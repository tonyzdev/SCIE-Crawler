Then we consider the collaboration between bands, where two bands are connected if they have a musician in common. The community structure analysis reveals that these constructions capture essential ingredients of the social interactions between jazz musicians. We observe correlations between recording locations, racial segregation and the community structure. A quantitative analysis of the community size distribution reveals a surprising similarity with an e-mail based social network recently studied.",

    "abstract": "The study of crowd dynamics is interesting because of the various self-organization phenomena resulting from the interactions of many pedestrians, which may improve or obstruct their flow. Besides formation of lanes of uniform walking direction and oscillations at bottlenecks at moderate densities, it was recently discovered that stop-and-go waves [D. Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.97 (2006) 168001] and a phenomenon called \"crowd turbulence\" can occur at high pedestrian densities [D. Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. E75 (2007) 046109]. Although the behavior of pedestrian crowds under extreme conditions is decisive for the safety of crowds during the access to or egress from mass events as well as for situations of emergency evacuation, there is still a lack of empirical studies of extreme crowding. Therefore, this paper discusses how one may study high-density conditions based on suitable video data. This is illustrated at the example of pilgrim flows entering the previous Jamarat Bridge in Mina, 5 kilometers from the Holy Mosque in Makkah, Saudi-Arabia. Our results reveal previously unexpected pattern formation phenomena and show that the average individual speed does not go to zero even at local densities of 10 persons per square meter. Since the maximum density and flow are different from measurements in other countries, this has implications for the capacity assessment and dimensioning of facilities for mass events. When conditions become congested, the flow drops significantly, which can cause stop-and-go waves and a further increase of the density until critical crowd conditions are reached. Then, \"crowd turbulence\" sets in, which may trigger crowd disasters. For this reason, it is important to operate pedestrian facilities sufficiently below their maximum capacity and to take measures to improve crowd safety, some of which are discussed in the end.",

    "abstract": "The relation between speed and density is connected with every self-organization phenomenon of pedestrian dynamics and offers the opportunity to analyze them quantitatively. But even for the simplest systems, like pedestrian streams in corridors, this fundamental relation is not completely understood. A comparison of data from literature shows that specifications in text books as well as measurements under various experimental conditions differ significantly. In this contribution it is studied whether cultural influences and length of the corridor can be the causes for these deviations. To reduce as much as possible unintentional effects, a system is chosen with reduced degrees of freedom and thus the most simple system, namely the movement of pedestrians along a line under closed boundary conditions. It is found that the speed of Indian test persons is less dependent on density than the speed of German test persons. Surprisingly the more unordered behavior of the Indians is more effective than the ordered behavior of the Germans. This may be due to differences in their self-organization behavior. Without any statistical measure one cannot conclude about whether there are differences or not. By hypothesis test it is found quantitatively that these differences exist, suggesting cultural differences in the fundamental diagram of pedestrians.",

    "abstract": "At these times, internet of things (IoT) technologies have become ubiquitous in the healthcare sector. Because of the increasing needs of IoT, massive quantity of patient data is being gathered and is utilized for diagnostic purposes. The recent developments of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) models are commonly employed to accurately identify the diseases in real-time scenarios. Despite the benefits, security, energy constraining, insufficient training data are the major issues which need to be resolved in the IoT enabled medical field. To accomplish the security, blockchain technology is recently developed which is a decentralized architecture that is widely utilized. With this motivation, this paper introduces a new blockchain with DL enabled secure medical data transmission and diagnosis (BDL-SMDTD) model. The goal of the BDL-SMDTD model is to securely transmit the medical images and diagnose the disease with maximum detection rate. The BDL-SMDTD model incorporates different stages of operations such as image acquisition, encryption, blockchain, and diagnostic process. Primarily, moth flame optimization (MFO) with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), called MFO-ECC technique is used for the image encryption process where the optimal keys of ECC are generated using MFO algorithm. Besides, blockchain technology is utilized to store the encrypted images. Then, the diagnostic process involves histogram-based segmentation, Inception with ResNet-v2-based feature extraction, and support vector machine (SVM)-based classification. The experimental performance of the presented BDL-SMDTD technique has been validated using benchmark medical images and the resultant values highlighted the improved performance of the BDL-SMDTD technique. The proposed BDL-SMDTD model accomplished maximum classification performance with sensitivity of 96.94%, specificity of 98.36%, and accuracy of 95.29%, whereas the feature extraction is performed based on ResNet-v2",

In order to understand the origins of this topology and its evolutionary implications, we present a simple model of proteome evolution that is able to reproduce many of the observed statistical regularities reported from the analysis of the yeast proteome.

We also study how the speed of the dynamics are affected by the underlying network structure. Among other conclusions, we find that, even at low traffic densities, the dynamical measure of traffic density (the occupation ratio) has a non-trivial dependence on the static centrality (quantified by \"betweenness centrality\"), which non-central vertices getting a comparatively large portion of the traffic.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of designing (perhaps massively distributed) collectives of computational processes to maximize a provided \"world utility\" function. We consider this problem when the behavior of each process in the collective can be cast as striving to maximize its own payoff utility function. For such cases the central design issue is how to initialize/update those payoff utility functions of the individual processes so as to induce behavior of the entire collective having good values of the world utility. Traditional \"team game\" approaches to this problem simply assign to each process the world utility as its payoff utility function. In previous work we used the \"Collective Intelligence\" (COIN) framework to derive a better choice of payoff utility functions, one that results in world utility performance up to orders of magnitude superior to that ensuing from the use of the team game utility. In this paper, we extend these results using a novel mathematical framework. Under that new framework we review the derivation of the general class of payoff utility functions that both (i) are easy for the individual processes to try to maximize, and (ii) have the property that if good values of them are achieved, then we are assured a high value of world utility. These are the \"Aristocrat Utility\" and a new variant of the \"Wonderful Life Utility\" that was introduced in the previous COIN work. We demonstrate experimentally that using these new utility functions can result in significantly improved performance over that of previously investigated COIN payoff utilities, over and above those previous utilities' superiority to the conventional team game utility. These results also illustrate the substantial superiority of these payoff functions to perhaps the most natural version of the economics technique of \"endogenizing externalities.\"",

We explore how these patterns change over years and career ages and how they impact scientific success. Our results highlight that successful male and female scientists reveal the same collaboration patterns: compared to scientists in the same career age, they tend to collaborate with more colleagues than other scientists, seek innovations as brokers and establish longer-lasting and more repetitive collaborations. However, women are on average less likely to adapt the collaboration patterns that are related with success, more likely to embed into ego networks devoid of structural holes, and they exhibit stronger gender homophily as well as a consistently higher dropout rate than men in all career ages.",

    "abstract": "Human language is unparalleled in both its expressive capacity and its diversity. What accounts for the enormous diversity of human languages [13]? Recent evidence suggests that the structure of languages may be shaped by the social and demographic environment in which the languages are learned and used. In an analysis of over 2000 languages Lupyan and Dale [25] demonstrated that socio-demographic variables, such as population size, significantly predicted the complexity of inflectional morphology. Languages spoken by smaller populations tend to employ more complex inflectional systems. Languages spoken by larger populations tend to avoid complex morphological paradigms, employing lexical constructions instead. This relationship may exist because of how language learning takes place in these different social contexts [44, 45]. In a smaller population, a tightly-knit social group combined with exclusive or almost exclusive language acquisition by infants permits accumulation of complex inflectional forms. In larger populations, adult language learning and more extensive cross-group interactions produce pressures that lead to morphological simplification. In the current paper, we explore this learning-based hypothesis in two ways. First, we develop an agent-based simulation that serves as a simple existence proof: As adult interaction increases, languages lose inflections. Second, we carry out a correlational study showing that English-speaking adults who had more interaction with non-native speakers as children showed a relative preference for over-regularized (i.e. morphologically simpler) forms. The results of the simulation and experiment lend support to the linguistic niche hypothesis: Languages may vary in the ways they do in part due to different social environments in which they are learned and used. In short, languages adapt to the learning constraints and biases of their learners.",

    "abstract": "The largely dominant meritocratic paradigm of highly competitive Western cultures is rooted on the belief that success is due mainly, if not exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent, intelligence, skills, efforts or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material success. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the importance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well known that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among the population, whereas the distribution of wealth - considered a proxy of success - follows typically a power law (Pareto law). Such a discrepancy between a Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale, and the scale invariant distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind the scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent-based model, we suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success, being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our knowledge, this counterintuitive result - although implicitly suggested between the lines in a vast literature - is quantified here for the first time. It sheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit on the basis of the reached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others. With the help of this model, several policy hypotheses are also addressed and compared to show the most efficient strategies for public funding of research in order to improve meritocracy, diversity and innovation.",

We study the probability of contagion conditional on the failure of a random bank, the most connected bank and the biggest bank, and we consider the effect of targeted policies aimed at increasing the capital requirements of a few banks with high connectivity or big balance sheets. Networks with heterogeneous degree distributions are shown to be more resilient to contagion triggered by the failure of a random bank, but more fragile with respect to contagion triggered by the failure of highly connected nodes. A power law distribution of balance sheet size is shown to induce an inefficient diversification that makes the system more prone to contagion events. A targeted policy aimed at reinforcing the stability of the biggest banks is shown to improve the stability of the system in the regime of high average degree. Finally, disassortative mixing, such as that observed in real banking networks, is shown to enhance the stability of the system.",

Several attempts have been made to model and predict malignant tumor behavior and also to account for immune system response and the impact of possible clinical treatments. Modeling started from a macroscopic perspective and developed towards cell-based approaches, from which cellular automaton (CA) models are an example. In this article, we first introduce the general concept of CA systems. Then, we review CA models of tumor development, focusing on avascular and vascular growth, tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Finally, a comparative analysis of the models as well as criteria for designing new CA models are provided and future perspectives are outlined.",

This model is superior to cellular automata because of its ability to learn and is also superior to a single learning automaton because it is a collection of learning automata which can interact with each other. The basic idea of cellular learning automata, which is a subclass of stochastic cellular learning automata, is to use the learning automata to adjust the state transition probability of stochastic cellular automata. In this paper, we first provide a mathematical framework for cellular learning automata and then study its convergence behavior. It is shown that for a class of rules, called commutative rules, the cellular learning automata converges to a stable and compatible configuration.

    "abstract": "In many social dilemmas, individuals tend to generate a situation with low payoffs instead of a system optimum (\"tragedy of the commons\"). Is the routing of traffic a similar problem? In order to address this question, we present experimental results on humans playing a route choice game in a computer laboratory, which allow one to study decision behavior in repeated games beyond the Prisoner's Dilemma. We will focus on whether individuals manage to find a cooperative and fair solution compatible with the system-optimal road usage. We find that individuals tend towards a user equilibrium with equal travel times in the beginning. However, after many iterations, they often establish a coherent oscillatory behavior, as taking turns performs better than applying pure or mixed strategies. The resulting behavior is fair and compatible with system-optimal road usage. In spite of the complex dynamics leading to coordinated oscillations, we have identified mathematical relationships quantifying the observed transition process. Our main experimental discoveries for 2- and 4-person games can be explained with a novel reinforcement learning model for an arbitrary number of persons, which is based on past experience and trial-and-error behavior. Gains in the average payoff seem to be an important driving force for the innovation of time-dependent response patterns, i.e. the evolution of more complex strategies. Our findings are relevant for decision support systems and routing in traffic or data networks.",

The interplay of both has been shown to produce metastabilities, system crashes, and emergent structures in ways that are yet only poorly understood. Meeting this exciting scientific challenge requires a combination of time-series analysis, complexity theory, and simulation with the analytical tools that have been developed by game theory, as well as graph and matrix theories.

Based on an analysis of all patenting inventors in the U.S. from 1975 to 2002, we observe dramatic aggregation of the regional inventor network in Silicon Valley around 1989. Based on network statistics, we argue that the sudden rise of giant networks in Silicon Valley can be understood as a phase transition during which small isolated networks form one giant component. By contrast, such a transition in Boston occurred much later and much less dramatically. We do not find convincing evidence that this marked difference between the two regions is due to regional differences in the propensity to collaborate or the involvement of universities in patenting. Interviews with key network players suggest that contingent labor mobility between established firms in Silicon Valley, in particular resulting from IBM's policy as a central player in patenting activity, promoted inter-organizational networking, leading to larger inventor networks.",

    "abstract": "A unified approach is proposed, which integrates game-theoretical models with models of directed motion. Specifically, strategic interactions in space and imitation of more successful neighboring strategies, as studied by spatial games, are combined with success-driven migration based on \"test interactions\" or wealth-related \"neighborhood tagging.\" It turns out that such directed migration allows cooperators to evade defectors and (in constrast to purely diffusive motion) also to find other cooperators in order to form clusters (\"islands of cooperation\"). This can increase the cooperation to a great extent. Moreover, success-driven motion leads to interesting spatiotemporal pattern-formation phenomena, which are clearly different from those produced by previously studied spatial games. Despite the simplicity of the model, the forming patterns appear to realistically represent many stylized facts of social interactions, particularly phenomena such as social networking, urban aggregation, social segregation or turn-taking. Furthermore, migration games offer a game-theoretical explanation of social attraction and repulsion, based on payoff-related mobility, and they display a larger variety than conventional games, as their behavior is not invariant to shifting all payoffs by a constant amount. In summary, the combination of strategic interactions and imitation with models of directed motion has high potential for understanding empirical observations in the social, biological and economic sciences from a game-theoretical point of view. Finally, the breakdown of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma at high values of temptation is explained by configurational analysis.",

This mathematical structure captures the effect of superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intentions, which allows us to explain a variety of interesting fallacies and anomalies that have been reported to particularize the decision-making of real human beings. The theory describes entangled decision-making, non-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference of composite prospects. We demonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle (disjunction effect) can be explained as a result of the interference of intentions, when making decisions under uncertainty. The conjunction fallacy is also explained by the presence of the interference terms. We demonstrate that all known anomalies and paradoxes, documented in the context of classical decision theory, are reducible to just a few mathematical archetypes, all of which allow the finding of straightforward explanations in the frame of the developed quantum approach.",

The influences of the different strategies on the evacuation time, the individual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution, and the overall jam size itself are investigated.

One of the principal challenges for the social sciences is to explain the emergence of agglomeration and cooperative behavior in an environment characterized by egoistic individuals. In this paper we address this long standing problem with the tools given by evolutionary game theory. Specifically, we explore a model in which selfish individuals interact in a public goods creation environment. As a further ingredient each agent is characterized by an individual expectation and, if unsatisfied, can change its location. In this scenario we study the effects of the knowledge of other players' performances on both cooperation and agglomeration and discuss the results in the context of previous and related works. Our results show that cooperation and agglomeration are generally robust against the inclusion of different information on other player performances and, in some cases, it can produce an enhancement of the cooperative behavior. Moreover, our results demonstrate that only in extreme and very competitive environments cooperation and agglomeration are lost.",

Moreover, we find that, while victory and defeats can be explained by the team’s performance during a game, it is difficult to detect draws by using a machine learning approach. We then simulate the outcomes of an entire season of each league only relying on technical data and exploiting a machine learning model trained on data from past seasons.

The implementation of these machine learning algorithms and visualization of the results was done using Python. The results achieved a high accuracy (99.65%) on training and testing datasets which is far better than traditional means.

These new algorithms are described as an extension to the classical routing algorithms: they combine the ideas of online asynchronous distance vector routing with adaptive link state routing. Estimates of the current traffic condition and link costs are measured by sending routing agents in the network that mix with the regular information packets and keep track of the costs (e.g. delay) encountered during their journey. The routing tables are then regularly updated based on that information without any central control nor complete knowledge of the network topology. Two new algorithms are proposed here. The first one is based on round trip routing agents that update the routing tables by backtracking their way after having reached the destination. The second one relies on forward agents that update the routing tables directly as they move toward their destination. An efficient co-operative scheme is proposed to deal with asymmetric connections. All these methods are compared on a simulated network with various traffic loads; the robustness of the new algorithms to network changes is proved on various dynamic scenarii.",

In addition to the complete invasion of defectors, we find coexistence regimes with either a majority of cooperators in large spatial domains, or a minority of cooperators organized in small non-stationary domains or in small clusters.

In theory, potential-based reward shaping does not alter the Nash Equilibria of a stochastic game, only the exploration of the shaped agent. We demonstrate empirically the performance of reward shaping in two problem domains within the context of RoboCup KeepAway by designing three reward shaping schemes, encouraging specific behaviour such as keeping a minimum distance from other players on the same team and taking on specific roles. The results illustrate that reward shaping with multiple, simultaneous learning agents can reduce the time needed to learn a suitable policy and can alter the final group performance.",

Usually models of pedestrian dynamics are (implicitly) built on the assumption that pedestrians walk along the shortest path. Model elements formulated to make pedestrians locally avoid collisions and intrusion into personal space do not produce motion on quickest paths. Therefore a special model element is needed, if one wants to model and simulate pedestrians for whom travel time matters most (e.g. travelers in a station hall who are late for a train). Here such a model element is proposed, discussed and used within the Social Force Model.",

The encoding schema enables the algorithm to determine the number of communities adaptively and automatically, which provides great flexibility to the detection process.

In general, in a structured form or meaning space, not all forms and meanings are equivalent: some forms and some meanings are more easily confused with each other than with other forms or meanings. We first give a formalization of this idea, and explore how it influences robust form-meaning mappings. It is shown that some fundamental properties of human language, such as discreteness and combinatorial structure as well as universals of sound systems of human languages follow from optimal communication in structured form and meaning spaces. We also argue that some properties of human language follow less from these fundamental issues, and more from cognitive constraints. We then show that it is possible to experimentally investigate the relative contribution of functional constraints and of cognitive constraints. We illustrate this with an example of one of our own experiments, in which experimental participants have to learn a set of complex form-meaning mappings that have been produced by a previous generation of participants. Theoretically predicted properties appear in the sets of signals that emerge in this iterated learning experiment.",

Another issue is the cost of integrating simulation applications with other manufacturing applications. These barriers hinder the automated input of data into DES models and as a result deter use of real-time DES in manufacturing. This review presents the existing research studies in the literature that address the above issues, demonstrating in parallel the already implemented concepts.

The study also gives us the opportunity to examine the outcomes of the Eurace model so to discuss the nature of endogenous money, giving a contribution to a debate that has grown stronger over the last two decades. A set of 40 years long simulations have been performed and examined in the short (first five years), medium (the following 15 years) and long (the last 20 years) run. Results point out a non-trivial dependence of real economic variables such as the gross domestic product (GDP), the unemployment rate and the aggregate capital stock on banks' capital adequacy ratios; this dependence is in place due to the credit channel and varies significantly according to the chosen evaluation horizon. In general, while boosting the economy in the short run, regulations allowing for a high leverage of the banking system tend to be depressing in the medium and long run. Results also point out that the stock of money is driven by the demand for loans, therefore supporting the theory of endogenous nature of credit money.",

The sum of the complexity over all scales is the same for any system with the same number of underlying degrees of freedom (variables), even though the complexity at specific scales differs due to the organization/interdependence of these degrees of freedom. This reflects a tradeoff of complexity at different scales of observation. Calculation of this complexity for a simple frustrated system reveals that it is possible for the complexity to be negative.

The key feature of the model resides in an explicit microfoundation of the processes of : (i) matching between firms and workers, (ii) job search, (iii) wage setting, (iv) endogenous formation of aggregate demand, and (v) endogenous price formation. Moreover, we allow for a competitive process entailing selection of firms on the basis of their revealed competitiveness. Simulations show that the model is able to robustly reproduce Beveridge, Wage and Okun curves under quite broad behavioral and institutional settings. The system generates endogenously an Okun coefficient greater than one even if individual firms employ production functions exhibiting constant returns to labor. Monte Carlo simulations also indicate that statistically detectable shifts in Okun and Beveridge curves emerge as the result of changes in institutional, behavioral, and technological parameters. Finally, the model generates sharp predictions about how system parameters affect aggregate performance (i.e. average GDP growth) and its volatility.",

A commonly used tool to study basic control mechanisms are in vitro experiments in which the growth conditions can be widely varied. However, even in vitro experiments are not free from unknown or uncontrolled influences. One reason why mathematical models become more and more a popular complementary tool to experiments is that they permit the study of hypotheses free from unknown or uncontrolled influences that occur in experiments. Many model types have been considered so far to model multicellular organization ranging from detailed individual-cell based models with explicit representations of the cell shape to cellular automata models with no representation of cell shape, and continuum models, which consider a local density averaged over many individual cells. However, how the different model description may be linked, and, how a description on a coarser level may be constructed based on the knowledge of the finer, microscopic level, is still largely unknown. Here, we consider the example of monolayer growth in vitro to illustrate how, in a multi-step process starting from a single-cell based off-lattice-model that subsumes the information on the sub-cellular scale by characteristic cell-biophysical and cell-kinetic properties, a cellular automaton may be constructed whose rules have been chosen based on the findings in the off-lattice model. Finally, we use the cellular automaton model as a starting point to construct a multivariate master equation from a compartment approach from which a continuum model can be derived by a systematic coarse-graining procedure. We find that the resulting continuum equation largely captures the growth behavior of the CA model. The development of our models is guided by experimental observations on growing monolayers.",

If their attitudes are closer than u on both dimensions, or further than u on both dimensions, or closer than u on one dimension and not further than u + δ u on the other dimension, then the rules of the BC model apply. But if their attitudes are closer than u on one dimension and further than u + δ u on the other dimension, then the individuals are in a dissonant state. They tend to solve this problem by shifting away their close attitudes. The model shows metastable clusters, which maintain themselves through opposite influences of competitor clusters. Our analysis and first experiments support the hypothesis that, for a large range of uncertainty values, the number of clusters grows linearly with the inverse of the uncertainty, whereas this growth is quadratic in the BC model.",

The development of these networks thus reveals a nonlinear dynamical pattern where the global topology of syntax graphs shifts from a hierarchical, tree-like pattern, to a scale-free organization. Such change seems difficult to be explained under a self-organization framework. Instead, it actually supports the presence of some underlying innate component, as early suggested by some authors.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing diffusion of the Internet technology, TV remains the principal medium of communication. People's perceptions, knowledge, beliefs and opinions about matters of fact get (in)formed through the information reported on by the media. However, a single source of information (and consensus) could be a potential cause of anomalies in the structure and evolution of a society. Hence, as the information available (and the way it is reported) is fundamental for our perceptions and opinions, the definition of conditions allowing for a good information to be disseminated is a pressing challenge. In this paper starting from a report on the last Italian political campaign in 2008, we derive a socio-cognitive computational model of opinion dynamics where agents get informed by different sources of information. Then, a what-if analysis, performed through simulations on the model's parameters space, is shown. In particular, the scenario implemented includes three main streams of information acquisition, differing in both the contents and the perceived reliability of the messages spread. Agents' internal opinion is updated either by accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by exchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive mechanisms to accept, reject or partially consider the acquired information.",

We embed an evolutionary public-goods game in a spatial simulation of household activities in which agents, representing households, decide where to farm, hunt, and locate their residences. Leaders, through their work in monitoring group members and punishing defectors, can increase the likelihood that group members will cooperate to achieve a favorable outcome in the public-goods game. We show that under certain conditions households prefer to work in a group with a leader who receives a share of the group's productivity, rather than to work in a group with no leader. Simulation produces outcomes that match reasonably well those known for a portion of Southwest Colorado between AD 600 and 900. We suggest that for later periods a model incorporating coercion, or inter-group competition, or both, and one in which tiered hierarchies of leadership can emerge, would increase the goodness-of-fit.",

To analyze their resilience against attacks, either the network nodes or edges are removed in specific sequences (attack scenarios). During each scenario the size S(c) of the largest remaining network component is observed as function of the removed share c of nodes or edges. To quantify the PTN stability with respect to different attack scenarios we use the area below the curve described by S(c) for c ∈ [0, 1] recently introduced (Schneider, C. M. et al.

Moreover a different birth rate is assumed for different ideologies, the rate being assumed to be positive for the reference population, made of initially non-believers. Ideological competition can happen in one or several regions in space. In the latter case, migration of non-believers and adepts is allowed; this leads to an enrichment of the ideological dynamics. Finally, the current ideological situation in the Arab countries and China is commented upon from the point of view of the presently developed mathematical model.

We study three open source Java projects over a 10-year period and demonstrate, using different metrics, that the K-core decomposition of the network can help us identify the key classes of the corresponding software. Specifically, we show that the vertices with the highest core number represent the important classes and demonstrate that the core-numbers of classes with similar functionalities evolve at similar trends.",

    "abstract": "The idea is advanced that self-organization in complex systems can be treated as decision making (as it is performed by humans) and, vice versa, decision making is nothing but a kind of self-organization in the decision maker nervous systems. A mathematical formulation is suggested based on the definition of probabilities of system states, whose particular cases characterize the probabilities of structures, patterns, scenarios, or prospects. In this general framework, it is shown that the mathematical structures of self-organization and of decision making are identical. This makes it clear how self-organization can be seen as an endogenous decision making process and, reciprocally, decision making occurs via an endogenous self-organization. The approach is illustrated by phase transitions in large statistical systems, crossovers in small statistical systems, evolutions and revolutions in social and biological systems, structural self-organization in dynamical systems, and by the probabilistic formulation of classical and behavioral decision theories. In all these cases, self-organization is described as the process of evaluating the probabilities of macroscopic states or prospects in the search for a state with the largest probability. The general way of deriving the probability measure for classical systems is the principle of minimal information, that is, the conditional entropy maximization under given constraints. Behavioral biases of decision makers can be characterized in the same way as analogous to quantum fluctuations in natural systems.",

Further, we will determine the needed ICU beds (intense medical carte beds) and regular treatment beds. Also, we provide the outcome of governmental strategies in reducing the spread of disease.

Also, the interaction between the impeller and volute tongue region is actually according to the impeller blades’ relative position concerning the tongue region.

Nevertheless, so far, the notion of centrality in TVG scenarios usually refers to metrics that assess the relative importance of nodes along the temporal evolution of the dynamic complex network. For some TVG scenarios, however, more important than identifying the central nodes under a given node centrality definition is identifying the key time instants for taking certain actions. In this paper, we thus introduce and investigate the notion of time centrality in TVGs. Analogously to node centrality, time centrality evaluates the relative importance of time instants in dynamic complex networks. In this context, we present two time centrality metrics related to diffusion processes. We evaluate the two defined metrics using both a real-world dataset representing an in-person contact dynamic network and a synthetically generated randomized TVG. We validate the concept of time centrality showing that diffusion starting at the best ranked time instants (i.e., the most central ones), according to our metrics, can perform a faster and more efficient diffusion process.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we find the solutions for two-dimensional biological population model having fractional order using fractional natural decomposition method (FNDM). The proposed method is a graceful blend of decomposition scheme with natural transform, and three examples are considered to validate and illustrate its efficiency. The nature of FNDM solution has been captured for distinct arbitrary order. In order to illustrate the proficiency and reliability of the considered scheme, the numerical simulation has been presented. The obtained results illuminate that the considered method is easy to apply and more effective to examine the nature of multi-dimensional differential equations of fractional order arisen in connected areas of science and technology.",

    "abstract": "Social systems are characterized by the presence of group interactions and by the existence of both trust and distrust relations. Although there is a wide literature on signed social networks, where positive signs associated to the links indicate trust, friendship, agreement, while negative signs represent distrust, antagonism, and disagreement, very little is known about the effect that signed interactions can have on the spreading of social behaviors when, not only pairwise, but also higher-order interactions are taken into account. In this paper, we introduce a model of complex contagion on signed simplicial complexes, and we investigate the role played by trust and distrust on the dynamics of a social contagion process, where exposure to multiple sources is needed for the contagion to occur. The presence of higher-order signed structures in our model naturally induces new infection and recovery mechanisms, thus increasing the richness of the contagion dynamics. Through numerical simulations and analytical results in the mean-field approximation, we show how distrust determines the way the system moves from a state where no individuals adopt the social behavior, to a state where a finite fraction of the population actively spreads it. Interestingly, we observe that the fraction of spreading individuals displays a non-monotonic dependence with respect to the average number of connections between individuals. We then investigate how social balance affects social contagion, finding that balanced triads have an ambivalent impact on the spreading process, either promoting or impeding contagion based on the relative abundance of fully trusted relations. Our results shed light on the nontrivial effect of trust on the spreading of social behaviors in systems with group interactions, paving the way to further investigations of spreading phenomena in structured populations.",

We find long-range correlations in the power spectra of arriving packet density and the network's activity bursts. The packet transit time distribution shows a power-law dependence with average transit time increasing with network size. This implies dynamic queuing on the network, in which many interacting queues are mutually driven by temporally correlated packet streams.",

In contrast, Latin American (LATAM) economies began taking steps in this direction only in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but before this period they were more focused on the implementation of import substitution policies. These divergent paths have led to sharply different growth performances in the two regions. Yet, standard trade openness indicators fall short of portraying the peculiarity of the Asian experience, and of explaining why other emerging markets with similar characteristics have been less successful over the last 25 years. We offer an alternative perspective on this issue by exploiting recently developed indicators based on weighted network analysis. We study the evolution of the core–periphery structure of the World Trade Network (WTN) and, more specifically, the evolution of the HPAE and LATAM countries within this network. Using random walk betweenness centrality, we show that the HPAE countries are more integrated into the WTN and many of them, which were on the periphery in the 1980s, are now in the core of the network. In contrast, the LATAM economies have at best maintained their position over the 1980–2005 period, and in some cases have fallen in the ranking of centrality.",

Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital photographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text labels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging and introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging activity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform experiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a weighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show that this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among resources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely emergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number of users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in social tagging systems.",

We consider two different levels: first, we compute the inward–outward investment stocks at the level of firms, based on ownership shares and number of employees; then we estimate the inward–outward investment stock at the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the ownership network of firms, based on their headquarter location. To our knowledge, there is no similar approach in the literature so far, and we believe that it may lead to important applications for policy making. In the present paper, we focus on the statistical distributions and the scaling laws, while in further studies we will analyze the structure of the network and its relation to geographical space. We find that while outward investment and activity of firms are power law distributed with a similar exponent, for regions these quantities are better described by a log-normal distribution. At both levels we also find scaling laws relating investment to activity and connectivity. In particular, we find that investment stock scales as a power law of the connectivity, as previously found for stock market data.",

We refer to the model of Weisbuch and Deffuant, where n agents adjust their continuous opinions as a result of random pairwise encounters whenever their opinions differ not more than a given bound of confidence ε. A high ε leads to consensus, while a lower ε leads to a fragmentation into several opinion clusters. We drop the random encounter assumption and ask: How small may ε be such that consensus is still possible with a certain communication plan for the entire group? Mathematical analysis shows that ε may be significantly smaller than in the random pairwise case. On the other hand, we ask: How large may ε be such that preventing consensus is still possible? In answering this question, we prove Fortunato's simulation result that consensus cannot be prevented for ε &gt; 0.5 for large groups. Next, we consider opinion dynamics under different individual strategies and examine their power to increase the chances of consensus. One result is that balancing agents increase chances of consensus, especially if the agents are cautious in adapting their opinions. However, curious agents increase chances of consensus only if those agents are not cautious in adapting their opinions.",

The framework relies on the well-known positive correlation between cognitive cost and the Euclidean distance between the elements (e.g. words) involved in a syntactic link. We study the conditions under which a certain word order is more economical than an alternative word order by proposing a mathematical approach. We apply our methodology to two different cases: (a) the ordering of subject (S), verb (V) and object (O), and (b) the covering of a root word by a syntactic link. For the former, we find that SVO and its symmetric, OVS, are more economical than OVS, SOV, VOS and VSO at least 2/3 of the time. For the latter, we find that uncovering the root word is more economical than covering it at least 1/2 of the time. With the help of our framework, one can explain some Greenbergian universals. Our findings provide further theoretical support for the hypothesis that the limited resources of the brain introduce biases toward certain word orders.

Can we utilize biological principles to design systems, which can flexibly adapt to hardly predictable, fluctuating conditions? We propose a bio-inspired \"BioLogistics\" approach to deduce dynamic organization processes and principles of adaptive self-control from biological systems, and to transfer them to man-made logistics (including nanologistics), using principles of modularity, self-assembly, self-organization, and decentralized coordination.

We show here that certain dimensions of the social environment, namely the size of the social group, the degree of social tolerance expressed, the structure of the dominance hierarchy, and the patterns of dispersal, may influence the emergence and stability of cooperation in predictable ways. Furthermore, the social environment experienced by a species over evolutionary time will have shaped their cognition to provide certain strengths and strategies that are beneficial in their species' social world. These cognitive adaptations will in turn impact the likelihood of cooperating in a given social environment. Experiments with one primate species, the cottontop tamarin, illustrate how social dynamics may influence emergence and stability of cooperative behavior in this species. We then take a more general viewpoint and argue that the hypotheses presented here require further experimental work and the addition of quantitative modeling to obtain a better understanding of how social dynamics influence the emergence and stability of cooperative behavior in complex systems. We conclude by pointing out subsequent specific directions for models and experiments that will allow relevant advances in the understanding of the emergence of cooperation.",

    "abstract": "Humans divide themselves up into groups based on a shared cultural identity and common descent. Culturally inherited differences in dress, language, and institutions are often used as symbolic markers of the boundaries of these ethnic groups. Relatively little is known about the function of such ethnic groups, and why ethnic diversity is high in some regions yet lower in others. In this paper, we demonstrate how investigating the spatial distribution of ethnolinguistic groups can reveal the factors that affect the origin and maintenance of human ethnic group diversity. Here we describe the use of a Geographic Information System to construct a large database that integrates information about languages with a number of environmental, ecological, and ethnographic variables. Using these data on the spatial distribution of ethnolinguistic groups, we employ a hierarchical linear modeling approach to test a variety of hypotheses concerning the function of such groups. Despite revealing intriguing spatial patterns such as the latitudinal gradient in ethnolinguistic diversity, previous analyses suggested that the direct effects of environmental variables on the distribution of ethnolinguistic groups were in fact quite small. Here we show that the strength of the relationship between ethnolinguistic area and environmental variables is stronger in societies whose primary mode of subsistence is foraging. We then go on to demonstrate this same finding using the estimated native distributions of ethnolinguistic group in the Americas and Australia. In particular, Net Primary Productivity is shown to be a good predictor of the area covered by ethnolinguistic groups in foragers but not in agriculturalists. This provides support for the idea that the factors affecting ethnic diversity have changed in a systematic way with changes in subsistence strategies and social organization. We highlight future avenues for spatially explicit investigations of the evolution of ethnic diversity, and suggest that the evolutionary ecological approach adopted here may provide important insights into processes affecting ethnic diversity in the modern world.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the directed and weighted complex network of free word associations in which players write a word in response to another word given as input. We analyze in details two large datasets resulting from two very different experiments: On the one hand the massive multiplayer web-based Word Association Game known as Human Brain Cloud, and on the other hand the South Florida Free Association Norms experiment. In both cases, the networks of associations exhibit quite robust properties like the small world property, a slight assortativity and a strong asymmetry between in-degree and out-degree distributions. A particularly interesting result concerns the existence of a characteristic scale for the word association process, arguably related to specific conceptual contexts for each word. After mapping, the Human Brain Cloud network onto the WordNet semantics network, we point out the basic cognitive mechanisms underlying word associations when they are represented as paths in an underlying semantic network. We derive in particular an expression describing the growth of the HBC graph and we highlight the existence of a characteristic scale for the word association process.",

Here, we employ a spatially explicit metapopulation model to investigate the extent to which the effects of local extinction on selectively neutral cultural diversity and change are sensitive to intergroup cultural transmission — the rate at which cultural variants are transmitted between groups. Our results show that the level of intergroup cultural transmission as well as the topology of the social network that mediates cultural transmission between groups influence the way in which local extinctions affect total diversity, group differentiation, and the rate at which copy errors accumulate in structured populations.

    "abstract": "Chemical organization theory has been suggested as a new approach to analyze complex reaction networks. Concerning the long-term behavior of the network dynamics we will study its foundations mathematically. Therefore we consider a chemical reactor containing molecules of different species reacting with each other according to a set of reaction rules. We further assume that the dynamical behavior of the concentration of each species is given by a continuous chemical ordinary differential equation. Abstracting from dedicated concentration values we consider a discrete problem: Which species can appear in the reactor after a long time? We define the limit set abstraction, which contains the subsets of species characterizing the long-term behavior. We prove that all these subsets are closed and that for all bounded limit sets, at least one of them is self-maintaining and thus is an organization. This implies for a chemical ordinary differential equation systems that any attractor that does not touch the state space boundaries (in particular, any periodic attractor) lies within one organization, that is, the set of species with positive concentrations in any state of such an attractor is an organization. This in turn explains why in a deterministic system evolving according to reaction rules one can observe species sets that are closed and self-maintaining, thus organizations.",

    "abstract": "We study the role played by bilinguals in the competition between two languages and in the formation of a bilingual community. To this aim we introduce a simple three-state model that combines the Minett–Wang model, in which the bilinguals do not affect directly the probability of transition of an individual from monolingualism to bilingualism, and the Baggs–Freedman model, in which such a transition probability only depends on bilinguals. The model predicts the possibility for the existence of a stable bilingual community though no particular conditions are assumed for the two competing languages: the asymptotic stability of the bilinguals community is only due to the type of dynamics regulating the transitions between different linguistic groups. The proposed model and the obtained results give some suggestions for the conditions necessary for the formation of a stable bilingual community. First of all, it is important that the bilinguals are valid representatives of the two languages, in the sense that they are regarded by monolinguals also as speakers of the other language. Besides that, the transition from bilinguals to monolinguals must be smaller than the opposite transition. Unless both these conditions are fulfilled, the stable equilibrium solution of the language competition is a monolingual society.",

Due to sarin’s special properties of being colorless and odorless, we focus more on the modeling of agents’ perceiving and reasoning process and use a Belief, Desire, Intention (BDI) architecture to solve the problem. Another contribution of our work is that we put forward a path planning algorithm which not only take distance but also comfort and threat factors into consideration.

The multi-point genetic optimization of neural network topology and network weights is performed using hierarchical coding schemes and genetic operations. The simulated annealing mechanism is incorporated into the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the design and optimization of neural network conformation and network weights simultaneously. The SAGA takes advantage of GA excellent ability in grasping the overall ability of the search process, also uses the SA algorithm to control the convergence of the algorithm to avoid premature phenomenon. The fault diagnosis of one certain on-board electrical control box of helicopter and one certain flight control box of aircraft autopilot were used as a test platform to simulate the algorithm.

The advancements in the technology lead to provide various services, like accessing network, resources, and platform. However, handling large datasets and security are major issues in the cloud systems. Hence, this paper proposes a technique, namely, Jaya–Whale Optimization (JWO), which is the integration of Jaya algorithm and Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and adapts homomorphic encryption for initiating secure data transmission in the cloud. The original data are preserved by generating Data Protection (DP) coefficient using the proposed JWO algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the fitness is calculated based on privacy and utility parameters for selecting the optimal solution. Also, the sanitized data are generated by EXORing the Key Information Product (KIP) matrix and key vector. Finally, the data owner provides the key to the users for retrieving the original data from the sanitized data. The experimentation is carried out using Cleveland, Hungarian, and Switzerland datasets in terms of BD, accuracy, and fitness and the analysis shows that the proposed JWO provides superior performance in terms of BD, accuracy, and fitness parameters with values 0.720, 0.822, and 0.722.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing brings incipient transmutations in different fields of life and consists of different characteristics and virtualization is one of them. Virtual machine (VM) is one of the main elements of virtualization. VM is a process in which physical server changes into the virtual machine and works as a physical server. When a user sends data or request for data in cloud data center, a situation can occur that may cause the virtual machines to underload data or overload data. The aforementioned situation can lead to failure of the system or delay the user task. Therefore, appropriate load balancing techniques are required to surmount the above two mentioned problems. Load balancing is a technique utilized in cloud computing for management of the resource by a condition such that a maximum throughput is achieved with slightest reaction time and additionally dividing the traffic between different servers or VM so that it can get data without any delay. For the amelioration of load balancing technique in this study, a novel technique is used which is coalescence of BAT and ABC algorithms both of which are nature-inspired algorithms. When the ABC algorithm local search section changes with BAT algorithm local search section, a second modification takes place in the fitness function of BAT algorithm. The proposed technique is known as HBATAABC algorithm. The novel technique implemented by utilizing transfer strategy policy in VM improves the performance of data allocation system of VM in the cloud data center. To check the performance of the proposed algorithm, three main parameters are used which are network average time, network stability and throughput. The performance of the proposed novel technique is verified and tested with the help of cloudsim simulator. The result shows that the suggested modified algorithm increases performance by 1.30% of network average time, network stability and throughput as compared with BAT algorithm, ABC algorithm and RRA algorithm. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is more precise and expeditious as compared with the three models.",

    "abstract": "The basic genetic algorithm usually has the following problems when solving robot path planning problems. First, the chromosome (path) of the first generation is randomly generated, so its fitness is often too high, resulting in too slow convergence speed and even unable to obtain the global optimal solution. Second, in the crossover operator, the selection of crossover points is often random, which cannot ensure that the fitness of cross generated offspring is better than that of their parents. Finally, in the mutation stage, because the traditional mutation strategy is to replace the selected mutation node in the individual chromosome with a random node, the offspring path generated by the mutation operator is likely to be discontinuous, so it cannot reflect the effectiveness of the mutation operator. Based on the mentioned contents, some improved strategies are proposed for the discussed three shortcomings of the basic genetic algorithm. First, a new generation mechanism of the first generation is constructed by simulating the path finding rules of ants in ant colony optimization, which greatly improves the quality of the first generation. Second, during crossover operator, the chromosomes of the two parents are disconnected at the same node, and the optimal chromosome fragments in each segment are combined based on greed, so as to gather all the excellent gene fragments of the parents in an individual as much as possible, improve the quality of the offspring after crossover operator, and speed up the convergence speed. Finally, a new mutation strategy is proposed to eliminate redundant sections and the number of corners, so that the individuals always can be mutated in a good direction. A large number of simulation results show that the improved genetic algorithm is effective in solving the robot path planning problem, and the overall performance is better than the basic genetic algorithm and some other improved genetic algorithms. Finally, by modeling and simulating the real enterprise factory environment based on the ROS platform, the experimental results also verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the improved genetic algorithm.",

The goal of image restoration is to avert the process of image deterioration that happens during image acquisition and processing. Blurring and noise are two common types of picture capture degradation. When the blurring function is unknown, the image restoration issue is referred to as blind image restoration. Existing methods of image restoration do not provide efficient results due to time complexity, computational complexity, large-scale scaling factor and limited input. Therefore, in order to overcome those problems, an Improved Graph Laplacian Regularization with Sparse Coding by integrating Internet of Things (IoT) is developed in this research. The process of removing de-noised portions of image to texture layer and cartoon layer is carried out by Morphological Component Analysis (MCA). An improved Graph Laplacian regularized method and Simultaneous Sparse Coding with Gaussian Scale Mixture (SSC-GSM) methods is performed on texture layer, cartoon layer and restored image. A Levin’s dataset and a real-time dataset such as industrial manufacturing products are analyzed in this research. The proposed Graph Laplacian algorithm and sparse coding model are better efficient in identifying sharper texture information and getting a restored image. The proposed method proves that it has better performance in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 35.82 and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.94 than the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "A link in a supplier–customer network is usually a creditor–debtor relationship. If a firm goes into a state of financial insolvency or bankruptcy, then firms on its upstream are affected secondarily along the links. By using 10-year data from recent data on bankruptcy in Japan, we show that this \"link effect\" is by no means negligible in a nationwide economy. While the total debt of bankruptcy typically amounts to as much as a few percent of GDP in Japan, nearly 20% of all bankruptcies are due to the link effect. Interestingly, we find that such a link effect becomes comparable with other causes of bankruptcy, including poor performance in business (namely solo failure) with respect to the number of events, as the bankruptcy is larger. This means that the link effect grows for larger bankruptcies. Because the supplier–customer network has a heavy tail in its degree distribution, the ripple effect due to the bankruptcy chain is considerable. Since every firm is embedded in a giant network of production, this study would suggest the importance of understanding the heterogeneity in the large-scale network of suppliers and customers on a nationwide scale.",

This inertia depends on the persistence time of a voter's current opinion (ageing). We focus on the case of only two different inertia values: zero if a voter just changed toward a new opinion, and ν otherwise. We are interested in the average time to reach consensus, i.e. the state in which all voters have adopted the same opinion. Adding inertia to the system means to slow down the dynamics at the voter's level, which should presumably lead to slower consensus formation. As an unexpected outcome of our inertial voter dynamics, there is a parameter region of ν where an increasing inertia leads to faster consensus formation. These results rest on the heterogeneity of voters which evolves through the described ageing. In a control setting of homogeneous inertia values, we only find monotonously increasing consensus times. In this paper, we present dynamical equations for the mean field case which allow for analytical insight into the observed slower-is-faster effect.",

The study of qawm lends insight into the structural and processual dynamics of Afghan society. In particular, we concentrate on the evolution of power structures. An agent-based computational model is presented whose ontology borrows from neopatrimonialism, a notion of power prevalent in contemporary conflicts. In this model, agents' structural arrangement, behavior and cognition are informed by qualitative data derived from case studies on Afghanistan. The simulation results suggest that the emergence of qawm and, hence, the fragmentation of Afghan society are systemic and lead to a constant drain of resources. Cross-validation between the simulated network and a target system network reveals that qawm exhibit small world characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Written language is a complex communication signal capable of conveying information encoded in the form of ordered sequences of words. Beyond the local order ruled by grammar, semantic and thematic structures affect long-range patterns in word usage. Here, we show that a direct application of information theory quantifies the relationship between the statistical distribution of words and the semantic content of the text. We show that there is a characteristic scale, roughly around a few thousand words, which establishes the typical size of the most informative segments in written language. Moreover, we find that the words whose contributions to the overall information is larger, are the ones more closely associated with the main subjects and topics of the text. This scenario can be explained by a model of word usage that assumes that words are distributed along the text in domains of a characteristic size where their frequency is higher than elsewhere. Our conclusions are based on the analysis of a large database of written language, diverse in subjects and styles, and thus are likely to be applicable to general language sequences encoding complex information.",

Usually these requirements obstruct a scientific understanding of social phenomena on scientific grounds. Due to developments in IT, new collective human behavior, new dimensions of data sources are beginning to open up. Here we report on a complete data set of an entire society, consisting of over 350,000 human players of a massive multiplayer online game. All actions of all players over three years are recorded, including communication behavior and social ties. In this work we review the first steps undertaken in analyzing this vast data set, focusing on social dynamics on friend-, enemy- and communication networks. This new data-driven approach to social science allows to study socio-economic behavior of humans and human groups in specific environments with unprecedented precision. We propose two new empirical social laws which relate the network properties of link weight, overlap and betweenness centrality in a nonlinear way, and provide strong quantitative evidence for classical social balance assumptions, the weak ties hypothesis and triadic closure. In our analysis of large-scale multirelational networks we discover systematic deviations between positive and negative tie networks. Exploring such virtual \"social laboratories\" in the light of complexity science has the potential to lead to the discovery of systemic properties of human societies, with unforeseen impact on managing human-induced crises.",

The industrial plant simulation model (called HAZIMUT, HAZelnuts Industrial plant design and management based on advanced simulation Models Utilization) recreates the entire hazelnuts production process (based on nine different production lines). The HAZIMUT simulation model is used to evaluate the effects — caused by multiple changes in the production lines capacities — on multiple performance measures based on machines levels utilization, work in process and production system productivity. The simulation results show how variations in production lines capacities generate an over-reaction of the system with major changes in some of the performance measures therefore stressing the importance to use the HAZIMUT simulator to tune the system correctly to improve the overall plant performances.",

The main novelties of the model are the introduction of a \"behavioral filter approach\" to model tax decisions, the combination of a set of different mechanisms to produce tax compliance (namely rational choice, normative commitments and social influence), and the use of the concept of \"fraud opportunity use rate\" (FOUR) as the main behavioral outcome. After describing the model in detail, we display the main behavioral and economic results of 1,920 simulations calibrated for the Spanish case and designed to test for the internal validity of SIMULFIS. The behavioral outcomes show that scenarios with strict rational agents strongly overestimate tax evasion, while the introduction of social influence and normative commitments allows to generate more plausible compliance levels under certain deterrence conditions. Interestingly, the relative effect of social influence is shown to be ambivalent: it optimizes compliance under low and middle deterrence conditions, but not when deterrence is made harder. Finally, SIMULFIS economic outcomes are broadly in line with theoretical expectations, thus supporting the reliability of the model.",

By assuming the sources of nutrients are cities and protoplasmic tubes connecting the sources are motorways, how well does the plasmodium approximate existing motorway networks? We take the Netherlands as a case study for bio-development of motorways, while it has the most dense motorway network in Europe, current demand is rapidly approaching the upper limits of existing capacity. We represent twenty major cities with oat flakes, place plasmodium in Amsterdam and record how the plasmodium spreads between oat flakes via the protoplasmic tubes. First we analyze slime-mould-built and man-built transport networks in a framework of proximity graphs to investigate if the slime mould is capable of computing existing networks. We then go on to investigate if the slime mould is able calculate or adapt the network through imitating restructuring of the transport network as a response to potential localized flooding of the Netherlands.",

In this study, we have performed a quantitative analysis in an artificial agent — a running quadruped robot with multiple sensory modalities — using tools from information theory (transfer entropy). Starting from very little prior knowledge, through systematic variation of control signals and environment, we show how the agent can discover the structure of its sensorimotor space, identify proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensory modalities, and acquire a primitive body schema.

As a growing number of 3D printers are becoming accessible on various 3D printing service platforms, there raises the concern over the validation of virtual product designs and their manufacturing procedures for novices as well as users with 3D printing experience before physical products are produced through the cloud platform. This paper presents a 3D model to help users validate their designs and requirements not only in the traditional digital 3D model properties like shape and size, but also in physical material properties and manufacturing properties when producing physical products like surface roughness, print accuracy and part cost. These properties are closely related to the process of 3D printing and materials. In order to establish the 3D model, the paper analyzes the model of the 3D printing process selection in the cloud platform. Triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are applied to generate a set of 3D printers with the same process and material. Based on the 3D printing process selection model, users can establish the 3D model and validate their designs and requirements on physical material properties and manufacturing properties before printing physical products.",

These equations are received after applying the integral transformation and Gauss–Ostrogradsky’s theorem to the Green tensor for equilibrium equations of the infinite isotropic medium. Initially, three-dimensional problems expressed in Cartesian coordinates are transformed to cylindrical ones and integrated with respect to the circumference coordinate. So, the three-dimensional axisymmetric problems are reduced to systems of one-dimensional singular integral equations requiring the evaluation of linear integrals only. The thorough analysis of both displacement and traction kernels is accomplished, and similarity in behavior of both kernels is established. The kernels are expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals of first and second kinds. The second kind elliptic integrals are nonsingular, and standard Gaussian quadratures are applied for their numerical evaluation. Analysis of external integrals proved the existence of logarithmic and Cauchy’s singularities. The numerical treatment of these integrals takes into account the presence of this integrable singularity. The numerical examples are provided to testify accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method including integrals with logarithmic singularity, Catalan’s constant, the Gaussian surface integral. The comparison between analytical and numerical data has proved high precision and availability of the proposed method.",

To this aim, we present a new model that considers the influence of dissenting opinions on those users who have already believed in rumor/anti-rumor but have not spread the rumor/anti-rumor yet. We hypothesize that influence is a motive for the believers to spread their beliefs in rumor/anti-rumor.

    "abstract": "Conventional financial risk assessment is not accurate and its adaptive assessment ability is low. In order to solve this problem, a financial risk assessment model based on big data is proposed. In this method, the quantitative analysis method is adopted to analyze the explanatory variable model and the control variable model of financial risk assessment. The market-to-book ratio, asset–liability ratio, cash flow ratio and financing structure model are adopted as constraint parameters to construct a big data analysis model for financial risk assessment. On this basis, the adaptive fuzzy weighted control method is adopted for information fusion of financial risk assessment data and big data classification, and the asset income control and innovative evaluation model are adopted for linear planning and square fitting during financial risk assessment. Based on the intervention factors of financial market participants, quantitative regression analysis is performed, and according to the economic game theory, big data analysis and prediction of financial risk assessment are performed through the regression analysis method. Then the big data fusion and clustering algorithms are adopted for financial risk assessment. The simulation results show that this method can provide a relatively high accuracy in financial risk assessment, and has relatively strong adaptive evaluation capability to the risk coefficient, so it has a good application value in the prevention and control of risk factors in financial systems.",

These networks open the way to both microscopic and macroscopic states prediction in such systems. We apply this method to trader-resolved data in the foreign exchange market. We show that these networks are remarkably persistent, which explains why and how order flow prediction is possible from trader-resolved data. In addition, if traders’ actions depend on past prices, the evolution of the average price paid by traders may also be predictable. Using random forests, we verify that the predictability of both the sign of order flow and the direction of average transaction price is strong for retail investors at an hourly time scale, which is of great relevance to brokers and order matching engines. Finally, we argue that the existence of trader lead-lag networks explains in a self-referential way why a given trader becomes active, which is in line with the fact that most trading activity has an endogenous origin.",

Unlike previous epidemics due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), COVID-19 has the particularity that it is more contagious than the other previous ones. In this paper, we try to predict the COVID-19 epidemic peak in Japan with the help of real-time data from January 15 to February 29, 2020 with the uses of fractional derivatives, namely, Caputo derivatives, the Caputo–Fabrizio derivatives, and Atangana–Baleanu derivatives in the Caputo sense. The fixed point theory and Picard–Lindel of approach used in this study provide the proof for the existence and uniqueness analysis of the solutions to the noninteger-order models under the investigations. For each fractional model, we propose a numerical scheme as well as prove its stability. Using parameter values estimated from the Japan COVID-19 epidemic real data, we perform numerical simulations to confirm the effectiveness of used approximation methods by numerical simulations for different values of the fractional-order [Formula: see text], and to give the predictions of COVID-19 epidemic peaks in Japan in a specific range of time intervals.",

This novel coronavirus named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It spreads directly through close contact with an asymptomatic (carrier) or symptomatic person who is coughing, sneezing, talking, singing and kissing. It also spreads indirectly through contact with an environment contaminated by viral particles of SARS-COV-2. In the absence of effective treatment against COVID-19, awareness can play an important role in reducing cases of COVID-19. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to better describe the dynamics of COVID-19 by taking into account the above modes of transmission and the prosocial awareness. The existence, uniqueness, positivity and boundedness of solutions of the model are discussed. All possible equilibrium points are determined. The local asymptotic stability of these equilibrium points is studied. Suitable Lyapunov functionals are constructed to investigate the global dynamics of the model.",

Ocean science is a multidisciplinary discipline developing scientific models and simulations as ocean system models that are an essential research asset. In software engineering and information systems research, modeling is also an essential activity. In particular, business process modeling for business process management and systems engineering is the activity of representing processes of an enterprise, so that the current process may be analyzed, improved, and automated. In this paper, we employ process modeling for analyzing scientific software development in ocean science to advance the state in engineering of ocean system models and to better understand how ocean system models are developed and maintained in ocean science. We interviewed domain experts in semi-structured interviews, analyzed the results via thematic analysis, and modeled the results via the business process modeling notation BPMN. The processes modeled as a result describe an aspired state of software development in the domain, which are often not (yet) implemented. This enables existing processes in simulation-based system engineering to be improved with the help of these process models.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the major principal sources of high mortality among women worldwide. Consequently, early detection is essential to save lives. BC can be diagnosed with different modes of medical images such as mammography, ultrasound, computerized tomography, biopsy, and magnetic resonance imaging. A histopathology study (biopsy) that results in images is often performed to help diagnose and analyze BC. Transfer learning (TL) is a machine-learning (ML) technique that reuses a learning method that is initially built for a task to be applied to a model for a new task. TL aims to enhance the assessment of desired learners by moving the knowledge contained in another but similar source domain. Consequently, the challenge of the small dataset in the desired domain is reduced to build the desired learners. TL plays a major role in medical image analysis because of this immense property. This paper focuses on the use of TL methods for the investigation of BC image classification and detection, preprocessing, pretrained models, and ML models. Through empirical experiments, the EfficientNets pretrained neural network architectures and ML classification models were built. The support vector machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were learned on the BC dataset. The result showed a comparative but good performance of EfficientNetB4 and XGBoost. An outcome based on accuracy, recall, precision, and F1_Score for XGBoost is 84%, 0.80, 0.83, and 0.81, respectively.",

A detailed understanding of the peculiarities of the chemical reaction kinetics associated with replication processes is therefore an indispensible prerequisite for any understanding of evolution at the molecular level. Networks of interacting self-replicating species can give rise to a wealth of different dynamical phenomena, from competitive exclusion to permanent coexistence, from global stability to multi-stability and chaotic dynamics. Nevertheless, there are some general principles that govern their overall behavior. We focus on the question to what extent the dynamics of replication can explain the accumulation of genetic information that eventually leads to the emergence of the first cell and hence the origin of life as we know it. A large class of ligation-based replication systems, which includes the experimentally available model systems for template directed self-replication, is of particular interest because its dynamics bridges the gap between the survival of a single fittest species to the global coexistence of everthing. In this intermediate regime the selection is weak enough to allow the coexistence of genetically unrelated replicators and strong enough to limit the accumulation of disfunctional mutants.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown how information theory extends conventional full-rationality game theory to allow bounded rational agents. The associated mathematical framework can be used to solve distributed optimization and control problems. This is done by translating the distributed problem into an iterated game, where each agent's mixed strategy (i.e. its stochastically determined move) sets a different variable of the problem. So the expected value of the objective function of the distributed problem is determined by the joint probability distribution across the moves of the agents. The mixed strategies of the agents are updated from one game iteration to the next so as to converge on a joint distribution that optimizes that expected value of the objective function. Here, a set of new techniques for this updating is presented. These and older techniques are then extended to apply to uncountable move spaces. We also present an extension of the approach to include (in)equality constraints over the underlying variables. Another contribution is that we show how to extend the Monte Carlo version of the approach to cases where some agents have no Monte Carlo samples for some of their moves, and derive an \"automatic annealing schedule\".",

    "abstract": "Cooperation in spatial evolutionary game theory has revealed various interesting insights into the problem of the evolution and maintenance of cooperative behavior. In social dilemmas, cooperators create and maintain a common resource at some cost to themselves while defectors attempt to exploit the resource without contributing. This leads to classical conflicts of interest between the individual and the community with the prisoner's dilemma as the most prominent mathematical metaphor to describe such situations. The evolutionary fate of cooperators and defectors sensitively depends on the interaction structure of the population. In spatially extended populations, the ability to form clusters or collectives often supports cooperation by limiting exploitation to the cluster boundaries but often collectives formation may also inhibit or even eliminate cooperation by hindering the dispersal of cooperators. Another attempt at resolving the conflict of interest allows individuals to drop out of unpromising public enterprises and hence changes compulsory interactions into voluntary participation. This leads to a cyclic dominance of cooperators, defectors and loners that do not participate and gives rise to oscillatory dynamics which again subtly depends on the population structure. Here we review recent advances in the dynamics of cooperation in structured populations as well as in situations where cooperative investments vary continuously. In such continuous games, the evolutionary dynamics driven by mutation and selection can lead to spontaneous diversification and specialization into high and low investing individuals which provides a natural explanation for the origin of cooperators and defectors.",

In general, the Lognormal MSM models generate \"apparent\" long memory in good agreement with empirical scaling provided that one uses sufficiently many volatility components. In comparison with a Binomial MSM specification [11], results are almost identical.

An opinion formation procedure is introduced which is based on an abstract representation of opinions as k-dimensional bit-strings. Individuals interact if the difference in the opinion strings is below a defined similarity threshold d I . Depending on d I , different behavior of the population is observed: low values result in a state of highly fragmented opinions and higher values yield consensus. The first contribution of this research is to identify the values of parameters d I and k, such that the transition between fragmented opinions and homogeneity takes place. Then, we look at this transition from two perspectives: first by studying the group size distribution and second by analyzing the communication network that is formed by the interactions that take place during the simulation. The emerging networks are classified by statistical means and we find that nontrivial social structures emerge from simple rules for individual communication. Generating networks allows to compare model outcomes with real-world communication patterns.",

Following this principle, the so-called allostatic control system orchestrates the interaction of the homeostatic modules by changing their desired values in order to achieve stability. We use a minimal number of subsystems and estimate the model parameters from rat behavioral data in three experimental setups: free exploration, presence of reward, delivery of cues with reward predictive value. From this analysis, we show that a rat is influenced by the shape of the arena in terms of its openness. We then use the estimated model configurations to control a simulated and real robot which captures essential properties of the observed rat behavior. The allostatic reactive control model is proposed as an augmentation of the Distributed Adaptive Control architecture and provides a further contribution towards the realization of an artificial rodent.",

It is useful for dealing with networks in which the topology evolves according to some specified microscopic rules and, simultaneously, there is a dynamic process taking place on the network that both depends on its structure but is also capable of modifying it. It is a generic framework for modeling systems in which network structure, dynamics, and function are interrelated. At the practical level, this framework allows for easy implementation of the microscopic rules involved in such systems. To demonstrate the approach, we develop a class of simple biologically inspired models of fungal growth.",

The impact force can impose a large load with high local pressure on the body surface. On the other hand, determination of the maximum impact force during impact and acting point itself is very important in the design of floats. In this paper, the water entry of a two-dimensional wedge section is considered. This study is carried out in the framework of a potential-flow assumption. In particular, water impact on a dropping wedge with a constant velocity is pursued analytically by using the Schwartz–Christoffel conformal mapping. In order to determine a position of the wedge where the instantaneous effective force is largest during the impact, a particular equation is introduced here for the first time. The pressure distribution and maximum impact force are also calculated. The obtained results are compared against other numerical and experimental works and favorable agreement is displayed.",

The control of population pressure, using economic efforts is also considered in the modeling process. It is assumed that cumulative biomass density of forestry resources and the density of population follow logistic models. It is further assumed that the density of population and the level of industrialization increase as the cumulative biomass density of forestry resources increases. The cumulative density of economic efforts, which are applied to control the population pressure, is considered to be proportional to the population pressure. The model analysis shows that as the population pressure increases, the level of industrialization increases leading to decrease in the cumulative biomass density of forestry resources. It is found that if population pressure is controlled by using some economic efforts, the decrease in cumulative biomass density of forestry resources can be made much less than the case when no control is applied. It is also noted that if the population pressure augmented industrialization increases without control, the forestry resources may become extinct.",

We assume a working memory that operates on this minimally relevant goal information and study the necessary dynamics of in and out flow of information for such a working memory. Finally, we formally analyze explicit constraints on goal information pathways as information bottlenecks.

This paper explains that complex behavior and sudden transitions also arise from the economy's financial structure as reflected in its balance sheets, not just from heterogeneous interacting agents. It introduces \"flow-of-funds\" or \"accounting\" models, which were pre eminent in successful anticipations of the recent crisis. In illustration, a simple balance sheet model of the economy is developed to demonstrate that non-linear behavior and sudden transition may arise from the economy's balance sheet structure, even without any micro-foundations. The paper concludes by discussing one recent example of combining flow-of-funds and agent-based models. This appears a promising avenue for future research.",

It has proven its advantages e.g., in virtual prototyping i.e., simulation aided design and testing as well as in training and R&amp;D. It is recognized to be a tool for modern decision making. However, there are still reasons that slow down the wider utilization of modeling and simulation in companies. Modeling and simulation tools are separate and are not an integrated part of the other engineering information management in the company networks. They do not integrate well enough into the used CAD, PLM/PDM and control systems. The co-use of the simulation tools themselves is poor and the whole modeling process is considered often to be too laborious. In this article we introduce an integration solution for modeling and simulation based on the semantic data modeling approach. Semantic data modeling and ontology mapping techniques have been used in database system integration, but the novelty of this work is in utilizing these techniques in the domain of modeling and simulation. The benefits and drawbacks of the chosen approach are discussed. Furthermore, we describe real industrial project cases where this new approach has been applied.",

Therefore, conservation of forest resources is an important problem for sustainable development. In view of this, in this paper, we have proposed and analyzed a nonlinear mathematical model to study the effects of economic and technological efforts on the conservation of forest resources. In the modeling process, it is assumed that due to increase in population size, the demand of population (population pressure) for forest products, lands, etc., increases and to reduce this population pressure, economic efforts are employed proportional to the population pressure. Further, it is assumed that technological efforts in the form of genetically engineered plants are applied proportional to the depleted level of forest resources to conserve them. Model analysis reveals that increase in economic and technological efforts increases the density of forest resources but further increase in these efforts destabilizes the system. Numerical simulation is carried out to verify analytical findings and explore the effect of different parameters on the dynamics of model system.",

How and under what conditions do the various types of IGOs — economic, socio-cultural and general purpose — influence bilateral trade between their members? How do complex interdependencies in world trade matter? Existing research tends to examine aggregate joint IGO memberships and has done little to analyze how specific types of IGO membership matter in trade. Using a detailed IGO dataset and a novel network analysis approach called the temporal exponential random graph model, I assess the importance of three main IGO types — economic, socio-cultural and general purpose — in helping members to establish major trading ties. The results provide support for general purpose and socio-cultural IGOs and point to the importance of network phenomena such as popularity, activity and transitivity effects. Moreover, joint economic IGO memberships exhibit slightly more complex relations with bilateral trade. A robustness test reveals that preferential trade agreements are significant in fostering trade, while the World Trade Organization and other economic IGOs such as development banks are not. This paper presents a nuanced way of analyzing IGOs and provides the impetus for the study of complex interdependencies in international trade.",

Simultaneously, the CFD solver calculates induced velocities that are fed back to the simulation and affect the aerodynamic loads in the flight dynamics. The CFD solver models the inflow, ground effect and interactional aerodynamics in the flight dynamics simulation, and these calculations can be coupled with the solution of the external flow (e.g., ship airwake effects). The simulation framework for fully-coupled pilot-in-the-loop (PIL) flight dynamics/CFD is demonstrated for a simplified shedding wake. Initial tests were performed with 0.38 million structured grid cells running on 352 processors and showed near-real-time performance.

It is assumed that the nodes present in the routing protocols of MANETs are cooperative and trustworthy. This assumption makes MANET more prone to manipulation and interception, which generates several possibilities of different suspicious attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Hence, security is considered as an important parameter as the network is fond of suspicious attacks. This paper addresses the security issues by proposing an optimization algorithm, named Jaya Cuckoo Search (JCS) algorithm, which is the combination of Jaya algorithm and Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm for initiating secure route among the MANET nodes so that the path attained is feasible and secure. The proposed JCS algorithm uses a fitness function, which considers a multiobjective function using parameters, such as distance, link lifetime, delay, energy, trust, along with the reputation factor to select a secured path. The JCS algorithm shows maximum performance with energy, throughput, and PDR values as 27.826[Formula: see text]J, 0.554, and 0.628, respectively.",

In order to increase the machine’s reliability, the basis of reliability-centered maintenance approach was utilized. The purpose was to establish a planned preventive maintenance strategy to identify the machine’s critical components having a noteworthy effect on the product’s quality. The critical components were prioritized using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). The goal of the study was to decrease the ppm time interval for a CNC machine by simulating the projected preventive maintenance time interval. For this purpose, the simulation software ProModel 7.5 was implemented for the current preventive maintenance procedure to choose the best ppm time interval which contributed better norms. Five dissimilar optimization approaches were applied, however, the first approach yielded the prominent total system cost and the shorter ppm interval. The results of the study revealed that there was an increase of USD 1878 as a result of an increase in total system cost from USD 78,365 to USD 80,243. Preventive maintenance costs were reduced from USD 4196 to USD 2248 (46%). The costs associated with good parts increased from USD 8259 to USD 8294 (0.4%) and the costs associated with defective parts reduced from USD 171 to USD 3 (98.25%), respectively.",

    "abstract": "Automatic speech emotion recognition (ASER) from source speech signals is quite a challenging task since the recognition accuracy is highly dependent on extracted features of speech that are utilized for the classification of speech emotion. In addition, pre-processing and classification phases also play a key role in improving the accuracy of ASER system. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning convolutional neural network (DLCNN)-based ASER model, hereafter denoted with ASERNet. In addition, the speech denoising is employed with spectral subtraction (SS) and the extraction of deep features is done using integration of linear predictive coding (LPC) with Mel-frequency Cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs). Finally, DLCNN is employed to classify the emotion of speech from extracted deep features using LPC-MFCC. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed ASERNet model in terms of quality metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art ASER approaches.",

    "abstract": "Several recent modeling studies have attempted to understand the human immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Such a model-based understanding provides a sound basis for fighting COVID-19 on the level of individual patients. However, in this context, a worked-out nonlinear physics analysis providing insights into underlying amplitude equations and potential COVID-19 order parameters has not been conducted so far. In order to conduct such an analysis, a three-variable virus dynamics model is considered that can account for the human immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The model amplitudes equations are derived and the relevant order parameter is determined. In line with theoretical reasoning, it is demonstrated that the order parameter and its amplitude determine the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infections, in general, and the initial dynamics of immune reactions, in particular. Explicitly, this finding is demonstrated for data from four COVID-19 patients. For those patients it is also demonstrated that the remnant of the order parameter determines the final disease decline phase. In this context, a time-resolved eigenvalue analysis is conducted that reveals that the transition from the initial stage to the decline stage which is associated with a switch of the leading eigenvalue from a positive to a negative value. It is argued that the immune reaction essentially contributes to this switch. From a medical-physics point of view, this observation suggests that the immune reaction of COVID-19 patients can stabilize the virus-free fixed point of affected sites.",

    "abstract": "In an organism, genes encode proteins, some of which in turn regulate other genes. Such interactions work in highly structured but incredibly complex ways, and make up a genetic regulatory network. Recently, nonlinear delay differential equations have been proposed for describing genetic regulatory networks in the state-space form. In this paper, we study stability properties of genetic regulatory networks with time delays, by the notion of delay-independent stability. We first present necessary and sufficient conditions for delay-independent local stability of genetic regulatory networks with a single time delay, and then extend the main result to genetic regulatory networks with multiple time delays. To illustrate the main theory, we analyze delay-independent stability of three genetic regulatory networks in E. coli or zebra fish. For E. coli, an autoregulatory network and a repressilatory network are analyzed. The results show that these two genetic regulatory networks with parameters in the physiological range are delay-independently robustly stable. For zebra fish, an autoregulatory network for the gene her1 is analyzed. The result shows that delay-independent stability of this network depends on the initial number of protein molecules, which is in agreement with the existing biological knowledge. The theories presented in this paper provide a very useful complement to the previous work and a framework for further studying the stability of more complex genetic regulatory networks.",

The dynamics are mainly ruled by the level of agreement on the main dimension. If two individuals are close on the main dimension, then they attract each other on the main and on the secondary dimensions, whatever their disagreement on the secondary dimension. If they are far from each other on the main dimension, then too much proximity on the secondary dimension is uncomfortable, and generates rejection on this dimension. The proximity is defined by comparing the opinion distance with a threshold called attraction threshold on the main dimension and rejection threshold on the secondary dimension. With such dynamics, a population with opinions initially uniformly drawn evolves to a set of clusters, inside which secondary opinions fluctuate more or less depending on threshold values. We observe that a low attraction threshold favors fluctuations on the secondary dimension, especially when the rejection threshold is high. The opinion evolutions of the model can be related to some stylized facts.",

    "abstract": "Providing intelligent algorithms to manage the ever-increasing flow of air traffic is critical to the efficiency and economic viability of air transportation systems. Yet, current automated solutions leave existing human controllers \"out of the loop\" rendering the potential solutions both technically dangerous (e.g. inability to react to suddenly developing conditions) and politically charged (e.g. role of air traffic controllers in a fully automated system). Instead, this paper outlines a distributed agent-based solution where agents provide suggestions to human controllers. Though conceptually pleasing, this approach introduces two critical research issues. First, the agent actions are now filtered through interactions with other agents, human controllers and the environment before leading to a system state. This indirect action-to-effect process creates a complex learning problem. Second, even in the best case, not all air traffic controllers will be willing or able to follow the agents' suggestions. This partial participation effect will require the system to be robust to the number of controllers that follow the agent suggestions. In this paper, we present an agent reward structure that allows agents to learn good actions in this indirect environment, and explore the ability of those suggestion agents to achieve good system level performance. We present a series of experiments based on real historical air traffic data combined with simulation of air traffic flow around the New York city area. Results show that the agents can improve system-wide performance by up to 20% over that of human controllers alone, and that these results degrade gracefully when the number of human controllers that follow the agents' suggestions declines.",

The key feature of our definition of PMI is the omission of an interval of \"present\" time, so that the mutual information between close times is excluded: this renders PMI robust to superposed noise or chaotic behavior or graininess of data, distinguishing it from a range of established Complexity Measures. For the logistic map, we compare predicted with measured long-time PMI data. We show that measured PMI data captures not just the period doubling cascade but also the associated cascade of banded chaos, without confusion by the overlayer of chaotic decoration. We find that the standard map has apparently infinite PMI, but with well-defined fractal scaling which we can interpret in terms of the relative information codimension. Whilst our main focus is in terms of PMI over time, we can also apply the idea to PMI across space in spatially-extended systems as a generalization of the notion of ordered phases.",

After some preliminary analyses, the simulation model is first used with Design of Experiments and Analysis of Variance to investigate the effects of different resources allocations (i.e., number of forklifts and tractors) and some parameters (i.e., inter-arrival times, container unloading time) on the container terminal performances in terms of total number of handled containers per day. Then, based on the results achieved through the Design of Experiments and Analysis of Variance, the simulation model is used with genetic algorithms to carry out a range allocation optimization on berth assignment to incoming ships and number of tractors serving each quay crane. The aim of the optimization is the minimization of the average time spent by each ship in the port area (decreasing, as consequence, costs and increasing service level provided to final customers).",

The crater shape was developed using simulated temperature profiles to estimate the volume removed in a single crater. The temperature distribution on the workpiece was used to predict the cooling rate and calculate the stresses generated due to thermal loading. Subsequently, the simulation results were experimentally validated by physically measuring the crater shape and volume. From the results it was concluded that about 25% of heat is transmitted to the workpiece during machining at the process conditions used in the experiment. The microscopic pictures showed bigger craters with increase in current. The machined surface showed overlapping craters with surface cracks suggesting a high cooling rate.",

Collaborative filtering is one of the most successful algorithms which provide recommendations using ratings of users on items. There are two approaches: user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. Additionally a unifying method for user-based and item-based collaborative filtering was proposed to improve the recommendation accuracy. The unifying approach uses a constant value as a weight parameter to unify both algorithms. However, because the optimal weight for unifying is actually different depending on the situation, the algorithm should estimate an appropriate weight dynamically, and should use it. In this research, we first investigate the relationship between recommendation accuracy and the weight parameter. The results show that the optimal weight is different depending on the situation. Second, we propose an approach for estimation of the appropriate weight value based on collected ratings. Then, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on both multi-agent simulation and the MovieLens dataset. The results show that the proposed approach can estimate the weight value within an error rate of 0.5% for the optimal weight.",

It is greatly desired that the synergy between cyber and physical components of CPS is explored even before the complete system is put together. Virtualization has potential to play a significant role in exploring such synergy. In this paper, we propose a CPS virtualization approach based on the integration of virtual machine and physical component emulator. It enables real software, virtual hardware, and virtual physical components to execute in a holistic virtual execution environment. We have implemented this approach using QEMU as the virtual machine and Matlab/Simulink as the physical component emulator, respectively. To achieve high-fidelity between the real system and its virtualization, we have developed a strategy for synchronizing the virtual machine and the physical component emulator. To evaluate our approach, we have successfully applied it to real-world control systems. Experiments results have shown that our approach achieves high-fidelity in capturing dynamic behaviors of the entire system. This approach is promising in enabling early development of cyber components of CPS and early exploration of the synergy of cyber and physical components.",

The main conclusion derived connects the existence of diversity in the cognitive strategies and statistics of the sets of moral foundations and suggests that this connection arises from interactions between agents.

The question whether a model exists which is able to make consistent the two paradigms is a living matter that financial markets demand to address. The paper deals with a parsimonious stochastic model able to include as special cases both market efficiency and \"psychological\" phenomena such as the underreaction and the overreaction, peculiar features of the behavioral finance. The great readability of the model, its capability to agree the controversial results provided by literature on efficient markets and the simplicity of the financial intuition it offers are discussed.",

Hence, from the perspective of cloud clients, it is very important to take confident technical actions to defend their privacy at client side. Accordingly, different privacy protection techniques have been presented in the literature for safeguarding the original data. This paper presents a technique for privacy preservation of cloud data using Kronecker product and Bat algorithm-based coefficient generation. Overall, the proposed privacy preservation method is performed using two important steps. In the first step, PU coefficient is optimally found out using PUBAT algorithm with new objective function. In the second step, input data and PU coefficient is then utilized for finding the privacy protected data for further data publishing in cloud environment. For the performance analysis, the experimentation is performed with three datasets namely, Cleveland, Switzerland and Hungarian and evaluation is performed using accuracy and DBDR. From the outcome, the proposed algorithm obtained the accuracy of 94.28% but the existing algorithm obtained only the 83.64% to prove the utility. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm obtained DBDR of 35.28% but the existing algorithm obtained only 12.89% to prove the privacy measure.",

Past studies of software systems from the perspective of complex networks have already led to notable discoveries with different applications. Nevertheless, our comprehension of the structure of software networks remains to be only partial. We here investigate correlations or mixing between linked nodes and show that software networks reveal dichotomous node degree mixing similar to that recently observed in biological networks. We further show that software networks also reveal characteristic clustering profiles and mixing. Hence, node mixing in software networks significantly differs from that in, e.g., the Internet or social networks. We explain the observed mixing through the presence of groups of nodes with common linking pattern. More precisely, besides densely linked groups known as communities, software networks also consist of disconnected groups denoted modules, core/periphery structures and other. Moreover, groups coincide with the intrinsic properties of the underlying software projects, which promotes practical applications in software engineering.",

We treat this issue with an evolutionary model in which agents play the Prisoner's Dilemma on signed networks. The topology is allowed to co-evolve with relational signs as well as with agent strategies. We introduce a strategy that is conditional on the emotional content embedded in network signs. We show that this strategy acts as a catalyst and creates favorable conditions for the spread of unconditional cooperation. In line with the literature, we found evidence that the evolution of cooperation most likely occurs in networks with relatively high chances of rewiring and with low likelihood of strategy adoption. While a low likelihood of rewiring enhances cooperation, a very high likelihood seems to limit its diffusion. Furthermore, unlike in nonsigned networks, cooperation becomes more prevalent in denser topologies.",

The state of each component is fully encapsulated. Control in the network is fully decentralized to each component. At dynamic structure level, DEVS should permit the same level of decentralization. However, it is hard to ensure structure consistency while letting all components achieve structure changes. Besides, this solution can be complex to implement. To avoid these difficulties, usual dynamic structure approaches ensure structure consistency allowing structure changes to be done only by the network having newly added dynamics change capabilities. This is a safe and simple way to achieve dynamic structure. However, it should be possible to simply allow components of a network to modify the structure of their network, other components and/or their own structure — without having to modify the usual definition a DEVS network. In this manuscript, it is shown that a simple fully decentralized approach is possible while ensuring full modularity and structure consistency.",

    "abstract": "In 1760 James Macpherson published the first volume of a series of epic poems which he claimed to have translated into English from ancient Scottish-Gaelic sources. The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century bard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited comparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in literature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous literary controversies of all time, coloring the reception of the poetry to this day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while others protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological sources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian, initiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the two-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the poems in 1765. Here, we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of view. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described in the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources. Despite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric epics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant network-structural differences between Macpherson’s text and those of Homer. They also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the narratives known as Acallam na Senórach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology.",

Moreover, the results are visualized in a way that allows for analysis and semantic interpretation. For validation purposes this method is experimented on some well-known simple benchmarks and then applied to real data: photos and tags in Facebook and Human Brain Tractography data.

Sample: This work used two online datasets which consist of data collected from 768 individuals. We applied neural network algorithms to predict if the individuals have those two diseases based on some factors. Diabetes prediction is based on five factors: age, weight, fat-ratio, glucose, and insulin, while blood pressure prediction is based on six factors: age, weight, fat-ratio, blood pressure, alcohol, and smoking. Method: A model based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) was implemented. The inputs of the network were the factors for each disease, while the output was the prediction of the disease’s occurrence. The model performance was compared with other classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). We used performance metrics measures to assess the accuracy and performance of MLP. Also, a tool was implemented to help diagnose the diseases and to understand the results. Result: The model predicted the two diseases with correct classification rate (CCR) of 77.6% for diabetes and 68.7% for hypertension. The results indicate that MLP correctly predicts the probability of being diseased or not, and the performance can be significantly increased compared with both SVM and KNN. This shows MLPs effectiveness in early disease prediction.",

    "abstract": "In a wholesale shop, the retailer is required to keep an inventory of various ranges of a product due to uncertainty in consumer preferences and behavior. Different Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) models for each variety of a product are needed for optimum level of inventory. EOQ model decides how much stock a shopkeeper has to store, according to demand and deterioration of different items to optimize the inventory policy of multiple products. Items like fashion, food, vegetables, pharmaceuticals, etc., deteriorate in the retailer’s warehouse during storage. An investment is required in preservation technology to significantly reduce the deterioration rate, reduce economic losses, and increase business competitiveness. Here, a multi-item deteriorating EOQ model with a fixed cycle duration has been developed incorporating the preservation technology. The demands for the items are a quadratic function of the selling price, and shortages are allowed. The main objective is to determine the optimal selling price, investment under preservation, the time length up to zero inventory, order quantity of the proposed inventory model such that the overall profit will be maximized. First, we prove that the optimal selling price and investment in preservation exist and are unique. Next, the total profit per unit time is a concave function of selling price and preservation technology investment. An algorithm is designed to obtain the optimum joint policy. A numerical example has been given to illustrate the model, and sensitivity analysis is conducted, which gives some managerial insights.",

    "abstract": "Hypergraphs serve as models of complex networks that capture more general structures than binary relations. For graphs, a wide array of statistics has been devised to gauge different aspects of their structures. Hypergraphs lack behind in this respect. The Forman–Ricci curvature is a statistics for graphs based on Riemannian geometry, which stresses the relational character of vertices in a network by focusing on the edges rather than on the vertices. Despite many successful applications of this measure to graphs, Forman–Ricci curvature has not been introduced for hypergraphs. Here, we define the Forman–Ricci curvature for directed and undirected hypergraphs such that the curvature for graphs is recovered as a special case. It quantifies the trade-off between hyperedge (arc) size and the degree of participation of hyperedge (arc) vertices in other hyperedges (arcs). Here, we determine upper and lower bounds for Forman–Ricci curvature both for hypergraphs in general and for graphs in particular. The measure is then applied to two large networks: the Wikipedia vote network and the metabolic network of the bacterium Escherichia coli. In the first case, the curvature is governed by the size of the hyperedges, while in the second example, it is dominated by the hyperedge degree. We found that the number of users involved in Wikipedia elections goes hand-in-hand with the participation of experienced users. The curvature values of the metabolic network allowed detecting redundant and bottle neck reactions. It is found that ADP phosphorylation is the metabolic bottle neck reaction but that the reverse reaction is not similarly central for the metabolism. Furthermore, we show the utility of the Forman–Ricci curvature for quantification of assortativity in hypergraphs and illustrate the idea by investigating three metabolic networks.",

    "abstract": "We develop a quantitative framework for understanding the class of wicked problems that emerge at the intersections of natural, social, and technological complex systems. Wicked problems reflect our incomplete understanding of interdependent global systems and the systemic risk they pose; such problems escape solutions because they are often ill-defined, and thus mis-identified and under-appreciated by communities of problem-solvers. While there are well-documented benefits to tackling boundary-crossing problems from various viewpoints, the integration of diverse approaches can nevertheless contribute confusion around the collective understanding of the core concepts and feasible solutions. We explore this paradox by analyzing the development of both scholarly (social) and topical (cognitive) communities -- two facets of knowledge production studies here that contribute towards the evolution of knowledge in and around a problem, termed a knowledge trajectory -- associated with three wicked problems: deforestation, invasive species, and wildlife trade. We posit that saturation in the dynamics of social and cognitive diversity growth is an indicator of reduced uncertainty in the evolution of the comprehensive knowledge trajectory emerging around each wicked problem. Informed by comprehensive bibliometric data capturing both social and cognitive dimensions of each problem domain, we thereby develop a framework that assesses the stability of knowledge trajectory dynamics as an indicator of wickedness associated with conceptual and solution uncertainty. As such, our results identify wildlife trade as a wicked problem that may be difficult to address given recent instability in its knowledge trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Cancer of the breast is a deadly disease that can take a person’s life in many different ways. Predicting breast cancer at an early stage is crucial in the fight to end the disease. The usage of deep learning and blockchain technology has been implemented with the intention of integrating optimal prediction with clinical diagnostics and protecting private health information. Patients’ medical records are encrypted and stored in the blockchain for maximum safety. As a result, a large portion of time and energy is spent on feature engineering, a tedious process that requires prior expert domain knowledge of the data to develop effective features, and is crucial to the success of most conventional classification systems. Deep learning, on the other hand, can arrange the discriminative information in the data without the need for a domain expert to develop feature extractors. The research community and industry have paid attention to deep, feedforward networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) because of their empirical results in areas including speech recognition, signal processing, object recognition, natural language processing, and transfer learning. For the best breast cancer prediction, a new method called a “Hybrid CNN” combining the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) with a transfer learning algorithm has been presented. Mini-batch size and drop-out rate are just two of the factors that the SCA algorithm may fine-tune. To stop the model from overfitting, we employ a transfer learning strategy. The hyperparameters found using sine cosine algorithm is used in Visual geometry Group (VGG 16) architecture. ImageNet is used to pretrain the network and last three convolutional layers are trained using transfer learning. The integration of sine cosine algorithm and transfer learning together increases the accuracy thereby preventing the model from overfitting. The experimentation is performed in Google Colab and the proposed Hybrid CNN is compared with existing methodologies such as K-NN, SVM. Also, the proposed Hybrid CNN is compared with CNN without transfer learning and CNN without SCA. The metrics taken into account for comparison are accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-score. The proposed Hybrid CNN achieves 96.9% accuracy that shows the effectiveness of the integration of SCA and transfer learning.",

The measure of disruption, CD 5 , in this study does not account for differences in citation amid decades of exponential growth in publication rate. In order to account for both the exponential growth as well as the differential impact of research works over time, here we apply a weighted disruption index to the same dataset. We find that, among research papers in the dataset, this weighted disruption index has been close to its expected neutral value over the last fifty years and has even increased modestly since 2000. We also show how the proportional decrease in unique words is expected in an exponentially growing corpus. Finding little evidence for recent decrease in disruption, we suggest that it is actually increasing. Future research should investigate improved definitions of disruption.",

The spatio-temporal distribution of employed and unemployed agents is investigated both analytically and by means of stochastic computer simulations. We find the establishment of distinct economic centers out of a random initial distribution. The evolution of these centers occurs in two different stages: (i) small economic centers are formed based on the positive feedback of mutual stimulation/cooperation among the agents, (ii) some of the small centers grow at the expense of others, which finally leads to the concentration of the labor force in different extended economic regions. This crossover to large-scale production is accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate. We observe a stable coexistence between these regions, although they exist in an internal quasistationary non-equilibrium state and still follow a stochastic eigendynamics.",

First, opinion leader influence does not diffuse to the public without homogeneous communication networks. Second, opinion leader influence usually does not diffuse widely to the public because it inevitably faces resistance from self-strengthening communication networks.",

The main idea is to systematically explore the set of projections from the state space of a process to smaller state spaces, and to determine which of the projections impose Markovian dynamics on the coarser level. These projections, which we call Markov projections, then constitute the hierarchical dynamics of the system. The algorithm operates on time series or other statistics, so a priori knowledge of the intrinsic workings of a system is not required in order to determine its hierarchical dynamics. We illustrate the method by applying it to two simple processes — a finite state automaton and an iterated map.",

Using the small-world criterion for directed graphs, it is shown that contrary to claims in the literature, these software systems do not possess small-world properties. Furthermore, it is argued that the small-world property is not of any particular advantage in a standard layered architecture. Finally, it is suggested that the eigenvector centrality can play an important role in deciding which open source software packages to use in mission-critical applications. This comes about because knowing the absolute number of afferent links alone is insufficient to decide how important a package is to the system as a whole, instead the importance of the linking package plays a major role as well.",

    "abstract": "Real-world relations are often represented as bipartite networks, such as paper-author networks and event-attendee networks. Extracting dense subnetworks (communities) from bipartite networks and evaluating their qualities are practically important research topics. As the attempts for evaluating divisions of bipartite networks, Guimera and Barber propose bipartite modularities. This paper discusses the properties of these bipartite modularities and proposes another bipartite modularity that allows one-to-many correspondence of communities of different vertex types.",

The condition for aggregation is expressed as a permutation symmetry of a set of dual eigenvectors of the matrix that defines the dynamics. The applicability of the condition is illustrated in examples from three different generic classes of reducible Markov chains: systems consisting of independent subsystems, dynamics with symmetries, and nearly decoupled Markov chains. Furthermore we show how the method can be used to coarse-grain cellular automata.",

    "abstract": "Experimental studies have shown the ubiquity of altruistic behavior in human societies. The social structure is a fundamental ingredient to understand the degree of altruism displayed by the members of a society, in contrast to individual-based features, like for example age or gender, which have been shown not to be relevant to determine the level of altruistic behavior. We explore an evolutionary model aiming to delve how altruistic behavior is affected by social structure. We investigate the dynamics of interacting individuals playing the Ultimatum Game with their neighbors given by a social network of interaction. We show that a population self-organizes in a critical state where the degree of altruism depends on the topology characterizing the social structure. In general, individuals offering large shares but in turn accepting large shares, are removed from the population. In heterogeneous social networks, individuals offering intermediate shares are strongly selected in contrast to random homogeneous networks where a broad range of offers, below a critical one, is similarly present in the population.",

    "abstract": "Energy waste due to inhabitants' behavior in residential buildings has emerged as a potential research area due to the increasing worldwide population and growing energy needs. However, existing approaches for simulating energy consumption are mainly limited to office buildings and are based on static profiles. In this paper we propose a 4-step co-simulation methodology to assess how inhabitants' interactions with household appliances affect energy consumption. The approach is validated using a case study showing how human activities influence the energy consumption patterns of a refrigerator. The fridge was specifically chosen because it is a high energy-consuming appliance that is strongly affected by inhabitants' behaviors. In addition, modeling the fridge is nontrivial, and in choosing this appliance we show that it is possible to apply the approach to less complex appliances. A co-simulation approach is adopted with the fridge being physically modeled in Matlab and with human behavior being modeled in the Brahms language and simulation environment. The consumption distribution from the simulated scenario is compared with the actual distribution (using data from a consumption database), to find optimum values of tuning parameters with less than 10% variation. This methodology enables us to simulate how human behaviors affect energy appliance consumption.",

Here, we propose that rather than taking established theories from the physical sciences and naively mapping them into the social world, the advanced concepts and theories of social psychology should be taken as a starting point, and used to develop a new modeling methodology. In order to illustrate how such an approach might be carried out, we attempt to model the low elaboration attitude changes of a society of agents in an evolving social context. We propose a geometric model of an agent in context, where individual agent attitudes are seen to self-organize to form ideologies, which then serve to guide further agent-based attitude changes. A computational implementation of the model is shown to exhibit a number of interesting phenomena, including a tendency for a measure of the entropy in the system to decrease, and a potential for externally guiding a population of agents toward a new desired ideology.",

The material properties of the FGM plates are graded in the thickness direction according to a simple power-law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents. The theoretical nonlinear finite element formulations are based on the higher-order shear deformation theory, with a special modification in the transverse displacement in order to estimate the parabolic distribution of transverse shear strains through the plate thickness. The Green–Lagrange nonlinear strain–displacement relation with all higher-order nonlinear strain terms is included to account for the large deflection response of the plate. The fundamental equations for FGM plates with traction-free boundary conditions on the top and bottom faces of the plate are accomplished using variational approach. Results have been achieved using a C 0 continuous isoparametric Lagrangian finite element with 13 degrees of freedom per node. Convergence and comparison studies have been performed to ascertain the effectiveness of the present model. Numerical results are highlighted for different thickness ratios, aspect ratios, and role played by the constituent volume fraction index with different boundary conditions.",

    "abstract": "Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent planar jet with a second-order chemical reaction (A + B → R) is performed to investigate the processes of mixing and chemical reactions in spatially developing turbulent free shear flows. Reactant A is premixed into the jet flow, and reactant B is premixed into the ambient flow. DNS is performed at three different Damköhler numbers (Da = 0.1,1, and 10). Damköhler number is a ratio of a time scale of a flow to that of chemical reactions, and in this study, the large Da means a fast chemical reaction, and the small Da means a slow chemical reaction. The visualization of velocity field shows that the jet flow is developed by entraining the ambient fluid. The visualization of concentration of reactant A shows that concentration of reactant A for Da = 1 and 10 becomes very small in the downstream region because the chemical reaction consumes the reactants and reactant A is diffused with the jet development. By comparison of the profiles of chemical reaction rate and concentration of product R, it is found that product R for Da = 10 is produced by the chemical reaction at the interface between the jet and the ambient fluids and is diffused into the jet flow, whereas product R for Da = 0.1 is produced in the jet flow after reactants A and B are well mixed.",

    "abstract": "Measuring culture and its dynamics through surveys has important limitations, but the emerging field of computational social science allows us to overcome them by analyzing large-scale datasets. In this article, we study cultural dynamics through the votes in the Eurovision song contest, which are decided by a crowd-based scheme in which viewers vote through mobile phone messages. Taking into account asymmetries and imperfect perception of culture, we measure cultural relations among European countries in terms of cultural affinity. We propose the Friend-or-Foe coefficient, a metric to measure voting biases among participants of a Eurovision contest. We validate how this metric represents cultural affinity through its relation with known cultural distances, and through numerical analysis of biased Eurovision contests. We apply this metric to the historical set of Eurovision contests from 1975 to 2012, finding new patterns of stronger modularity than using votes alone. Furthermore, we define a measure of polarization that, when applied to empirical data, shows a sharp increase within EU countries during 2010 and 2011. We empirically validate the relation between this polarization and economic indicators in the EU, showing how political decisions influence both the economy and the way citizens relate to the culture of other EU members.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of wine purchasing behavior is studied focusing on the respective impacts of the word-to-mouth versus wine expert judgements and reputations. To investigate the problem we apply the Galam model of opinion dynamics to agents who have to select a preference about which type of wine to buy given expert judgements, individual preferences and wine reputations. It could be, for instance, a preference between Bordeaux and Burgundy. The main novelty of the work is not about the building of a new model but indeed the construction of a scheme to confront the Galam model to a specific problem of the real world. Accordingly we design a commercial strategy to hold on to a share of the wine market. It provides a novel understanding on how, given some established reputation, the competitive interplay between social interactions and expert judgments affects the market shares distribution. The financial implications of the practical implementation of these results are discussed. In particular it is found that sample distribution of bottles could be drastically reduced from the usual levels practiced by producers. We hope our results will convince some wine producers to test our predictions.",

Similarly, the Tsallis q-distributions may be obtained in the superstatistical framework as a superposition of different local dynamics at different time intervals. In such approach, the average of the stochastic variable is generated by the nonlinear stochastic process, while the local distribution of the signal is exponential or Gaussian one, conditioned by the slow average. Further we analyze relevance of the generalized and adapted equations for modeling the financial processes. We model the inter-trade durations, the trading activity and the normalized return using the superstatistical approaches with the exponential and normal distributions of the local signals driven by the nonlinear stochastic process.",

The data contained monthly records of origin–destination pairs of domestic airports and the number of passengers carried. The topological properties and the volume of people traveling are both studied in detail, revealing high heterogeneity in space and time. A recently developed community structure detection method, accounting for the spatial nature of these networks, is applied and reveals a picture of the communities within. The patterns of communities plotted for each bi-monthly interval reveal some interesting seasonal variations of passenger flows and airport clusters that do not occupy a single US region. The long-term evolution of the network between those years is explored and found to have consistently improved its stability.

    "abstract": "We study a system in which N agents have to decide between two strategies θ i (i ∈ 1 … N), for defection or cooperation, when interacting with other n agents (either spatial neighbors or randomly chosen ones). After each round, they update their strategy responding nonlinearly to two different information sources: (i) the payoff a i (θ i , f i ) received from the strategic interaction with their n counterparts, (ii) the fraction f i of cooperators in this interaction. For the latter response, we assume social herding, i.e., agents adopt their strategy based on the frequencies of the different strategies in their neighborhood, without taking into account the consequences of this decision. We note that f i already determines the payoff, so there is no additional information assumed. A parameter ζ defines to what level agents take the two different information sources into account. For the strategic interaction, we assume a Prisoner's Dilemma game, i.e., one in which defection is the evolutionary stable strategy. However, if the additional dimension of social herding is taken into account, we find instead a stable outcome where cooperators are the majority. By means of agent-based computer simulations and analytical investigations, we evaluate the critical conditions for this transition toward cooperation. We find that, in addition to a high degree of social herding, there has to be a nonlinear response to the fraction of cooperators. We argue that the transition to cooperation in our model is based on less information, i.e., on agents which are not informed about the payoff matrix, and therefore rely on just observing the strategy of others, to adopt it. By designing the right mechanisms to respond to this information, the transition to cooperation can be remarkably enhanced. Our results are obtained in an evolutionary PD game with fixed payoffs and a fixed four-player neighborhood, where agents follow a stochastic better response dynamics.",

The ABM-HPC framework provides an in silico testbed to explore how short-term/small-scale patterns of individual human behavior and long-term/large-scale patterns of environmental change act together to influence human dispersal, survival and extinction scenarios. These topics are currently at the center of the Neanderthal debate, i.e., the question why Neanderthals died out during the Late Pleistocene, while modern humans dispersed over the entire globe. To tackle this and similar questions, simulations typically adopt one of two opposing approaches, top-down (equation-based) and bottom-up (agent-based) models of population dynamics. We propose HPC technology as an essential computational tool to bridge the gap between these approaches. Using the numerical simulation of worldwide human dispersals as an example, we show that integrating different levels of model hierarchy into an ABM-HPC simulation framework provides new insights into emergent properties of the model, and into the potential and limitations of agent-based versus continuum models.",

    "abstract": "The question how a shared vocabulary can arise in a multi-agent population despite the fact that each agent autonomously invents and acquires words has been solved. The solution is based on alignment: Agents score all associations between words and meanings in their lexicons and update these preference scores based on communicative success. A positive feedback loop between success and use thus arises which causes the spontaneous self-organization of a shared lexicon. The same approach has been proposed for explaining how a population can arrive at a shared grammar, in which we get the same problem of variation because each agent invents and acquires their own grammatical constructions. However, a problem arises if constructions reuse parts that can also exist on their own. This happens particularly when frequent usage patterns, which are based on compositional rules, are stored as such. The problem is how to maintain systematicity. This paper identifies this problem and proposes a solution in the form of multilevel alignment. Multilevel alignment means that the updating of preference scores is not restricted to the constructions that were used in the utterance but also downward and upward in the subsumption hierarchy.",

The empirical Verhulst logistic function and the Gompertz double exponential law are used here in order to present an alternative view, within a similar mechanistic physics framework. As an example, a \"social force\" modifying the rate in the number of temples constructed by a religious movement, the Antoinist community, between 1910 and 1940 in Belgium is found and quantified. Practically, two temple inauguration regimes are seen to exist over different time spans, separated by a gap attributed to a specific \"constraint\", a taxation system, but allowing for a different, smooth, evolution rather than a jump. The impulse force duration is also emphasized as being better taken into account within the Gompertz framework. Moreover, a \"social force\" can be as here, attributed to a change in the limited need/capacity of some population, coupled to some external field, in either Verhulst or Gompertz equation, rather than resulting from already existing but competing goods as imagined by Montroll.",

In this paper, we identify the general rules that determine the controllability and control energy cost of multilayer networks. First, we quantitatively estimate the control energy cost of multilayer networks and investigate the impacts of different coupling strength and coupling patterns on the control energy cost for multilayer networks. The results indicate that the average energy and the coupling strength have an approximately linear relationship in multilayer networks with two layers. Second, we study how the coupling strength and the connection patterns between different layers affect the controllability of multilayer networks from both theoretical and numerical aspects. The obtained piecewise functional relations between the controllability’s measure and coupling strength reveal the existence of an optimal coupling strength for the different interconnection strategies in multilayer networks. In particular, the numerical experiments demonstrate that there exists a tradeoff between the optimal controllability and optimal control energy for selecting interlayer connection patterns in multilayer networks. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of interlayer couplings on the controllability and control energy cost for multilayer networks and provide a methodology for selecting the control nodes and coupling strength to maximize the controllability and minimize the control energy cost.",

    "abstract": "Polarization between groups is a major topic of contemporary societal debate as well as of research into intergroup relations. Formal modelers of opinion dynamics try to explain how intergroup polarization can arise from simple first principles of interactions within and between groups. Models have been proposed in which intergroup attitudes affect social influence in the form of homophily or xenophobia, elaborated as fixed tendencies of individuals to interact more with in-group members, be more open to influence from in-group members and perhaps even distance oneself from attitudes of outgroup members. While these models can generate polarization between groups, their underlying assumptions curiously neglect a central insight from research on intergroup attitudes. Intergroup attitudes are themselves subject to social influence in interactions with both in- and outgroup members. I extend an existing model of opinion formation with intergroup attitudes, by adding this feedback-effect. I show how this changes model predictions about the process and the conditions of polarization between groups. In particular, it is demonstrated how the model implies that intergroup polarization can become less likely if intergroup attitudes change under social influence; and how more complex patterns of intergroup relations emerge. Especially, a renegade minority (outgroup-lovers) can have a key role in avoiding mutually negative intergroup relations and even elicit attitude reversal, resulting in a majority of individuals developing a negative attitude towards their in-group and a positive one of the outgroup. Interpretations of these theoretical results and directions for future research are further discussed.",

Extant research has pointed out that firms select alliance partners considering both network-related and network-unrelated features (e.g., social capital versus complementary knowledge stocks). In our agent-based model, firms are located in a metric knowledge space. The interaction rules incorporate an exploration phase and a knowledge transfer phase, during which firms search for a new partner and then evaluate whether they can establish an alliance to exchange their knowledge stocks. The model parameters determining the overall system properties are the rate at which alliances form and dissolve and the agents' interaction radius. Next, we define a novel indicator of performance, based on the distance traveled by the firms in the knowledge space. Remarkably, we find that - depending on the alliance formation rate and the interaction radius - firms tend to cluster around one or more attractors in the knowledge space, whose position is an emergent property of the system. And, more importantly, we find that there exists an inverted U-shaped dependence of the network performance on both model parameters.",

To generalize the resilience measure, its sensitivity to change in demand should be studied. We observe that irrespective of the difference in network size or network topology, resilience decreases with increase in demand. We perform computational experiments on different network topologies to investigate the relationship between network resilience and traffic demand. Based on this, we introduce the area under the demand-resilience curve as a generalized index of resilience (GIR).

    "abstract": "RNA secondary structures provide a unique computer model for investigating the most important aspects of structural and evolutionary biology. The existence of efficient algorithms for solving the folding problem, i.e., for predicting the secondary structure given only the sequence, allows the construction of realistic computer simulations. The notion of a \"landscape\" underlies both the structure formation (folding) and the (in vitro) evolution of RNA. Evolutionary adaptation may be seen as hill climbing process on a fitness landscape which is determined by the phenotype of the RNA molecule (within the model this is its secondary structure) and the selection constraints acting on the molecules. We find that a substantial fraction of point mutations do not change an RNA secondary structure. On the other hand, a comparable fraction of mutations leads to very different structures. This interplay of smoothness and ruggedness (or robustness and sensitivity) is a generic feature of both RNA and protein sequence-structure maps. Its consequences, \"shape space covering\" and \"neutral networks\" are inherited by the fitness landscapes and determine the dynamics of RNA evolution. Punctuated equilibria at phenotype level and a diffusion like evolution of the underlying genotypes are a characteristics feature of such models. As a practical application of these theoretical findings we have designed an algorithm that finds conserved (and therefore potentially functional substructures of RNA virus genomes from spares data sets. The folding dynamics of particular RNA molecule can also be studied successfully based on secondary structure. Given an RNA sequence, we consider the energy landscape formed by all possible conformations (secondary structures). A straight formward implementation of the Metropolis algorithm is sufficient to produce a quite realistic folding kinetics, allowing to identify meta-stable states and folding pathways. Just as in the protein case there are good and bad folders which can be distinguished by the properties of their landscapes.",

For this purpose we have programmed an agent-based computational labor market model with endogenous job creation and endogenous job search behavior. Our~simulations suggest that the endogenous matching technology is subject to decreasing returns to scale. The Beveridge curve reveals substitutability of job searchers and vacancies for a small range of inputs, but is flat for relatively high numbers of job searchers and vertical for relatively high numbers of vacancies. Moreover, the matching technology changes with labor market policies.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the compressibility of complex systems by considering the simplification of Boolean networks. A method, which is similar to that reported by Bastolla and Parisi, 4,5 is considered that is based on the removal of frozen nodes, or stable variables, and network \"leaves,\" i.e. those nodes with outdegree = 0. The method uses a random sampling approach to identify the minimum set of frozen nodes. This set contains the nodes that are frozen in all attractor schemes. Although the method can over-estimate the size of the minimum set of frozen nodes, it is found that the chances of finding this minimum set are considerably greater than finding the full attractor set using the same sampling rate. Given that the number of attractors not found for a particular Boolean network increases with the network size, for any given sampling rate, such a method provides an opportunity to either fully enumerate the attractor set for a particular network, or improve the accuracy of the random sampling approach. Indeed, the paper also shows that when it comes to the counting of attractors in an ensemble of Boolean networks, enhancing the random sample method with the simplification method presented results in a significant improvement in accuracy.",

In this paper, we propose an agent-based model to show that randomly distributed social behavior by way of local interaction converges to a state with a multimodal distribution of behavior. This can be interpreted as a coexistence of different social norms, a result that goes beyond previous investigations. The model is discrete in time and space, behavior is characterized in a continuous state space. The adaptation of social behavior by each agent is based on attractive and repulsive forces caused by friendly and adversary relations among agents. The model is analyzed both analytically and by means of spatio-temporal computer simulations. It provides conditions under which we find convergence towards a single norm, coexistence of two opposing norms, and coexistence of a multitude of norms. For the latter case, we also show the evolution of the spatio-temporal distribution of behavior.",

Apart from the internal complexity, transportation systems are closely interrelated with other systems, which can be defined as external. Transport projects may have implications for the economy, the location and intensity of the activities in a given area, the environment, the quality of life and social cohesion. Actually, today, in order to have a better view of the urban problems and mainly for better governance of mobility, the urban system per se is no longer studied, but rather the whole metropolitan area surrounding it. Transport and land use are clearly integrated. Each technological innovation in transport has encouraged both people and industry to change their location to take advantage of the improved mobility; similarly, each change in land development (e.g. houses, factories, offices and shops) has influenced the demand for travel and ultimately the provision of new transport infrastructures and services. An example of integrated land use and transport planning is the Regional Metro System (RMS) project, carried out in Campania, which is finally reported.",

The model is particularly aimed at understanding the evolution of subsistence trait diversity, since the payoff from exploiting particular resources is often variable and subject to diminishing returns as a result of overexploitation. We find that traits that exploit the same shared resource evolve most quickly when intermediate rates of cultural transmission promote fluctuation in trait diversity. Higher rates of cultural transmission, which promote predominantly low diversity, and lower rates, which promote predominantly high diversity, both retard the adoption of traits offering higher payoff. We also find that the distribution of traits that exploit independent resources can evolve towards the theoretical Ideal Free Distribution so long as the rate of cultural transmission is low. Increasing the rate of cultural transmission reduces trait diversity, so that a more limited number of \"niches\" are occupied at any given time.",

The framework of ant colony optimization is taken as the basic framework in this algorithm. In each iteration, a Markov random walk model is employed as heuristic rule; all of the ants local solutions are aggregated to a global one through an idea of clustering ensemble, which then will be used to update a pheromone matrix. The strategy relies on the progressive strengthening of within-community links and the weakening of between-community links. Gradually this converges to a solution where the underlying community structure of the complex network will become clearly visible. The proposed MACO has been evaluated both on synthetic benchmarks and on some real-world networks, and compared with some present competing algorithms. Experimental result has shown that MACO is highly effective for discovering communities.",

For a tree with n leaves, the average distance of leaves from root scales as (log n)^2 to be compared to log n for random branching. The mean values and standard deviations for the tree shape indices depth (Sackin index) and imbalance (Colless index) of the model are compatible with those of real phylogenetic trees from databases.

We prove that when a pattern network has at least two active edges, then the resulting network has an average distance at most logarithmic in the number of nodes. This suggests that real-world networks based on a similar growth mechanism are likely to have small average distance. We provide an estimate of the clustering coefficient and verify its accuracy using simulations. Using numerous examples of simple patterns, our simulations show various ways to generate small-world networks.

Through an interdisciplinary approach to different game scenarios, the dependencies among market forces are observed, thus, being capable of offering insight on the incentives for adopting different behaviors. This paper takes use of the different factors that form the payoff of certain strategies which can be adopted by companies, and determines the prerequisites for cooperation or competition while all together constructing settings and predictions on the evolution of the phenomena. Determining the evolutionary stable strategy for different scenarios and looking at the way in which the probability of encountering a certain behavior is constructed, provide the possibility to determine the outcome of an ongoing evolutionary process. By studying the monotony of the probability function in respect to each of the factors that contribute to the payoffs, the study indicates that there is a positive relation between the percentage of population playing competitive strategies and market potential, costs, and risks of penalty for cooperation and a negative relation between this percentage and the disputed market share and supplementary winnings from arrangements.",

Markov chain aggregation is then used to derive a macro chain for the complete graph as well as a meso-level description for the two-community graph composed of two (weakly) coupled sub-communities. In both cases, a detailed understanding of the model behavior is possible using Markov chain tools. More importantly, however, this setting provides an analytical scenario to study the discrepancy between the homogeneous mixing case and the model on a slightly more complex topology. We show that memory effects are introduced at the macro level when we aggregate over agent attributes without sensitivity to the microscopic details and quantify these effects using concepts from information theory. In this way, the method facilitates the analysis of the relation between microscopic processes and a their aggregation to a macroscopic level of description and informs about the complexity of a system introduced by heterogeneous interaction relations.",

To calculate [Formula: see text], we propose an optimization method based on random samples of minimum sets of drivers.

Ranking nodes according to their [Formula: see text] values allows us to identify the top driver nodes that can control most of the network. We show that this ranking is superior to rankings based on other control-based measures. We find that control contribution indeed contains new information that cannot be traced back to degree, control capacity or control range of a node.",

Here we integrate ideas and findings on in-group favoritism, opinion dynamics, and radicalization using an agent-based model entitled cooperative bounded confidence (CBC). We investigate the interplay of homophily, rejection, and in-group cooperation drivers on the formation of opinion clusters and the emergence of extremist, radical opinions. Our model is the first to explicitly explore the effect of in-group favoritism on the macro-level, collective behavior of opinions. We compare our model against the two-dimentional bounded confidence model with rejection mechanism, proposed by Huet et al. [Adv. Complex Syst.13(3) (2010) 405–423], and find that the number of opinion clusters and extremists is reduced in our model. Moreover, results show that group influence can never dominate homophilous and rejecting encounters in the process of opinion cluster formation. We conclude by discussing implications of our model for research on collective behavior of opinions emerging from individuals' interaction.",

Having reliable rankings of the candidates is key to recruiting and maintaining a successful operation of an OSS project. This paper adopts degree-based, PageRank, and Hits ranking algorithms to rank developer candidates in OSS projects based on their social links. We construct several types of social networks based on the communications between the participants in Apache OSS projects, then train and test the ranking algorithms in these networks. We find that, for all the ranking algorithms under study, the rankings of emergent developers in temporal networks are higher than those in cumulative ones, indicating that the more recent communications of a developer in a project are more important to predict his/her first commit in the project. By comparison, the simple degree-based and the PageRank ranking algorithms in temporal undirected weighted networks behave better than the others in identifying emergent developers based on four performance indicators, and are thus recommended to be applied in the future.",

During the parallel computing, OpenMP is employed by its efficient fine grain parallel computing and MPI is used to perform the coarse grain parallel domain partitioning for data communications. Through the tests, the hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallel programming was used to renovate the finite element solvers in the BIEF library of Telemac.

Possible causes for such a sudden increase include the undiagnosed initial patient and lapses in infection control practices. To characterize MERS infection and transmission, this paper applies the period-based discrete SEIR model. Infected people of SEIR model shows a good fit to observed patients and MERS will become extinct around 113 days since the first outbreak. Through an effective quarantine plan, if we can reduce exposable people by 20%, it is estimated that the maximum number of infectious people may decrease by about 69% and MERS fade-out period will be shortened by about 30%. Simulations on assumed model support that Korean government’s two policies to control MERS infection rate are effective in lessening its spread. Simulation on reproduction ratio scenarios in SEIR model indicates that success in early infection control practices is critical for shortening the period of disease fade-out. Even there are some restrictions and assumptions on SEIR model simulation, our simulation results are to be helpful in developing strategies to prevent the infectious diseases like MERS.",

Several VMM-based strategies defined in the literature have considered various metrics, such as load, energy, and migration cost for balancing the load of the model. This paper introduces a novel VMM strategy by considering the load of the Cloud network. Two important aspects of the proposed scheme are the load prediction through the support vector regression (SVR) and the optimal VM placement through the proposed dragonfly-based crow (D-Crow) optimization algorithm. The proposed D-Crow optimization algorithm is developed by incorporating crow search algorithm (CSA) into dragonfly algorithm (DA). Also, the proposed VMM strategy defines a load balancing model based on the energy consumption, load, and the migration cost to achieve the energy-aware VMM. The simulation of the proposed VMM strategy is done based on the metrics such as load, energy consumption, and the migration cost. From the results, it can be shown that the proposed VMM strategy surpassed other comparative models by achieving the minimum values of 7.3719%, 10.0368%, and 11.0639% for the load, energy consumption, and migration cost, respectively.",

    "abstract": "To promote the implementation of realistic control over various complex networks, recent work has been focusing on analyzing energy cost. Indeed, the energy cost quantifies how much effort is required to drive the system from one state to another when it is fully controllable. A fully controllable system means that the system can be driven by external inputs from any initial state to any final state in finite time. However, it is prohibitively expensive and unnecessary to confine that the system is fully controllable when we merely need to accomplish the so-called target control — controlling a subnet of nodes chosen from the entire network. Yet, when the system is partially controllable, the associated energy cost remains elusive. Here we present the minimum energy cost for controlling an arbitrary subset of nodes of a network. We show the scaling behavior of the precise upper and lower bounds of the minimum energy in terms of the time given to accomplish control. For controlling a given number of target nodes, we further show that the associated energy over different configurations can differ by several orders of magnitude. When the adjacency matrix of the network is nonsingular, we can simplify the framework by just considering the induced subgraph spanned by target nodes instead of the entire network. Importantly, we find that energy cost could be saved by orders of magnitude as we only need the partial controllability of the entire network. Our theoretical results are all corroborated by numerical calculations, and pave the way for estimating the energy cost to implement realistic target control in various applications.",

In a recent computational study by Pluchino et al [Talent vs luck: The role of randomness in success and failure, Adv. Complex Syst. 21 (03-04) (2018) 1850014], it has been shown that the combined effects of both random external factors (lucky and unlucky events) and multiplicative dynamics in capital accumulation are able to clarify this apparent contradiction. We introduce here a simplified version (STvL) of the original Talent versus Luck (TvL) model, where only lucky events are present, and verify that its dynamical rules lead to the same very large wealth inequality as the original model. We also derive some analytical approximations aimed to capture the mechanism responsible for the creation of such wealth inequality from a Gaussian-distributed talent. Under these approximations, our analysis is able to reproduce quite well the results of the numerical simulations of the simplified model in special cases. On the other hand, it also shows that the complexity of the model lies in the fact that lucky events are transformed into an increase of capital with heterogeneous rates, which yields a non-trivial generalization of the role of multiplicative processes in generating wealth inequality, whose fully generic case is still not amenable to analytical computations.",

We highlight the existence of a stronger positive FDI relationship in pairs of countries that are more central in the migration network. Both intensive and extensive forms of centrality are FDI enhancing. Illuminating this result, we show that bilateral FDI between any two countries is further affected positively by the complex web of ‘third party’ corridors/migration stocks of the international migration network (IMN). Our findings are consistent whether we consider bilateral FDI and bilateral migration figures, or we focus on the outward FDI and the respective inward migration of the OECD countries.",

It integrates the existence of the rank of each layer from where the connection connects. The proposed metric was validated through simulations performed over various multilayer networks.

This method can be broken down into the following steps: data preparation, construction of similarity-based networks, algorithmic identification of opinion-based groups, and identification of important items for community structure. We assess the method’s performance and possible scope for applying it to empirical data and to a broad range of synthetic data sets. The empirical data application points out possible conclusions (i.e. social-identity polarization), whereas the synthetic data sets mark out the method’s boundaries. Next to an application example on political attitude survey, our results suggest that the method works for various surveys but is also moderated by the efficacy of the community detection algorithms.

We relate the perceptible effect of fear and anti-predator behavior of prey with the water-level fluctuations and describe how these are influenced by the seasonal changing of water level. So, we consider these as time-dependent functions to make the system more realistic. Also, we incorporate the time-dependent delay in the negative growth rate of prey in predator–prey model with Crowley–Martin-type functional response. We clearly provide the basic dynamics of the system such as positiveness, permanence and nonpersistence. The existence of positive periodic solution is studied using Continuation theorem, and suffiecient conditions for globally attractivity of positive periodic solution are also derived. To make the system more comprehensive, we establish numerical simulations, and compare the dynamics of autonomous and nonautonomous systems in the absence as well as the presence of time delay. Our results show that seasonality and time delay create the occurrence of complex behavior such as prevalence of chaotic disorder which can be potentially suppressed by the cost of fear and prey refuge. Also, if time delay increases, then system leads a boundary periodic solution. Our findings assert that the predation, fear of predator and prey refuge are correlated with water-level variations, and give some reasonable biological interpretations for persistence as well as extinction of species due to water-level variations.",

We assume that the diseases spread in Tilapia fish follows the Holling type II response function, and the interaction between Tilapia and Pelican follows the Beddington–DeAngelis response function. The dynamics of diffusive and delayed system are discussed separately. Analytically, all the feasible equilibria and their stability are discussed. The criterion for Turing instability is derived. Based on the normal form theory and center manifold arguments, the existence of stability criterion and the direction of Hopf bifurcation are obtained. Numerical simulation shows the occurrence Hopf bifurcation, double Hopf bifurcation and transcritical bifurcation scenarios. The snap shot shows the spot, spot-strip mix patterns in the whole domain. Further, the stability switching phenomena is observed in the delayed system. Our comprehensive study highlights the effect of different parameters, multiple time delay and extinction in Pelican populations.",

    "abstract": "In the digital era, social media platforms have become the focal point for public discourse, with a significant impact on shaping societal narratives. However, they are also rife with mis- and disinformation, which can rapidly disseminate and influence public opinion. This paper investigates the propagation of mis- and disinformation on X, a social media platform formerly known as Twitter. We employ a multidimensional analytical approach, integrating sentiment analysis, wavelet analysis, and network analysis to discern the patterns and intensity of misleading information waves. Sentiment analysis elucidates the emotional tone and subjective context within which information is framed. Wavelet analysis reveals the temporal dynamics and persistence of disinformation trends over time. Network analysis maps the intricate web of information flow, identifying key nodes and vectors of virality. The results offer a granular understanding of how false narratives are constructed and sustained within the digital ecosystem. This study contributes to the broader field of digital media literacy by highlighting the urgent need for robust analytical tools to navigate and neutralize the infodemic in the age of social media.",

Resolving these issues becomes increasingly important as efficient collection and maintenance of panel data make application more conducive. To address some computational issues and structural preservation, Bonzo [3] presented a stochastic version of Kosmelj and Batagelj's approach [16] to clustering panel data. The method used a probability link function (instead of the usual distance functions) in defining cluster inertias with the aim of preserving the clusters' probabilistic structure. Formulating clustering as an optimization problem, the objective function allows the application of heuristic and stochastic optimization techniques. In this paper, we present a modified heuristic for adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) by perturbing the state vector's sampling distribution, specifically, by perturbing the drift of a diffusion process. Such an approach has been used to hasten convergence towards global optimum at equilibrium for diversely complex, combinatorial, and large-scale systems. The perturbed ASA (PASA) heuristic is then embedded in a genetic algorithm (GA) procedure to hasten and improve the stochastic local search process. The PASA-GA hybrid can be further modified and improved such as by explicit parallel implementation.",

The main attraction of agent-based models is that the actors — firms, workers, and networks — that are the objects of study in the 'real world,' can be represented directly in the model. This one-to-one correspondence between model agents and economic actors provides greater clarity and more opportunities for analysis than many alternative modeling approaches. However, the advantages of agent-based modeling have to be tempered by disadvantages and as yet unsolved methodological problems. In this brief summary drawn from the discussion at the closing session of WILD@ACE, we review three of these open problems in the context of the papers presented at the conference: How can agent-based models be empirically validated? What criteria should be used to evaluate the explanatory success of agent-based models? And how can the conclusions of research on similar topics be integrated?",

    "abstract": "Industrial networks offer a prime example of the tension between system stability and change. Change is necessary as a response to environmental variation, whereas stability provides the underpinning for long-term investment and the exploitation of efficiencies. Whilst one of the key themes in industrial network research has been the dynamics of change, relatively little work, empirical or theoretical, has been devoted to the dynamics of stability. This paper presents a new approach to this problem by using Boolean networks, which were originally devised by Stuart Kauffman as an abstract model of genetic networks. The elements in the model are connected by rules of Boolean logic, and a novel aspect of this research is that the elements represent the industrial network exchanges rather than stock entities (the organizations). The model structure consists of interactions between the exchanges, and the results represent the pattern of exchange episodes. A total of 42 networks were modeled and the dynamics analyzed in detail, and five of these cases are presented in this paper. The models produced realistic behavior and provided some insights into the reasons for stability in industrial networks.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based simulation methods are a relatively new way to address complex systems. Usually, the idea is that the agents used are rather simple, and the complexity and adaptivity of such a system are modeled by the interaction between these agents. However, another way to exploit agent-based simulation methods is by use of agents that themselves also have certain forms of learning or adaptation. In order to simulate adaptive agents with abilities matching those of their real-world biological or societal counterparts, a natural approach is to incorporate certain adaptation mechanisms such as classical conditioning into agent models. Existing models for adaptation mechanisms are usually based on quantitative, numerical methods, and in particular, differential equations. Since agent-based simulation is usually based on qualitative, logical languages, these quantitative models are often not directly appropriate as an input in the context of agent-based simulation. To deal with this problem, this paper puts forward an integrative approach to simulate and analyze the dynamics of complex systems, in particular a conditioning process of an adaptive agent, integrating quantitative, numerical and qualitative, logical aspects within one expressive temporal specification language. To obtain a simulation model, an executable sublanguage of this language is used to specify the agent's adaptation mechanism in detail. For analysis and validation, in the proposed approach both properties characterising the externally observable adaptive behavior and properties characterizing the dynamics of internal intermediate states have been identified, formally specified and automatically checked on the generated simulation traces. As part of the latter, an approach to (formally) specify and check representational relations for intermediate, internal agent states is put forward. This enables verification of whether the representational content of an intermediate state a modeller has in mind indeed is in accordance with the agent model's internal dynamics. For a biological agent with known neural mechanisms, such as Aplysia, the modeling approach incorporates high-level modeling of neural states occurring as intermediate states and relates them to their representational content specification. This provides the possibility to validate not only the resulting observable behavior of a simulation model against the observable behavior of the agent in the real world, but also the intermediate states of the agent in the model against the intermediate states of the agent in the world.",

In the context of an integrated quality assurance strategy, several quality- and efficiency-related concepts have been developed and combined, including a model documentation guideline, a generalized V&amp;V concept (the V&amp;V Triangle), a graph-based V&amp;V, and a multistage tailoring process. This article describes the proposed concepts and their applications in two selected simulation development projects. While the primary objective of the first project was introduction and application of the documentation guideline and the tailoring concept; the second project focused more on applying the V&amp;V Triangle and the graph-based V&amp;V.

A genetic algorithm (GA) based inverse technique is applied to fit the simulation outputs with actual data grouped in time intervals as patterns. The simulation results discovered family strategies sustained by the examination systems in imperial China, which relates to important sociological theories on the impact of the intergenerational reproduction of cultural capital within family circles on social inequality in the individual entry in labor and professional markets.

    "abstract": "A significant body of work exists on effectively allowing multiple agents to coordinate to achieve a shared goal. In particular, a growing body of work in the Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) framework enables such coordination with different amounts of teamwork. Such algorithms can implicitly or explicitly trade-off improved solution quality with increased communication and computation requirements. However, the DCOP framework is limited to planning problems; DCOP agents must have complete and accurate knowledge about the reward function at plan time. We extend the DCOP framework, defining the Distributed Coordination of Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE) problem class to address real-world problems, such as ad-hoc wireless network optimization, via multiple novel algorithms. DCEE algorithms differ from DCOP algorithms in that they (1) are limited to a finite number of actions in a single trial, (2) attempt to maximize the on-line, rather than final, reward, (3) are unable to exhaustively explore all possible actions, and (4) may have knowledge about the distribution of rewards in the environment, but not the rewards themselves. Thus, a DCEE problem is not a type of planning problem, as DCEE algorithms must carefully balance and coordinate multiple agents' exploration and exploitation. Two classes of algorithms are introduced: static estimation algorithms perform simple calculations that allow agents to either stay or explore, and balanced exploration algorithms use knowledge about the distribution of the rewards and the time remaining in an experiment to decide whether to stay, explore, or (in some algorithms) backtrack to a previous location. These two classes of DCEE algorithms are compared in simulation and on physical robots in a complex mobile ad-hoc wireless network setting. Contrary to our expectations, we found that increasing teamwork in DCEE algorithms may lower team performance. In contrast, agents running DCOP algorithms improve their reward as teamwork increases. We term this previously unknown phenomenon the team uncertainty penalty, analyze it in both simulation and on robots, and present techniques to ameliorate the penalty.",

Finally, we discuss future research and developments needed to bring the marketplace into common use by modeling and simulation practitioners.",

    "abstract": "We consider the dynamics of cultural evolution in spatially-structured populations. Most spatially explicit modeling approaches can be broadly divided into two classes: micro- and macro-level models. Macro-level models study cultural evolution at the population level and describe the average behavior of the considered system. Conversely, micro-level models focus on the constituent units of the system, and study the evolutionary dynamics that emerge out of the interaction between these units. In this paper, we give an overview of the general properties of micro- and macro-level models using the examples of agent-based simulations and of continuum models based in diffusion theory; we highlight how both frameworks account for spatially-dependent processes. We argue that both micro- and macro-level models are well-suited to describe the process of cultural evolution in spatial settings and stress that micro- and macro-level models should not be considered as competing alternatives, but rather as complementary tools that can provide different insights into cultural evolutionary dynamics. Although adding spatial components to any model increases its complexity, we argue (based on the findings presented by contributors to this Special Issue of Advances in Complex Systems), that the incorporation of space into the evolutionary framework is a necessary step towards a more complete understanding of the process of cultural evolution.",

Although decision-making by individual neurons has been extensively studied, questions regarding how neurons should behave to cooperate effectively remain largely unaddressed. Under assumptions that capture a few basic features of cortical neurons, we show that constraining reward maximization by metabolic cost aligns the information content of actions with their expected reward. Thus, metabolic cost provides a mechanism whereby neurons encode expected reward into their outputs. Further, aside from reducing energy expenditures, imposing a tight metabolic constraint also increases the accuracy of empirical estimates of rewards, increasing the robustness of distributed learning. Finally, we present two implementations of metabolically constrained learning that confirm our theoretical finding. These results suggest that metabolic cost may be an organizing principle underlying the neural code, and may also provide a useful guide to the design and analysis of other cooperating populations.",

Local fishery cooperatives are currently suffering from economic difficulties due to decrease of the fish catch of P. altivelis. Local fishery cooperatives and municipalities have been enthusiastically trying to develop countermeasures that can effectively reduce the predation pressure; however, their effectiveness and efficiency have not been systematically quantified well. This aim can be achieved with the help of an appropriate mathematical model. In this paper, based on a pure death process, a practical stochastic control model for population dynamics of released P. altivelis in river environment under predation pressure from P. carbo, harvesting by human, and environmental fluctuations is proposed. Finding an optimal management strategy ultimately reduces to solving a 2D Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, which is performed with a finite element scheme. Its application to a Japanese river environment successfully computes the optimal management strategy that is consistent with the reality. Numerical sensitivity analysis of the presented mathematical model is also performed for comprehension of dependence of the optimal strategy on the model parameters.",

The SVM-based scheduling mechanism was trained first and then used to make the optimal real-time decisions between “wait” and “deliver” on the basis of real-time system states. An objective function considering throughput and delivery distances was established to evaluate the system performance. Moreover, a simulation model in eM-Plant software was developed to validate and compare the proposed SVM-based scheduling mechanism with the classic minimum batch size (MBS) heuristic. It simulated both the steady and dynamic environments which are characterized by the uncertainty of demands or scheduling criteria. The simulation results demonstrated that the SVM-based scheduling mechanism could dynamically make optimal real-time decisions for multiple-load carriers and outperform the MBS heuristic as well.",

We show that, under certain conditions of social dynamics, the introduction of group dynamics in a cultural dissemination process avoids the flattening of the culture into a single entity and preserves the multiplicity of cultural attitudes.

    "abstract": "Humanity has been fascinated by the pursuit of fortune since time immemorial, and many successful outcomes benefit from strokes of luck. But success is subject to complexity, uncertainty, and change — and at times becoming increasingly unequally distributed. This leads to tension and confusion over to what extent people actually get what they deserve (i.e. fairness/meritocracy). Moreover, in many fields, humans are overconfident and pervasively confuse luck for skill (I win, it is skill; I lose, it is bad luck). In some fields, there is too much risk-taking; in others, not enough. Where success derives in large part from luck — and especially where bailouts skew the incentives (heads, I win; tails, you lose) — it follows that luck is rewarded too much. This incentivizes a culture of gambling, while downplaying the importance of productive effort. And, short-term success is often rewarded, irrespective, and potentially at the detriment, of the long-term system fitness. However, much success is truly meritocratic, and the problem is to discern and reward based on merit. We call this the fair reward problem. To address this, we propose three different measures to assess merit: (i) raw outcome; (ii) risk-adjusted outcome, and (iii) prospective. We emphasize the need, in many cases, for the deductive prospective approach, which considers the potential of a system to adapt and mutate in novel futures. This is formalized within an evolutionary system, comprised of five processes, inter alia handling the exploration–exploitation trade-off. Several human endeavors — including finance, politics, and science — are analyzed through these lenses, and concrete solutions are proposed to support a prosperous and meritocratic society.",

In contrast, trade imbalances in relative terms show a more fragmented topology, with less concentrated clustering which is particularly high for developing countries.

    "abstract": "Recovery of society after a large-scale disaster generally consists of two phases, short- and long-term recoveries. The main goal of the short-term recovery is to bounce the damaged system back to the operating standards enabling residents in damaged cities to survive, and fast supply with vital resources to them is one of its important elements. We propose a general principle by which the required redistribution of vital resources between the affected and neighboring cities can be efficiently implemented. The short-term recovery is a rescuer operation where uncertainty in evaluating the state of damaged region is highly probable. To allow for such an operation, the developed principle involves two basic components. The first one of ethic nature is the triage concept determining the current city priority in the resource delivery. The second one is the minimization of the delivery time subjected to this priority. Finally a certain plan of the resource redistribution is generated according to this principle. Several specific examples are studied numerically. It elucidates, in particular, the effects of system characteristics such as the city limit capacity in resource delivery, the type of initial resource allocation among the cities, the number of cities able to participate in the resource redistribution, and the damage level in the affected cities. As far as the uncertainty in evaluating the state of damaged region is concerned, some specific cases were studied. It assumes the initial communication system has crashed and formation of a new one and the resource redistribution proceed synchronously. The obtained results enable us to consider the resource redistribution plan governed by the proposed method semi-optimal and rather efficient especially under uncertainty.",

Our model exploits a single postulate: the information transfer in an isotropic medium occurs at constant rate. To fulfill this requirement, we introduce in each cell a local counter keeping track of the distance run by the wave from its source. This allows maintaining the wave velocity constant in all possible directions even in the presence of nonconductive local areas (obstacles) with complex spatial geometry. Then, we illustrate the model on the problem of real-time building of cognitive maps used for navigation of a mobile robot. The isotropic property of the CA helps obtaining “smooth” trajectories and hence natural robot movement. The accuracy and flexibility of the approach are proved experimentally by driving the robot to a target avoiding collisions with obstacles.",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to explore the influence of predation on the spread of a disease developed in the prey population where we assume that the prey has a social behavior. The memory of the prey and the predator measured by the time fractional derivative plays a crucial role in modeling the dynamical response in a predator–prey interaction. This memory can be modeled to articulate the involvement of interacting species by the presence of the time fractional derivative in the considered models. For the purpose of studying the complex dynamics generated by the presence of infection and the time-fractional-derivative we split our study into two cases. The first one is devoted to study the effect of a non-selective hunting on the spread of the disease, where the local stability of the equilibria is investigated. Further the backward bifurcation is obtained concerning basic reproduction rate of the infection. The second case is for explaining the impact of selecting the weakest infected prey on the edge of the herd by a predator on the prevalence of the infection, where the local behavior is scrutinized. Moreover, for the graphical representation part, a numerical simulation scheme has been achieved using the Caputo fractional derivative operator.",

    "abstract": "In some of the previous decades, we have observed that mathematical modeling has become one of the most interesting research fields and has attracted many researchers. In this regard, thousands of researchers have proposed different varieties of mathematical models to study the dynamics of a number of real-world problems. This research work is framed to analyzing the structure of the well-known Lassa hemorrhagic epidemic; a dangerous epidemic for pregnant women, via new generalized Caputo type noninteger order derivative with the help of a modified Predictor–Corrector scheme. Lassa hemorrhagic disease is an epidemical and biocidal fever, whose negative impacts were initially recognized in the countries of Africa. This virus has killed many pregnant women as compared to the Ebola epidemic. It was noticed that Lassa virus was isolated in Vero cell cultures from a blood pattern, and after 12 days it was ejective, after the climb of the sickness. In this research study, necessary theorems and lemmas are reminded to prove the existence of a unique solution and stability of given fractional approximation scheme. All necessary results are reminded to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approximation algorithm by graphical observations for various fractional-order values. In our practical calculations, we plotted the graphs for two different values of natural death rate along with various values of given fractional-order operator. Our major target is to show the importance of the proposed modified version of the Predictor–Corrector algorithm in epidemic studies by exploring the given Lassa hemorrhagic fever dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Today, artificial intelligence (AI) can use the most powerful edge computing systems in the Internet of Things (IoT) for finding the information extracted from vast sensory data such as cyber effects or models in physical environments for classification, identification, and prediction. Heterogeneous IoT devices produce isolated and dispersed information parts, and knowledge sharing and exchange in IoT intelligent applications with several selfish nodes are necessary for complex tasks. In both academia and business, IoT is driving a digital revolution. However, protection and IoT privacy problems are challenged. It offers comfort for everyday lives. Blockchain, a shared cryptographic database, is a promising IoT encryption solution for several manufacturing, finance, and trade sectors. The IoT-based blockchain architecture is an interesting contrast to the conventional, centralized paradigm that struggles to fulfill specific IoT requirements. New concepts for applying data and resources management protection procedures in distributed networks and cloud computing are introduced. Cloud management services can be linked to the application through blockchain technology and distributed leader, a stable cognitive information system that facilitates management operations and securing data. This document provides many ideas for applying personal and behavioral characteristics to security and cryptography protocols, blockchain based on the cognitive cloud computing (BC-CCC) pattern. The simulation result shows that the proposed strategy can significantly enhance data transmission rate (96.2%), security ratio (94.5%), throughput ratio (92.4%), scalability ratio (91.5%), trust rate (93.8%), data trading ratio (96.2%), and reduce storage cost rate (25.1%) compared to other existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Music listening is one of the most enigmatic of human mental phenomena; it not only triggers emotions but also changes our behavior. During the music session many people are observed to exhibit varying emotional response, which can be influenced by diverse factors such as music genre and instrument as well as the personal attributes of audiences. In this study, we assume that there is an intrinsic, complex and implicit relationship between the basic sound features of music and human emotional response to the music. The response levels of 12 individuals to a representative repertoire of 36 classical/popular Chinese traditional music (CTM) are systematically analyzed using the chills as a quantitative indicator, totally resulting in 432 ([Formula: see text]) CTM–individual pairs that define a systematic individual-to-music response profile (SPTMRP). Gaussian process (GP) is then employed to model the multivariate correlation of SPTMRP profile with 15 sound features (including 5 Timbres, 4 Rhythms and 6 Pitchs) and 5 individual features in a supervised manner, which is also improved by genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection and compared with other machine learning methods. It is shown that the built GP regression model possesses a strong internal fitting ability ([Formula: see text]) and a good external predictive power ([Formula: see text]), which performed much better than linear PLS and nonlinear SVM and RF, confirming that the human emotional response to music can be quantitatively explained by GP methodology. Statistical examination of the GP model reveals that the sound features contribute more significantly to emotional response than individual features; their importance increases in the order: [Formula: see text], in which the spectral centroid (SC), relative amplitude of salient peaks (RASP), ratio of peak amplitudes (RPA), sum of all rhythm histograms (SARH) and period of unfolded maximum peak (PUMP) as well as gender are primarily responsible for the response.",

We develop a framework to quantify the resilience of highly volatile, non-equilibrium social organizations, such as collectives or collaborating teams. It consists of four steps: (i) delimitation, i.e. narrowing down the target systems, (ii) conceptualization, i.e. identifying how to approach social organizations, (iii) formal representation using a combination of agent-based and network models, (iv) operationalization, i.e. specifying measures and demonstrating how they enter the calculation of resilience. Our framework quantifies two dimensions of resilience, the robustness of social organizations and their adaptivity, and combines them in a novel resilience measure. It allows monitoring resilience instantaneously using longitudinal data instead of an ex-post evaluation.",

Eigenvalues of the matrix that are above the rescaled Marchenko–Pastur distribution can be interpreted as collective modes behavior while the modes under are usually considered as noise. In this analysis, we use complex network analysis to simulate the “noise” and the “market” component of the return correlations, by introducing some meaningful correlations in simulated geometric Brownian motion for the stocks. We find that the returns correlation matrix is dominated by stocks with high eigenvector centrality and clustering found in the network. We then use simulated “market” random walks to build an optimal portfolio and find that the overall return performs better than using the historical mean-variance data, up to [Formula: see text] on short-time scale.",

These systems can be considered as sequential dynamical systems (SDS) over words, a class of dynamical systems that consists of (a) a finite, labeled graph Y with vertex set {v 1 ,…,v n } and where each vertex v i has a state x v i in a finite field K, (b) a sequence of functions (F v i ,Y ) i , and (c) a word w = (w 1 ,…,w k ), where each w i is a vertex in Y. The function F v i ,Y updates the state of vertex v i as a function of the state of v i and its Y-neighbors and maps all other vertex states identically. The SDS is the composed map [Formula: see text]. In the particular case of ACA, the graph is the circle graph on n vertices (Y = Circ n ), and all the maps F v i are induced by a common Boolean function. Our main result is the identification of all w-independent ACA, that is, all ACA with periodic points that are independent of the word (update schedule) w. In general, for each w-independent SDS, there is a finite group whose structure contains information about for example SDS with specific phase space properties. We classify and enumerate the set of periodic points for all w-independent ACA, and we also compute their associated groups in the case of Y = Circ 4 . Finally, we analyze invertible ACA and offer an interpretation of S 35 as the group of an SDS over the three-dimensional cube with local functions induced by nor 3 + nand 3 .",

    "abstract": "Applications of nonlinear dynamic tools for studying air pollution are gaining attention. Studies on ozone concentration in urban areas have reported the presence of low-dimensional deterministic natures and thus the possibility of good predictions of air pollution dynamics. In light of these encouraging results, a nonlinear deterministic approach is employed herein to study air pollution dynamics in a rural, and largely agricultural, setting in California. Specifically, air quality index (AQI) data observed at the University of California, Davis/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (UCD/NOAA) climate station are studied. Four different daily AQI types of data are analyzed: maximum, minimum, difference (between maximum and minimum), and average. The correlation dimension method, a nonlinear dynamic technique that uses phase–space reconstruction and nearest neighbor concepts, is employed to identify the nature of the underlying dynamics, whether high-dimensional or low-dimensional. Correlation dimensions of 5.12, 6.20, 6.68, and 5.84 obtained for the above four series, respectively, indicate the presence of low-dimensional deterministic behavior, with six or seven dominant governing variables in the underlying dynamics. The dimension results and number of variables are in reasonable agreement with those reported by past studies, even though the studied data are different: rural versus urban, and AQI versus ozone concentration. Future efforts will focus on strengthening the present results on the nature of air pollution dynamics, identifying the actual governing variables, and predictions of air pollution dynamics.",

The present paper decomposes and reinterprets the particle swarm in order to discover new ways of implementing the algorithm. Some essential characteristics of the method are illuminated, and some inessential features are discarded. Various new forms are tested and found to perform well on a suite of test functions. In particular, it is shown that the traditional trajectory formulas can be replaced with random number generators sampling from various symmetrical probability distributions. The excellent performance of these new versions demonstrates that the strength of the algorithm is in the interactions of the particles, rather than in their behavior as individuals.",

Here, we present a new method to construct networks in a spatial setting that uses spectral methods in combination with a probability distribution function. Nearly all previous algorithms for network construction have assumed randomized distribution of links or a distribution dependent on the degree of the nodes. We relax those assumptions. Our algorithm is capable of creating spectral networks along a gradient from random to highly clustered or diverse networks. Number of nodes and link density are specified from start and the structure is tuned by three parameters (γ, σ, κ). The structure is measured by fragmentation, degree assortativity, clustering and group betweenness of the networks. The parameter γ regulates the aggregation in the spatial node pattern and σ and κ regulates the probability of link forming.",

    "abstract": "A model is developed to study the effectiveness of innovation and its impact on structure creation on agent-based societies. The abstract model that is developed is easily adapted to any particular field. In an interacting environment, the agents receive something from the environment (the other agents) in exchange for their effort and pay the environment a certain amount of value for the fulfilling of their needs or for the very price of existence in that environment. This is coded by two bit strings and the dynamics of the exchange is based on the matching of these strings to those of the other agents. Innovation is related to the adaptation by the agents of their bit strings to improve some utility function.",

We find that despite communication motivated mostly by controversy and negative emotions, the resulting social network is remarkably similar to networks found in discussion boards based on similarity of views. All collected messages have been analyzed to determine their content type, author's political sympathies and emotion level. This has allowed us to discover almost complete stability of the political sympathies of the users writing comments during the studied period. Using the data on reader evaluation of the comments we present estimates of the political sympathies of the \"silent majority\" of forum readers and found that they follow closely the distribution of sympathies of comment authors. The data from the observations are used as the input for an agent based computer simulation model, reproducing many observed statistical characteristics of the forum.",

    "abstract": "The problem of how young learners acquire the meaning of words is fundamental to language development and cognition. A host of computational models exist which demonstrate various mechanisms in which words and their meanings can be transferred between a teacher and learner. However these models often assume that the learner can easily distinguish between the referents of words, and do not show if the learning mechanisms still function when there is perceptual ambiguity about the referent of a word. This paper presents two models that acquire meaning-word mappings in a continuous semantic space. The first model is a cross-situational learning model in which the learner induces word-meaning mappings through statistical learning from repeated exposures. The second model is a social model, in which the learner and teacher engage in a dyadic learning interaction to transfer word-meaning mappings. We show how cross-situational learning, despite there being no information to the learner as to the exact referent of a word during learning, still can learn successfully. However, social learning outperforms cross-situational strategies both in speed of acquisition and performance. The results suggest that cross-situational learning is efficient for situations where referential ambiguity is limited, but in more complex situations social learning is the more optimal strategy.",

These are defined as the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a user-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a priori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make mistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an epsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level user's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are thus the \"emerging\" patterns corresponding to the utility function. The transitions between these decisional states correspond to events that lead to a change of decision. The new REMAPF algorithm estimates both the epsilon-machine and the decisional states from data. Application examples are given for hidden model reconstruction, cellular automata filtering, and edge detection in images.",

It is assumed that the growths of competing species are logistic and carrying capacities increase with increase in the density of resource biomass. Further, it is assumed that the resource biomass too is growing logistically in the environment and its carrying capacity decreases with the increase in densities of competing species and industrialization. The growth rate of population pressure is assumed to be proportional to the densities of competing species. Stabilities of all equilibria and conditions which influence the permanence of the system are carried out using theory of differential equations. Numerical simulations are performed to accomplish our analytical findings. It is shown that the equilibrium density of resource biomass decreases as (i) the growth rate coefficient of population pressure increases (ii) the growth rate coefficient of industrialization due to population pressure increases and (iii) the growth rate coefficient of industrialization due to resource biomass increases. It is found that the competitive outcome alters with increase in the growth rate coefficient of population pressure. Decrease in the equilibrium densities of competing species is also noted with increase in the growth rate coefficient of industrialization due to resource biomass.",

Each aspect influences the other: social networks provide the conduits via which groups recruit new members and groups provide the context in which new social ties are formed. Given that the resources of individuals are finite, groups can be considered to compete with one another for the time and energy of their members. Such competition is likely to have an impact on the way in which social structure and group affiliation co-evolve. While many social simulation models exhibit group formation as a part of their behaviour (e.g., opinion clusters or converged cultures), models that explicitly focus on group affiliation are less common. We describe and explore the behaviour of a model in which, distinct from most current models, individual nodes can belong to multiple groups simultaneously. By varying the capacity of individuals to belong to groups, and the costs associated with group membership, we explore the effect of different levels of competition on population structure and group dynamics.",

The basic version of MABA, namely SABA, combines a self-avoiding label propagation technique with a simulated annealing strategy for ant diffusion in networks. Once the communities are found by SABA, this method can be reapplied to a higher level network where each obtained community is regarded as a new vertex. The aforementioned process is repeated iteratively, and this corresponds to MABA. Thanks to the intrinsic multi-level nature of our algorithm, it possesses the potential ability to unfold multi-scale hierarchical structures. Furthermore, MABA has the ability that mitigates the resolution limit of modularity. The proposed MABA has been evaluated on both computer-generated benchmarks and widely used real-world networks, and has been compared with a set of competitive algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MABA is both effective and efficient (in near linear time with respect to the size of network) for discovering communities.",

By previously creating markers in the MSC.ADAMS software package, the parametric model of the rope wound along helix is established based on the concentrated-mass theory with multi-degree of freedom (multi-DOF). A novel driving strategy, cooperating fixed joints with angle sensors under the control of driving script, is proposed to substitute conventional contact force. Researching on the hoisting rope in the sinking winch mechanism, an equivalent discretization model is obtained with complicated boundary conditions considered. The differential equations of motion of the hoisting system are formulated employing Lagrange's equation and numerically solved using Runge–Kutta method. The simulation indicates that the horizontal swing is decreased in principle and the simulation with 800 discrete ropes is not performed more than 61 min. Therefore, this feasible strategy could not only guarantee the accuracy but also promote simulation efficiency and stability. The motion curves exported from ADAMS simulation coincide with one in numerical simulation, which validates both the numerical model and the driving strategy.",

The need for web services monitoring and evaluation is necessary because the quantity and quality of retrieved web services generally does not fulfill the demands or requirements of the web service requesters. In the literature, many authors proposed suitable solutions for checking the quality of web service in an ad hoc scenario but there is no available testbed for this purpose. In this work, it is proposed to develop a framework as a testbed for evaluating the web service for its suitability and privacy. In order to verify, the retrieved web services fulfill the demands and requirements of the requester in a DWS environment. The Framework to Evaluate the Web Service Suitability (FEWSS) supports service providers in modeling the services with testbed and to design service behavior to comply the service suitability. It generates run-time instances of web services, client's requests, service registries and other entities in order to emulate realistic SOA environments. By generating a real testbed, our approach assists in runtime test for provider system/services. Particular focus has been put on the privacy policy extensibility to allow the service providers and users in a complex environment. FEWSS also provides an intuitive interface for testing all services under SOA control.",

Assuming a mix of two cooperating and two defecting strategies, we first investigate for isolated islands the conditions for an exclusive domination of each of these strategies and their possible coexistence. This allows to define a threshold frequency for cooperation that, dependent on $n_{g}$ and the initial mix of strategies, describes the outbreak of cooperation in the absense of migration. We then allow migration of a fixed fraction of the population after each generation. Assuming a worst case scenario where all islands are occupied by defecting strategies, whereas only one island is occupied by cooperators at the threshold frequency, we determine the optimal migration rate that allows the outbreak of cooperation on \\emph{all} islands. We further find that the threshold frequency divided by the number of islands, i.e. the relative effort for invading defecting islands with cooperators decreeses with the number of islands. We also show that there is only a small bandwidth of migration rates, to allow the outbreak of cooperation. Larger migration rates destroy cooperation.",

The simple idea is to build the dependence among firms by assuming simple balance sheet rules on debts and credits. In detail we assume that the debts of every company are credits for some of its neighbors. Debts and credits are represented by different balls in the urns/firms. At the same time we assume that the riskiness of every firm also depends on the economic wealth of its neighbors and of the economy in general. These simple rules are sufficient to create business cycles, in which the accumulation of debts pushes the economy towards frequent crises. The model can be easily simulated and the results we obtain encourage the development of brand new finitary probabilistic approaches to study firms' behavior and dynamics.",

The first mechanism follows a standard approach in the literature and is based on the inclusion of a third additional pure strategy in the payoff matrix of the stage-game. Differently, the second mechanism consists of letting cooperators punish defectors with a given exogenous frequency. In the latter, the pure strategy cooperation is replaced by a mixed strategy in which cooperators randomize between cooperation and punishment against defectors. While both mechanisms share the same result regarding the minimum required level of punishment in order to eliminate defectors in both populations, stability in the mechanism following the second approach is more robust in the sense that extinction of defectors is a globally asymptotically stable state for any interior initial conditions in the phase space. Thus, the second mechanism displays a topologically simpler model but the robustness of the evolutionary equilibrium is improved. Results were obtained analytically through nonlinear differential equations and also using an agent-based simulation. There was a good level of agreement between both approaches with respect to the evolutionary pattern over time and the possible steady-states.",

With collaborating and competing 22 players on the field, soccer is often considered as a complex system. More specifically, each game is usually modeled as a network with players as nodes and passes between them as the edges. The number of passes usually define the weight of each edge, and these weights are employed to identify the key players using network modeling theory. However, the number of passes metric considers each pass the same and cannot differentiate players who are making ordinary passes, usually in their own pitch to a close teammate, from those who make key passes that start or improve an attack. As a solution, in this paper, we present a descriptive model to quantify the effectiveness of passes in soccer to differentiate between key passes and regular passes with not much contribution to the play of a team. Our model captures the perception of domain experts with a careful combination of risk and gain assessments. We have implemented our model in a soccer data analytics software. We performed a user study with domain experts, and the results show that our model captures domain expert evaluations of a number of example scenarios with 94% accuracy.

We show that these patterns can be explained by the relative influence of a positive bias on self-opinions and of a negative bias on opinions about others. Without gossips, the positive bias on self-opinions dominates, leading to a positive average opinion. Gossips increase the negative bias about others, which can dominate the positive bias on self-opinions, leading to a negative average opinion.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approximate solution of nonlinear fractional differential equations (FDEs) that exhibit an oscillatory behavior by using a metaheuristic technique. The solutions of the governing equations are approximated by using homotopy perturbation method (HPM) along with the fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. The designed methodology is based on a weighted series of HPM in conjunction with a nature-inspired algorithm. The idea is instantly fascinated by the researchers on the consequent implementation of nature-inspired learning algorithms such as a Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA). The usage of CSA has accelerated the minimized search path of error to the convergent values of the solution. The validity and accuracy of the proposed technique are ascertained by calculating the approximate solution and the error norms which ensure the convergence of the approximation that can be further increased. The critical analysis is also provided by the numerical simulation of two different test models. Discussion of key points has been determined by the tabulation of numerical values and graphs. Comparative study of the results with known numerical technique is also performed.",

    "abstract": "The ship energy efficiency management is an important topic in the field of the energy management onboard and the exhaust gases emission nowadays. The advanced model plays a vital role to improve the ship energy efficiency management when considering the variable factors. The establishment of the ship energy efficiency model through energy efficiency operational indicator (EEOI) index has been conducted through Monte Carlo simulation method along with using the operation data of a bulk carrier. A bulk carrier is chosen, namely, M/V NSU JUSTICE 250,000 DWT of VINIC Shipping Transportation Company in Vietnam. This research uses the real operational data to perform a statistical methodology which calculates the various factors used to calculate EEOI. This method is supported by Matlab program through the curve fitting tool. The normal distribution estimation and the kernel density estimation method are used for the parametric curve fitting and non-parametric curve fitting, respectively. The average weather condition (wind speed and wave height) and the fouling condition of hull have been investigated and compared with the research results. The validation of the proposed methods has been conducted through the study of the external factors influencing the research results. The research result shows the optimal operational data for the fuel consumption at each certain voyage.

Extracted multimodal features of ground missions, air missions, and cruise mission were trained to generate support vector machine behavior model based on supervised learning. The results showed that different behaviors affects different multiple rhythm features, which are power spectra of the [Formula: see text] waves of EEG, standard deviation of normal to normal, root mean square of standard deviation and average gaze duration. The different physiological characteristics of the pilots could also be distinguished using an SVM model.

This paper develops a novel model for realizing ant-inspired algorithms that coordinate robots within fixed, geographically constrained environments (\"factory/laboratory/warehouse floors\") and studies the model via sample tasks that illustrate various aspects of path planning and exploration. The model, dubbed a Cellular ANTomaton (C-ANTomaton, for short), inverts the relationship between ant-robots and the environments that they navigate: \"Intelligence\" now resides in the \"floor\" rather than in the ant-robots. The C-ANTomaton model is illustrated via three proof-of-concept problems: (1) Parking requires ant-robots to congregate in their nearest corners of the \"floor,\" in a maximally compact formation. (2) Food-seeking (both with and without impenetrable obstacles) requires each ant-robot to find its own \"food\" item, until either \"foodless\" ant-robots or unclaimed \"food\" items run out. (3) Maze-threading requires a single ant-robot to find the unique exit to a maze. \"Unintelligent\" C-ANTomaton-based robots accomplish all of these goals provably more efficiently than traditional \"intelligent\" ant-robots can; indeed, \"intelligent\" ant-robots cannot always park at all! All of the presented algorithms are scalable, in that they provably work for any number of ant-robots, within any finite-size \"floor.\" In other words, the computers that collectively supply the system with \"intelligence\" never exploit any information about either the number of ant-robots or the size of the \"floor.\"",

Evidence shows that these two mechanisms strongly involve learning about associations. Based on these biological findings, we propose a new learning model to achieve successful control policies for artificial systems. This model combines correlation-based learning using input correlation learning (ICO learning) and reward-based learning using continuous actor–critic reinforcement learning (RL), thereby working as a dual learner system. The model performance is evaluated by simulations of a cart-pole system as a dynamic motion control problem and a mobile robot system as a goal-directed behavior control problem. Results show that the model can strongly improve pole balancing control policy, i.e., it allows the controller to learn stabilizing the pole in the largest domain of initial conditions compared to the results obtained when using a single learning mechanism. This model can also find a successful control policy for goal-directed behavior, i.e., the robot can effectively learn to approach a given goal compared to its individual components. Thus, the study pursued here sharpens our understanding of how two different learning mechanisms can be combined and complement each other for solving complex tasks.",

Our approach is making use of the multi-resolution basis of multiwavelets. The potential is obtained as the direct solution of the Poisson equation in its Green's function integral form. In the multiwavelet basis, the formally non local integral operator decays rapidly to negligible values away from the main diagonal, yielding an effectively banded structure where the bandwidth is only dictated by the requested accuracy. This sparse operator structure has been exploited to achieve linear scaling and parallel algorithms. Parallelization has been achieved both through the shared memory (OpenMP) and the message passing interface (MPI) paradigm. Our implementation has been tested by computing the electrostatic potential of the electronic density of long-chain alkanes and diamond fragments showing (sub)linear scaling with the system size and efficent parallelization.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent system (MAS) models have been increasingly applied to the simulation of complex phenomena in different areas, providing successful and credible results. Citizens behavior related to a specific urban activity (i.e., recreation activities in a park, using bicycle for mobility purposes) can be modeled as an agent (actor) with several affinities and preferences which are dependent on aspects that affect the activity. A particular application of a MAS approach is in area of urban policy design, in which policies should be designed considering citizens needs, preferences and behavior. Once an open space in a city is available (i.e., an industry is moved to an industrial area), a land use policy should contribute to identify the new use for the urban space. There are different land use policies that can be applied depending on which services or facilities must be empowered in the city. It is important to identify the correct policy in order to satisfy present citizens needs but considering also the future needs in a social changing context. A socio-technological simulation model has been developed to allow citizens to get a better understanding of the urban problem, its dynamics and explore the sustainability of the different solutions., enhancing citizens to participate in the urban decisions through new technologies (i.e., e-participation). This paper illustrates an open space MAS simulation model for land use design policies in which citizens can check their opinion and get a better understanding of the different choices and its acceptability by the community considering not only present neighborhood profiles, but also future neighborhood configurations. It is the first step before the development of the final software including a user friendly interface to let citizens with different cultural profiles to perform simulations as an essential and neutral tool to reach consensus during the decision-making process in urban policy design.",

Relative to the benchmark case of banks with homogeneous degrees and balance-sheet sizes, we find that if banks have a power-law degree distribution the system becomes less robust with respect to the initial failure of a random bank, and that targeted shocks to the most specialised banks (i.e. banks with low degrees) or biggest banks increases the probability of observing a cascade of defaults. In contrast, we find that a power-law degree distribution for assets increases stability with respect to random shocks, but not with respect to targeted shocks. We also study how allocations of capital buffers between banks affects the system's stability, and we find that assigning capital to banks in relation to their level of diversification reduces the probability of observing cascades of defaults relative to size based allocations. Finally, we propose a non-capital based policy that improves the resilience of the system by introducing disassortative mixing between banks and assets.",

Here, a continuous model of opinion dynamics for multiple possible choices is analysed. Its main features are the inclusion of disagreement and possibility of modulating information, both from one and multiple sources. The interest is in identifying the effect of the initial cohesion of the population, the interplay between cohesion and information extremism, and the effect of using multiple sources of information that can influence the system. Final consensus, especially with external information, depends highly on these factors, as numerical simulations show. When no information is present, consensus or segregation is determined by the initial cohesion of the population. Interestingly, when only one source of information is present, consensus can be obtained, in general, only when this is extremely mild, i.e. there is not a single opinion strongly promoted, or in the special case of a large initial cohesion and low information exposure. On the contrary, when multiple information sources are allowed, consensus can emerge with an information source even when this is not extremely mild, i.e. it carries a strong message, for a large range of initial conditions.",

But most of the actual system scheduling problems are more than one object. Therefore, the research of multi-objective scheduling problem is very important and meaningful. In this paper, we proposed a multi-objective scheduling model which adopts weighted sum method to optimize two important indexes (makespan and total flow time). Genetic algorithm (GA) has diversified global search ability, while simulated annealing (SA) combined with tabu search (TS) have intensified capabilities in local neighborhood search. To overcome the drawback of the GA, we proposed a new hybrid GA (NewHGA) which produces initial solutions by GA firstly, and then take SA operator incorporate TS operator to search in the local space. By adding the novel local search strategy, the diversity of solutions will be improved greatly so that it can ensure the algorithm jump out of the local optimal value. We test this algorithm using the benchmark instances of different sizes taken from the OR-Library, and the results show that the algorithm is efficient than another hybrid algorithm.",

First, it analyzes the importance of the weights of the neurons in each layer of the DNN model to the correctness of the final prediction results, and ranks the weights according to the influence on the prediction results of the DNN model. Second, mutation is performed to generate mutants based on the rank of weights, and genetic algorithms are used to select mutants for the next round of mutation until the stop condition is touched. Experiments are carried on a set of DNN models which are trained with the MNIST dataset. The experimental results show that GenMuNN can improve the accuracy of the DNN models.",

A comparison between the XDEVS model and models described by DEV&amp;DESS and GDEVS shows that XDEVS can clearly express the structure of the model and reduce the burden on modelers.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, the advent of network science permitted new quantitative approaches to literary studies. Here we bring the Kyiv bylyny cycle into the field - East Slavic epic narratives originating in modern-day Ukraine. By comparing them to other prominent European epics, we identify universal and distinguishing properties of the social networks in bylyny. We analyse community structures and rank the most important characters. The method allows to bolster hypotheses from humanities literature - such as the position of Prince Volodymyr - and to generate new ones We show how the Kyiv cycle of bylyny fits very well with narrative networks from other nations - especially heroic ones. We anticipate that, besides delivering new narratological insights, this study will aid future scholars and interested public to navigate their way through Ukraine's epic story and identify its heroes.",

    "abstract": "There is a public and scholarly debate about whether personalized services of social-media platforms contribute to the rise of bipolarization of political opinions. On the one hand, it is argued that personalized services of online social networks generate filter bubbles limiting contact between users who disagree. This reduces opportunities for assimilative social influence between users from different camps and prevents opinion convergence. On the other hand, empirical research also indicated that exposing users to content from the opposite political spectrum can activate the counter-part of assimilative influence, repulsive influence. Fostering contact that leads to opinion assimilation and limiting contacts likely to induce repulsive interactions, it has been concluded, may therefore prevent bipolarization. With an agent-based model, we demonstrate here that these conclusions fail to capture the complexity that assimilative and repulsive influence generate in social networks. Sometimes, more assimilative influence can actually lead to more and not less opinion bipolarization. Likewise, increasing the exposure of users to like-minded individuals sometimes intensifies opinion polarization. While emerging only in specific parts of the parameter space, these counter-intuitive dynamics are robust, as our simulation experiments demonstrate. We discuss implications for the debate about filter bubbles and approaches to improve the design of online social networks. While we applaud the growing empirical research on the micro-processes of assimilative and repulsive influence in online settings, we warn that drawing conclusions about resulting macro-outcomes like opinion bipolarization requires a rigorous analysis capturing the complexity of online communication systems. Intuition alone is error-prone in this context. Accordingly, models capturing the complexity of social influence in networks should play a more important role in the design of communication systems.",

The results are obtained using Liouville–Caputo and new generalized Caputo-type fractional derivatives. The numerical simulations are presented for various orders of given derivatives. Existence and uniqueness analysis of the given problem are also performed in the new generalized Caputo sense. The explored results are verified using figures.

    "abstract": "The application of support vector machine to the aircraft power supply system breakdown diagnosis is one of the research focuses in the tomorrow. Support vector machine (SVM) belongs a new type of machine learning technique, which uses structural hazard minimization rule to substitute for the conventional empirical hazard minimization according to great specimen. The powerful performance of the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) needs to be reflected in the optimal selection of appropriate parameters, and the quality of parameters greatly affects the accuracy and efficiency of breakdown diagnosis. The traditional LSSVM parameters selection method is inefficient, the calculation is huge, and it takes expensive time to select the satisfactory solution. Aiming at the problem of parameters selection of LSSVM, the way of optimizing the parameters of LSSVM by apply simulated annealing genetic algorithm (SAGA) is proposed. SAGA uses the parallel sampling process of genetic algorithm to improve the time performance of optimization, and makes use of the simulated annealing algorithm to dominate the constriction of majorization to prevent precocity. On the one hand, genetic algorithm has strong ability to grasp the overall search process, on the other hand, simulated annealing algorithm is used to control the convergence of the algorithm to prevent premature phenomenon. The automatic optimal selection of LSSVM parameters is achieved. The Iris system classification and recognition in the UCI machine learning database and the breakdown diagnosis of the autopilot flight control box are used as experimental platforms to obtain data samples for simulation research. The simulation results show that LSSVM optimized by SAGA improves both the accuracy and efficiency of classification recognition. It not only effectively overcomes the problem of low efficiency caused by searching optimal parameters by experience, but also effectively improves the accuracy of classification recognition. The false alarm rate and redundant breakdowns are effectively reduced.",

Such network serves as an important tool to study the network structure of alters of the ego, and it is essential to present such network with good visualization. This work aims at introducing an efficient method, namely the Uniform Placement of Alters on Spherical Surface (U-PASS), to represent an ego-centric network so that all alters are scattered on the surface of the unit sphere uniformly. Unlike other simple uniformity that considers to maximize Euclidean distances among nodes, U-PASS is a three-stage method that spreads the alters with the consideration of existing edges among alters, no overlapping of node clusters, and node attribute information. Particle swarm optimization is employed to improve efficiency in node allocations. To guarantee the uniformity, we show the connection between our U-PASS to the minimum energy design on a two-dimensional flat plane with a specific gradient. Our simulation study shows good performance of U-PASS in terms of some distance statistics when compared to four state-of-the-art methods via self-organizing maps and force-driven approaches. We use a Facebook network to illustrate how this ego-centric network looks different after the alter nodes are allocated via our U-PASS.",

The formulation of this operator is carried out by the Caputo–Fabrizio derivative and the Horn–Schunck method. In this way, our operator generalizes the traditional Horn–Schunck technique. The Caputo–Fabrizio fractional-order derivative is introduced for its high capability to enhance and preserve both texture detail and image edges, making it more suitable for optical flow estimation in images with weak edges caused by low contrast or noise. A fractional-order multiscale strategy is also considered to deal with large displacements. This fractional-order approach produces a dense flow and greatly increases robustness at outliers. Experimental comparisons with the conventional multiscale Horn–Schunck algorithm and some integer- and fractional-order methods existing on the MPI Sintel and Middlebury Stereo datasets demonstrate that our operator provides significantly lower average endpoint error and average angular error. The firefly algorithm is used to get the optimal order for all the stereoscopic image sequences.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the dynamics of economic evolution and technological change as hill-climbing in an adaptive landscape over a continuous characteristics space. A technology/firm is described by a large number of attributes or characteristics representing technology-inherent aspects, financial, organizational and economic features. These parameters span a characteristics space, which is a real Euclidean vector space, in analogy to the phenotype space in biology. Further we define a real-valued multimodal fitness function/functional and a population density over the characteristics space. The evolutionary dynamics including competition and mutations/innovations is modeled by reaction-diffusion equations of Fisher–Eigen or Lotka–Volterra type. We demonstrate the potential of such models, which in certain aspects go beyond the widespread applications of discrete replicator dynamics. Concerning technological change the emergence of technological populations as the result of a search process in an adaptive landscape will be investigated. In particular, the relation between incremental and radical innovations will be considered, especially the apparent paradox of a discrete continuum of technological change. Further, an application of the developed framework to the assessment of firms in the stock market is discussed.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a phenomenological approach to describe a complex systemcolon; scientific research impact through Citation Mining. The novel concept of Citation Mining, a combination of citation bibliometrics and text mining, is used for the phenomenological description. Citation Mining starts with a group of core papers whose impact is to be examined, retrieves the papers that cite these core papers, and then analyzes the bibliometrics characteristics of the citing papers as well as their linguistic and thematic characteristics. The Science Citation Index is used as the source database for the core of citing papers, since its citation-based structure enables the capability to perform citation studies easily. This paper presents illustrative examples in photovoltaics (applied research) and sandpile dynamics (basic research) to show the types of output products possible. Bibliometric profiling is performed over a number of the citing papers' record fields to offer different perspectives on the citing (user) community. Text mining is performed on the aggregate citing papers, to identify aggregate citing community themes, and to identify extra-discipline and applications themes. The photovoltaics applied research papers had of the order of hundreds of citations in aggregate. All of the citing papers ranged from applied research to applications, and their main themes were fully aligned with those of the aggregate cited papers. This seems to be the typical case with applied research. The sandpile dynamics basic research papers had hundreds of citations in aggregate. Most of the citing papers were also basic research whose main themes were aligned with those of the cited paper. This is typically the case with basic research. However, about twenty percent of the citing papers were research or development in other disciplines, or development within the same discipline. In addition, there was a four year lag time between publication and citation by the development papers.",

    "abstract": "An urn-ball probabilistic model of the labor market is developed. Agents can be employed (voluntarily or involuntarily) unemployed, or entrepreneurs. The analytical long-run equilibrium probabilities for each state and the matching function are derived. In equilibrium, a higher reservation wage increases the number of start-ups, but has an overall negative impact on the unemployment rate. A more buoyant economy (higher average growth rate and higher average wages) is shown to be associated with a lower unemployment rate. Higher start-up costs discourage entrepreneurship and increase unemployment. More active search behavior leads first to a decrease in the unemployment rate, and then to a small increase, due to increased coordination failure induced by the higher number of applications sent by job seekers. The out-of-equilibrium dynamics are investigated through an agent-based simulation, which also provides results on firm demography. Important empirical regularities such as the Beveridge and the Okun curve are recovered. Finally, the simulation model is used to investigate departures from maximizing individual behavior and the effects of more realistic assumptions about profits and the business cycle.",

We show an intimate connection between the Rényi disorders and the spectrum of dimensions known as multifractals. Three examples are treated, including one for power law distributions and one based on the logistic map. On the basis of the three examples, it is demonstrated that all three classes of extended disorder are required to fully characterize the corresponding properties of a system. We conjecture, and sketch a proof to support, that all three extended disorders are also sufficient to completely determine a dimension spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of complex biological systems has been shown to lead to contradictory results. Two completely different approaches are compared using a highly dynamic system of the adaptive immune response with medical relevance. In germinal centers, high affinity antibodies are newly generated from antigen-activated B cell clones. The encoded antibody is mutated and high affinity clones for a specific antigen are selected to survive, giving rise to affinity maturation of antibodies. Here, the general assumption that competition for antigen held on follicular dendritic cells is responsible for affinity maturation is shown to be unlikely. This finding is based on the investigation of eight different selection mechanisms. A realistic model on selection mechanisms leading to affinity maturation is developed. It is found that negative selection of B cell, a B cell refractory time for binding antigen, and competition for T cell help, have strongest impact on affinity maturation. Antigen consumption is demonstrated to have impact on the kinetics of the germinal center in the late phase of the reaction and is hypothesized to be responsible for the termination of the reaction. These results are consistently found with agent-based and ordinary differential equation approaches and can, thus be considered to be robust. Experimental tests of the predicted selection mechanisms are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Financial markets are complex systems; all the information scattered around the market is fairly and dynamically reflected in the current prices. It is difficult to understand the dynamics of markets merely by traditional analyzing methods. We propose here a new concept inspired by complex networks to study the trading behavior and the dynamics of markets. A web-based platform for prediction market which trades the political futures contracts is built to monitor the trading behavior among the human players. Two experiments are conducted on this platform in parallel for 30 days. From the accumulated transaction data, we reconstruct the so-called cash-flow networks. By examining the degree distributions of these networks, we observe that the network structure is scale-free with a power-law exponent of 1.15, which means that there must be a non-trivial mechanism governing the network growth in our markets. Through carrying out a post-simulation modelling by a continuous double auction market with \"zero-intelligence\" traders, we demonstrate that such a simple model is capable of generating scale-free networks. We thus suggest that the scale-free nature of the cash-flow networks should rely on the institutional design and the structure of markets rather than on the traders' strategies.",

As part of analyzing them, we develop generally applicable techniques and metrics for qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing indexes that evaluate content and people, as well as for understanding the causes of their different behaviors. Finally, we extend the analysis to other popular indexes, to show whether the choice of the index has a significant effect in how papers and authors are ranked. We put the techniques at work on a dataset of over 260 K ACM papers, and discovered that the difference in ranking results is indeed very significant (even when restricting to citation-based indexes), with half of the top-ranked papers differing in a typical 20-element long search result page for papers on a given topic, and with the top researcher being ranked differently over half of the times in an average job posting with 100 applicants.",

    "abstract": "There is much empirical evidence that human decision-making under risk does not coincide with expected value maximization, and much effort has been invested into the development of descriptive theories of human decision-making involving risk (e.g. Prospect Theory). An open question is how behavior corresponding to these descriptive models could have been learned or arisen evolutionarily, as the described behavior differs from expected value maximization. We believe that the answer to this question lies, at least in part, in the interplay between risk-taking, sequentiality of choice, and population dynamics in evolutionary environments. In this paper, we provide the results of several evolutionary game simulations designed to study the risk behavior of agents in evolutionary environments. These include several evolutionary lottery games where sequential decisions are made between risky and safe choices, and an evolutionary version of the well-known stag hunt game. Our results show how agents that are sometimes risk-prone and sometimes risk-averse can outperform agents that make decisions solely based on the maximization of the local expected values of the outcomes, and how this can facilitate the evolution of cooperation in situations where cooperation entails risk.",

A well mixed population of two fluorescently labeled microbial species is grown in a circular geometry. As the population expands, a coarsening process driven by genetic drift gives rise to sectoring patterns with fractal boundaries, which show a non-trivial asymptotic distribution. Using simplified lattice based Monte Carlo simulations as a generic caricature of the above experiment, we present detailed numerical results to establish a model for sector boundaries as time changed Brownian motions. This is used to derive a general one-to-one mapping of sector statistics between circular and linear geometries, which leads to a full understanding of the sectoring patterns in terms of annihilating diffusions.",

It assumes that individuals (operators) governing the dynamics of a certain system try to follow an optimal strategy in controlling its motion but fail to do this perfectly because similar strategies are indistinguishable for them. The main attention is focused on the systems where the optimal dynamics implies the stability of a certain equilibrium point in the corresponding phase space. In such systems the fuzzy rationality gives rise to some neighborhood of the equilibrium point, the region of dynamical traps, wherein each point is regarded as an equilibrium one by the operators. So, when the system enters this region and while it is located in it, maybe for a long time, the operator control is suspended. To elucidate a question as to whether the dynamical traps on their own can cause emergent phenomena, the stochastic factors are eliminated from consideration. In this case the system can leave the dynamical trap region only because of the mismatch between actions of different operators. By way of example, a chain of oscillators with dynamical traps is analyzed numerically. As demonstrated, the dynamical traps do induce instability and complex behavior of such systems.",

On the other hand, they mutually cooperate. This fact has motivated many researchers. Some solutions for this question have been proposed, and particular studies indicate that the diversity in decision-making or relationships promotes cooperation. In this research, we achieve the diversity by utilizing the novel method that refers to the mechanism of correction regarding each probability that every strategy comes to the representative by decision-making of group. This mechanism works when difference between the probability of the first and others becomes quite large. If once every group adopts this corrected decision, he/she achieves mutual cooperation of high level in the sequential prisoner's dilemma game in case the number of strategies (= players) is within the definite range. We also note that this game can effectively describe the property of evolution of strategy only with a small number of players. When each group has many players, in contrast to previous research, the decision with correction also has an effect on the suppression of prevalence of defection. In addition, we also show that the decision of this model is analogous to the system of redistribution of revenue, which provides balance of strength between several teams in professional sports.",

It addresses the problem of efficiently providing globally synchronous time epochs in complex, dynamic Peer-to-Peer network topologies. Rather than the usual model of continuously coupled nodes, a discretized version with sporadic message-based couplings to nearest neighbors is considered. This article empirically studies the emergence of coherent oscillator states for different network topologies, coupling functions, and sporadic coupling intensities. It further investigates the protocol's minimum bandwidth requirements in small-world network topologies. Synchronization resilience under the effect of random perturbations is studied for two coupling variations. Finally, the potential utilization of the scheme for a local inference of global network topology characteristics is discussed.",

Some influencing factors, such as supporting stiffness, positions error of sun or carrier, and external input load are analyzed on the dynamical load sharing of the planetary gear system with multi-floating components. The results demonstrate that the load sharing condition of the system is best when both the sun gear and planet gears are multi-floating at the same time.

AR renders intuitive computer-generated contents directly on a user’s surroundings. Integrating FEA with AR helps users through enhancing their perception and interaction with the engineering problems. Correct and effective visualization of these data using an AR platform can reduce the misinterpretation in spatial and logical aspects. Over the past decade, AR has undergone a transition from desktop to phablet computing. Mobile platforms enable user exploration of FEA results in situ. The client side uses a hybrid method to visualize FEA results in the mobile AR environment. In addition, a user can collaborate with other users by using the result sharing function. A prototype with basic functions has been built and a case study has been implemented to demonstrate the visualization method and evaluate the overall performance.",

This paper presents a cloud-based experimental platform for NICS to test new technologies and security threats. A cloud platform is used to emulate network devices and Simulink is used to simulate the physical layer. To build this testbed, we modify the cloud platform and add three modules to the testbed. One module is used so that the cloud platform can connect to real devices. By using this module, real devices can be added to the networks in the cloud platform. The second module is used for network connection configurations in the testbed. By using this module, the bandwidth, delay and packet loss rate for networks in the testbed can all be set. The third module is used to connect the Simulink to the testbed. The main features of the proposed platform are high flexibility, high authenticity, and low cost. Advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks are a common threat for NICS nowadays. In order to prove the feasibility of the proposed testbed, a common NICS is established and an APT attack is executed on it.",

Although in many situations, it would be very important for the 3D structures of the visualized transparent images to be perceived as they are simulated, little is known quantitatively as to how such transparent 3D structures are perceived. To address this question, in the present study, we conducted a psychophysical experiment in which the observers reported the perceived depth magnitude of a transparent object in medical images, presented with a multi-view 3D display. For the visualization, we employed a stochastic point-based rendering (SPBR) method, which was developed recently as a technique for efficient transparent-rendering. Perceived depth of the transparent object was smaller than the simulated depth. We found, however, that such depth underestimation can be alleviated to some extent by (1) applying luminance gradient inherent in the SPBR method, (2) employing high opacities, and (3) introducing binocular disparity and motion parallax produced by a multi-view 3D display.",

The paper is written in a way that it enables any researcher to reach the cutting edge knowledge of the design principles of cellular automata (CA) models of the observed phenomena in any scientific field. The whole sequence of design steps is demonstrated: definition of the model using topology and local (transition) rule of a cellular automaton, achieved results, comparison to real experiments, calibration, pathological observations, flow diagrams, software, and discussions. Additionally, the whole paper demonstrates the extreme expressiveness and flexibility of massively parallel computational approaches compared to other computational approaches. The paper consists of the introductory parts that are explaining CSs, self-organization and emergence, entropy, and CA. This allows readers to realize that there is a large variability in definitions and solutions of this class of models.",

Accordingly, the required energy cost of control is a fundamental and significant problem. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study the controllability of complex networks from the energy perspective. First, by combining theoretical derivation and numerical simulations, we obtain lower bounds of the maximal and minimal energy costs for an arbitrary normal network, which are related to the eigenvalues of the state transition matrix. Second, we deduce that controlling unstable normal networks is easier than controlling stable normal networks with the same size. Third, we demonstrate a tradeoff between the control energy and the average degree (or the maximum degree) of an arbitrary undirected network. Fourth, numerical simulations show that the energy cost is negatively correlated with the degree of nodes. Moreover, the combinations of control nodes with the greater sum of degree need less energy to implement complete control. Finally, we propose a multi-objective optimization model to obtain the control strategy, which not only ensures the fewer control nodes but also guarantees the less energy cost of control.",

Finally, a recent characterization of the triangular cliques has been considered in order to describe the intimate structure of the network.

It is shown, in particular, that, even if all interfaces are regular, the class of ill-posed problems can be very large in the presence of general square-integrable impressed sources. However, when a simple and realistic constraint is enforced on these sources, requiring that the support of the sources does not include any interface between a traditional medium and a metamaterial, among the problems here considered just those involving an interface between complementary materials remain ill-posed. These considerations have a very significant impact also on the approximability of the solution of well-posed problems since the numerical noise can introduce small fictitious sources even where the sources to be simulated are not present. These effects on finite element simulators are fully analyzed. Finally, we propose an algorithm that allows to obtain much better approximations of the solutions of the most critical well-posed problems.",

As a simple proxy for hierarchical social structures, we introduce a two-step decision making process in which in the second step groups of like-minded individuals are replaced by representatives once they have reached local consensus, and the representatives in turn form a collective decision in a downstream process. We find that the introduction of such a hierarchical decision making structure can improve consensus formation, in the sense that the eventual collective opinion is closer to the true average of individual opinions than without it. In particular, we numerically study how the size of groups of like-minded individuals being represented by delegate individuals affects the impact of the bias on the final population-wide consensus.

We derive predictions on the occurrence of the possible convention structures and test our theoretical findings in a computerized experiment. The experimental results indicate that the egalitarian conventions indeed emerge and persist and that the alternating conventions are much more likely than the stationary ones.

    "abstract": "Trust models play an important role in computational environments. One of the main aims of the work undertaken in this domain is to provide a model that can better describe the socio-technical nature of computational trust. It has been recently shown that quantum-like formulations in the field of human decision making can better explain the underlying nature of these types of processes. Based on this research, the aim of this paper is to propose a novel model of trust based on quantum probabilities as the underlying mathematics of quantum theory. It will be shown that by using this new mathematical framework, we will have a powerful mechanism to model the contextuality property of trust. Also, it is hypothesized that many events or evaluations in the context of trust can be and should be considered as incompatible, which is unique to the noncommutative structure of quantum probabilities. The main contribution of this paper will be that, by using the quantum Bayesian inference mechanism for belief updating in the framework of quantum theory, we propose a biased trust inference mechanism. This mechanism allows us to model the negative and positive biases that a trustor may subjectively feel toward a certain trustee candidate. It is shown that by using this bias, we can model and describe the exploration versus exploitation problem in the context of trust decision making, recency effects for recently good or bad transactions, filtering pessimistic and optimistic recommendations that may result in good-mouthing or bad-mouthing attacks, the attitude of the trustor toward risk and uncertainty in different situations and the pseudo-transitivity property of trust. Finally, we have conducted several experimental evaluations in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in different scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we have considered the multi-dimensional space fractional diffusion equations with variable coefficients. The fractional operators (derivative/integral) are used based on the Caputo definition. This study provides an analytical approach to determine the analytical solution of the considered problems with the help of the two-step Adomian decomposition method (TSADM). Moreover, new results have been obtained for the existence and uniqueness of a solution by using the Banach contraction principle and a fixed point theorem. We have extended the dimension of the space fractional diffusion equations with variable coefficients into multi-dimensions. Finally, the generalized problems with two different types of the forcing term have been included demonstrating the applicability and high efficiency of the TSADM in comparison to other existing numerical methods. The diffusion coefficients do not require to satisfy any certain conditions/restrictions for using the TSADM. There are no restrictions imposed on the problems for diffusion coefficients, and a similar procedures of the TSADM has followed to the obtained analytical solution for the multi-dimensional space fractional diffusion equations with variable coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Object detection is the most fundamental but challenging issues in the field of computer vision. Object detection identifies the presence of various individual objects in an image. Great success is attained for object detection/recognition problems in the controlled environment, but still, the problem remains unsolved in the uncontrolled places, particularly, when the objects are placed in arbitrary poses in an occluded and cluttered environment. In the last few years, a lots of efforts are made by researchers to resolve this issue, because of its wide range of applications in computer vision tasks, like content-enabled image retrieval, event or activity recognition, scene understanding, and so on. This review provides a detailed survey of 50 research papers presenting the object detection techniques, like machine learning-based techniques, gradient-based techniques, Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Fast R-CNN) detector, and the foreground-based techniques. Here, the machine learning-based approaches are classified into deep learning-based approaches, random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and so on. Moreover, the challenges faced by the existing techniques are explained in the gaps and issues section. The analysis based on the classification, toolset, datasets utilized, published year, and the performance metrics are discussed. The future dimension of the research is based on the gaps and issues identified from the existing research works.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of computer vision techniques has brought new opportunities for manufacturing industries, accelerating the intelligence of manufacturing systems in terms of product quality assurance, automatic assembly, and industrial robot control. In the electronics manufacturing industry, intensive variability in component shapes and colors, background brightness, and visual contrast between components and background results in difficulties in printed circuit board image classification. In this paper, we apply computer vision techniques to detect diverse electronic components from their background images, which is a challenging problem in electronics manufacturing industries because there are multiple types of components mounted on the same printed circuit board. Specifically, a 13-layer convolutional neural network (ECON) is proposed to detect electronic components either of a single category or of diverse categories. The proposed network consists of five Convolution-MaxPooling blocks, followed by a flattened layer and two fully connected layers. An electronic component image dataset from a real manufacturing company is applied to compare the performance between ECON, Xception, VGG16, and VGG19. In this dataset, there are 11 categories of components as well as their background images. Results show that ECON has higher accuracy in both single-category and diverse component classification than the other networks.",

The SES network is subject to dynamics of spread of a global reform through a knock-on effect, as a direct and indirect repercussion of a small-scale reform process that spreads out over time through network connectivity. The model outcomes reveal that high probability of reform completion on an SES layer through nodes previously reformed on other SES layers is necessary and sufficient to propagate the desired reform on that layer. The maximum asymptotic density of reformed nodes can only be achieved in the absence of risk of reform abrogation. When the risk is significant, it prevents the equilibrium density from reaching a steady state. The numerical simulation results show that the combination of likely probability of reform completion and of proportional influence of all layers yields the maximum magnitude of efficiency of the knock-on effect. We provide a formal argument that favors assigning equal weight to all aspects of sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "Planetary gear trains are widely applied in various transmission units. Whether strengths of all gears are accurately calculated or not can affect reliability of the entire system significantly. Strength calculation method for planetary gear trains usually follows the method for cylindrical gears, in which the worst meshing positions for both contact stress and bending stress cannot be determined precisely, and calculation results tend to be conservative. To overcome these shortcomings, a kinematics analysis for a planetary gear train is firstly performed, in which the influence of relative speed is investigated. Then the finite element strength analysis of a planetary gear train based on its transient meshing properties is carried out in ANSYS. Time–history curves of contact and bending stresses of sun gear, planetary gears and ring gear are respectively obtained. Also the accurate moment and its corresponding position of the maximum stress are precisely determined. Finally, calculation results of finite element method (FEM) and traditional method are compared in order to verify the effectiveness. Simulation and comparison show the stability of the proposed method in this paper. Researches in this paper establish the foundations for fatigue analysis and optimization for a planetary gear train.",

    "abstract": "Milk is considered to be one of the most perfect natural foods for human beings. The analysis of effective components and determination of important components in milk is an important practical work. Based on the previous measurement data of fat volume concentration and refractive index of milk in the market, this paper forms a fitting formula through mathematical fitting, which can solve the corresponding relationship between nonmeasurement points of milk concentration and refractive index. Because the actual measurement points are limited, its practical application is not convenient. However, fitting formulas can calculate the corresponding values of infinitely many points, which can be easily applied. However, judging from the goodness of fit of the fitting formula, a theoretically good fitting formula may produce underfitting and overfitting in practical application. Through the analysis of the first-order to sixth-order fitting formulas of milk concentration and refractive index, this paper tells us that the fitting formula with high goodness of fit is not necessarily a good formula. The specific problems should be analyzed in the application process to make the theory more consistent with the actual situation. From the calculation and analysis in this paper, it can be seen that the fitted sixth-order formula has the best effect when the fat volume concentration of milk is 0–10%. When considering a fat volume concentration of 0–34% in milk, the fitted second-order formula performs better.",

    "abstract": "Protecting healthcare data privacy and security is crucial in advanced manufacturing, which involves medical devices. It encompasses patient records and clinical trial data. Federated learning emerges as a solution that enables model training across different institutions without compromising data privacy and security. However, existing frameworks often exhibit a bias towards clients with larger data volumes, neglecting the connection between global and local model performance. This can result in suboptimal aggregation of the global model, thereby affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of the overall process. To address these limitations, we propose a performance evaluation-driven federated learning framework (PedFed). The primary objective of PedFed is to enhance global model aggregation and improve communication efficiency. Our approach involves a client selection strategy based on performance evaluation of local and global models. Specifically, we introduce the concept of local model improvement (LMI) using Intersection over Union (IoU) for client selection in medical image segmentation scenarios. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic aggregation framework incorporating validation IoU as a weighting factor to mitigate model divergence caused by not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We focus on performing image segmentation tasks to simulate the analysis of sensitive data in the healthcare domain. Experimental results conducted on brain tumor and heart segmentation datasets demonstrate the superiority of the PedFed framework over the baseline framework, confirming its benefits in communication efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems composed of a large number of loosely coupled entities, with no central coordination offer a number of attractive properties like scalability, robustness or massively distributed computation. However, designing such complex systems presents some challenging issues that are difficult to tackle with traditional top-down engineering methodologies. Coevolutionary learning, which involves the embedding of adaptive learning agents in a fitness environment that dynamically responds to their progress, is proposed as a paradigm to explore a space of complex system designs. It is argued that coevolution offers a flexible framework for the implementation of search heuristics that can efficiently exploit some of the structural properties exhibited by such state spaces. However, several drawbacks have to be overcome in order for coevolutionary learning to achieve continuous progress in the long term. This paper presents some of those problems and introduces a new strategy based on the concept of an \"ideal\" trainer to address them. This presentation is illustrated with a case study: the discovery of cellular automata rules to implement a classification task. The application of the \"ideal\" trainer paradigm to that problem resulted in a significant improvement over previously known best rules for this task.",

    "abstract": "The problem of outlier and change-point identification has received considerable attention in traditional linear regression models from both, classical and Bayesian standpoints. In contrast, for the case of regression models with measurement errors, also known as error-in-variables models, the corresponding literature is scarce and largely focused on classical solutions for the normal case. The main object of this paper is to propose clustering algorithms for outlier detection and change-point identification in scale mixture of error-in-variables models. We propose an approach based on product partition models (PPMs) which allows one to study clustering for the models under consideration. This includes the change-point problem and outlier detection as special cases. The outlier identification problem is approached by adapting the algorithms developed by Quintana and Iglesias [32] for simple linear regression models. A special algorithm is developed for the change-point problem which can be applied in a more general setup. The methods are illustrated with two applications: (i) outlier identification in a problem involving the relationship between two methods for measuring serum kanamycin in blood samples from babies, and (ii) change-point identification in the relationship between the monthly dollar volume of sales on the Boston Stock Exchange and the combined monthly dollar volumes for the New York and American Stock Exchanges.",

Although these maps are specially selected examples of one-dimensional ones, the conclusions can also be applied to any other one-dimensional map. Since the metric characteristics of a bifurcation diagram of a unimodal map, such as the referred percentage of order, are dependent on the order of the maximum, this dependence is verified for several maps. Once the chaotic zone can be separated into regions between the sequential band mergings, the percentage of order corresponding to each region is calculated for the logistic map.

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to develop a new fuzzy linear programming technique for solving multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems with incomplete weight preference information under fuzzy environments. In this methodology, linguistic variables are used to capture fuzziness in decision information and decision-making processes by means of a fuzzy decision matrix. Consistency and inconsistency indices are defined on the basis of preference relations between alternatives given by the decision maker under uncertain environments. Each alternative is assessed on the basis of its distance to a fuzzy ideal solution (FIS) which is unknown a priori. Then the FIS and the weights of attributes are estimated using a new linear programming model based upon the consistency and inconsistency indices defined. The fuzzy distance of each alternative to the FIS can be calculated to determine the ranking order of all alternatives. An extended illustrative example on the selection of air-fighters is presented to demonstrate the implementation process of this methodology. The methodology proposed in this paper can deal with MADM problems under not only fuzzy environments but also crisp environments. Also it has been proven that different weight information structures may result in different final decision results.",

It was found that for both model variants altruistic behavior was selected when certain cost/benefit constraints were met. Specifically, ResourceWorld selects for altruism only when the collective benefit of an action is at least as high as the individual cost. This gives a minimal method for realizing so-called \"social rationality,\" where nodes select behaviors for the good of the collective even though actions are based on individual greedy utility maximization.

The method of chaotic graph theory is adopted for this purpose. Chaotic graphs of pressure levels and CAPE are formed for thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm days. Ranks of the adjacency matrices constituted with the union of chaotic graphs of pressure levels and CAPE are computed for thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm days. The results reveal that the rank of the adjacency matrix is maximum for non-thunderstorm days and a column with all zeros occurs very quickly on severe thunderstorms days. This indicates that CAPE loses connectivity with pressure levels very early on severe thunderstorm days, showing that for the genesis of severe thunderstorms over Kolkata short, and therefore broad, CAPE is preferred.",

    "abstract": "In large cooperative multiagent systems, coordinating the actions of the agents is critical to the overall system achieving its intended goal. Even when the agents aim to cooperate, ensuring that the agent actions lead to good system level behavior becomes increasingly difficult as systems become larger. One of the fundamental difficulties in such multiagent systems is the slow learning process where an agent not only needs to learn how to behave in a complex environment, but also needs to account for the actions of other learning agents. In this paper, we present a multiagent learning approach that significantly improves the learning speed in multiagent systems by allowing an agent to update its estimate of the rewards (e.g. value function in reinforcement learning) for all its available actions, not just the action that was taken. This approach is based on an agent estimating the counterfactual reward it would have received had it taken a particular action. Our results show that the rewards on such \"actions not taken\" are beneficial early in training, particularly when only particular \"key\" actions are used. We then present results where agent teams are leveraged to estimate those rewards. Finally, we show that the improved learning speed is critical in dynamic environments where fast learning is critical to tracking the underlying processes.",

The key difficulty to overcome in such systems is one of credit assignment: How to apportion credit (or blame) to a particular agent based on the performance of the entire system. In this paper, we show how this problem can be solved in general for a large class of reward functions whose analytical form may be unknown (hence \"black box\" reward). This method combines the salient features of global solutions (e.g. \"team games\") which are broadly applicable but provide poor solutions in large problems with those of local solutions (e.g. \"difference rewards\") which learn quickly, but can be computationally burdensome. We introduce two estimates for local rewards for a class of problems where the mapping from the agent actions to system reward functions can be decomposed into a linear combination of nonlinear functions of the agents' actions. We test our method's performance on a distributed marketing problem and an air traffic flow management problem and show a 44% performance improvement over team games and a speedup of order n for difference rewards (for an n agent system).",

As the demand for the cloud computing increases, vulnerabilities in the service provision also increase. EDoS is one of the attacks that take over the provider, financially affecting the various organizations which use the cloud data. This paper utilizes fuzzy entropy and lion neural learner (FLNL) for the classification of cloud users to mitigate EDoS attacks in the cloud. This technique includes a training phase, which creates a log file using various parameters and then transforms the features into database considering certain key features. There are two important stages in this classification approach: feature selection and classification. Here, the fuzzy entropy function is utilized for feature selection which effectively selects useful features without information loss. The classification is performed using lion neural learner (LNL) which incorporates Lion algorithm (LA) into the neural network and uses Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm. The experimental results finalize that the proposed FLNL is effective with 89% precision, 78% recall, and 83.13% of f-measure compared with the existing Naïve Bayes (NB), Neural [Formula: see text] Propagation [Formula: see text], and Neural [Formula: see text]–Marquardt [Formula: see text].",

    "abstract": "In Schelling’s segregation model, agents of two ethnic groups reside in a regular grid and aim to live in a neighborhood that matches the minimum desired fraction of members of the same ethnicity. The model shows that observed segregation can emerge from people interacting under spatial constraints following homophily preferences. Even mild preferences can generate high degrees of segregation at the macro level. In modern, ethnically diverse societies, people might not define similarity based on ethnicity. Instead, shared tolerance towards ethnic diversity might play a more significant role, impacting segregation and integration in societies. With this consideration, we extend Schelling’s model by dividing the population of agents into value-oriented and ethnicity-oriented agents. Using parameter sweeping, we explore the consequences that the mutual adaptation of these two types of agents has on ethnic segregation, value segregation, and population density in the neighborhood. We examine for equally sized ethnic groups and for majority–minority conditions. The introduction of value-oriented agents reduces total ethnic segregation compared to Schelling’s original model, but the new value segregation appears to be more pronounced than ethnic segregation. Due to spillover effects, stronger ethnic homophily preferences lead not only to greater ethnic segregation, but also to more value segregation. Stronger value-orientation of the tolerant agents similarly leads to increased ethnic segregation of the ethnicity-oriented agents. Also, value-oriented agents tend to live in neighborhoods with more agents than ethnicity-oriented agents. In majority–minority settings, such effects appear to be more drastic for the minority than the majority ethnicity.",

Avoidance of traffic congestion, system utility maximization and enhancement of network capacity are prominent issues. Network capacity may be improved either by optimizing network topology or enhancing in routing approach. In this context, we propose and design a model of the time-varying data communication networks (TVCN) based on the dynamics of inflowing links. Traffic congestion can be avoided by using a suitable centrality measure, especially betweenness and Eigen vector centralities. If the nodes coming in user’s route are most betweenness central, then that route will be highly congested. Eigen vector centrality is used to find the influence of a node on others. If a node is most influential, then it will be highly congested and considered as least reputed. For that reason, routes are chosen such that the sum of the centralities of the nodes coming in user’s route should be minimum. Furthermore, Kelly’s optimization formulation for a rate allocation problem is used for obtaining optimal rates of distinct users at different time instants and it is found that the user’s path with lowest betweenness centrality and highest reputation will always give maximum rate at the stable point.",

Here we present a framework for tracing the cycle of prosperity-and-decline of a product to find insights into influential and potent factors that determine its success. As a rapid, high-throughput indicator of the preference of the public, popularity charts have emerged as a useful information source for finding the market performance patterns of products over time, which we call the on-chart life trajectories that show how the products enter the chart, fare inside it, and eventually exit from it. We propose quantitative parameters to characterise a life trajectory, and analyse a large-scale data set of nearly $7\\,000$ songs from Gaon Chart, a major weekly Korean Pop (K-Pop) chart that cover a span of six years. We find that a significant role is played by non-musical extrinsic factors such as the established fan base of the artist and the might of production companies in the on-chart success of songs, strongly indicative of the commodified nature of modern cultural products. We also review a possible mathematical model of this phenomenon, and discuss several nontrivial yet intriguing trajectories that we call the \"Late Bloomers\" and the \"Re-entrants\" that appears to be strongly driven by serendipitous exposure on mass media and the changes of seasons.",

The problem statement is ever evolving, with the aim of developing more flexible and realistic modeling procedures. For example, a first step in developing a more informative model is the inclusion of weighted interactions. In addition to the standard community structure problem, interest has increased in the detection of overlapping communities. Adopting such constraints may, in some cases, represent a more true to life abstraction of the system under study. In this paper, two novel mathematical programming algorithms for module detection are presented. First, disjoint modules in weighted and unweighted networks are detected by formulating modularity maximization as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. The solution obtained is then used to detect overlapping modules through a further MINLP model. The inclusion of two parameters controlling the extent of overlapping offers flexibility in user requirements. Comparative results show that these methodologies perform competitively to previously proposed methods. The methodologies proposed here promote the detection of topological relationships in complex systems. Together with the amenable nature of mathematical programming models, we show that both algorithms offer a versatile solution to the community detection problem.",

We vary the key parameters that define bank activities in the interbank market — including the size of interbank exposures, the size of liquid assets, the heterogeneity of the size of credit lending and the heterogeneity of banks — and analyze the impact of these parameters on contagion risk. First, we find that the size of interbank exposures is the main factor in determining the effect of contagion risk, that increases in the size of interbank exposures may lead to an increase in the threat of contagion risk, that after the size of interbank exposures rises beyond a threshold, the effect of contagion risk in small-world networks is the most significant, followed by that in tiered, random and scale-free networks, respectively. Second, increases in the size of liquid assets can decrease the effect of contagion risk. Third, the impact of the heterogeneity of the size of credit lending on contagion risk varies with interbank network structures. Finally, the effect of contagion risk among heterogeneous banks is stronger than that among homogeneous banks, and there is a positive relationship between the effect of contagion risk and the heterogeneity of banks.",

We explain this by calibrating a modified standard model of neutral cultural evolution to the record of first name popularities for the United States as a whole since 1900 and across the individual states over the last 50 years. We obtain estimates of both the temporal and spatial diversity of the speed of cultural evolution during the 20th century and early 21st century. We find that the speed of innovation of popular baby names accelerated substantially since the end of the 20th century. We suggest that the increased inventiveness has driven a drift process that increased the geographic diversity across the United States.",

It has recently taken flight and combines over a hundred interlinked data sources with more than 15 billion edges. A consequence of this recent success is that a paradigm shift has taken place: up to now the Web of Data could be studied, searched and maintained like a classical database; nowadays it has turned into a Complex System and needs to be studied as such. In this paper, we introduce the Web of Data as a challenging object of study and provide initial results on two network scales: the pure data-layer, and the global connection between groups data items. In this analysis, we show that the \"official\" abstract representation of the WoD does not fit the real distribution we derive from the lower scale. As interesting as these results are, bigger challenges for analysis await in the form of the highly dynamic character of the WoD, and the typed, and implicit, character of the edges which is, to the best of our knowledge, hitherto unstudied.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a connectionist Agent-Based Model (cABM) that incorporates detailed, micro-level understanding of social influence processes derived from laboratory studies and that aims to contextualize these processes in such a way that it becomes possible to model multidirectional, dynamic influences in extended social networks. At the micro-level, agent processes are simulated by recurrent auto-associative networks, an architecture that has a proven ability to simulate a variety of individual psychological and memory processes [D. Van Rooy, F. Van Overwalle, T. Vanhoomissen, C. Labiouse and R. French, Psychol. Rev. 110, 536 (2003)]. At the macro-level, these individual networks are combined into a \"community of networks\" so that they can exchange their individual information with each other by transmitting information on the same concepts from one net to another. This essentially creates a network structure that reflects a social system in which (a collection of) nodes represent individual agents and the links between agents the mutual social influences that connect them [B. Hazlehurst, and E. Hutchins, Lang. Cogn. Process. 13, 373 (1998)]. The network structure itself is dynamic and shaped by the interactions between the individual agents through simple processes of social adaptation. Through simulations, the cABM generates a number of novel predictions that broadly address three main issues: (1) the consequences of the interaction between multiple sources and targets of social influence (2) the dynamic development of social influence over time and (3) collective and individual opinion trajectories over time. Some of the predictions regarding individual level processes have been tested and confirmed in laboratory experiments. In a extensive research program, data is currently being collected from real groups that will allow validating the predictions of cABM regarding aggregate outcomes.",

Each of the algorithms draws inspiration from biologic bee foraging/nest-site selection behavior. The main focus will be on the third algorithm, namely STIGMERGIC LANDMARK FORAGING which is a novel hybrid approach. It combines the high performance of bee-inspired navigation with ant-inspired recruitment. More precisely, navigation is based on Path Integration which results in vectors indicating the distance and direction to a destination. Recruitment only occurs at key locations (i.e., landmarks) inside of the environment. Each landmark contains a collection of vectors with which visiting agents can find their way to a certain goal or to another landmark in an unknown environment. Each vector represents a local segment of a global route. In contrast to ant-inspired recruitment, no attracting or repelling pheromone is used to indicate where to go and how worthwhile a route is in comparison to other routes. Instead, each vector in a landmark has a certain strength indicating how worthwhile it is. In analogy to ant-inspired recruitment, vector strength can be reinforced by visiting agents. Moreover, vector strength decays over time. In the end, this results in optimal routes to destinations. STIGMERGIC LANDMARK FORAGING proves to be very efficient in terms of building and adapting solutions.",

The study uses an agent-based simulation and, in particular, controls for different levels of intra-organizational complexity and modes of coordination, i.e., the way how preferences on the departmental site are aligned with each other in respect to the overall organizational objective. The results indicate that for different levels of intra-organizational complexity different incentive systems emerge: With lower intra-organizational complexity, in tendency, the less focus is put on firm performance and vice versa. However, results also suggest that the mode of coordination may considerably affect the emergence of the incentive structure. This provides support for the idea that multiple management controls, like the incentive system and the mode of coordination, should be regarded and designed as a system with interrelations among its components and not just as a collection of several control practices.",

The results show that the network equilibrium depends on the influence of leader nodes, while the network connectivity depends on the cohesiveness among followers.

The standard Vicsek model (SVM) — a minimal model for swarming systems of self-propelled particles — describes a large population of agents reaching global alignment without the need of central control. Yet, the emergence of order in this model takes time and is not robust to noise. In many real-world scenarios, we need a decentralized protocol to guide a swarming system (e.g., unmanned vehicles or nanorobots) to reach an ordered state in a prompt and noise-robust manner. Here, we find that introducing a simple adaptive rule based on the heading differences of neighboring particles in the Vicsek model can effectively speed up their global alignment, mitigate the disturbance of noise to alignment, and maintain a robust alignment under predation. This simple adaptive model of swarming systems could offer new insights in understanding the prompt and flexible formation of animals and help us design better protocols to achieve fast and robust alignment for multi-agent systems.",

At the same time, by analyzing the quality of simplified triangular mesh, optimizing triangular mesh locally, reducing the amount of narrow triangles, the quality of the simplified model is improved. The proposed algorithm was tested on Cow model, Car model and Bunny model, and compared with another three algorithms, one of them is a classical mesh simplification algorithm based on edge collapse, the other is an improved algorithm of the classical one.

In the first decade, fundamental characteristics of complex network structure, such as the small-worldness, scale-freeness, and modularity, of various complex networked systems were harvested from analyzing big empirical data. The associated dynamical processes on complex networks were also heavily studied. In the second decade, more attention was devoted to investigating the control of complex networked systems, ranging from fundamental theories to practical applications. Here we briefly review the recent progress regarding network dynamics and control, mainly concentrating on research questions proposed in the six papers we collected for this topical issue. This review closes with possible research directions along this line, and several important problems to be solved.

    "abstract": "In geotechnical engineering, modeling geo-structures is challenging, particularly in cases where the interaction between the structures and soil or rock is complex. Most well-known commercial modeling software is based on homogenous and isotropic materials. However, soil and rock are often modeled in heterogeneous and anisotropic media because of the inherent anisotropy of sedimentary rock masses and their stratified structure. In recent decades, coupled hydro-mechanical (HM) interactions in isotropic porous media have been studied; however, the behavior of transversely isotropic porous media is rarely considered. In addition, it is difficult for commercial software such as Plaxis and Flac3D to express complex rock formation where the anisotropy of the material and the associated cracks and fractures could be assembled into a single model. In this study, a finite element implementation using Differential Equation Analysis Library (DEAL.II), an open-source library of finite element codes, was developed to model the fully coupled HM behavior of transversely isotropic porous media. The proposed implementation can be applied to both isotropic and transversely isotropic porous media based on Biot’s theory. The developed code can be used to model poroelastic media with (1) equations of linear elasticity for the solid matrix and (2) diffusion equations for fluid flow based on mass and linear-momentum conservation laws. We verified the performance and accuracy of the code through two examples, i.e., Mandel’s problem with a compared analytical solution and a tunnel excavation process with the Flac3D software. On the basis of these numerical applications, we present the code to model the behavior of various geo-structures such as tunnels and pile–soil interactions with anisotropic materials.",

    "abstract": "The aging population is primarily affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder. There is a need for an automated efficient technique to diagnose Alzheimer’s in its early stage. Various techniques are used to diagnose AD. EEG and neuroimaging methodologies are widely used to highlight changes in the electrical activity of the brain signals that are helpful for early diagnosis. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major neurological disease that results in an average of 50,000 new clinical diagnoses worldwide every year. The voice features are majorly used as the main means to diagnose PD. The major symptoms of PD are loss of intensity, the monotony of loudness and pitch, reduction in stress, unidentified silences, and dysphonia. Even though various innovative models are proposed by explorers about Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s classification diseases, still there is a need for efficient learning methodologies and techniques. This paper provides a review on using machine learning (ML) together with several feature extraction techniques that is helpful in the early detection of AD with Parkinson’s. The novelty and objective of this study are that the CAD technique is used to improve the accuracy of early diagnosis of AD. The proposed technique depends on the nonlinear process for data dimension reduction, feature removal, and classification using kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The dimension of the input space is radically diminished with kernel methods. As the learning set is labeled, it creates sense to utilize this information to make a dependable method of dropping the input space dimension. The different techniques of ML are explained under the major approaches viz. SVM, artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning (DL), and ensemble methods. A comprehensive assessment is presented at SVM, ANN, and DL approaches for better detection of Alzheimer’s with PD highlighting future insights.",

We discuss to what extent an established model for firm growth can be applied to the dynamics of OSS projects. Our analysis is based on a large-scale data set from SourceForge (SF) consisting of monthly data for 10 years, for up to 360'000 OSS projects and up to 340'000 developers. Over this time period, we find an exponential growth both in the number of projects and developers, with a remarkable increase of single-developer projects after 2009. We analyze the monthly entry and exit rates for both projects and developers, the growth rate of established projects and the monthly project size distribution. To derive a prediction for the latter, we use modeling assumptions of how newly entering developers choose to either found a new project or to join existing ones. Our model applies only to collaborative projects that are deemed to grow in size by attracting new developers. We verify, by a thorough statistical analysis, that the Yule-Simon distribution is a valid candidate for the size distribution of collaborative projects except for certain time periods where the modeling assumptions no longer hold. We detect and empirically test the reason for this limitation, i.e., the fact that an increasing number of established developers found additional new projects after 2009.",

We view the dual-channel supply chain as a nonlinear system that consists of co-competition, learning decision and dynamic game between direct channels and retail channels. Then, we develop learning dynamics and evolutionary game model to analyze the channels’ altruism behavior and the factors that influence trust input. We find that the evolutionary direction of altruistic behavior is determined by the sensitiveness and the learning abilities of both members of supply chains. The trust input decision of both channels is highly related to the output ratio of high-level trust input, only if the input–output ratio is ideal for both game parties, the system may come to an evolutionary stable equilibrium of high trust input. If the trust input of the two sides is unilateral, then one side chooses high trust input, while the other side chooses low trust input. In this case, even the input–output ratio is high, it will not be evolutionary stable. The profit both sides earned from the low-trust cooperation is the basic for further trust input, the increased free ride income, trust input risk and the trust evaluation cost will affect the enthusiasm of trust input for the dual-channel supply chain members. To promote high trust input in dual-channel supply chain, a certain amount of compensation should be negotiated in the contract in order to improve the performance of the supply chain.",

Botnets are refined and more dangerous in their functionality over the network model. Most of the prevailing models and flow- and rule-based models feel challenging to predict the bot functionalities in a preventive manner. Therefore, the modeling of efficient and automated botnet detection approaches is highly essential. This research concentrates on modeling a novel botnet detection approach based on the recursively analyzing the flow of features of the network nodes spatially and temporally where the attack samples are intra-dependent time-series data. The hierarchical structural design of the network helps to integrate various levels of feature information and learns the spatial and temporal information automatically among the adjacent network connection. This process is carried out by the proposed architectural model known as Recursively Learning Long Short-Term Memory over spatial and temporal ([Formula: see text]. Thus, the bot activities are detected by recursively analyzing the limited number of nodes. The [Formula: see text] model is modeled to improve the efficiency of the network by eliminating unnecessary activities. The proposed model is validated using the online accessible CTU-13 dataset and benchmarked against the prevailing classification approaches for botnet detection. The simulation is done in a MATLAB environment, and the outcomes work efficiently and evaluated with prevailing models to project the significance of the [Formula: see text] model.",

Smart factories/workshops/production lines are important carriers for realizing intelligent manufacturing. However, there are difficulties in smart factories in processing multi-source heterogeneous data, in integrating virtual and physical worlds, and in achieving continuous and iterative optimization with real-time feedback. Digital twin, which is able to deeply integrate physical and virtual worlds, provides an important technology for easing the difficulties mentioned above. The construction of a digital twin system can solve the problem of data fusion, analysis, processing, and applications in smart factory. Digital production lines are the foothold of a smart factory. Building a digital twin production line can facilitate rapid practice of digital twins and promote the development of intelligent manufacturing. To this end, this paper proposes a development framework for a digital twin production line with closed-loop control based on a mechatronics approach. The detailed development process is given based on the framework. The framework proposed may provide some inspiration and insights for design and development of digital twin production lines.",

    "abstract": "Defects are frequent in software systems, and they can cause a lot of issues for users. Despite the fact that many studies have been conducted on employing software product metrics to determine defect-prone modules, defect prediction techniques are still worth investigating. Hence, the aim of this work is to provide a unique Software Defect Prediction (SDP) approach that includes four steps like “(a) pre-processing, (b) feature extraction, (c) feature selection and (d) detection.” At first, the input data are given to the pre-processing step, as well as in the feature extraction step; the “statistical features, raw features, higher-order statistical features as well as proposed entropy features” are extracted from the pre-processed data. In addition, the retrieved features are sent into a feature selection step, wherein the appropriate features are selected utilizing a modified chi-square scheme. In the detection step, a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) classifiers are used to predict the defects. To provide a more accurate detection, the weights of both DBN and LSTM are optimally tuned via a Self Improved Social Ski-Driver Optimization (SISSDO) algorithm. This proposed SDP model is a beneficial practice for enhancing software quality and reliability. Moreover, the results of the adopted technique are assessed to traditional techniques on the basis of various measures. In particular, the accuracy of the suggested approach for dataset 3 is 5.80%, 6.52%, 5.07%, 7.97%, 5.80%, 9.42%, 9.42%, 10.15%, 2.17%, and 3.62% better than the extant HC[Formula: see text]+[Formula: see text]ALO, HC[Formula: see text]+[Formula: see text]SMO, HC[Formula: see text]+[Formula: see text]CMBO, HC[Formula: see text]+[Formula: see text]SSD, RNN, CNN, NN, Bi-LSTM, HC+SPFCNN, and HC[Formula: see text]+[Formula: see text]CWAR approaches, correspondingly.

We study the dependence of the growth rate distribution on firm size: depending on procedures, we find almost no dependence when the center of the distribution is considered or, similar to previous work, a power-law when the wings are weighted more strongly. Correlations in the growth of different firms are essentially random. We determine the annual growth of the entire economy, and successfully correlate it with a standard economic indicator of business cycles in Germany.

We also consider the synchronization time τ, which is the average number of measurements required to infer the phase of a periodic signal. We calculate T and τ for all periodic sequences up to and including period 23. We show which sequences of a given period have the maximum and minimum possible T and τ values, develop analytic expressions for the extreme values, and show that in these cases the transient information is the product of the total phase information and the synchronization time. Despite the latter result, our analyses demonstrate that the transient information and synchronization time capture different and complementary structural properties of individual periodic sequences — properties, moreover, that are distinct from source entropy rate and mutual information measures, such as the excess entropy.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with a special kind of complex systems which depend on an arbitrary (and usually large) number n of random Boolean variables. The so-called complex stochastic Boolean systems often appear in many different scientific, technical or social areas. Clearly, there are 2 n binary states associated to such a complex system. Each one of them is given by a binary string u = (u 1 ,…,u n ) ∈ {0, 1} n of n bits, which has a certain occurrence probability Pr {u}. The behavior of a complex stochastic Boolean system is determined by the current values of its 2 n binary n-tuple probabilities Pr {u} and by the ordering between pairs of them. Hence, the intrinsic order graph provides a useful representation of these systems by displaying (scaling) the 2 n binary n-tuples which are ordered in decreasing probability of occurrence. The intrinsic order reduces the complexity of the problem from exponential (2 n binary n-tuples) to linear (n Boolean variables). For any fixed binary n-tuple u, this paper presents a new, simple algorithm enabling rapid, elegant determination of all the binary n-tuples v with occurrence probabilities less than or equal to (greater than or equal to) Pr {u}. This algorithm is closely related to the lexicographic (truth-table) order in {0, 1} n , and this is illustrated through the connections (paths) in the intrinsic order graph.",

To answer these questions, we propose a harmonious unifying hybrid preferential model (HUHPM) to a certain class of complex networks, which is controlled by a hybrid ratio, d/r, and study their behavior both numerically and analytically. As typical examples, we apply the concepts and method of the HUHPM to un-weighted scale-free networks proposed by Barabasi and Albert (BA), weighted evolving networks proposed by Barras, Bartholomew and Vespignani (BBV), and the traffic driven evolution (TDE) networks proposed by Wang et al., to get the so-called HUHPM-BA, HUHPM-BBV and HUHPM-TDE networks. All the findings of topological properties in the above three typical HUHPM networks give certain universal meaningful results which reveal some essential hybrid mechanisms for the formation of nontrivial scale-free and small-world networks.",

In their empirical study, the authors analyze, how a network of human subjects acting as autonomous agents performs in solving a conflict-avoidance task (the graph coloring problem) for different network architectures. A surprising result was that the run-time of the empirical dynamics decreases with the number of shortcuts in a Watts–Strogatz small-world graph. In a simulation of the dynamics based on randomly selecting color conflicts for update, they observe a strong increase of the run-time with the number of shortcuts. Here, we propose classes of strategies, which are capable of explaining the decrease in run-time with an increasing number of shortcuts. We show that the agent's strategy, the graph topology, and the complexity of the problem (essentially given by the graph's chromatic number) interact nontrivially yielding unexpected insights into the problem-solving capacity of organizational structures.",

    "abstract": "We built a computational model of political party competition in order to gain insight into the effect of the decrease in the number of relevant political issues (dimensions), and the change of their relative importance, on the number of surviving political parties, their strategy performance, and the degree of political party fragmentation. Particularly, we find that when there is a dimensionality reduction (i.e., a change from a two-dimensional issue space to a one-dimensional one, or, a substantial decrement in one of the issue's relative importance with respect to the other), the number of political parties declines, as does the overall degree of party fragmentation in the system. Regarding party strategies, we observe that, after the dimensionality reduction, (i) the inert parties tend to improve their performance in terms of party numbers (i.e., more inert parties survive, relatively speaking); (ii) the population of large-size seekers declines, (iii) the few large-size seeker survivors, in general, cushion their increased mortality hazard with increased size (i.e., increased number of supporters); and, finally, (iv) the mortality hazard increases with distance to the mean voter spot.",

Recent studies demonstrate that social learning mechanisms, including conformist strategies, and heterogeneous adoption thresholds related to economic inequality and the decreasing cost of goods can generate these S-shaped cumulative frequency curves. The present study of a regional material culture sequence expands our inquiry concerning the underlying social forces that structure diffusion through both space and time. Using historic New England gravestones and their associated documents, this study considers both cultural transmission between stone carvers and consumer choices. Social learning among consumers can generate both wave-like diffusion patterns through space and lead to the persistence of cultural variants in certain locales.",

    "abstract": "Social conventions are useful self-sustaining protocols for groups to coordinate behavior without a centralized entity enforcing coordination. The emergence of such conventions in different multi agent network topologies has been investigated by several researchers, although exploring only specific cases of the convention emergence process. In this work we will provide multi-dimensional analysis of several factors that we believe determines the process of convention emergence, such as: the size of agents memory, the population size and structure, the learning approach taken by agents, the amount of players in the interactions, or the convention search space dimension. Although we will perform an exhaustive study of different network structures, we are concerned that different topologies will affect the emergence in different ways. Therefore, the main research question in this work is comparing and studying effects of different topologies on the emergence of social conventions. While others have investigated memory for learning algorithms, the effects of memory on the reward have not been investigated thoroughly. We propose a reward metric that is derived directly from the history of the interacting agents. Another research question to be answered is what effect does the history based reward function and the learning approach have on convergence time in different topologies. Experimental results show that all the factors analyzed affect differently the convention emergence process, being such information very useful for policy-makers when designing self-regulated systems.",

The model takes task demand and situational aspects as input and calculates internal factors related to human functioning, such as the experienced pressure, exhaustion, and motivation, and how they affect performance. Simulation experiments under different parameter settings pointed out that the model is able to produce realistic behavior of humans with different types of personalities. Moreover, by a mathematical analysis the equilibria of the model have been determined, and by automated checking a number of expected properties of the model have been confirmed. In addition to this \"internal\" validation of the model, an experiment has been designed for the purpose of external validation, addressing the estimation of aspects of the human process that are relevant for its practical application. Output from the experiment, like information about personality characteristics and performance quality, has been used to perform estimation of the parameters of the model. By the parameter estimation, a set of parameter values has been identified by which an adequate representation of a person's functional state when performing a task is achieved.",

This hypothesis states that the behavior of financial markets constantly changes and that the trading strategies in a market need to continuously co-evolve with it in order to remain effective. After formalizing the hypothesis, we suggest a testing methodology and run tests under 10 international financial markets. Our tests are based on a framework that we recently developed, which used Genetic Programming as a rule inference engine, and Self-Organizing Maps as a clustering machine for the above rules. However, an important assumption of that study was that maps among different periods were directly comparable with each other. In order to allow this to happen, we had to keep the same clusters throughout the different time periods of our experiments. Nevertheless, this assumption could be considered as strict or even unrealistic. In this paper, we relax this assumption. This makes our model more realistic. In addition, this allows us to investigate in depth the dynamics of market behavior and test for the plausibility of the Dinosaur Hypothesis. The results show that indeed markets' behavior constantly changes. As a consequence, strategies need to continuously co-evolve with the market; if they do not, they become obsolete or dinosaurs.",

Since the procedure of collecting data is iterative, an effective technique is necessary to obtain the data efficiently by reducing the consumption of nodal energy. Hence, a technique for data reduction in WSN is presented in this paper by proposing a prediction algorithm, called Hierarchical Fractional Bidirectional Least-Mean Square (HFBLMS) algorithm. The novel algorithm is designed by modifying Hierarchical Least-Mean Square (HLMS) algorithm with the inclusion of BLMS for bidirectional-based data prediction and Fractional Calculus (FC) in the weight update process. Data redundancy is achieved by transmitting only those data required based on the data predicted at the sensor node and the sink. Moreover, the proposed HFBLMS algorithm reduces the energy consumption in the network by the effective prediction attained by BLMS. Two metrics, such as energy consumption and prediction error, are used for the evaluation of performance of the HFBLMS prediction algorithm, where it can attain energy values of 0.3587 and 0.1953 at the maximum number of rounds and prediction errors of just 0.0213 and 0.0095, using air quality and localization datasets, respectively.",

Averaging over a collection of individual judgments proves a reliable strategy for aggregating information, particularly in diverse groups in which statistically independent beliefs fall on both sides of the truth and contradictory biases are cancelled out. Social influence, some have said, narrows variation in individual opinions and undermines this wisdom-of-crowds effect in continuous estimation tasks. Researchers, however, neglected to study social-influence effects on voting in discrete choice tasks. Using agent-based simulation, we show that under voting — the most widespread social decision rule — social influence contributes to information aggregation and thus strengthens collective judgment. Adding to our knowledge about complex systems comprised of adaptive agents, this finding has important ramifications for the design of collective decision-making in both public administration and private firms.",

A novel approach to modeling imitation is presented based on range-dependent processes that describe how firms consider proximity when imitating peers who are found in a given neighborhood in terms of productivity. Using a particularly tractable approach, we are able to analyze how drastically different economic growth scenarios emerge from different imitation strategies. These emerging scenarios range from diffusive growth where the variance of productivity grows indefinitely, to balanced growth described by a traveling wave with fixed variance. The latter scenario is sustained only when imitation strength among firms exceeds a critical bifurcation threshold.",

In the modern connected world, wireless sensor nodes are scattered around the environment. These nodes are powered by batteries. Batteries require regular replacement, hence energy harvesters providing continuous autonomous power are used to power these sensor nodes. This work provides two different fixation modes for the resonant frequency for the two modes. Variation in geometric parameter and their effect on resonant frequency and output power have been analyzed. These harvesters capture a wide-band of ambient vibrations and convert them into usable electrical energy. To capture random ambient vibrations, the harvester used is a wide-band energy harvester based on conventional seesaw mechanism. The proposed structure operates on first two resonant frequencies in comparison to the conventional cantilever system working on first resonant frequency. Resonance frequency, as well as response to a varying input vibration frequency, is carried out, showing better performance of seesaw cantilever design. In this work, modeling of wide-band energy harvester with proof mass is being performed. Position of proof mass plays a key role in determining the resonant frequency of the harvester. Placing the proof mass near or away from fixed end results in increase and decrease in stress on the piezoelectric layer. Hence, to avoid the breaking of cantilever, the position of proof mass has been analyzed.",

How to build a high-quality model is the first consideration in simulation. Fidelity and credibility are the two mostly used metrics to evaluate the quality of a model. However, the definitions and evaluation methods of fidelity and credibility vary from one research to another and it’s hard to evaluate the metrics precisely. More importantly, the evolution process of a model in use cannot be directly reflected by the two metrics. Therefore, this paper introduces the model maturity to track the status of a model during its life cycle, especially in the use and management phases, which will be an important supplement to the quality evaluation system of models. The concept of model maturity is given and a framework of index system for model maturity evaluation is established. Then, a hierarchical evaluation method based on qualitative and quantitative analysis (HEQQ) for model maturity is proposed. Finally, a case study is used to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this model, the onchocerciasis infected human individuals are divided into two classes of infected humans with high and low microfilarial output incorporating saturated treatment function, which caters for high saturation of onchocerciasis disease. We analyze the model feasible region and obtain the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] using the next generation matrix method. Also, we obtain the onchocerciasis-free and onchocerciasis endemic equilibrium solutions and show that if [Formula: see text] is less than unity, the onchocerciasis-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, we employed a Lyapunov function to analyze the global asymptotic stability of the onchocerciasis — endemic equilibrium whenever [Formula: see text] is greater than unity. In addition, data on mass drug distribution of ivermectin drug to combat onchocerciasis prevalence in Ekiti state of Nigeria were fitted to the model. Graphical results reveal that consistent annual or bi-annual distribution of ivermectin drug in the region is effective in reducing the disease menace. Further simulations also show that public health control measures are needed to minimize infectious contact between humans and blackflies which leads to onchocerciasis infections and visual blindness.",

The model incorporates the effect of transmission and treatment on the occurrence of new infections. For the model, the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] has been computed. Corresponding to the threshold quantity [Formula: see text], the stability of endemic and disease-free equilibrium (DFE) points are determined. For [Formula: see text], if the endemic equilibrium point exists, then it is locally asymptotically stable, whereas the DFE point is globally asymptotically stable for [Formula: see text] which implies the eradication of the disease. The effects of various parameters on the spread of COVID-19 are discussed in the segment of sensitivity analysis. The model is numerically simulated to understand the effect of reproduction number on the transmission dynamics of the disease COVID-19. From the numerical simulations, it is concluded that if the reproduction number for the coronavirus disease is reduced below unity by decreasing the transmission rate and detecting more number of infectives, then the epidemic can be eradicated from the population.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the major health emergencies in decades that affected almost every country in the world. As of June 30, 2020, it has caused an outbreak with more than 10 million confirmed infections, and more than 500,000 reported deaths globally. Due to the unavailability of an effective treatment (or vaccine) and insufficient evidence regarding the transmission mechanism of the epidemic, the world population is currently in a vulnerable position. The daily cases data sets of COVID-19 for profoundly affected countries represent a stochastic process comprised of deterministic and stochastic components. This study proposes an integrated deterministic–stochastic approach to forecast the long-term trajectories of the COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain. The deterministic component of the daily-cases univariate time series is assessed by an extended version of the SIR [Susceptible–Infected–Recovered–Protected–Isolated (SIRCX)] model, whereas its stochastic component is modeled using an autoregressive (AR) time series model. The proposed integrated SIRCX-AR (ISA) approach based on two operationally distinct modeling paradigms utilizes the superiority of both the deterministic SIRCX and stochastic AR models to find the long-term trajectories of the epidemic curves. Experimental analysis based on the proposed ISA model shows significant improvement in the long-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain in comparison to the ODE-based SIRCX model. The estimated Basic reproduction numbers for Italy and Spain based on SIRCX model are found to be [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. ISA model-based results reveal that the number of cases in Italy and Spain between 11 May, 2020–9 June, 2020 will be 10,982 (6383–15,582) and 13,731 (3395–29,013), respectively. Additionally, the expected number of daily cases on 9 July, 2020 for Italy and Spain is estimated to be 30 (0–183) and 92 (0–602), respectively.",

    "abstract": "It has become critical to develop explanatory models using partial differential equations (PDEs) for big data from interesting scientific phenomena, e.g., fluids, atmosphere, and cosmic phenomena. Big data are often measured at discrete spatiotemporal points. In this paper, we assume a PDE and consider a set of the PDE solution data at multiple discrete points as pseudo-measurement data. In a data-driven PDE derivation, it is assumed that the PDE is a linear regression model comprising partial temporal and spatial differential terms, where the coefficients are estimated using regression analysis techniques, and the PDE derivation accuracy is defined as the difference (i.e., error) between the exact and estimated coefficients. A spatiotemporal model is required to calculate the partial temporal and spatial differential terms; thus, we employ a spatiotemporal model based on a neural network (NN) obtained from big data. To develop the data-driven PDE derivation technique, we employ PDEs with exact solutions such that we can calculate the differential terms by differentiating them analytically at multiple discrete points. If we assume an activation function in the NN model, the partial differential term can be derived using a chain rule. The NN model accuracy is measured by the loss function and error between the exact and estimated partial differential terms. In addition, we clarify a requirement for an NN structure that can maximize the PDE derivation and NN model accuracy by varying the NN meta-parameters, i.e., the numbers of NN layers and neurons.",

We study the effect of traffic fluctuations and the transition to congested states for a stochastic dynamical model of traffic on a road network. The model simulates a finite population that moves from one road to another according to random transition probabilities. In such a way, we mimic the traffic fluctuations due to the granular feature of traffic and the dynamics at the crossing points. Then the amplitude of traffic flow fluctuations is proportional to the average flow as suggested by empirical observations. Assuming a parabolic shaped flow-density relation, there exists an unstable critical point for the road dynamics and the system can perform a phase transition to a congested state, where some roads reach their maximal capacity. We apply a statistical physics approach to study the onset congestion and we characterize analytically the relation between the fluctuations amplitude and the appearance of congested nodes. We verify the results by means of numerical simulations on a Manhattan-like road network. Moreover we point out the existence of oscillating regimes, where traffic oscillations back propagate on the road network, whose onset depend sensitively from the traffic fluctuations and that have a strong influence on the hysteresis cycles of the systems when the traffic load is modulated. The comparison between the numerical simulations and the empirical traffic data recorded by an inductive-loop traffic detector system (MTS system) on the county roads of the Emilia Romagna region in Italy is shortly discussed.",

In the present work, finite element modeling has been carried out considering randomly oriented multiple sparks during PMEDM. Transient thermal analysis is done to obtain temperature distribution, volume removal, and proportion of volume removed by melting and evaporation at different current, pulse on time and fraction of heat that enters to work piece. Gradually growing spark behavior and Gaussian distribution of heat source is used to simulate multiple craters. Temperature distribution along radial direction shows peak temperature at center of spark and thereafter a gradual decrease with increase in radial distance. Along depth direction temperature sharply decreases that forms wider craters with shallow depth in PMEDM. Peak temperature and volume removal increases with current more rapidly. Volume removal by melting is much higher than evaporation at lower current settings and with higher current almost equal amount of material is removed by melting and evaporation thus reducing the re-solidification of melted material. Current plays a significant role behind the contribution of material removal by evaporation followed by fraction of heat. Increase in pulse on duration increases the total volume of material removal however does not significantly increase the proportion of volume removal by vaporization.",

    "abstract": "We recently introduced the concept of dynamical score network to represent the harmonic progressions in any composition. Through a process of chord slicing, we obtain a representation of the score as a complex network, where every chord is a node and each progression (voice leading) links successive chords. In this paper, we use this representation to extract quantitative information about harmonic complexity from the analysis of the topology of these networks using state-of-the-art statistical mechanics techniques. Since complex networks support the communication of information by encoding the structure of allowed messages, we can quantify the information associated with locating specific addresses through the measure of the entropy of such network. In doing so, we then characterize properties of network topology, such as the degree distribution of a graph or the shortest paths between couples of nodes. Here, we report on two different evaluations of network entropy, diffusion entropy analysis (DEA) and the Kullback–Leibler divergence applied to the conditional degree matrix, and the measurements of complexity they provide, when applied to an extensive corpus of scores spanning 500 years of western classical music. Although the analysis is limited in scope, our results already provide quantitative evidence of an increase of such measures of harmonic complexity over the corpora we have analyzed.",

Within this framework, complexity is quantified by assuming to know the mental categories and the mental model by which a system is represented in the mind of its observer. It is argued that this subjectivist concept of complexity is not in contrast with objective measures of complexity introduced in particular domains, but generalizes complexity to domains where no objective measure is feasible. An extensive numerical example is presented and thoroughly discussed.",

We show that reciprocal cooperation, which is generally invoked to explain non-kin altruism, requires very restrictive conditions to be stable. Some of these conditions are not met in many cases of altruism observed in nature. In search of another explanation of non-kin altruism, we consider Zahavis's theory of prestige. We extend it to propose a \"political\" model of altruism. We give evidence showing that non-kin altruism can evolve in the context of inter-subgroup competition. Under such circumstances, altruistic behavior can be used by individuals to advertise their quality as efficient coalition members. In this model, only abilities which positively correlate with the subgroup success can evolve into altruistic behaviors.",

For face detection, we assume the face-appearance as blob-like, and that the face has an approximately elliptical shape. Accordingly, an ellipse-fitting algorithm is appropriate, which is based on statistical moments, and those blobs that have an elliptical shape are retained as face candidates.",

However, the role of physical interactions in the organization of traffic flows in ants under crowded conditions has only been studied very recently. The related results suggest new ways of congestion control and simple algorithms for optimal resource usage based on local interactions and, therefore, decentralized control concepts. Here, we present a mathematical analysis of such concepts for an experiment with two alternative ways with limited capacities between a food source and the nest of an ant colony. Moreover, we carry out microscopic computer simulations for generalized setups, in which ants have more alternatives or the alternative ways are of different lengths. In this way and by variation of interaction parameters, we can get a better idea of how powerful congestion control based on local repulsive interactions may be. Finally, we discuss potential applications of this design principle to routing in traffic or data networks and machine usage in supply systems.",

One of them, digital multiplication, has been intensively studied in recent years, where hitherto the evolutionary design of only specific small multipliers was achieved. The fact that this and other problems can be solved in full generality employing self-assembly sheds light on the evolutionary role of self-assembly in biology and is of relevance for the design of complex systems in nano- and bionanotechnology.",

Through wavelet decomposition we evaluate the price–output relationship at different time scales, where most countries reveal similar patterns. More precisely, at short time scales a positive correlation seems to appear whereas, and consequently, a regime switch occurs at a time horizon of about two years leading to a negative relationship for higher horizons. These results seem to suggest that the negative or acyclical relationship usually found after the 1960s may be the composite effect of different time scale correlations, where the four-year-horizon component seems to have the greatest influence. In particular for Canada, France, and Italy we observe something like a rotation of the price–output relationship between the countercyclical and the procyclical relationship. Finally, our analysis shows that even the relationship between the two series does not seem to be very stable regarding the lead and lag structure also. The phase is nonlinear for all the countries and, consequently, the group delay (the lag) is not constant. In particular, looking at the time scale we observe an inversion of the local monotonicity at the frequency of about 0.3–0.35 for all G7 countries.",

However, increasingly, the majority of Internet traffic reflects opportunistic rather than symbiotic social relations. Here we use email data drawn from a large university to construct directed graphs of email exchange that quantify the differences between social and opportunistic behavior, represented by legitimate messages and spam, respectively. We show that while structural characteristics typical of other social networks are shared to a large extent by the legitimate component, they are not characteristic of opportunistic traffic. To complement the graph analysis, which suffers from incomplete knowledge of users external to the domain, we study temporal patterns of communication to show dynamical properties of email traffic. The results indicate that social email traffic has lower entropy (higher structural information) than opportunistic traffic for periods covering both working and non-working hours. We see in general that both social and opportunistic traffics are not random, and that social email shows stronger temporal structure with a high probability for long silences and bursts of a few messages. These findings offer insights into the fundamental differences between social and opportunistic behavior in email networks, and may generalize to the structure of opportunistic social relations in other environments.",

First, we find that the optimization model and the spatial preferential attachment model can generate similar topological structures under appropriate parameters. Second, our experiments surprisingly show that the simple generalized random graph model outperforms the two proposed models. Third, we find that a series of spatial networks under global optimization of wire length, including the electronic circuits, brain networks, neuronal networks and transportation networks, have high s-metric values close to those of the corresponding generalized random graph models. These s-metric observations explain why the generalized random graph model can match the electronic circuits and the brain networks well from a probabilistic viewpoint, and distinguish their structures from self-organized spatial networks, such as the Internet.",

As we observed the same tendencies found in the former model, a new dimension emerged from the agent-based simulation: an increase of oscillations for the characteristic rates, revealing an increase of precariousness (job instability) due to the new type of contract. Moreover, our simulation enabled us to detect and correct some flaws of the Cobb–Douglas type of matching function. These encouraging results led us to continue in that direction, where several extensions of our model can be proposed, including the move to a large-scale simulation framework.",

Given that in the Web there can be messages from one place to another, and that these messages can be, with some probability, new unclassified virus warning messages as well as worms or other kind of viruses, the sites can be infected very fast. The question to answer is how and when a network infection can become global and how it can be controlled or at least how to stabilize the spreading in such a way that it becomes confined below a fixed portion of the network.

    "abstract": "Computer simulations of complex food-webs are important tools for deepening our understanding of these systems. Yet most computer models assume, rather than generate, key system-level patterns, or use mathematical modeling approaches that make it difficult to fully account for nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we present a computer simulation model that addresses these concerns by focusing on assumptions of agent attributes rather than agent outcomes. Our model utilizes the techniques of complex adaptive systems and agent-based modeling so that system level patterns of a marine ecosystem emerge from the interactions of thousands of individual computer agents. This methodology is validated by using this general simulation model to replicate fundamental properties of a marine ecosystem, including: (i) the predator–prey oscillations found in Lotka–Volterra; (ii) the stepped pattern of biomass accrual from resource enrichment; (iii) the Paradox of Enrichment; and (iv) Gause's Law.",

    "abstract": "Formal control design techniques usually rely on the plant model of a desired system. The plant model can be derived from the foundation principles of the system but often includes unidentified parameters. In order to approximate these unknown parameters, experiments are conducted to collect information from the behavior of plant dynamics. Thus, closed-loop feedback control methods can be formulated upon the estimation of an appropriate plant model using simulation techniques. Rapid prototyping techniques support this design paradigm which requires that the rapid prototype operate in real time, interact with real hardware and have supporting control functionality. This paper delivers a study on the modeling and testing of a gait generation method using a rapid prototyping technique. The objective is to develop a method of rapid prototyping to test new walking algorithms on a real-time robotic system. The paper addresses the drawbacks of a non-real-time simulation by evaluating the locomotion of a six-legged robot in terms of tracking errors and signifies the proposed methodology of tuning the gait generation algorithm online through real-time hardware in loop simulation setup. Finally, the paper inspects the improved locomotion of the robot using the proposed methodology and signifies it as a valid prototyping technique for approximating novel gait generation algorithms on real-time robotic systems.",

The probability distribution of the effect of point mutations in linear structural motifs of the secondary structure is well fit by Pareto or Lognormal probability distributions functions, independent of the origin of the RNA molecule. This extends previous results to the case of natural sequences of diverse origins. We introduce a new indicator of robustness, the average weighted length of linear motifs (AwL) and demonstrate that it correlates with the average effect of point mutations in RNA secondary structures. Structures with a high AwL value display the highest structural robustness and cluster in particular regions of sequence space.",

In the engineering practice, cavitation flow is often modeled as a single-phase flow (mixture), where the cavitation area is handled as an area with the pressure lower than the vapor pressure. This approach always leads to the result, and the requirement of computer time is many times lower in comparison with multiphase flow models. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are solved for the mixture of liquid and vapor, which is considered as a single-phase with variable density. The vaporization and condensation processes are controlled by barocline low. A transport equation with source terms is implanted in the code Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to compute the volume fraction of the vapor. The CFD code used is ANSYS CFX. The influence of numerical and the physical parameters are presented. The numerical results are compared to previous experimental measures. For steady flow, a SST turbulence model is adopted and LES for the unsteady flow.",

The irregularity of the time series is thereby faithfully reflected in the fraction of cooperators surviving the evolutionary process, thus effectively linking time series with evolutionary games. Pivotal to the linkage is a simple visibility algorithm that transforms time series into networks. More specifically, periodic series yield regular networks, chaotic series yield random networks, while fractal series yield scale-free networks. As an example, we use a chaotic time series from the Logistic map and a fractal time series of Brownian motion, yielding an interaction network with an exponential and a power-law degree distribution, respectively. By employing the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game, we demonstrate that such heterogeneous interaction networks facilitate the evolution of cooperation if compared to the traditional square lattice topology. Due to the simplicity of the employed methodology, newcomers with a basic command of nonlinear dynamics or stochastic processes can become easily acquainted with evolutionary games, and moreover, integrate these interesting and vibrant subfields of physics more effectively into their research.",

    "abstract": "Cloud Computing has become the popular paradigm for accessing the various scalable and on-demand computing services over the internet. Nowadays, individual Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) offering specialized services to the customers collaborate to form the Cloud Federation, in order to reap the real benefits of Cloud Computing. By collaboration, the member CSPs of the federation achieve better resource utilization and Quality of Service (QoS), thereby increasing their business prospects. When a CSP runs out of resources in the Cloud Federation, in order to offload the customer requests for resources to other CSP(s), identifying a suitable partner is a challenging task due to the lack of global coordination among them. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of an efficient partner selection mechanism in the Cloud Federation, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods, and also considering the trust values of various CSPs in the federation. The AHP method is used to calculate the weights of the QoS parameters used in the TOPSIS method which is used to rank the various CSPs in the Cloud Federation according to the user requirements. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this approach in order to efficiently select the trustworthy partners in large scale federations to ensure the required QoS to the cloud consumers.",

Many traditional approaches require experienced designers to manually specify the formulization of the approximating function, leading to the rigid, non-adaptive representation of the value function. To address this problem, a novel Q-value function approximation method named ‘Hierarchical fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory’ (HiART) is proposed in this paper. HiART is based on the Fuzzy ART method and is an adaptive classification network that learns to segment the state space by classifying the training input automatically. HiART begins with a highly generalized structure where the number of the category nodes is limited, which is beneficial to speed up the learning process at the early stage. Then, the network is refined gradually by creating the attached sub-networks, and a layered network structure is formed during this process. Based on this adaptive structure, HiART alleviates the dependence on expert experience to design the network parameter. The effectiveness and adaptivity of HiART are demonstrated in the Mountain Car benchmark problem with both fast learning speed and low computation time. Finally, a simulation application example of the one versus one air combat decision problem illustrates the applicability of HiART.",

To adapt this framework to an urban scenario, characterized by several individuals sharing very close physical spaces, we propose a metapopulation version of the Schelling model defined on the top of a regular lattice whose cells can be interpreted as a bunch of buildings or a district containing several agents. We assume the model to contain two kinds of agents relocating themselves if their individual utility is smaller than a tolerance threshold. While the results for large values of the tolerances respect the common sense, namely coexistence is the rule, for small values of the latter we obtain two non-trivial results: first we observe complete segregation inside the cells, second the population redistributes highly heterogeneously among the available places, despite the initial uniform distribution. The system thus converges toward a complex heterogeneous configuration after a long quasi-stationary transient period, during which the population remains in a well mixed phase. We identify three possible global spatial regimes according to the tolerance value: microscopic clusters with local coexistence of both kinds of agents, macroscopic clusters with local coexistence (hereafter called soft segregation) and macroscopic clusters with local segregation but homogeneous densities (hereafter called hard segregation).",

In this paper, a new VM migration algorithm for the load balancing in the cloud is proposed. The migration algorithm proposed (EGSA-VMM) is based on exponential gravitational search algorithm which is the integration of gravitational search algorithm and exponential weighted moving average theory. In our approach, the migration is done based on the migration cost and QoS. The experimentation of proposed EGSA-based VM migration algorithm is compared with ACO and GSA. The simulation of experiments shows that the proposed EGSA-VMM algorithm achieves load balancing and reasonable resource utilization, which outperforms existing migration strategies in terms of number of VM migrations and number of SLA violations.",

However, if there are stubborn agents in the networks, regular agents’ opinions will finally be confined to the convex combinations of the stubborn agents’. Specifically, if all stubborn agents hold the same opinion, even if the agents only exist on a certain layer, their opinions will diffuse to the entire multilayer networks.

    "abstract": "Influence maximization is a well-known problem in the social network analysis literature which is to find a small subset of seed nodes to maximize the diffusion or spread of information. The main application of this problem in the real-world is in viral marketing. However, the classic influence maximization is disabled to model the real-world viral marketing problem, since the effect of the marketing message content and nodes’ opinions have not been considered. In this paper, a modified version of influence maximization which is named as “opinion-aware influence maximization” (OAIM) problem is proposed to make the model more realistic. In this problem, the main objective is to maximize the spread of a desired opinion, by optimizing the message content, rather than the number of infected nodes, which leads to selection of the best set of seed nodes. A nonlinear bi-objective mathematical programming model is developed to model the considered problem. Some transformation techniques are applied to convert the proposed model to a linear single-objective mathematical programming model. The exact solution of the model in small datasets can be obtained by CPLEX algorithm. For the medium and large-scale datasets, a new genetic algorithm is proposed to cope with the size of the problem. Experimental results on some of the well-known datasets show the efficiency and applicability of the proposed OAIM model. In addition, the proposed genetic algorithm overcomes state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel Laplacian-based algorithm that simplifies triangle surface meshes and can provide different preservation ratios of geometric features. Our efficient and fast algorithm uses a 3D mesh model as input and initially detects geometric features by using a Laplacian-based shape descriptor (L-descriptor). The algorithm further performs an optimized clustering approach that combines a Laplacian operator with K-means clustering algorithm to perform vertex classification. Moreover, we introduce a Laplacian weighted cost function based on L-descriptor to perform feature weighting and error statistics comparison, which are further used to change the deletion order of the model elements and preserve the saliency features. Our algorithm can provide different preservation ratios of geometric features and may be extended to handle arbitrary mesh topologies. Our experiments on a variety of 3D surface meshes demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm in terms of improving accuracy and applicability, and preserving saliency geometric features.",

Equally importantly, the inherent crossroads constraints, namely, the security of their users and the structure thereof, also referred to as the antagonism principle, are considered in the proceeding of this method. The implementation of this model on two crossroads significantly decreases the waiting time and regulates the traffic flow.

Using big data mining method to predict traffic accidents is conducive to taking measures to prevent or reduce traffic accidents in advance. In recent years, prediction methods of traffic accidents used by researchers have some problems, such as low calculation accuracy. Therefore, a prediction model of traffic accidents based on joint probability density feature extraction of big data is proposed in this paper. First, a function of big data joint probability distribution for traffic accidents is established. Second, establishing big data distributed database model of traffic accidents with the statistical analysis method in order to mine the association rules characteristic quantity reflecting the law of traffic accidents, and then extracting the joint probability density feature of big data for traffic accident probability distribution. According to the result of feature extraction, adaptive functional and directivity are predicted, and then the regularity prediction of traffic accidents is realized based on the result of association directional clustering, so as to optimize the design of the prediction model of traffic accidents based on big data. Simulation results show that in predicting traffic accidents, the model in this paper has advantages of relatively high accuracy, relatively good confidence and stable prediction result.",

    "abstract": "We assume a community whose members adopt one of two opinions [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text]. Each member appears as an inflexible, or as a non-contrarian or contrarian floater. An inflexible sticks to its opinion, whereas a floater may change into a floater of the alternative opinion. The occurrence of this change is governed by the local majority rule: members meet in groups of a fixed size, and a floater then changes its opinion provided it is a minority in the group. Subsequently, a non-contrarian floater keeps the opinion as adopted under the local majority rule, whereas a contrarian floater adopts the alternative opinion. Whereas the effects of on the one hand inflexibles and on the other hand non-contrarians and contrarians have previously been studied separately, the current approach allows us to gain insight in the effect of their combined presence in a community. Given fixed proportions of inflexibles [Formula: see text] for the two opinions, and fixed fractions of contrarians [Formula: see text] among the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] floaters, we derive the update equation [Formula: see text] for the overall support for opinion [Formula: see text] at time [Formula: see text], given [Formula: see text]. The update equation is derived respectively for local group sizes 1, 2 and 3. The associated dynamics generated by repeated local updates is then determined to identify its asymptotic steady configuration. The full opinion flow diagram is thus obtained, showing conditions in terms of the parameters for each opinion to eventually win the competing dynamics. Various dynamical scenarios are thus exhibited, and it is derived that relatively small densities of inflexibles allow for more variation in the qualitative outcome of the dynamics than higher densities of inflexibles.",

We propose a generalised framework to explore temporal networks using second-order time-unfolded models, called event graphs. Through examples we demonstrate how event graphs can be used to understand the higher-order topological-temporal structure of temporal networks and capture properties of the network that are unobserved when considering either a static (or time-aggregated) model. Furthermore, we show that by modelling a temporal network as an event graph our analysis extends easily to consider non-dyadic interactions, known as hyper-events.",

Collective decisions are produced by voting procedures which aggregate individual preferences and judgments. Before and after, individual preferences and judgments change as their underlying attitudes, values, and opinions change through discussion and deliberation. In large groups, these dynamics naturally go beyond the scope of the individual and consequently might show unexpected self-driven macroscopic systems dynamics following socio-physical laws. On the other hand, aggregated information and preferences as communicated through media, polls, political parties, or interest groups, also play a large role in the individual opinion formation process. Further on, actors are also capable of strategic opinion formation in the light of a pending referendum, election or other collective decision. Opinion dynamics and collective decision should thus not only be tackled by social choice, game theory, political and social psychology, but also from a systems dynamics and sociophysics perspective.",

Our empirical analysis shows that: (i) Users play indeed a predominant role in communication, which points towards the vivid role of an active user community; (ii) communication is highly concentrated, which points towards the importance of active individuals and (iii) community turnover exhibits only little correlation with community segregation, which may allow to benefit from high turnover rates while keeping negative effects small.

DDM admits the sending federates and the receiving federates to express their interest using update regions and subscription regions in a multidimensional routing space. There are several matching algorithms to obtain overlap information between the update regions and subscription regions. When the number of regions increase sharply, the matching process is time consuming. However, the existing algorithms is hard to be parallelized to take advantage of the computing capabilities of multi-core processors. To reduce the computational overhead of region matching, we propose a parallel algorithm based on order relation to accelerate the matching process. The new matching algorithm adopts divide-and-conquer approach to divide the regions into multiple region bound sublists, each of which comprises parts of region bounds. To calculate the intersection inside and amongst the region bound sublists, two matching rules are presented. This approach has good performance since it performs region matching on the sublists parallel and does not require unnecessary comparisons within regions in different sublists. Theoretical analysis has been carried out for the proposed algorithm and experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm has better performance than major existing DDM matching algorithms.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an agent-based model for opinion dynamics on an adaptive coupled random network is proposed. Based on Festinger's idea of \"cognitive dissonance\", in the proposed model an agent can either make opinion exchange with a neighbor according to the bounded confidence mechanism, or migrate toward another network position in case that the majority of the adjacent agents are beyond the confidence bound. Through numerical simulations, we test how the key factors, such as the interconnectivity of the two communities, the confidence bound or the communal tolerance to diversity, the initial distributions of the opinions, and the level of sense of community, affect the final opinion state of the system. The overall analyses show a general picture of the dynamics of opinions on an adaptive network with community structure. In particular, the results reveal that the clustering of similar agents has a bifurcating function for the opinion dynamics. Given that the inter-communal influence is high, the clustering fosters the global consensus. If the inter-communal influence is weak, the clustering would instead intensify polarization and thus hinder the formation of global consensus. The factors of the communal tolerances and interconnectivity leverage the bifurcating effect.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and simulation is pervasive throughout many different disciplines. As computing technology has provided more capability, the systems being modeled and simulated have grown larger and more complex. Often times, these large systems are managed as interacting subsystems. When it is necessary for the simulation to allow disparate subsystems to maintain their independence, then a hybrid model of the subsystems should be used. Furthermore, to ease the burden of verification and validation of simulation results, a proven system theoretical modeling specification should be used. However, many communities have already adopted nonsystem theoretical software solutions and established a group of domain experts familiar with these tools. This paper provides two things: a formal approach to building a hybrid model, and a discussion of how to incorporate a nonsystem theoretical software implementation into a proven framework. The first is done through the implementation of a Knowledge Interchange Broker (KIB) as an Interaction Model (IM). The second is accomplished by exemplifying the use of the IM in an agent-environment hybrid model. In the hybrid model, the agent is implemented in the Discrete-event System (DEVS) specification and the environment is implemented in the Geographical Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) using a Composable Cellular Automaton (CCA) specification. This concept has been successfully applied to both example models and an interdisciplinary research project where the interactions between human activities and landscape processes are studied.",

Consequently, this paper intends to investigate the part delivery of mixed-model assembly lines with decentralized supermarkets and tow trains. Besides, uncertain exception disturbances, including tow train failures and adjustments of the production sequence, are also considered. To solve this problem, a heuristic-based dynamic delivery strategy is proposed, which dynamically schedules the route, departure time, quantities and types of loaded parts for each tour. To evaluate the performance of this strategy, it is used to solve an instance in comparison with the periodic delivery strategy, experimental results are reported and their performances are compared under different metrics. Moreover, a multi-scenario analysis is employed to determinate the long-term decisions, including the number of tow trains and the route layout. Finally, the critical storage is suggested to be set for each station to avoid part starvation resulting from disturbances, and its effect on the delivery performance is investigated.",

The proposed method uses geometric duality for spatially adapting covariance-based interpolation (CBI). To preserve edge information, a multi-stage cascaded joint bilateral filter (MSCJBF) is proposed as an intermediary stage. These edges are incorporated in the high frequency subbands obtained by the stationary wavelet transform (SWT), through nearest neighbor interpolation (NNI) method. Prior to the NNI process, the high frequency subbands undergo two-lobed lanczos interpolation to achieve the desired resolution enhancement. The quantitative and qualitative analysis for various test images prove the superiority of our method.",

    "abstract": "Heat transfer using air jet impingement technique is one of the conspicuous tasks in the looming world of electronic packaging system. Here, the material selection of heat sink becomes one of the prior and important assignments to construct a heat sink with desired characteristic cooling rate. In order to study the material effect of heat sink over the cooling characteristic, the present work takes an initiative in plotting the Nusselt magnitude over the radial distance for different material of heat sink. This is done by computing the flow regime and heat transfer characteristic of a 2D axis symmetric geometry in commercial simulating software, ANSYS CFX. The computation of cooling characteristic in form of Nusselt profile is done using SST + Gamma–theta turbulence model. Since the prediction of heat interaction due to the intermediacy and transition in the flow regime is a unique issue of this problem. The results for Nusselt curve signifies a tangible elevation in local Nusselt value (nonuniformity) with decrease in thermal diffusivity of target surface. Also the nonuniformity is observed to vanish above a critical range (66.76[Formula: see text]mm 2 /s) of thermal diffusivity. This happens due to presences of abnormal turbulence of heat flow which occurs inside the target surface. Since the variation in thermal diffusivity causes some imbalance competition between the heat storage and dissipation capabilities. Above all the target surface carrying thermal diffusivity less than 66.76[Formula: see text]mm 2 /s possesses a dominating heat storage capability, on behalf of which some heat transfer occurring in near jet and far jet regions are being restricted. These are transferred towards stagnation region in radial direction.",

Moreover, we investigate the mechanism of contagion when counter-party and liquidity channels are both active in the dynamic interbank market network. Specifically, we analyze the effects of bank capitalization, interbank exposures, liquid assets, and bank credit lending preference on the stability of the banking system, respectively. First, we find that liquidity in interbank market and fluctuations of deposits could amplify the negative impact of each other on the resilience of interbank market network. Second, banks with higher capitalization level tend to be more resilient against financial contagion. Third, interbank exposures may have multiple effects on the resilience of interbank market network. Fourth, the resilience of interbank market network is a nonmonotonic function of percentage of liquid assets. Finally, we discover a complex relationship between bank credit lending preference and the resilience of interbank market.",

The gratitude intervention had been previously shown to increase positive affect and decrease negative affect in an individual but dynamic group effects have not been considered. In the first study, the intervention was administered to the whole network. In the second study, two social networks are considered and in each only a subset of individuals, initially low/high in negative affect respectively received the intervention as \"agents of change\". Data was analyzed using stochastic actor-based modeling techniques to identify resulting network changes, impact on positive and negative affect and potential contagion of mood within the group. The first study found a group level increase in positive and a decrease in negative affect. Homophily was detected with regard to positive and negative affect but no evidence of contagion was found. The network itself became more volatile along with a fall in rate of change of negative affect. Centrality measures indicated that the best broadcasters were the individuals with the least negative affect levels at the beginning of the study. In the second study, the positive and negative affect levels for the whole group depended on the initial levels of negative affect of the intervention recipients. There was evidence of positive affect contagion in the group where intervention recipients had low initial level of negative affect and contagion in negative affect for the group where recipients had initially high level of negative affect.",

The theory uses a mesoscopic view, i.e. it works with probabilities instead of individual configurations used in micro-simulations. An exact stochastic analysis can be done using the theory of Markov processes. But this analysis is restricted to small problems only. For larger problems we compute the distribution using a factorization into marginals. These marginals are then approximated by the given marginals of low order with iterative proportional fitting using the maximum entropy principle. This method has been developed in probabilistic logic. Our method leads to a set of difference equations which have to be iterated numerically. We use the exact methods as well as our approximations to investigate the popular nonlinear voter model (NLVM). We show that the \"phase transitions\" regarded in recent papers are artifacts of the mean-field approximation. They do not show up in the real automata. There exist many mathematical peculiarities of the NLVM which raise doubts concerning the suitability of the model. As an alternative we propose the Exponential Voter Model which depends on a single parameter only, the inverse \"temperature\" β. Our proposed method to perform a stochastic analysis is not restricted to cellular automata, but can be applied to more general discrete stochastic systems.",

Appearing in that way, chaos can prevent species extinction in a situation when it would be inevitable otherwise. We also show that an essential consequence of chaotic dynamics is that the issue of species extinction is subject to the size of the domain inhabited by the population, the extinction more likely happens in a small domain than in a large one.",

The perspective is that of a demographer, and the main focus is on the macro regularities, in particular, the shape of the frequency distribution of mating time and the proportion of ever-mated, arising from the micro hypotheses. We show – both by simulation and by formal proof – that if agents behave homogeneously according to the same TNB rule the shape of the distribution is monotonically decreasing. Switching then to the hypothesis that individuals act heterogeneously, with different TNB rules, the typical shape of the union formation curve emerges. Finally, we argue that students of demography might gain important hints for their theories by simulation-based approaches and that a population-oriented focus might also be advantageous for studying the mental models for agents.",

The conclusion is reached that when a set of chemical reactions achieves such closure as to generate persistent and interactive coherence (such as a limit cycle or strange attractor), properties of a test entity are altered. To the extent that this can be shown to be the case, it is appropriate to consider that a novel (emergent) entity has come into existence. Existence of the limit cycle brings about major changes in the levels (concentrations) of reactants that generate that cycle.

We analyze statistical properties of randomly generated genomes both on the sequence and network level, and show that this model correctly predicts the frequency of genes in genomes as found in experimental data. Using an evolutionary algorithm based on stabilizing selection for a phenotype, we show that dynamical robustness against single base mutations, as against random changes in initial states of regulatory dynamics that mimic stochastic fluctuations in environmental conditions, can emerge in parallel. Point mutations at the sequence level can have strongly nonlinear effects on network wiring, including structurally neutral mutations and simultaneous rewiring of multiple connections, which occasionally lead to strong reorganization of the attractor landscape and metastability of evolutionary dynamics. Similar to real genomes, evolved artificial genomes exhibit both highly conserved regions, as well as regions that are characterized by a high rate of accepted base substitutions.",

    "abstract": "Biological networks are often modeled by systems of ordinary differential equations. In chemical reaction kinetics, for instance, sigmoid functions represent the regulation of gene expression via transcription factors. Solutions of these models tend to converge to a unique steady state, and feedback control mechanisms are required for a more complex dynamic behavior. This paper focuses on periodic behavior in two-component regulatory networks. Here, a key issue is that oscillations in chemical reaction systems are usually not robust with respect to parameter variations. Small variations lead to bifurcations that change the system's overall qualitative dynamic behavior. This concerns the mechanisms stabilizing periodic behavior in living cells. Using a small sample network, we demonstrate that oscillations can efficiently be stabilized by large time scale differences that correspond to reactions with different velocities. Furthermore, the inclusion of a time delay, reflecting transport and diffusion processes, has a similar effect. This suggests that processes of this kind potentially play a crucial role in biological oscillators.",

In an economic overlapping generations framework, it is shown how social interactions and neighborhood effects are of vital importance in the endogenous determination of the long run number of skilled workers and therefore of the growth prospects of an economy. Neighborhood effects interact with the initial distribution of skilled agents across space and play a key role in the long run stabilization of the number of skilled individuals. Our model implies a tendency toward segregation, with a possibly positive influence on growth, if team effects operate. The long run growth rate is also shown to depend on the rate of time preference. Initial circumstances are of vital importance for long run outcomes. A poor initial education endowment will imply a long run reduced number of skilled workers and a mediocre growth rate, so there is no economic convergence tendency. On the contrary, poor societies will grow less, or will even fall into a poverty trap, and will diverge continuously from richer ones.",

These needs create an environment in which system needs evolve or change too quickly to be tracked or managed by humans’ natural capabilities. We propose that systems engineering must aid systems engineering managers by providing architectural alternatives and design options. Further, as systems become more complex and dynamic, there is an increased need to identify hidden risks, model emergent behavior, and expose hidden patterns in the behavior of stakeholders. Systems engineering needs to evolve to build fast-fielded, resilient, and adaptive systems that leverage positive reinforcement feedback loops with multiple experimental and real-world information sources. The very basis of systems engineering must evolve from today’s development paradigms to a future that leverages modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence to drastically improve the capability and agility for developing new systems.

The mathematical model is formulated using system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The model includes disease-related parameters such as contact rate, disease-induced death rates, immigration rate and transition rates along with parameters for control measures such as implementation of social distancing practices, isolation and quarantine rates. From the stability analysis of the model, it is shown that if the social distancing is practiced by the large number of susceptible population, then the disease will not spread, and it may eventually die out. Further, it is derived from the analysis of the model that if most of the infected populations are isolated or quarantined, then the spread of the disease can be eventually controlled. However, from the analysis of the model, it is observed that if there is constant immigration of asymptomatic infected persons, then the disease will continue to spread and will remain pandemic. For controlling the disease, two more parameters, that is, vaccination and testing rates, are introduced in the original mathematical model and from the numerical analysis of this model, it has been shown that the control strategy involving vaccination and testing in combination can have synergistic effect for minimizing the COVID-19 infected cases.",

Quantitative models are either aggregated over large market segments or restricted to utility models of an individual's buying decision. While the aggregate models acknowledge that customer interactions are important they do not model them and hence have no way to adjust their model to changing business environments. This paper bridges the gap between individual decisions and the overall market behavior using agent based simulations to model the sales of computer chips in the high-end gamers market. The simulation environment is dynamic and models the succession of 19 products introduced over a 40 month time horizon which includes the recession of 2008–2010. Simulated sales are compared to actual sales data and are used to adjust the parametrization of the agents and their environment. We found that only two agent parameters are sufficient to obtain a very reasonable fit between simulations and data: The amount of money available for the gaming hobby and a parameter related to the gaming success of the high-end gamers.",

    "abstract": "Time-continuous dynamical systems defined on graphs are often used to model complex systems with many interacting components in a non-spatial context. In the reverse sense attaching meaningful dynamics to given \"interaction diagrams\" is a central bottleneck problem in many application areas, especially in cell biology where various such diagrams with different conventions describing molecular regulation are presently in use. In most situations these diagrams can only be interpreted by the use of both discrete and continuous variables during the modelling process, corresponding to both deterministic and stochastic hybrid dynamics. The conventions in genetics are well known, and therefore we use this field for illustration purposes. In [25] and [26] the authors showed that with the help of a multi-scale analysis stochastic systems with both continuous variables and finite state spaces can be approximated by dynamical systems whose leading order time evolution is given by a combination of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and Markov chains. The leading order term in these dynamical systems is called average dynamics and turns out to be an adequate concept to analyze a class of simplified hybrid systems. Once the dynamics is defined the mutual interaction of both ODEs and Markov chains can be analyzed through the (reverse) introduction of the so-called Interaction Graph, a concept originally invented for time-continuous dynamical systems, see [5]. Here we transfer this graph concept to the average dynamics, which itself is introduced as a heuristic tool to construct models of reaction or contact networks. The graphical concepts introduced form the basis for any subsequent study of the qualitative properties of hybrid models in terms of connectivity and (feedback) loop formation.",

The nonlinear cubic polynomial has been used to describe the spring characteristic and a quadratic polynomial has been used to describe the damper characteristic. The coefficients of each polynomial represent the design parameters of the suspension system and are to be determined. To find these parameters we have formulated a nonlinear optimization problem in which the bouncing transmissibility of the sprung mass at the center of mass has been minimized with respect to technological constraints and the constraints which satisfy the performance as per ISO 2631 standards. The advanced real coded GA has been used to solve this problem in time domain and the results obtained have been compared to those obtained using the existing design parameters.

For the first time, the nature and evolution of the Dutch economy are captured by means of a data set analysis that describes the monetary transactions among 105 economical activity clusters over the period 1987–2007. We propose to represent this data set as a multi-weighted network, called the monetary transaction network. Each node represents a unique activity cluster. Nodes are interconnected via monetary transactions. The millions of euros that traverse the links and that circulate inside each activity cluster are denoted by a link weight and a node weight respectively. By applying innovative methodologies from network theory, we observe important features of the monetary transaction network as well as its evolution: (a) Activity clusters with a large internal flow tend to cooperate with many other clusters via high volume monetary transactions. (b) Activity clusters with a lower internal transaction volume prefer to transact with fewer neighboring nodes that have a higher internal flow. (c) The node weights seem to follow a power law distribution. Surprisingly, (b) and (c) have been observed in community structures of many real-world networks as well. (d) Activity clusters tend to balance the monetary volume of their transactions with their neighbors, reflected by a positive link weight correlation around each node. This correlation becomes stronger over time while the number of links increases over time as well.",

    "abstract": "Technological artifacts such as software often comprise a large number of modules; more than twenty thousand in the case of the Java software Eclipse. While on the micro-level this system is modular, how should the building blocks be arranged on the macro-level? In the literature this question has mainly been addressed with the same arguments already used to advocate modularity on the micro-level: Dependencies should be minimized as they impede optimization and flexibility of the system. In contrast to this I argue that along with a change from the micro view to the macro view also the argumentation has to change. In this paper, I analyze the theoretical ramifications of dependency between modules on the macro-level. In particular, I argue that macro-level dependencies are first weak dependencies, and second, foster flexibility and change efficiency. This argumentation is supported by an empirical analysis of 35 software architectures. Data show that dependency relations seldom cause change propagation. Furthermore, high dependency in the architecture negatively correlates with the occurrence of large change events. Thus, higher interdependency is associated with higher evolvability and more efficient change.",

On the basis of such icon chip structures, a color categorization for both an individual learner and a population of learners is then evolved. These results remove limitations of some particular previous color categorization simulation work which assumed a fixed number of color stimuli and a maximal number of predefined color categories. These simulations are extended to demonstrate that learners need neither to share the same icon chip structures, nor do these structures have to be fully developed for a population of learners to produce a stable color categorization system. Additionally, when a naïve learner is introduced into a population with a stable color categorization, the game dynamics result in the learner's adopting the existing categorization. All results are shown to hold while the underlying icon chip structures evolve continuously in response to novel stimuli. The usefulness of the approach as well as some of the potential implications of the results for human learning of color categories are discussed.",

The infestation rate plays an important role in the variation of infection. In this logic, we set out a mathematical model with variable infestation rate for the evolution of babesiosis disease. Using the (0,2)-Jacobi multi-wavelets method combined with the decoupling and quasi-linearization technique, we demonstrate the validity and applicability of our model. Then, a set of experimental data is used to validate the proposed model under the same operating conditions. The results of numerical simulations are provided to show the impact of seasonality on the transmission dynamics of Babesiosis. Eventually, a numerical study of the model varying the control parameters of babesiosis shows different scenarios about the spread of the disease.",

Nevertheless, RED suffers from drawbacks in particular when its \"average queue length\" is set below the buffer's \"minimum threshold\" position which makes the router buffer quickly overflow. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes two discrete-time queue analytical models that aim to utilize an instant queue length parameter as a congestion measure. This assigns mean queue length (mql) and average queueing delay smaller values than those for RED and eventually reduces buffers overflow. A comparison between RED and the proposed analytical models was conducted to identify the model that offers better performance. The proposed models outperform the classic RED in regards to mql and average queueing delay measures when congestion exists. This work also compares one of the proposed models (RED-Linear) with another analytical model named threshold-based linear reduction of arrival rate (TLRAR). The results of the mql, average queueing delay and the probability of packet loss for TLRAR are deteriorated when heavy congestion occurs, whereas, the results of our RED-Linear were not impacted and this shows superiority of our model.",

However, due to the inherent complex characteristics of stream data, such as quick generation, tremendous volume and dynamic evolution distribution, how to develop an effective online anomaly detection method is a challenge. The main objective of this paper is to propose an adaptive online anomaly detection method for stream data. This is achieved by combining isolation principle with online ensemble learning, which is then optimized by statistic histogram. Three main algorithms are developed, i.e., online detector building algorithm, anomaly detecting algorithm and adaptive detector updating algorithm. To evaluate our proposed method, four massive datasets from the UCI machine learning repository recorded from real events were adopted. Extensive simulations based on these datasets show that our method is effective and robust against different scenarios.",

One application of the same is that by deploying on-board diagnostic devices, the signatures of vehicle vibration along with its location and time are recorded. Detailed analyses of the collected signatures offer deep insights into the state of the objects under study. Towards that objective, we carried out experiments by deploying telematics device in one of the office bus that ferries employees to office and back. Data is collected from 3-axis accelerometer, GPS speed and the time for all the journeys. In this paper, we present initial results of the above exercise by applying statistical methods to derive information through systematic analysis of the data collected over four months. It is demonstrated that the higher order derivative of the measured Z-axis acceleration samples display the properties of Weibull distribution when the time axis is replaced by the amplitude of such processed acceleration data. Such an observation offers us a method to predict future behavior where deviations from prediction are classified as context-based aberrations or progressive degradation of the system. In addition, we capture the relationship between speed of the vehicle and median of the jerk energy samples using regression analysis. That analysis is further used to identify low, normal and high JE values for a velocity and classify journey at a micro-trip (small section of a trip) level. Such results offer an opportunity to develop a robust method to model road–vehicle interaction thereby enabling us to predict such like driving behavior and condition-based maintenance, etc.",

    "abstract": "The design process of new air- and rotorcraft is commonly separated into three different consecutive phases. In the conceptual design phase, the viability of different designs is investigated with respect to customer requirements and/or the market situation. It usually ends with the identification of a basic aircraft lay-out. In the subsequent preliminary design stage the various disciplines are introduced, thus redefining the design process as a multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) task. The objective of this design stage is to enhance the initial aircraft configuration by establishing an advanced design comprising a loft provided with primary structure. This updated aircraft configuration represents a global optimum solution for the specified requirements which will then be optimized on a local level in the concluding detailed design phase with particular regard to manufacturing aspects. The investigations in the preliminary design phase comprise the generation of numerous similar but still different analytical and finite element (FE) models. Even though computational power is constantly increasing the model generation process is still a time-consuming task. Moreover, it is also a potential source of errors which — in the worst case — may lead to time- and cost-intensive redesign activities during the detailed design. As the preliminary design stage, therefore, is of particular importance during the overall design process the model generation process benefits from parametric models and automated process chains. The presented paper overviews the tools used for the automated generation of FE models developed and used at the Institute of Structures and Design (BT) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for the subsequent use in numerical simulations. Furthermore, basic requirements for the effective use of parametrization and automation like a common data format and infrastructure will be introduced. Exemplary models and applications will be presented to illustrate the positive impact on efficiency in aircraft design. Concluding, future development steps and possible applications will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Model-Based Development has become an industry wide standard paradigm. As an open source alternative, Scilab/Xcos is being widely employed as a hybrid dynamic systems modeling tool. With the increasing efficiency in implementation using graphical model development and code generation, the modeling and simulation community is struggling with assuring quality as well as maintainability and extendibility. Refactoring is defined as an evolutionary modernization activity where, most of the time, the structure of the artifact is changed to alter its quality characteristics, while keeping its behavior unchanged. It has been widely established as a technique for textual programming languages to improve the code structure and quality. While refactoring is also regarded as one of the key practices of model engineering, the methodologies and approaches for model refactoring are still under development. Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) has been introduced by the software engineering community as a model-based approach to software modernization, in which the implicit information that lies in software artifacts is extracted to models and model transformations are applied for modernization tasks. Regarding refactoring as a low level modernization task, the practices from ADM are adaptable. Accordingly, this paper proposes a model-based approach for model refactoring in order to come up with more efficient and effective model refactoring methodology that is accessible and extendable by modelers. Like other graphical modeling tools, Scilab/Xcos also possesses a formalized model specification conforming to its implicit metamodel. Rather than proposing another metamodel for knowledge extraction, this pragmatic approach proposes to conduct in place model-to-model transformations for refactoring employing the Scilab/Xcos model specification. To construct a structured model-based approach, the implicit Scilab/Xcos metamodel is explicitly presented utilizing ECORE as a meta-metamodel. Then a practical model transformation approach is established based on Scilab scripting. A Scilab toolset is provided to the modeler for in-place model-to-model transformations. Using a sample case study, it is demonstrated that proposed model transformation functions in Scilab provide a valuable refactoring tool.",

    "abstract": "The basic configuration of step up converter usually used in photovoltaic solar systems to increase the DC voltage generated at their outputs suffers from some drawbacks just like high ripple in the output voltage, greater losses in the system and unstable dynamic behavior. To eliminate these drawbacks, this paper introduces a two-phase connection of step up converter with uncoupled smoothing reactors. Detailed analysis, simulation and control strategy have been proposed in this paper to investigate the advantages of using such connection with uncoupled reactors. This paper is intended to prove that two-phase connection with uncoupled reactors helps increasing the output power of the converter, minimizing its output ripple and making its control easier and more efficient. It also increases the converter chopping frequency and consequently decreases the size of smoothing reactors and filters used in the system. Concerning the design of such converters, it requires a long working period of time with a significant cost and specific technical tests at nominal operating points. Therefore, simulation can essentially decrease economic and development costs. Using modulation and simulation software techniques (Simplorer, Simulink, and Matlab) throughout this paper helped simulation of very fast the converter behavior and accurate determination of its dynamic characteristics. Moreover, the paper deals with modulation of voltage control technique using Matlab and Simplorer, thus regulating the converter output current and voltage. Simulation results show that this control technique provides robust output current and voltage of step up converters and is more feasible for their chopper up conversion technique.",

The inviscid numerical flux is evaluated using AUSM[Formula: see text]-up upwind scheme. An eight-step hydrogen–oxygen finite rate chemistry model is used to model the development of chemical species in a supersonic reacting flow field. The chemical species terms are alone solved implicitly in this explicit flow solver by rescaling the equation in time. The turbulence modeling has been done using RNG-based [Formula: see text]–[Formula: see text] model. Three-stage Runge–Kutta method has been used for explicit time integration. The nonreacting two-dimensional Cartesian version of the same solver has been successfully validated against experimental and numerical results reported for the wall static pressure data in sonic slot injection to supersonic stream. Detailed validation studies for reacting flow solver has been done using experimental results reported for a coaxial supersonic combustor, in which species profile at various axial locations has been compared. Present numerical solver is useful in simulating combustors of high speed air-breathing propulsion devices.",

Risks associated with CC involve the data security and network security account for real-time systems.

The ML classifier predicts the network vulnerabilities and prevents insecure communication in a CC environment.

    "abstract": "When debris flows, landslides, or any gravitational mass flows hit closed or partially open water sources such as seas, oceans, fjords, hydraulic reservoirs, mountain lakes, bays, and landslide dams, it results in tsunami (impulse water waves) by transforming their impact energy to water body, potentially causing damages of infrastructures and human casualties both near field and the distant coastlines. The intensity of hazard depends on the scale, location and process of the landslide, and also on the reservoir volume and topography that surrounds it. Volume or size of the initial release mass that fails and slides along a slope is one of the dominant factors to determine the degree of splash, propagating speed and the amplitudes of the fluid waves, and potential dam breach or water spill over. Here, we numerically integrate the two-phase mass flow model [Pudasaini S. P., J. Geophysi. Res. 117 (F03010), 2012] for quasi-three-dimensional, high-resolution simulation results with variation of size of the two-phase initial landslide or debris both longitudinally and laterally. In our numerical experimental results, we observe fundamentally different solid and fluid evolution and wave structures in the reservoir. There are also significant differences in the flow dynamics of solid under water for different volumes of the release mass by extending or contracting the base area along downslope and/or cross-slope directions. The simulation results show that tsunami amplitudes and run out extents are rapidly increased when the volume of the initial release mass in the form of a triangular wedge is increased by increasing the base area through the increment of the length and breadth of the release base. This study can be useful to develop and implement tsunami hazard mitigation strategies to enhance public safety and reduce potential loss due to landslide-generated wave hazards.",

In this paper, we analyze two different nonclassical Coronavirus models to observe the outbreaks of this disease. Caputo and Caputo–Fabrizio (C–F) fractional derivatives are considered to simulate the given epidemic models by using two separate methods. We perform all required graphical simulations with the help of real data to demonstrate the behavior of the proposed systems. We observe that the given schemes are highly effective and suitable to analyze the dynamics of Coronavirus. We find different natures of the given model classes for both Caputo and C-F derivative sense. The main contribution of this study is to propose a novel framework of modeling to show how the fractional-order solutions can describe disease dynamics much more clearly as compared to integer-order operators. The motivation to use two different fractional derivatives, Caputo (singular-type kernel) and Caputo–Fabrizio (exponential decay-type kernel) is to explore the model dynamics under different kernels. The applications of two various kernel properties on the same model make this study more effective for scientific observations.",

This approach leverages an expert-defined knowledge ontology that features both breadth (27,875 MeSH analyzed across 25 million articles indexed by PubMed from 1902 onwards) and depth (we differentiate between Major and Minor MeSH terms to identify differences in the knowledge network representation constructed from primary research topics only). With this level of uniform resolution we differentiate between three different modes of innovation contributing to the combinatorial knowledge network: (i) conceptual innovation associated with the emergence of new concepts and entities (measured as the entry of new MeSH); and (ii) recombinant innovation, associated with the emergence of new combinations, which itself consists of two types: peripheral (i.e., combinations involving new knowledge) and core (combinations comprised of pre-existing knowledge only). Another relevant question we seek to address is whether examining triplet and quartet combinations, in addition to the more traditional dyadic or pairwise combinations, provide evidence of any new phenomena associated with higher-order combinations. Analysis of the size, growth, and coverage of combinatorial innovation yield results that are largely independent of the combination order, thereby suggesting that the common dyadic approach is sufficient to capture essential phenomena. Our main results are twofold: (a) despite the persistent addition of new MeSH terms, the network is densifying over time meaning that scholars are increasingly exploring and realizing the vast space of all knowledge combinations; and (b) conceptual innovation is increasingly concentrated within single research articles, a harbinger of the recent paradigm shift towards convergence science.",

    "abstract": "Predicting engineering students’ academic performance is crucial for teachers to implement teaching interventions. How to use students’ behavior records to predict grades during school has attracted extensive attention from researchers. Various machine learning methods have been proposed by previous researchers to predict engineering students’ academic performance through their learning records. However, one of the major challenges now is that many researchers ignore the problem of reduced accuracy of prediction models due to imbalanced data. Simultaneously, a single classifier is susceptible to data changes and has an unstable classification performance. To this end, this paper proposes the RBF-Naive Bayes (RBFNB) prediction model to predict students’ academic performance, which integrates Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network algorithm and Naive Bayes algorithm. The method of RBF Network is applied to predict the academic performance of students and generate prediction results. Then, the method of Naive Bayes is adopted to correct the previous prediction results for improving the accuracy of the prediction. The proposed RBFNB prediction model was applied to the data set about the engineering students’ academic performance from a university and the Kalboard 360 public data set, respectively.",

The study shows that using the stairway or elevator separately cannot achieve the best effect. The elevator’s evacuation time depends on the number of occupants on each floor and the elevator’s carrying capacity. This paper discusses how to use the stair and elevator to optimize the hybrid evacuation in high-rise buildings and proposes two goals for the evacuation model of high-rise buildings under emergency conditions. One is that both the last occupant to use the stairway and the last occupant to use the elevator reach the safe place simultaneously. The other is that we fine-tune the evacuation destinations of the occupants to balance the utilization of each evacuation path as much as possible. We present the optimization method with three steps, and the evacuation time shrunk by up to 57% according to the baseline. Finally, we compare the optimized hybrid evacuation and the single evacuation method to the previous work and give the results of the experiments.",

    "abstract": "Succinic acid, also known as dicarboxylic acid, is one of the biochemical products chemically produced from Escherichia coli (E. coli) metabolism. However, by using conventional methods succinic acid cannot be produced sufficiently and it is costly. Hence, there is a lot of ongoing research on E. coli by using in silico methods. Researchers build computational models of E. coli to analyze and modify their metabolic network. This paper proposes a hybrid of ant colony optimization–genetic algorithm–flux balance analysis (ACOGAFBA) in enhancing the succinic acid production of E. coli by identifying genes to be knocked out. Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a swarm intelligent optimization that is inspired based on the natural foraging behavior of ant colony. Local search technique like genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to solve optimization and search problem by approximation. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is used for fitness calculation after gene knockout. FBA identifies a point (fitness) in flux space by using quadratic programming, which is closest to the wild type point. ACOGAFBA produced three sets of gene knockout lists. The dataset [Formula: see text]JR904 is used in this paper. The results show that ACOGAFBA can identify the set of knockout genes to improve succinic acid production in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical and computational frameworks of complexity science are dominated by binary structures. This binary bias, seen in the ubiquity of pair-wise networks and formal binary operations in mathematical models, limits our capacity to faithfully capture irreducible polyadic interactions in higher-order systems. A paradigmatic example of a higher-order interaction is the Borromean link of three interlocking rings. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework via hypergraphs and hypermatrix algebras that allows to formalize such forms of higher-order bonding and connectivity in a parsimonious way. Our framework builds on and extends current techniques in higher-order networks — still mostly rooted in binary structures such as adjacency matrices — and incorporates recent developments in higher-arity structures to articulate the compositional behavior of adjacency hypermatrices. Irreducible higher-order interactions turn out to be a widespread occurrence across natural sciences and socio-cultural knowledge representation. We demonstrate this by reviewing recent results in computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, social science, and cultural analysis through the conceptual lens of irreducible higher-order interactions. We further speculate that the general phenomenon of emergence in complex systems may be characterized by spatio-temporal discrepancies of interaction arity.",

When the initial state is homogeneous with uniform random perturbations, a unique final state is reached which depends only on the shape of the interaction function f(λ). A potential formulation of the dynamics suggests that the final wavelength is determined by a Maxwell construction applied to f(λ), but comparison with numerical simulations shows that this yields only an upper bound. In contrast, the evolution from a perfectly homogeneous state with a localized perturbation proceeds through the propagation of wavelength doubling fronts. The front speed can be predicted by standard marginal stability theory. In this case the final wavelength depends on the initial wavelength in a complicated manner which involves multiplication by powers of two and rational ratios such as 4/3.",

Simulation of fabric drape is a significant issue in textile research, which contributes to advances within the framework of virtual models and clothing simulation. In the first part of this paper, the existing methods dealing with the fabric simulation are presented. In the following part, a mathematical model that has been selected for simulation is given. The third part is devoted to the identification of unknown parameters. Each parameter corresponds to a predefined test. In order to obtain reliable results, very specific samples were realized, testing the fabric weave method and the influence of the yarn nature. This choice is guided by industrial needs. Moreover, the proposed method enables a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters. Finally, in the fourth part, several simulation results are presented and they are compared with practical results by analyzing textile structural deformation according to parameter variation.",

A simulator (OrgSwarm) which can be used to model the adaptation of a population of organizations on a strategic landscape is introduced.

These features allow the examination of a wide range of real-life scenarios in organizational adaptation. The paper reports the results of a number of simulation experiments and these suggest that agent (management) uncertainty as to the payoffs to potential strategies has the effect of lowering the average payoffs obtained by a population of organizations. The results also suggest that a degree of strategic inertia can assist rather than hamper adaptive efforts at a populational level.",

A search on the occurrence of particular scaling laws in Mexico's normalized yearly mean grain yield anomaly series of maize (Zea mays L.), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oriza sativa L.), using a variography approach is reported in this work. Additionally, power spectrum determination, time-frequency analysis, and estimation of Lyapunov exponent were performed for each profile in order to obtain useful information on the frequency contents and signs at which important frequencies occur as well as to determine their sensitivity to initial conditions. Fractal analysis gives us the order maize &lt; wheat &lt; rice &lt; beans of sensitivity to external forcings, which was the same as that obtained through the Lyapunov exponent values. Results confirm that the final outputs (crop yields) in agricultural systems are affected by the magnetic and sunspot cycles of the Sun, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the quasi-biannual oscillation, and possibly by the so-called heliospheric mid-term-quasi-periodicities, which act on different time (or spatial and spatial-time) scales. In particular, the maize normalized year anomaly series is clearly correlated with March, April, May and June series of the ENSO index.",

For this purpose, we build an agent-based model, and model these two scenarios of simulations. Results are partly studied using network analysis, and they show that in the second type of simulations agents are able to identify the most competent agents in the network and increase their competencies. Results also show that learning is easier when there is no prior knowledge of others' competencies. Otherwise, agents deal with a congestion effect that slows down the learning process.",

The potential role of ethnic preferences has received increasing attention in recent years, but the development of theoretical models has been limited in many respects. This study seeks to extend the understanding of the possible role of ethnic preferences by investigating an agent-based model that introduces the concept of spatial potential — the desirability of particular spatial locations — as a competing preference. The distribution of spatial potential is varied from convex to concave distributions on the city landscape to investigate the resulting impact on patterns of segregation. Three types of zones are identified in the model city, namely the minority ghetto, the majority ring, and the integrated ring. The present model is considered to be an example of a discrete dynamic system that is characterized by its random move condition and its definition on the grid system. Insights from analytic approaches are explored in the context of the new dynamics to gain a better understanding of the emergent patterns of the system.",

The novelty is that both the internal energy and the volume are no longer additive functions. The new approach is referred to as \"fully\" nonextensive thermodynamics. The physical temperature is different from the inverse of the Lagrange multiplier. This fact changes the form of some usual thermodynamic relations. For example, the Clausius definition of the thermodynamic entropy has to be modified. As an application, the classical gas model is examined with statistical calculations performed under the Tsallis–Mendes–Plastino formalism of nonextensive thermodynamics. The specific heat expression differs from the one encountered in ordinary extensive thermodynamics but the equation of state keeps the same form.",

    "abstract": "Leading-edge supercomputers, such as the K computer, have generated a vast amount of simulation results, and most of these datasets were stored on the file system for the post-hoc analysis such as visualization. In this work, we first investigated the data generation trends of the K computer by analyzing some operational log data files. We verified a tendency of generating large amounts of distributed files as simulation outputs, and in most cases, the number of files has been proportional to the number of utilized computational nodes, that is, each computational node producing one or more files. Considering that the computational cost of visualization tasks is usually much smaller than that required for large-scale numerical simulations, a flexible data input/output (I/O) management mechanism becomes highly useful for the post-hoc visualization and analysis. In this work, we focused on the xDMlib data management library, and its flexible data I/O mechanism in order to enable flexible data loading of big computational climate simulation results. In the proposed approach, a pre-processing is executed on the target distributed files for generating a light-weight metadata necessary for the elaboration of the data assignment mapping used in the subsequent data loading process. We evaluated the proposed approach by using a 32-node visualization cluster, and the K computer. Besides the inevitable performance penalty associated with longer data loading time, when using smaller number of processes, there is a benefit for avoiding any data replication via copy, conversion, or extraction. In addition, users will be able to freely select any number of nodes, without caring about the number of distributed files, for the post-hoc visualization and analysis purposes.",

As self-involved agents share different attitude dynamics to other agents [Wood, W., Pool, G., Leck, K. and Purvis, D., Self-definition, defensive processing, and influence: The normative impact of majority and minority groups, J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. (1996) 1181–1193], we study the emergence and evolution of norms through an individual-based model involving these two types of agents. The dynamics of self-involved agents is drawn from [Huet, S. and Deffuant, G., Openness leads to opinion stability and narrowness to volatility, Adv. Complex Syst. 13 (2010) 405–423], and the dynamics of others, from [Deffuant, G., Neau, D., Amblard, F. and Weisbuch, G., Mixing beliefs among interacting agents, Adv. Complex Syst. 3 (2001) 87–98]. The attitude of an agent is represented as a segment on a continuous attitudinal space. Two agents are close if their attitude segments share sufficient overlap. Our agents discuss two different issues, one of which, called main issue, is more important for the self-involved agents than the other, called secondary issue. Self-involved agents are attracted to both issues if they are close to the main issue, but shift away from their peer’s opinion if they are only close on the secondary issue. Differently, non-self-involved agents are attracted by other agents when they are close on both the main and secondary issues. We observe the emergence of various types of extreme minor clusters. In one or different groups of attitudes, they can lead to an already-built moderate norm or a norm polarized on secondary and/or main issues. They can also push disagreeing agents gathered in different groups to a global moderate consensus.",

    "abstract": "The unpredictable structure failures of carbon steel and low alloy steel leading to accidents may be caused by the propagation of a flaw or crack already present in the structure. Fracture toughness which describes the ability of a material containing a crack to resist fracture is one of the most important material properties for design applications of metallic structures. Since this material property is influenced by several parameters, namely material chemistry, heat treatment, morphology of structure, it requires millions of experiments to be conducted to understand and predict it. So, mathematical modeling is one of the solutions to find the effect of these parameters and design future alloys. Stress–intensity factor [Formula: see text] is a quantitative parameter of fracture toughness determining a maximum value of stress which may be applied to a specimen containing a crack (notch) of a certain length. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed using over 100 sets of data to study the effect of alloying elements on fracture toughness, [Formula: see text] for the low alloy steel. 20% of data was used for training, 60% to develop predictive model and rest of the 20% for validation. The model can predict the fracture toughness of unknown new data close to 80% accuracy which is good enough for statistical modeling. The details of program code with ANN modeling steps have been explained. Prediction of fracture toughness by the model with variation of alloy composition as well as yield stress gives interesting and important information which may help in designing alloy which will resist crack propagation in a structure and hence enhance the life of structure to fail.",

We introduce the frequency-domain definition for fractional-order derivative by the Fourier transform, which is easy to implement numerically. The new edge indicator is better than the existing edge indicating operators in distinguishing between ramps and edges and can better handle the fine textures. Comparative results for natural images validate that the proposed method can yield a visually pleasing result and better values of MSSIM and PSNR.",

A digraph of the aggregated relation on a set of alternatives for information of experts or criteria is preconstructed. If the digraph does not contain any cycles, then the Demukron algorithm for partitioning the digraph into levels can be used to order the alternatives by preference. This algorithm cannot be applied if there are clusters consisting of equivalent alternatives. In the paper the algorithm for partitioning an arbitrary digraph of into preference levels is proposed. In contrast to the standard procedure, the digraph of the aggregated relation admits the presence of cycles, and, consequently, of equivalent vertexes-alternatives. The vertexes in any cycle of digraph belong to one level of preference.",

    "abstract": "A community is the basic component structure of complex networks and is important for network analysis. In recent decades, researchers from different fields have witnessed a boom of community detection, and many algorithms were proposed to retrieve disjoint or overlapping communities. In this paper, a unified expansion approach is proposed to obtain two different network partitions, which can provide divisions with higher accuracies and have high scalability in large-scale networks. First, we define the edge intensity to quantify the densities of network edges, a higher edge intensity indicates a more compact pair of nodes. Second, vertices of higher density edges are extracted out and denoted as core nodes, whereas other vertices are treated as margin nodes; finally we apply an expansion strategy to form disjoint communities: closely connected core nodes are combined as disjoint skeleton communities, and margin nodes are gradually attached to the nearest skeleton communities. To detect overlapping communities, extra steps are adopted: potential overlapping nodes are identified from the existing disjoint communities and replicated; and communities that bear replicas are further partitioned into smaller clusters. Because replicas of potential overlapping nodes might remain in different communities, overlapping communities can be acquired. Experimental results on real and synthetic networks illustrate higher accuracy and better performance of our method.",

Based on research that addressed the relationship between antenna structure and electromagnetic wave frequency, this paper — in order to increase the frequency of electromagnetic waves — alters the charge distribution mode of the mechanical antenna while keeping the motor’s rotational speed constant to realize an increase of transmission signal frequency.

After the failures of dampers, especially in the case of the complete failure, the anti vibration effect of the friction is prominent. However, the nonlinear vibration response characteristics of the cab subject to the damper complete failure have not been revealed. In order to reveal the nonlinear vibration response characteristics, a dynamic model of the cab system was established and its vibration equations were given. The friction forces existing in the suspensions were determined by the bench test. The influences of the friction forces on the cab vibration under different amplitude harmonic inputs were investigated when the dampers completely fail. The cab vertical displacement changes with the excitation amplitude and the vibration represents various motion states, including the periodic motion, the quasi-periodic motion, and the chaotic motion. The simulation results show that when the dampers fail, the proper friction forces help to suppress the quasi-periodic motion and the chaotic motion of the cab and to reduce the amplitude of the periodic motion. The proper friction forces can make the cab movement far away from the chaos area. They also help to avoid the fatigue damage of the cab floor and suspension parts to improve the service life of the suspension parts and to reduce the maintenance cost of the cab suspensions.",

We examine attractor control and self-sustaining circuits within the cell cycle restriction switch, a bistable regulatory circuit that allows or prevents entry into the cell cycle. We explore this system using three models: a previously published Boolean model, a Hill kinetics model that we construct from the Boolean model using the HillCube methodology, and a reaction-based model we construct from the literature. We highlight the robustness of stable motifs across these three levels of modeling detail. We also show how consideration of control-robust regulatory circuits can aid in parameter specification.",

Some existing works tried to reproduce some of the complex characteristics of real traffic flow by taking into account the heterogeneous driving behavior, and the drivers are generally divided into two classes (including aggressive drivers and careful drivers) or three classes (including aggressive drivers, normal drivers and careful drivers). Nevertheless, the classification approaches have not been verified, and the rationality of the classifications has not been confirmed as well. In this study, the trajectory data of drivers is extracted from the NGSIM datasets. By combining the K-Means method and Silhouette measure index, the drivers are classified into four clusters (named as clusters A, B, C and D, respectively) in accordance with the acceleration and time headway. The two-dimensional approach is applied to analyze the characteristics of different clusters. Here, one dimension consists of “Cautious” and “Aggressive” behaviors in terms of velocity and acceleration, and the other dimension consists of “Sensitive” and “Insensitive” behaviors in terms of reaction time. Finally, the fuel consumption and emissions for different clusters are calculated by using the VT-Micro model. A surprising result indicates that overly “cautious” and “sensitive” behaviors may result in more fuel consumption and emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to find the balance between the driving characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Today, there exist many centrality measures for assessing the importance of nodes in a network as a function of their position and the underlying topology. One class of such measures builds on eigenvector centrality, where the importance of a node is derived from the importance of its neighboring nodes. For directed and weighted complex networks, where the nodes can carry some intrinsic property value, there have been centrality measures proposed that are variants of eigenvector centrality. However, these expressions all suffer from shortcomings. Here, an extension of such centrality measures is presented that remedies all previously encountered issues. While similar improved centrality measures have been proposed as algorithmic recipes, the novel quantity that is presented here is a purely analytical expression, only utilizing the adjacency matrix and the vector of node values. The derivation of the new centrality measure is motivated in detail. Specifically, the centrality itself is ideal for the analysis of directed and weighted networks (with node properties) displaying a bow-tie topology. The novel bow-tie centrality is then computed for a unique and extensive real-world dataset, coming from economics. It is shown how the bow-tie centrality assesses the relevance of nodes similarly to other eigenvector centrality measures, while not being plagued by their drawbacks in the presence of cycles in the network.",

Using these facts we can explain all interesting observable features of the aggregated demand: appearance of strong fluctuations, their periodicity, and existence of preferred levels. For another payoff, g(x) = x, the number of states is still finite and utility remains bounded but the number of states cannot be reduced and probabilities of states are not calculated.

The 1961–1991 Indian censuses report a sharper increase in Hindi/English Bilinguals compared to Monolingual Hindi speakers, suggesting that English is on the rise in India — and is out-competing Hindi. However, the 1991–2011 data show that Bilingual numbers have saturated, while Monolingual Hindi speakers continue to rise exponentially. To capture this counter-intuitive dynamic, we propose a novel language dynamics model of interaction between Monolingual Hindi speakers and Hindi/English Bilinguals, which captures the Indian census data of the last 50 years with greater accuracy, than other well-known language dynamics models. We thus provide a first example of a lower status language having out competed English, a higher status language.",

These beliefs are to different extents coherent with each other — this is modeled using a coherence function from possible sets of core beliefs to [-1, 1]. The social influence is achieved through gaining of a belief across a social link. Beliefs can be lost by being dropped from an agent's store. Both of these processes happen with a probability related to the change in coherence that would result in an agent's belief store.

The resultant mapping of the space of network topologies occupied by the most complex networks yields new insights into the relationship between network structure and function. The highest complexity networks are found within limited numerical ranges of clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, small-world index, and global efficiency. The widths of these ranges vary from quite narrow to modest, and provide a guide to the most productive regions of the space of neural topologies in which to search for complexity. Our demonstration that evolution selects for complex dynamics and small-world networks helps explain biological evidence for these trends and provides evidence for selection of these characteristics based purely on network function—with no physical constraints on network structure—thus suggesting that functional and structural evolutionary pressures cooperate to produce brains optimized for adaptation to a complex, variable world.",

One important problem here is concept drift, where global data patterns (movement, preferences, activities, etc.) change according to the actual set of participating users, the weather, the time of day, or as a result of events such as accidents or even natural catastrophes. In an important case — when the network is very large but only a few training samples can be obtained at each node locally — no efficient distributed solution is known that could follow concept drift efficiently. This case is characteristic of smart device platforms where each device stores only one local observation or data record related to a learning problem. Here we present two algorithms to handle concept drift. None of the algorithms collects data to a central location, instead models of the data perform random walks in the network, while being improved using an online learning algorithm. The first algorithm achieves adaptivity by maintaining young as well as old models in the network according to a fixed age distribution. The second one measures the performance of models locally, and discards them if they are judged outdated. We demonstrate through a thorough experimental analysis that our algorithms outperform the known competing methods if the number of independent local samples is limited relative to the speed of drift: a typical scenario in our targeted application domains. The two algorithms have different strengths: while the age distribution approach is very simple and efficient, explicit drift detection can be useful in monitoring applications to trigger control action.",

    "abstract": "The speed of social and technological changes is constantly increasing. Change is a pre-requisite for economic development but this increasing speed carries additional costs that may largely affect the ability of the social systems to adopt them. While the financial costs constitute a limit to adoption, the psychological and social costs may also profoundly change the adoption potential. In an agent-based model of a heterogeneous population of adopters we explore the consequences of increasing the speed of novelty introduction on their satisfaction and the degree to which new trends may permeate the system. We show that introduction speed has a diametrically different impact on different adopter groups: opinion leaders are most satisfied when the mainstream individuals are least content and vice versa. Moreover, introduction speed profoundly affects the ability of trends to penetrate the system — the lower the introduction speed, the higher the level of penetration of the social system. With high speed of introduction, only a small fraction of the most attractive novelties is able to permeate the system. In sum, these results show that both the wellbeing of the social system as well as its capacity to adopt novelties are dependent on the speed of change.",

The objective of this paper is to find an efficient network topology on a tactical level, which still satisfies the service level agreements on the operational level. We develop an optimization method, which constructs a tactical network topology based on the operational decisions resulting from a given model predictive control (MPC) policy. Experiments suggest that such a topology typically requires only a small fraction of all possible links. As expected, the found topology is sensitive to changes in supply and demand averages. Interestingly, the found topology appears to be robust to changes in second order moments of supply and demand distributions.",

After sorting the particles based on their grid index, neighbor search can be done quickly on GPU. Second, we propose a fast particle-boundary collision detection method. By precomputing the distance field of scene boundaries, collision detection's computing cost arrived as O(n), which is much faster than the traditional way. Third, we propose a pipeline with fine-detail surface reconstruction, and progressive photon mapping working on GPU. We experiment our algorithm on different situations and particle numbers of scenes, and find out that our method gets good results. Our experimental data shows that we can simulate 100K particles, and up to 1000K particles scene at a rate of approximately 2 times per second.",

    "abstract": "How can networking affect the turnout in an election? We present a simple model to explain turnout as a result of a dynamic process of formation of the intention to vote within Erdös–Rényi networks. Citizens have fixed preferences for one of two parties and are embedded in a social network. They decide whether or not to vote on the basis of the attitude of their immediate contacts. They may simply follow the behavior of the majority (followers) or make an adaptive local calculus of voting (calculators). So they have the intention of voting either when the majority of their neighbors are willing to vote too, or when they perceive in their social neighborhood that elections are \"close\". We study the long-run average intention to vote, interpreted as the actual turnout observed in an election. Depending on the values of the average connectivity and the probability of behaving as a follower/calculator, the system exhibits monostability (zero turnout), bistability (zero and moderate/high turnout) or tristability (zero, moderate and high turnout). By obtaining realistic turnout rates for a wide range of values of both parameters, our model suggests a mechanism behind the observed relevance of social networks in recent elections.",

The new metric is based on gossip spreading activity in the network, which is correlated with both topology and relative edge weights in the network. The model gives more insight about the weight distribution and correlation of topology with edge weights in a network. It also measures how suitable a weighted network is for gossip spreading. We analyze gossip spreading on real weighted networks of human interactions. Six co-occurrence and seven social pattern networks are investigated. Gossip propagation is found to be a good parameter to distinguish co-occurrence and social pattern networks. As a comparison some miscellaneous networks of comparable sizes and computer generated networks based on ER, BA and WS models are also investigated. They are found to be quite different from the human interaction networks.",

To overcome these shortcomings, a time series prediction method is presented based on the combination of OS-ELM with adaptive forgetting factor (AFF-OS-ELM) and bootstrap (B-AFF-OS-ELM). Firstly, adaptive forgetting factor is added into OS-ELM for adjusting the effective window length of training data during OS-ELM sequential learning phase. Secondly, the current bootstrap is developed to fit time series prediction online. Then associated with improved bootstrap, the proposed method can compute prediction interval as uncertainty information, meanwhile the improved bootstrap enhances prediction accuracy and stability of AFF-OS-ELM. Performances of B-AFF-OS-ELM are benchmarked with other traditional and improved OS-ELM on simulation and practical time series data. Results indicate the significant performances achieved by B-AFF-OS-ELM.",

Most of the existing partitioning methods suffer from a limitation that the buses within a cluster are severely topologically disconnected after partitioning in some cases. As a result, a cluster will inevitably be assigned to two or more power grid corporations. This assignment obstructs inner-cluster monitoring and control applications of the transmission system. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes a multi-index power grid partitioning approach using Monte Carlo simulation guaranteeing cluster connectivity to ensure the cluster autonomy. A line-based binary coding technique is developed to ensure the cluster connectivity. Three partitioning indices are considered: the coherency, the cluster connectivity, and the number of clusters. Finally, the proposed partitioning method is applied to IEEE 9-bus system, IEEE 39-bus system and IEEE 145-bus system and compared with Fuzzy C-medoid (FCMdd) algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid systems such as Cyber Physical System (CPS) are becoming increasingly popular, mainly due to the involvement of information technology in different aspects of life. For analysis and verification of hybrid system models, simulation is used extensively. As parts of a common hybrid system may belong to different domains of study, it is sometimes beneficial to use specialized simulation packages (SPs) for each domain. In this case, parts of a system are simulated in different SPs. The idea may seem simple, but coupling more than one simulation component presents challenges related to numerical stability. The presented article suggests an implicit solver coupling technique enhanced to facilitate simulation of hybrid models using multiple simulation components. The technique is developed using two of the most popular simulation interoperability standards, namely, the High Level Architecture and the Functional Mock-up Interface. By using these standards, the developed algorithm will be useful for a large number of practitioners and researchers. The developed algorithm is described using a generic distributed computation model, which makes it reproducible even without using the standards. For the verification of results, the algorithm is tested on two case studies. The results are compared to a monolithic simulator and the proximity of results initiates the validity of the developed algorithm.",

Picks did not meet the fatigue life when they were damaged by abrasion, so the pick fatigue life and strength are excessive. In the paper, in order to reduce the abrasion and save the materials, structure optimization was carried out. For static analysis and fatigue life prediction, the simulation program was proposed based on mathematical models to obtain the cutting resistance. Furthermore, the finite element models for static analysis and fatigue life analysis were proposed. The results indicated that fatigue life damage and strength failure of the cutting pick would never happen. Subsequently, the initial optimization model and the finite element model of picks were developed. According to the optimized results, a new type of pick was developed based on the working and installing conditions of the traditional pick. Finally, the previous analysis methods used for traditional methods were carried out again for the new type picks. The results show that new type of pick can satisfy the strength and fatigue life requirements.",

Such services can be found in different areas such as healthcare, social networks, urban transportation, and multimedia. Nowadays, there are a wide variety of services with similar functionalities in each of the abovementioned areas. Ranking these services based on quality of service (QoS) criteria can help the users to choose the most appropriate services that meet their preferences. The aim of this research is to create a comprehensive framework based on QoS criteria in ubiquitous environment to rank services. At first by extending the previous research, this paper gathers and classifies the QoS criteria into four classes of architecture, usability, ubiquity, and security. This classification organizes QoS criteria in a hierarchical structure. Afterward, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to propose a customized service ranking framework according to the values of each criterion. To utilize the opinions of experts of the subject, a questionnaire is designed to evaluate the proposed structure of QoS criteria and to determine the weight of each criterion. Finally, comparing the proposed framework with previous approaches indicates that this framework includes a complete set of criteria, which leads to a deep perception of QoS in a ubiquitous computing environment. Moreover, the computed inconsistency ratio indicates that the performed decision-making process has a reasonable consistency.",

We find that the emergence of even a small risk premium on government debt will trigger considerable instability in the real and nominal variables. We show that a switch to an exchange-rate rule for monetary policy would considerably moderate the instability induced by a rising risk premium.",

First, the model of HRM is established. Second, the proposed IGC method based on DSC and ADRC is designed. The stability of closed-loop system is proved strictly. It is worth mentioning that the ADRC technique is used to estimate and compensate the disturbance in the proposed IGC system. This makes the closed-loop system a better performance and reduces the chattering caused by lumped disturbances. Finally, a series of simulations and comparisons with a 6-DOF non-linear missile that includes all aerodynamic effects are demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed IGC method.",

We characterize how these two sources of heterogeneity interact to affect the probability and extent of financial contagions in three network structures. We find that greater heterogeneity has a stabilizing effect for networks that are sparsely connected and a destabilizing effect for networks that are highly interconnected. Finally, we consider multiple sequential shocks and find that when banks redistribute assets following an initial mild contagion it increases the stability, on average, of the system to subsequent shocks originating at weakened banks.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on the fossil record time series has suggested that there is consistent evidence for self-similarity i.e. long-range correlations with power-law behavior. The existence of such fractal strucutes means that, when looking at a given time frame, some basic properties remain the same if a change of scale is performed. In other words, there is no characteristic time scale, as we could expect if some type of periodic or other low-dimensional dynamics were present. A possible explanation for such long-range order is a dynamical process operating at all scales, as it is the case for systems in the neighborhood of critical points. In this paper these results are further explored by extending previous data analysis and examining the relevance of recent theoretical approaches to the statistical features of the fossil record. The presence of long-range correlations is shown through Hurst analysis using non-interpolated data series from the Fossil Record 2 database. As shown in previous studies, such correlations span over hundreds of millions of years and are compared with a simple model of large-scale evolution displaying self-organized criticality.",

The importance of coordination for social relations is reflected in common wisdom, where individuals who are connected by a satisfying social relationship are often termed to on the same wavelength or to resonate with one another, whereas those in a problematic relationship are said to be out of synch with each other. Coordination may take many different forms and involve different specific mechanisms. In organizations, for example, the coordination of individual actions is of the primary concern, since the productivity of the group depends to a high degree on the quality of coordination of individual actions. In close relationships, on the other hand, coordination of feelings and thoughts may be more important since it directly affects the degree of satisfaction with the relationship. The lack of synchrony and mutual understanding is a source of dissatisfaction in marriages and other close relationships. Despite the wide variety of phenomena associated with coordination, there is reason to believe that many aspects of coordination are invariant across phenomena.",

The macroeconomic price dynamic is a consequence of the cumulated excess demand/supply created on this micro level. The behavior analysis of a small number of agents is well understood through the game theory. In case of a large number of agents one may use the limiting case that an individual agent does not have an influence on the market, which allows the aggregation of agents by statistic methods. In contrast to this restriction, we can omit the assumption of an atomic market structure, if we model the market through a multi-agent approach. The contribution of the mathematical theory of neural networks to the market price formation is mostly seen on the econometric side: neural networks allow the fitting of high dimensional nonlinear dynamic models. Furthermore, in our opinion, there is a close relationship between economics and the modeling ability of neural networks because a neuron can be interpreted as a simple model of decision making. With this in mind, a neural network models the interaction of many decisions and, hence, can be interpreted as the price formation mechanism of a market.",

The disorder represents the punctuated resetting of 'normal' immune self-image to a self-attacking 'excited' state, a process formally analogous to models of punctuated equilibrium in evolutionary theory. Thus disease onset takes place in the context of a particular immunological 'cognitive module' similar to what has been proposed by evolutionary psychologists for the human mind. Disease progression involves interaction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which we also treat as a cognitive physiological submodule, with both immune cognition and an embedding pathogenic social hierarchy, a structured psychosocial stress which literally writes an image of itself on the course of the disorder. Both onset and progression may be stratified by a relation to cyclic physiological responses which are long in comparison with heartbeat period: circadian, hormonal, and annual light/temperature cycles. The high rate of lupus in African-American women suggests existence of a larger dynamic which entrains powerful as well as subordinate population subgroups, implying that the wide ranging programs of social and economic reform required to cause declines in disease among African-American women will bring significant benefit to all.",

The systems we investigate are called Sequential Dynamical Systems (SDSs), which are a class of dynamical systems that provide a framework for analyzing computer simulations. Specifically, an SDS consists of (i) a finite undirected graph Y with vertex set {1,2,…,n} where each vertex has associated a binary state, (ii) a collection of Y-local functions (F i,Y ) i∈ v [Y] with [Formula: see text] and (iii) a permutation π of the vertices of Y. The SDS induced by (i)–(iii) is the map [Formula: see text] The paper is motivated by a general reduction theorem for SDSs which guarantees the existence of a phase space embedding induced by a covering map between the base graphs of two SDSs. We use this theorem to obtain information about phase spaces of certain SDSs over binary hypercubes from the dynamics of SDSs over complete graphs. We also investigate covering maps over binary hypercubes, [Formula: see text], and circular graphs, Circ n . In particular we show that there exists a covering map [Formula: see text] if and only if 2 n ≡0 mod n+1. Furthermore, we provide an interpretation of a class of invertible SDSs over circle graphs as right-shifts of length n-2 over {0,1} 2n-2 . The paper concludes with a brief discussion of how we can extend a given covering map to a covering map over certain extended graphs.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a realistic mathematical model of fabric. In contrast to other studies on fabric modeling as a deformable surface, the model described in this article takes into account the geometry of the object. Moreover, it integrates the nonlinear phenomena of the dynamic behavior of material. As input parameters, the weaving data that define the 3D structure of the object and the mechanical properties of the yarn that express its dynamics are used. Thus, the fabric model is composed of a geometrical model of fabric (structure) on which a model of yarn (material characterization) is added. This hypothesis may be reasonable since a fabric shows the result of a three-dimensional assembly of yarns judiciously disposed. Since these yarns interact dynamically: the main difficulty consists of defining the yarn model. In our case, it is composed of various nonlinear functions representing the dynamic behavior of yarn. In order to characterize the flexibility of material, the weight, the elasticity and any other mechanical characteristics defining the relation between the strain and the stretching out of the shape should be taken into account. Firstly, several works dealing with realistic mathematical models of fabric are described. A taxonomic classification is achieved in order to position our study (in comparison to the scientific community). Secondly, the model of the fabric is described. A geometrical model of the object is presented. It allows one to dimension the object in a 3D space and then to position it at its initial state. Subsequently, a nodal model of yarns is described, step by step, in order to demonstrate the separability of the various dynamic behaviors. These nodal links make it simple to integrate the proposed model in the global geometrical model. Thus, the methods of numerical resolution used to simulate the complete model of the fabric are exposed. One method is selected and used in order to improve the performances of the fabric simulator and to obtain better stability. Several simulations illustrate the quality of the results obtained.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a simulation model of the behavior of industrial districts in the face of changes in their environment. By applying Kauffman's N/K-C model to the question of optimum governance in industrial districts facing an external shock, the paper sheds light on the optimum co-ordination mechanism among agents in interdependent industrial networks. Simulation results indicate that collective governance structures with agents adjusting for the sake of the district as a whole perform best in adaptation, whereas individualistic governance modes deliver the worst results. Alliance and leader firm governance forms position themselves in-between these two extremes. However, both modes of governance can be preferable to the collective one if the observation and punishment mechanisms in the district's local culture are not strong enough to impose solidarity among its agents. In this case, a prisoner's dilemma emerges and the collective governance form is replaced by the inferior individualistic one. Through these results, the model highlights the link between governance and district adaptability. It provides an explanation for the trend in Italian districts towards more hierarchical governance structures. Moreover, the identification of the role played by governance structure for district adaptability in changing environments could serve as guidance for future research.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an efficient numerical procedure is presented to implement the Gaussian Runge–Kutta (GRK) methods (also called Gauss methods). The GRK technique first discretizes each marching step of the initial value problem using collocation formulations based on Gaussian quadrature. As is well known, it preserves the geometric structures of Hamiltonian systems. Existing analysis shows that the GRK discretization with s nodes is of order 2s, A-stable, B-stable, symplectic and symmetric, and hence \"optimal\" for solving initial value problems of general ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, as the unknowns at different collocation points are coupled in the discretized system, direct solution of the resulting algebraic equations is in general inefficient. Instead, we use the Krylov deferred correction (KDC) method in which the spectral deferred correction (SDC) scheme is applied as a preconditioner to decouple the original system, and the resulting preconditioned nonlinear system is solved efficiently using Newton–Krylov schemes such as Newton–GMRES method. The KDC accelerated GRK methods have been applied to several Hamiltonian systems and preliminary numerical results are presented to show the accuracy, stability, and efficiency features of these methods for different accuracy requirements in short- and long-time simulations.",

With the accumulation of omics data, the network for molecule interactions in the cell cycle process will become much clearer. The identification of the crucial modules in a giant network and investigation of inherent control relations are very important to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of diseases for new drug design. The paper proposes novel techniques in analyzing such core regulatory modules based on network and system control theories. We initially define the degree of participation (DOP) and the rate of activity (ROA) for indentifying core module components, and then the diverse contribution elasticity functions for quantifying pairwise regulatory or control activities between those components, thus facilitating the decomposition of expanded core modules and the formation of feedback loops within the control schema. Motivated by the inherent regulatory mechanisms, we expound a kind of multiphase nonlinear adaptive control algorithm in repelling abnormal genetic mutations, which directly and indirectly impact cancer development in biological cells and organs. Experimental predictions are also elucidated within the work, helping those in vivo design, verification and performance evaluation.",

Nonetheless, in real-life scenarios cooperation does not collapse. Several explanations have been proposed in order to explain this phenomenon, such as punishment and signaling. In the present work, we investigate the effects of new elements associated with punishment upon signaling such as gossiping and bribery. Agents may denounce free-riders (who on their turn get punished) or may be bribed to remain silent and even spread rumors of false good behavior. Having a model with richer social mechanisms enable us to test how cooperation develops in situations in which players have social attachments. Our results show that when punishment and bribery are present, the levels of contribution are kept at a relatively higher value compared to the situation when no punishment is exercised. As to what regards gossiping, if the number of free-riders is high, finding mechanisms to prevent gossiping could be an important step in order to increase the contribution. If the ratio between free-riders and other agents is about one, then gossiping does affect contribution in a positive way.",

    "abstract": "The question of what properties of biological systems allow for efficient evolutionary search in complex fitness landscapes (evolvability) is one of the central interests both for the research in the field of evolutionary biology and artificial life. Here, we attempt to address this issue by using a model of 3D multicellular development in which cell fate is determined by differential gene expression in each cell. In our model, cells can vary in size and can move freely in 3D space, affected by forces of adhesion and repulsion. The development relies on an indirect mapping between the genotype and the morphology (the phenotype). Cell differentiation is allowed by positional information provided by diffusible factors. The state of the gene regulatory network (GRN) coded by the genome determines the cell fate (such as division, death, growth). The genetic elements in our systems define points in N-dimensional space. The connectivity in the GRN is determined by the proximity of these points; one can imagine the evolutionary process as their movement in space. Changing the number of dimensions of this space allows to ask directly the questions about the effect of the complexity of the search space on the efficiency of the evolutionary search. Higher dimensionality results in a larger search space, but in our model this search space can still be explored thanks to the action of genetic operators that allow for duplications of genetic elements, a mutational mechanism that allows for regulatory innovations in the network.",

    "abstract": "Crowds of people are often found in enclosed or constricted spaces. Evacuation in such situations is usually conducted calmly, but real or perceived danger may trigger panic. In panicked crowds, the interpersonal distance crowd members normally observe is often overwhelmed by the physical pressure of crowd members pushing against each other. That pressure can both slow evacuation and lead to injury or death. Models have been developed to study crowd evacuation in a range of situations. This paper describes the implementation, testing, and validation of a crowd evacuation model using Unity, a commercial computer game engine. A realistic physics-based model of crowd movement that calculates and considers the physical pressure crowd members exert on each other was implemented in Unity. The implemented model was tested under both nonpanicked and panicked scenarios; those tests exhibited known qualitative characteristics of such scenarios. The model was then quantitatively validated by comparing its results to the outcome of an actual evacuation event, the 2003 fire at The Station nightclub in Rhode Island. The implementation and validation show that Unity can be an effective tool for evacuation modeling.",

The trade-off between time-to-control and the minimum number of driven nodes is captured by the notion of the actuation spectrum (AS). We study the actuation spectra of a variety of artificial and real-world networked systems, modeled by fractional-order dynamics that are capable of capturing non-Markovian time properties with power-law dependencies. We find evidence that, in both types of networks, the actuation spectra are similar when the time-to-control is less or equal to about 1/5 of the size of the network. Nonetheless, for a time-to-control larger than the network size, the minimum number of driven nodes required to attain controllability in networks with fractional-order dynamics may still decrease in comparison with other networks with Markovian properties. These differences suggest that the minimum number of driven nodes can be used to determine the true dynamical nature of the network. Furthermore, such differences also suggest that new generative models are required to reproduce the actuation spectra of real fractional-order dynamical networks.",

We test our theoretical results on synthetic homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, as well as on a selection of large-scale real-world networks.

In this study, a multi-objective optimal control problem has been simulated to gauge the success of the lockdowns in India. To accomplish this objective, a system dynamics modeling was used to simulate the Susceptible–Infected–Quarantined–Removed epidemic model. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model’s behavior and its value for decision-makers regarding the lockdown intensity. The simulation of the model presents various scenarios, wherein the cost–benefit analysis of lockdown was done. Notably, the lockdown success intensity was defined, post which, the findings indicate that the states of Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Panjab, Jammu, Kashmir, Haryana, and Bihar have achieved more than 90% lockdown success intensity. Further, it was observed that these states could effectively implement lockdowns by strictly enforcing social distancing measures during the early stages of the virus spread, which in turn resulted in the high success rate of lockdowns.",

There exist many models for computing CEME simulation, including empirical models, half-empirical or half-deterministic models and deterministic models.

The ray tracing (RT) and parabolic equation (PE) methods are very suitable for large-scale CEME simulation. Based on the introduction of RT and PE, qualitative comparisons of the two methods are analyzed in view of algorithm theory, the category of the model, solution to the model and the application field, and then four specific indices are focused on to analyze the computational complexity, accuracy, speed and parallelism in details. The numerical experiments are presented by the three-dimensional (3D) RT method employing the software of Wireless InSite (WI) and a quasi-3DPE method using the sliced method. Although both RT and PE methods can achieve high speedup using coarse-grained parallel computing, the experimental results indicate that the PE method can obtain a higher speed than the RT method, and the two methods can acquire an approximate precision.

As the technology advances in terms of speed and density of circuit within a chip, the power dissipation increases exponentially. The packages are subjected to heating during fabrication, testing, and service. Due to the heterogeneous construction with wide mismatch of material properties, thermal stresses are induced which would result in mechanical failures such as cracking and delamination. It is essential to analyze the packages for thermal and stress fields and check their compliance with the design requirements. Earlier investigations were mostly based on approximate models such as plane-stress, plane-strain, and axisymmetric conditions. In reality, none of the packages satisfies the conditions associated with these models. In this work, 3D solid finite element with variable nodes, 8–21 nodes per element is employed. Software has been developed with the following features: sequentially coupled thermomechanical modeling, nonlinear transient solution capability, incompatible mode option when 8-node brick element is used, better estimation of nodal stresses by transformation from gauss point stresses, and quadratic criterion for delamination failure. A flipchip has been analyzed using the software developed for their thermal and stress fields. Numerical results indicate: the junction temperatures exceed the specification limits for higher heat dissipation, if appropriate cooling is not applied.

    "abstract": "Studies have revealed that some topological properties of complex networks are robust to random node failures, but highly sensitive to failures in nodes of high centrality (i.e., attacks). This work proposes mechanisms based on local information for detecting vulnerable network configurations and for promoting changes in the topology to mitigate the impact on network connectivity of successive node losses due to attacks and failures. Two scenarios were evaluated: with maintenance of the number of links in the network, and with the creation of new links. For the first case, we show that the removal of the most central nodes affects networks in such a way that is also difficult to preserve their main topological properties, although improvement in the values of global efficiency at the expense of a reduction of the local efficiency was observed. For the second scenario, there was a significant decrease in the impact from attacks and failures. Notably, for failures the connectivity properties not only remained almost unchanged, but in some cases considerably increased, thus improving the overall network performance. The results were also verified in some benchmark real-network topologies, and a comparative performance evaluation with a random self-regenerating process was also analyzed. The study demonstrates the importance and feasibility of local adaptation mechanisms for link rewiring based on the concept of vulnerability.",

The standard Euler-angle parametrization of three-dimensional rotations contains singular points in the coordinate space that can cause failure of both dynamical model and control. In order to avoid singularities, all the rotations of the microcopter are thus parametrized in terms of quaternions and an original proportional derivative (PD) regulator is proposed in order to control the dynamical model. Numerical simulations will be performed on symmetrical flight configuration, proving the reliability of the proposed PD control technique.",

The computed torque control method is applied first, which can provide satisfactory tracking responses for fish joints. Since this robotic fish is essentially an underactuated system, the reference trajectories for the orientation of the N links are planned in such a way that, at a neighborhood of the equilibrium point, the tracking task of N angles can be achieved by using N - 1 joint torques. To deal with parameter uncertainties that exist in the actual environment, sliding mode control is adopted. Considering feasibility and complexity issues, a simplified sliding mode control algorithm is given.

Our results indicate that cooperation levels are significantly lower for larger groups in contrast to the original pure strategy model. Here, defection behavior not only diminishes the public good, but also affects the expectations of group members leading conditional co-operators to change their strategies.

A key result is a sharp cultural boundary across which the agriculturalists' heritage changes from that of the invading population to that of the converts. Here we present an analytical study of the cultural boundary for some simple cases. We show that the width of the boundary is determined by human mobility and the strength of competition. Simulations for the full model give essentially the same result. The finite width facilitates irreversible gene flow between the populations, so over time genetic differences appear as gradients while e.g. linguistic barriers may remain sharp. We also examine the various assumptions of the model relating to purposeful versus. random movement of peoples and the competition between cultures, demonstrating its richness and flexibility.",

The optimization objective function is the consistency between the result of the inner loop and the experimental data.

Here, we propose that rather than taking established theories from the physical sciences and naively mapping them into the social world, the advanced concepts and theories of social psychology should be taken as a starting point, and used to develop a new modelling methodology. In order to illustrate how such an approach might be carried out, we attempt to model the low elaboration attitude changes of a society of agents in an evolving social context. We propose a geometric model of an agent in context, where individual agent attitudes are seen to self-organise to form ideologies, which then serve to guide further agent-based attitude changes. A computational implementation of the model is shown to exhibit a number of interesting phenomena, including a tendency for a measure of the entropy in the system to decrease, and a potential for externally guiding a population of agents towards a new desired ideology.",

    "abstract": "In cloud computing environment, load balancing delinquent arises when a large count of new IoT user requests are linked with specific fog nodes. So, a well-organized load balancing tactic is needed in cloud computing. Therefore, in this manuscript, a hybrid elephant herding optimization and harmony search algorithm (HSA) for potential load balancing in cloud environments (HEHO-HSA-PLB-CE) is effectively proposed for reducing task waiting time, load balancing rate, scheduling time, delay and energy consumption. The HEHO algorithm and HSA are mainly used for leveraging the allocation of virtual machine (VM) and incorporating an enhanced strategy of physical machine selection. The proposed HEHO-HSA-PLB-CE method aims at preventing the issue of premature convergence or the issue related to the solution falling at the point of local optimum. Finally, the proposed method potentially achieves load balance under the allocation of VM and enhancement of resource utilization in the cloud computing environment. The proposed approach is activated in CloudSim and the efficiency of the proposed method is assessed by evaluation metrics, such as response time, load balance rate, scheduling time, delay, energy consumption. Then, the simulation performance of the proposed method provides lower delay 32.82%, 25.32%, 29.34% and 34.18%, low energy consumption 38.22%, 25.46%, 42.12% and 15.34% compared with the existing methods, like Aquila optimizer for PLB in CE (AO-PLB-CE), arithmetic optimization algorithm for PLB in CE (AOA-PLB-CE), sine cosine algorithm for PLB in CE (SCA-PLB-CE), and enhanced krill herd algorithm for PLB in CE (EKHO-PLB-CE) respectively.",

    "abstract": "The so-called “Win-Continue, Lose-Reverse” (WCLR) rule is a simple iterative procedure that can be used to choose a value for any numeric variable (e.g., setting a price or a production level). The rule dictates that one should evaluate the effect on profits of the last adjustment made to the value (e.g., a price variation), and keep on changing the value in the same direction if the adjustment led to greater profits, or reverse the direction of change otherwise. Somewhat surprisingly, this simple rule has been shown to lead to collusive outcomes in Cournot oligopolies, even though its application requires no information about the other firms’ profits or choices. In this paper, we show that the convergence of the WCLR rule toward collusive outcomes can be very sensitive to small independent perturbations in the cost functions or in the income functions of the firms. These perturbations typically push the process toward the Nash equilibrium of the one-shot game. We also explore the behavior of WCLR against other strategies and demonstrate that WCLR is easily exploitable. We then conduct a similar analysis of the WCLR rule in a differentiated Bertrand model, where firms compete in prices.",

We apply citation network visualization and Latent Dirichlet allocation topic analysis to three different paradigms defined pragmatically as the set of papers citing a highly influential paper in each respective case. Our three case studies indicate a founder effect in how the seminal paper is highly-embedded in the citation network, and yet peripheral to the evolution of topics in subsequent “layers” of publications within the paradigm.

    "abstract": "Three transmit antennas Uncoded Space-Time Labeling Diversity (USTLD) systems were recently proposed as a direct extension to the two transmit antennas USTLD system. By employing more antennas at the transmitter, antenna — as well as — labeling diversity (LD) can be further achieved. Existing mapper designs for three transmit antennas USTLD systems are based on symmetrical heuristics, and hence no asymmetrical mapper designs can be produced. This paper proposes a multi-function optimization genetic algorithm for the three transmit antennas USTLD system that produces mapper designs irrespective of size or symmetry. The genetic algorithm was tested on 16-, 32QAM, 16-, 32APSK and 16APSK constellations that do not exhibit diagonal symmetry. The proposed genetic algorithm had produced mapper designs that match but did not improve upon existing mapper designs for 16QAM and 32QAM, respectively. The 16APSK and 32APSK mapper designs produced achieved diversity gains of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] when compared to existing third mapper designs, as well as [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] gain over the two transmit antennas USTLD scheme at the BER of [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, when tested on 16APSK constellations that do not exhibit diagonal symmetry, these mappers achieved diversity gains between [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] over the two-transmit USTLD scheme at the BER of [Formula: see text], respectively. The computational complexity of the proposed genetic algorithm was analyzed based on a previous study, which was shown to be [Formula: see text].",

    "abstract": "Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) can be treated as an emerging technology that has the ability to handle the physical process and computational view of interlinked systems. At the same time, the high-performing processing capability provides assurance of CPS applications in real time. Besides, task scheduling is considered as the Nondeterministic Polynomial (NP)-hard problem and optimal allocation of tasks is important for the CPS environment. The primary concept of the optimum energy-based scheduling approach searches for the physical host allocation vector to the allotted virtual machine with an aim of reducing energy utilization. The multiple processor packet scheduling technique defined that every task in the system is already divided into processors by the task allocating scheme and every process can execute on the distinct or identical single processor scheduling technique. With this motivation, this paper presents a new quantum invasive weed optimization-based energy-aware scheduling (QIWO-EATS) technique for the CPS environment. The goal of the QIWO-EATS technique is to assign [Formula: see text] autonomous tasks to [Formula: see text] dissimilar resources, and thereby the whole task completion duration gets reduced and resources are completely used. The proposed model has been simulated using the MATLAB tool. The experimental results highlighted the better outcomes of the QIWO-EATS technique over the recent approaches in terms of several evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of 3D scanning has allowed us to digitally capture cultural heritage objects as large-scale point clouds, recording their complex internal and external structures. We have developed a 3D multi-view transparent visualization using edge highlighting as visual guide, improving accuracy of perceived depth for reliable visual analyses of the 3D scanned point clouds. When transparently visualizing a 3D object on a 3D multi-view display, the depth information tends to become less distinct. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether emphasizing the statistically extracted 3D edges of the scanned object can enhance the perceived depth of transparently visualized 3D objects. We conducted psychophysical experiments where participants were asked to report their perceived magnitudes of depth for multiple types of 3D structures of cultural heritage presented on a multi-view 3D display. The results indicated that our edge highlighting reduced the underestimation of depth from 46.8% to 34.0% on average. This improvement persisted even when the 3D structures produced an atypical linear perspective, normally caused by reverse depths, where the front and back are reversed. These findings suggest that edge highlighting brings us an effective visual guide to improve the accuracy of perceived depths on a 3D multi-view display.",

    "abstract": "The MeanShift algorithm is a nonparametric method based on gradient ascent and it can effectively handle complex variations in lychee orchard scenes as well as changes in lychee tree canopies due to its adaptability, multi-scale analysis capabilities, and robustness, making it widely used in the segmentation processing of drone-based remote sensing images of lychee orchards. However, due to the high computational complexity of the MeanShift algorithm, its performance in processing large-scale drone remote sensing images of lychee tree canopies is not highly efficient, leading to low segmentation efficiency, which hampers its broader application. To address these issues, this study proposes high-speed MeanShift parallel segmentation algorithms for drone remote sensing images of lychee tree canopies based on MapReduce and Spark distributed computing frameworks. In this study, a cluster consisting of four nodes with Hadoop and Spark was set up, and 4000 drone remote sensing images were used as test data to evaluate the algorithm. Experimental results show that, the MeanShift algorithm based on MapReduce reduced the task execution time by 86.1% compared to the traditional MeanShift algorithm, while the MeanShift algorithm based on Spark reduced the task execution time by 88.0%, without compromising segmentation accuracy. The MeanShift parallel segmentation algorithm based on Hadoop and Spark platform can overcome the bottleneck of task execution efficiency and significantly enhance computational speed on a single machine.",

Today, scientific communities in fields like Computational Social Science, Network Science, Complex Systems, Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, and the broader AI field are increasingly starting to pay attention to these pressing issues. However, are sophisticated data driven tools ready to be used for solving real-world problems with imperfect data and of staggering complexity? We outline the current state-of-the-art and identify barriers, which need to be surmounted in order for data-driven technologies to become useful in humanitarian and development contexts.

WHO initiated compulsory vaccination for children who are at age of 12 months to 12 years, since 1967. Children must take two doses of vaccination for mumps. The dynamics of the system describing the mumps transmission is studied in this work. The main aim is to elucidate the nonlinear behavior of the system which can provide insights into the long-term effects of Mumps infection on auditory function. As the fractional-order derivative preserves the impact of system memory, we employ the Caputo fractional derivative as the dynamical system describing modeling to simulate hearing loss in children brought on by the mumps virus. The boundedness existence of the solution and stability analysis of the dynamical system are derived in the framework. The result is derived using a well-known numerical method to capture the corresponding consequences and predict the future consequence of the dynamical system associated with parameters. To testify to the importance of the generalizing classical model with a fractional operator, we plot 2D graphs.

Due to issues with data scalability and real-time analytics, advanced methods are required to extract useful information from the massive, ever-changing datasets produced by smart grids. This research proposed a Dynamic Resource Cloud-based Processing Analytics (DRC-PA), which integrates cloud-based processing and analytics with dynamic resource allocation algorithms. Computational resources must be able to adjust the changing grid circumstances, and DRC-PA ensures that big data analysis can scale as well. The DRC-PA method has several potential uses, including power grid optimization, anomaly detection, demand response, and predictive maintenance. Hence the proposed technique enables smart grids to proactively adjust to changing conditions, boosting resilience and sustainability in the energy ecosystem. A thorough simulation analysis is carried out using realistic circumstances within smart grids to confirm the usefulness of the DRC-PA approach. The methodology is described in the intangible, showing how DRC-PA is more efficient than traditional methods because it is more accurate, scalable, and responsive in real-time. In addition to resolving existing issues, the suggested method changes the face of contemporary energy systems by paving the way for innovations in grid optimization, decision assistance, and energy management.",

    "abstract": "Due to technical limitations and the characteristics of the launch power system propellant, its support capability is affected by many factors and links. In the process of mission support, it is necessary to consider both its quality characteristics and the safety during the support process, which bring difficulties to the accuracy of its support capability evaluation. In this regard, the evaluation indexes system is constructed according to the requirements of total quality management theory, process safety management theory and equipment support characteristics. In the process of setting the indexes system, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method (TOPSIS method) is used to screen the indexes to make indexes setting more scientific. The subjective weights obtained by the order relation analysis method (G1 method) and the objective weights obtained by the entropy weight method (EW method) are combined by the game theory combination weighting method to obtain the indexes combination weights, which reduce the error of weight calculation. The two-dimensional cloud model is used to evaluate support capability of the launch power system propellant from the two dimensions of quality management capability and safety management capability, which can reflect the support capability more comprehensively and accurately. Through example verification, the closeness of support capability of the launch power system propellant to the evaluation grades of ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘average’, ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ is calculated to be 0.2333, 5.1169, 0.3579, 0.1821 and 0.1041, respectively, indicating that the evaluation results are closer to good. Finally, compared with the existing one-dimensional cloud model evaluation method, the superiority of this research method is highlighted, which has a certain guiding role in improving its support capability.",

According to the nonlinear transmission characteristics of the harmonic drive, the effects of hysteresis characteristics, nonlinear friction, transmission error, and temperature on the friction loss of the harmonic drive were analyzed. With rated and peak torques of 0.4[Formula: see text]Nm and 1.44[Formula: see text]Nm, respectively, the theoretical calculations of friction loss inside the harmonic drive and simulations on the co-simulation platform to verify the results were performed. The theoretical analysis yielded friction loss rates of 8.54% and 10.41%, and the co-simulation platform yielded friction loss rates of 9.64% and 12.08%. The simulation results are consistent with the theoretical analysis, and the constructed integrated joint dynamics model is accurate. The scheme used to obtain the joint torque by measuring the deformation of the flexure wheel was found to be feasible; however, the friction loss compensation generated during the transmission process needs to be considered in practical working conditions. By analyzing the friction loss of integrated joints, this study provides the theoretical basis for the torque control of robot joints.",

Medical professionals often find it challenging to detect disorders by themselves appropriately; it is crucial to recognize and anticipate them early on. This paper aims to detect and predict people with more widespread chronic illnesses. To prevent such diseases from worsening, this research proposes a new deep learning-based technique to predict chronic diseases. Initially, patient data will be collected using Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Then, the missing values from input data are eliminated, and categorical data encoding, outlier detection, and data transformation are performed in the pre-processing stage. After that, the necessary attributes are selected to optimize the performance by eliminating unnecessary features using Binary Grasshopper Whale Optimization Algorithm (BGWOA), which combines the benefits of the Binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (BGOA) and Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (BWOA) algorithms. Then, the disease can be classified as chronic or not, utilizing a three-layer stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (TLSBLSTM) technique. The performance is evaluated on two chronic disease datasets that are publicly available. It successfully obtained good results by preparing the dataset on heart disease and comparing the findings using the most recent state-of-the-art approaches. According to the experimental findings, the proposed approach performs better in evaluating performance measures than the existing approaches. The observed accuracy of the proposed method is 99.87% and 99.84% for chronic kidney disease dataset and cardiovascular disease dataset, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The most fatal disease on the earth is thought to be illness of the heart. There are a lot of features that change the heart’s composition or functionality. In most cases, it is hard for doctors to make a diagnosis accurately and quickly. This study’s objective is to determine critical factors and methods of data mining which can improve the accuracy for prediction of heart disease. Further, it is essential to make use of automatic technologies in diagnosing heart diseases as early as possible. To develop a new prediction technique for heart disease that comprises four phases such as “(a) Pre-processing, (b) Feature extraction, (c) Feature selection and (d) Classification”. The initial stage of pre-processing is when the incoming data is treated to the elimination of redundant and missed numbers. Then, from the initial stage of data, the higher-order statistical and statistical characteristics, chi-squared features and symmetrical uncertainty attributes are derived. However, when working with a greater number of characteristics, the curse of dimensionality was a severe issue. Hence, the characteristics of optimal features are planned from the overall set of features. A novel Hybrid Bull and Elephant Algorithm (HB-EA) is introduced for the selection of optimal features. Consequently, the selected set of features is subjected to various classifiers as an ensemble model that contains “Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Optimized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Linear Regression (LR)”. The final step is to log off efficiency for outputs obtained from the group of classifiers and determine the outcome. The RNN weights are ideally tuned by the suggested HB-EA technique to boost the system’s accuracy. The proposed model is finally evaluated against existing techniques to determine its superiority. The suggested technique for dataset 1 achieved maximum accuracy (0.916), and it is 15.24%, 8.76%, 7.56%, 4.09% and 1.89% better than convolution schemes like Random Forest (RF), Deep Belief Network (DBN), SVM, [Formula: see text]-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) models.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary model of industrial dynamics, presented in this paper, can be classified as Schumpeterian one. The model describes the behaviour of a number of competing firms producing functionally equivalent products. Each firm tries to improve its position in the industry and in the market by introducing innovations in order to minimize the unit costs of production, maximize the productivity of capital, and maximize the competitiveness of its products on the market. The problem how decisions are made seems to be crucial for relevant modelling of socio-economic processes. The main aim of the simulations presented in the second part of the paper is to show how fluctuations and discontinuities occurs in economic processes due to boundedly rational decisions of competing firms. It is shown how fluctuation of 3–6 years and of 10 years periodicity can occur in an industry development because of firms' bounded rationality. Long waves of development of 50–60 years period (Kondratieff cycles) occur in the model because of radical innovation emergence at the maturity phase of an 'old' technology.",

In this study, we simulate this process by representing social communication as a Random Boolean Network in which the individuals are nodes, and each node's state represents an opinion (yes/no) about some issue. Television is modelled as having a direct link to every node in the network. Two scenarios were considered. First, we found that, except in the most well connected networks, television rapidly breaks down cohesion (agreement in opinion). Second, the introduction of Hebbian learning leads to a polarizing effect : one subgroup strongly retains the original opinion, while a splinter group adopts the contrary opinion. The system displays criticality with respect to connectivity and the level of exposure to television. More generally, the results suggest that patterns of communication in networks can help to explain a wide variety of social phenomena.",

For a population with small autonomous groups with collective monitoring, the interplay of intra- and intergroup dynamics shows this to be an adaptive trait, although not fully invasive of a selfish population. However, the absence of collective monitoring in a larger society changes the evolution dynamics.

    "abstract": "Drawing inspiration from social interactions in nature, the field of swarm intelligence has presented a promising approach to the design of complex systems consisting of numerous, usually homogeneous, simple parts, to solve a wide variety of problems. Like cellular automata, swarm-intelligence systems involve highly parallel computations across space, based heavily on self-organization, the emergence of global behavior through local interactions of components, and the absence of centralized or global control. However, this has a disadvantage as the desired behavior of a system becomes hard to predict or design based on its local interaction rules. In our ongoing research, we propose to provide greater control over a system, and potentially more useful, goal-oriented behavior, by introducing layered, hierarchical controllers in the particles or components. The layered controllers allow each particle to extend their reactive behavior in a more goal-oriented style, while keeping the locality of the interactions and the general simplicity of the system. In this paper, we present three systems designed using this approach: a competitive foraging system, a system for the collective transport and distribution of goods, and a self-assembly system capable of creating complex structures in a 3D world. Our simulation results show that in all three cases it was possible to guide the self-organization process at different levels of the designated task, suggesting that the self-organizing behavior of swarm-intelligence systems may be extendable to support problem solving in various contexts, such as coordinated robotic teams.",

In this paper, we describe the peculiarity of the articulated set of tools that should be used to support planning, allowing the setting up and management of processes of participation and communication tailored to the needs of specific projects — a set of friendly tools that make the relationship between technicians, clients and users effective and efficacious. Following this discussion we present a very flexible software environment based on cellular automata (Cellular Automata General Environment — CAGE) that can be used to simulate planning decisions and can be coupled with other modules dealing with the \"social side\" of complexity.",

But, of course, in human subjects experiments the basic question of what the human agents' behavior is remains open. We build an artificial agent-based model to show that the path of convergence needs more intelligence than the zero-intelligence framework. Results from experimental economics with human agents reproduced with artificial agents at a low cost and with an increase in the reliability of the experiment.

    "abstract": "In cloud computing, a lot of challenges like the server failures, loss of confidentiality, improper workloads, etc. are still bounding the efficiency of cloud systems in real-world scenarios. For this reason, many research works are being performed to overcome the shortcoming of existing systems. Among them, load balancing seems to be the most critical issue that worsen the performance of the cloud sector, and hence there necessitates the optimal load balancing with optimal task scheduling. With the intention of accomplishing optimal load balancing by effectual task deployment, this paper plans to develop an advanced load balancing model with the assistance acquired from the metaheuristic algorithms. Usually, handling of tasks in cloud system is an NP-hard problem and moreover, nonpreemptive independent tasks are crucial in cloud computing. This paper goes with the introduction of a new optimal load balancing model by considering three major objectives: minimum makespan, priority, and load balancing, respectively. Moreover, a new single-objective function is also defined that incorporates all the three objectives mentioned above. Furthermore, the deployment of tasks must be optimal and for this a new hybrid optimization algorithm referred as Firefly Movement insisted WOA (FM-WOA) is introduced. This FM-WOA is the conceptual amalgamation of standard Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Firefly (FF) algorithm. Finally, the performances of the proposed FM-WOA model is compared over the conventional models with the intention of proving its efficiency in terms of makespan, task completion (priority), and degree of imbalance as well.",

These data, when subjected to clustering and classification procedures, can assist in identifying patterns and providing insight on biological processes. To understand the properties of complex gene expression datasets, graphical representations can be used. Intuitively, the data can be represented in terms of a bipartite graph, with weighted edges corresponding to gene-sample node couples in the dataset. Biologically meaningful subgraphs can be sought, but performance can be influenced both by the search algorithm, and, by the graph-weighting scheme and both merit rigorous investigation. In this paper, we focus on edge-weighting schemes for bipartite graphical representation of gene expression. Two novel methods are presented: the first is based on empirical evidence; the second on a geometric distribution. The schemes are compared for several real datasets, assessing efficiency of performance based on four essential properties: robustness to noise and missing values, discrimination, parameter influence on scheme efficiency and reusability. Recommendations and limitations are briefly discussed.",

In this article response threshold models which incorporate dynamic environments with varying demand for work and their influence on division of labor are studied. In their natural habitats, social insects are always exposed to dynamic environments, however, the effect that such environments have on response threshold models has rarely been investigated. In the course of this article it is shown that overworking and underworking, i.e. working more or less than the ideal amount, over a certain time is a colony-size dependent effect in dynamic situations. By adjusting the number of possible learning steps, which correspond to changes in the maximal threshold values relative to a colony's size, the performance of colonies in dynamic environments can be increased. A setup inspired by repeated migration behavior is also investigated. It is shown that these different learning rates affect a colony's ability to maintain an activity onset for a reappearing task.",

    "abstract": "By using information theory to reduce the state space of sensor arrays, such as receptive fields, for AI decision making we offer an adaptive algorithm without classical biases of hand coded approaches. This paper presents a way to build an acyclic directed graph to organize the sensor inputs of a visual receptive field. The Information Distance Metric is used to repeatedly select two sensors, which contain the most information about each other. Those are then encoded to a single variable, of equal alphabet size, with a deterministic mapping function that aims to create maximal entropy while maintaining a low information distance to the original sensors. The resulting tree determines which sensors are fused to reduce the input data while maintaining a maximum of information. The structure adapts to different environments of input images by encoding groups of preferred line structures or creating a higher resolution for areas with simulated movement. These effects are created without prior assumptions about the sensor statistics or the spatial configuration of the receptive field, and are cheap to compute since only pair-wise informational comparison of sensors is used.",

    "abstract": "Molecular mechanics-based finite element (FE) models of graphene sheet and single-walled zigzag and armchair carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are developed on the basis of the assumption that the carbon nanostructures, when loaded, behave like frame structures. The behavior of carbon–carbon bonds, which are represented by beam elements, is simulated using the many-body second generation reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential. By means of the FE models, the tensile behavior of carbon nanostructures is simulated. The FE models are verified against molecular dynamics simulations. The computed results in terms of tensile stress–strain curves and fracture patterns are compared with results obtained using the pairwise modified-Morse potential. Different tensile properties and fracture patterns are predicted using the two potentials. This is mainly attributed to the deviations in the force–bond length curves and to the contribution of bond angle variation which is present in REBO. The present work is the first attempt to implement the REBO potential into a continuum model of carbon nanostructures and paves the way for a more systematic incorporation of atomistic simulation methods into continuum models.",

To understand the simulation result for scientists, conventional visualization methods based on 2-dimensional cloud classification are not enough for understanding individual clouds and their physical characteristics. In this study, we propose a new 3-dimensional extraction and classification method of simulated clouds based on their 3-dimensional shape and physical properties. Our proposed method extracts individual clouds by cloud water and cloud ice, and classifies them into six types by their altitude and upward flow. We applied the method to time-varying atmospheric simulation data, and attempted to visualize atmospheric phenomena on the tropics such as developing cumulonimbus and tropical cyclone. Two case studies clearly visualize the behavior of individual cloud type and clarify that some cloud types have a relationship with rainfall during active weather phenomena. The proposed method has the potential to analyze such phenomena that develop in the vertical direction as well as the horizontal direction.",

    "abstract": "Personalization is the adaptation of the services to fit the user’s interests, characteristics and needs. The key to effective personalization is user profiling. Apart from traditional collaborative and content-based approaches, a number of classification and clustering algorithms have been used to classify user related information to create user profiles. However, they are not able to achieve accurate user profiles. In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm, namely Multi-Dimensional Clustering (MDC), to determine user profiling. The MDC is a version of the Instance-Based Learner (IBL) algorithm that assigns weights to feature values and considers these weights for the clustering. Three feature weight methods are proposed for the MDC and, all three, have been tested and evaluated. Simulations were conducted with using two sets of user profile datasets, which are the training (includes 10,000 instances) and test (includes 1000 instances) datasets. These datasets reflect each user’s personal information, preferences and interests. Additional simulations and comparisons with existing weighted and non-weighted instance-based algorithms were carried out in order to demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithm. Experimental results using the user profile datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better clustering accuracy performance compared to other algorithms. This work is based on the doctoral thesis of the corresponding author.",

In the field of equipment maintenance support, the outstanding problem of equipment remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is analyzed, i.e., the stable model parameters without self-evolution ability, which has become the primary factor that hinders self-adaptive prediction of equipment RUL. Combined with parallel systems theory, the equipment RUL prediction oriented symbiotic simulation framework is proposed on the basis of modeling analysis and Wiener state space model (SSM) is taken as the basic simulation model in the framework. Driven by the dynamic injected equipment degradation observation data, the model parameters are updated online by using expectation maximum (EM) algorithm and the data assimilation between simulation outputs and observation data is executed by using Kalman filter, so as to realize dynamic evolution of the simulation model. The simulation model evolution which makes the simulation outputs close to equipment real degradation state provides high fidelity model and data for predicting equipment RUL accurately. The framework is verified by the performance degradation data of a bearing. The simulation results show that the symbiotic simulation method can accurately simulate the equipment performance degradation process and the self-adaptive prediction of equipment RUL is realized on the basis of improving prediction accuracy, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of symbiotic simulation method.",

Analyzing financial markets as complex systems is a framework that has demonstrated great promises, with the use of agent-based models (ABMs) and the inclusion of network science playing an important role in increasing the relevance of the framework. Using an artificial stock market created via an ABM, this paper provides a significant insight into the mechanisms that drive the returns in financial markets, including periods of elevated prices and excess volatility. The paper demonstrates that the network topology that investors form and the dividend policy of firms significantly affect the behavior of the market. However, if investors have a bias to following their neighbors then the topology becomes redundant. By successfully addressing these issues this paper helps refine and shape a variety of additional research tasks for the use of ABMs in uncovering the dynamics of financial markets.",

Complex dynamics has been previously found in the systems of multiple learning agents interacting via a simple game. Meanwhile, the single agent adaptation is considered trivially stable. We advocate the idea that adopting a more complex model of the individual behavior may result in a more diverse spectrum of macro-level behaviors. We develop an adaptation model based on the reinforcement learning framework extended by an additional processing channel. We scrutiny the dynamics of the single agent adapting to the unknown environment; the agent is biased by novelty seeking, the intrinsic inclination for exploration. We demonstrate that the behavior of the novelty-seeking agent may be inherently unstable. One of the surprising results is that under certain conditions the increase of the novelty-seeking level may cause the agent to switch from the non-rational to the strictly rational behavior. Our results give evidence to the hypothesis that the intrinsic motives of agents should be paid no less attention than the extrinsic ones in the models of complex socio-economic systems.",

If a typical opinion dynamics model is applied to a network with a community structure, the network can separate in two groups of nodes. Such bisection in a given network can arise in many different ways depending on the initial conditions. The opinion distance between two nodes is defined as the probability of disagreement, or the probability that the two nodes belong to different bisections in multiple Monte Carlo simulations. The communities can be defined in terms of the distance. Closer nodes belong to the same community. Three opinion dynamics models were tested to show how the method works. Through various example networks, it was shown that the distance data can be used as a unique metric for identifying hierarchical structures and overlapping nodes in networks, as well as for identifying the community structure itself.",

Using the framework of the information bottleneck (IB) method, we relate optimality to two aspects: the complexity and the predictive capacity of the retained measurement. Then, with a focus on agent-based models (ABMs), we analyze the solution space of the resulting optimization problem in a generic fashion. We show that, when dealing with a class of feasible measurements that are consistent with the agent structure, this solution space has interesting algebraic properties that can be exploited to efficiently solve the problem. We then present results of this general framework for the voter model (VM) with several topologies and show that, especially when predicting the state of some sub-part of the system, multilevel measurements turn out to be the optimal predictors.",

It is used extensively to solve complex nonalgorithmic problems such as prediction, pattern recognition and clustering. However, in the context of a holistic study, there may be a need to integrate ANN with other models developed in various paradigms to solve a problem. In this paper, we suggest discrete event system specification (DEVS) be used as a model of computation (MoC) to make ANN models interoperable with other models (since all discrete event models can be expressed in DEVS, and continuous models can be approximated by DEVS). By combining ANN and DEVS, we can model the complex configuration of ANNs and express its internal workings. Therefore, we are extending the DEVS-based ANN proposed by Toma et al.

Second, the inconsistent data are eliminated based on identical values. Third, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to overcome the limitations caused by high-volume data. Finally, enter the reduced size database in the proposed neural network (DNN) classifier and classify the input data as normal or abnormal. We implement the suggested method using Python and we inspect the performance in terms of different metrics.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an efficient Twice Finite Point-set Method (TFPM) coupled with difference scheme is proposed to solve the time-fractional Cahn–Hilliard (TF-CH) equation, and then it is extended to predict the phase separation process under nonlocal memory dominated by two-component TF-CH equations for the first time. The proposed meshless schemes are motivated by the following: (a) a high-order accuracy difference scheme is employed to approximate the time Caputo fractional derivative; (b) the fourth-order spatial derivative is divided into two second-order derivatives, and it is discretized by the FPM scheme continuously twice based on Taylor expansion and weighted least squares; (c) the Neumann boundary can be accurately imposed on the FPM scheme. In the numerical experiments, the error and numerical convergence of the proposed meshless method are first tested, which has near second-order convergent rate. Subsequently, the evolution of phase separation under memory dominated by single CH equation versus time is numerically investigated by the proposed method, and compared with the results in other literatures. The influence of fractional parameter on the separation phenomena is also discussed. Finally, the proposed method is used to predict the phase separation process under different parameters dominated by coupled TF-CH equations. All the numerical results show that the proposed coupled method is accurate in solving the TF-CH and efficient in predicting the phase separation evolution.",

    "abstract": "A network analysis of the structure of verbal communications in one of the most popular Russian novels of the Soviet era The Master and Margarita by M. A. Bulgakov has been carried out. The structure of the novel is complex, i.e. there is “a story within a story”. Moreover, the real-world-characters and the other-world-characters are interacting in the novel. This complex and unusual composition makes the novel especially attractive for a network analysis. In our study, only paired verbal communications (conversations) between explicitly present and acting characters have been taken into account; frontal communications, monologues, off-stage characters as well as expected connections between characters have not been taken into account. Based on a character pair verbal communication matrix, a graph has been constructed, the vertices of which are the characters of the novel, while the edges correspond to the connections between them. Taking only paired verbal communications into account leads to the result that the character network can be described by an ordinary, rather than a directed graph. Since the activity of the conversations was out of our intended scope, the edges have been given no weights. The largest connected component of the graph consists of 76 characters. Centralities, such as degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and assortativity coefficient were computed to characterize the network. The assortativity coefficient of the network under consideration is negative [Formula: see text], i.e. the network does not demonstrate the properties of a social network. The structure of the communities in the network was also analyzed. In addition to the obvious large communities — the characters from the Yershalaim part of the novel and the characters of the Moscow part — the analysis also revealed a fine structure in the Moscow component. Using the analysis of centralities, a group of main characters has been detected. The central characters of the novel are Koroviev, Margarita, Bezdomny, Woland, Behemoth, Azazello, Bosoi, Warenukha, Master, and Levi Matthew.",

    "abstract": "Genetic oscillators have been widely used in modeling key processes of biological systems, especially cell cycles and circadian rhythms. In particular, repressilatory genetic oscillators have been employed in modeling the dynamics of mRNA and protein interactions with transcriptional and translational feedback loops at the molecular level. In addition, synchronization of these oscillators is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the associated biological processes. In this paper, models of fractional-order genetic oscillators and their coupling are established, where the aspects of time delay, coupling strength, noise, and stability are all taken into consideration. Communication in the proposed coupling model is based on quorum sensing. The synchronization of the fractional-order repressilator model has been examined through simulations which show three main findings. Firstly, the synchronization of the fractional-order repressilator model can be optimized through coupling weight selection. Secondly, the synchronization can be enhanced by increasing the fractional order and decreasing the time delay and the noise intensity. Finally, transitions between the states of the fractional-order repressilatory oscillator can be achieved through varying the fractional order. The simulation results verify the biological relevance of the genetic oscillator models, and their potential for explaining the underlying mechanisms of the associated biological processes.",

Being able to interact in real-time with digital and spatial information offers further chances in order to manipulate medical data efficiently and easily. In fact, surgeons encounter multiple challenges handling digital patient data during surgical interventions. Multiple techniques are invested in order to visualize the operative areas, as for example fluoroscopy and ultrasound methods. The latter display certain deficiencies. Therefore, the AR technique can stand for a good candidate in order to project a 3D model of a target organ into the surgeon’s perspective and view field so as to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the medical intervention intraoperatively. The basic target of this paper is to simulate a generated biomechanical model of the liver organ and visualize its deformations through the use of an AR headset during the open surgery.

Additionally, sensor-based SCSLR methods cannot achieve high recognition accuracy due to limited hand gesture information. In this paper, we propose a multi-sensor fusion method, using a DE–XGBoost model, to fuse the information of hand gesture and finger curvature to achieve the SCSLR, which can overcome the recognition error problems caused by insufficient sign language information. In addition, we design and implement a prototype system, which consists of a smartphone and a smart glove, to evaluate our proposed method in comparison with support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, gcForest, and artificial neural network (ANN).

The parties in this model are opportunistic, in the sense that they try to maximize their share of votes regardless of any ideological position. Each party makes small corrections to its current platform in order to increase its own utility by means of the steepest ascent in the variables under its own control, i.e., by locally optimizing its own platform. We show that in models with more than two parties bifurcations at the trivial equilibrium occur if only the voters are critical enough, that is, if they respond strongly to small changes in relative utilities. A numerical survey in a three-party model yields multiple bifurcations, multi-stability, and stable periodic at tractors that arise through Hopf bifurcations. Models with more than two parties can thus differ substantially from the two-party case, where it has been shown that under the assumptions of quadratic voter utilities and complete voter participation there is always a globally stable equilibrium that coincides with the mean voter position.",

These features are regulatory cycles, the lengths of the longest pathways through a network — a measure of network compactness — and the abundance of node pairs connected by many alternative regulatory pathways. We determine whether these features are significantly more or less abundant in biological networks than in randomized networks with the same distribution of incoming and outgoing connections per network node. We find that autoregulatory cycles are of exceptionally high abundance in transcriptional regulation networks. All other cycles, however, are significantly less abundant in several signal transduction networks. This suggests that the multistability caused by complex feedback loops in a network may interfere with the functioning of such networks. We also find that several of the networks we examine are more compact than expected by chance alone. This raises the possibility that the transmission of information through such networks, which is fastest in compact networks, is a biologically important characteristic of such networks.",

Clustering is subject to many economic interpretations, often described by the Ewens Sampling Formula (ESF). In contrast with the usual complex derivations, we suggest a finitary characterization of the ESF pointing to real economic processes. Our approach is finitary in the sense that we provide a probabilistic description of a system of n individuals considered as a closed system, a population, where individuals can change attributes over time. The probability is understood as the fraction of time the system spends in the considered partition. As the ESF represents an equilibrium distribution satisfying detailed balance, some properties difficult to prove are derived in a simple way.

This kind of problem can be viewed as harmonic control among independent subsystems. Research results show that two unstable systems can generate a stable system through some effective cooperations. And a linear matrix inequality method is provided for decentralized controller design by using the parameter-dependent Lyapunov function method. Two examples are given to illustrate the results.",

Here, we apply an approach from analysis of complex networks, known as \"network motifs\" to define repeating dynamical patterns in musical harmony. We describe each piece as a graph, where the nodes are chords and the directed edges connect chords which occur consecutively in the piece. We detect several patterns, each of which is a walk on this graph, which recur in diverse musical pieces from the Baroque to modern-day popular music. These patterns include cycles of three or four nodes, with up to two mutual edges (edges that point in both directions). Cliques and patterns with more than two mutual edges are rare. Some of these universal patterns of harmony are well known and correspond to basic principles of music theory such as hierarchy and directionality. This approach can be extended to search for recurring patterns in other musical components and to study other dynamical systems that can be represented as walks on graphs.",

In the model presented, transition probabilities between three population types are used to emulate stability: stable types have low probabilities of making transitions to other types, and unstable types have high transition probabilities. The model itself consists of two stable types and one unstable type, and conditions are explored that lead to dominance by the unstable type. Under certain conditions the unstable type can defeat a stable type, even in an environment that always favors the stable type.",

For this purpose, we define a weighted network where the vowels are the nodes and an edge between two nodes (read vowels) signifies their co-occurrence likelihood over the vowel inventories. Through this network we identify communities of vowels, which essentially reflect their patterns of co-occurrence across languages. We observe that in the communities formed by the frequently occurring vowels, the constituent nodes are largely uncorrelated in terms of their features and show that they are formed based on the principle of maximal perceptual contrast. However, in the rest of the communities, strong correlations are reflected among the constituent vowels with respect to their features, indicating that it is the principle of feature economy that binds them together. We validate the above observations by proposing a quantitative measure of perceptual contrast as well as feature economy and subsequently comparing the results obtained due to these quantifications with those where we assume that the vowel inventories had evolved just by chance.",

However, in the previous works, software networks are usually considered as a single-layer network, which cannot capture the authentic characteristics of software since software in its nature should be multilayer. In this paper, we explore the structural properties of the multilayer software network at the class level by progressively merging layers together, where each coupling type such as inheritance, implements, and method call defines a specific layer. A case study in software Tomcat is conducted using a set of 10 measures widely used in complex network literatures. The results show that some structural properties that are widely observed in software network researches can only emerge when several layers are merged together, such as high clustering coefficient, small value of average shortest path length, and high global efficiency. Our study highlights the importance of taking into consideration the multilayer nature of software systems. The results we found can provide valuable insights to our understanding and modeling of the dynamical processes taking place in the design and development of software systems.",

To this end, a combinatorial auction-based task allocation scheme is used to develop a cooperative rescue plan for the heterogeneous rescue teams. Then, we illustrate the proposed cooperative rescue plan in different scenarios with the case of landslide disaster relief. The simulation results indicate that the combinatorial auction-based cooperative rescue plan would increase victims’ relative survival probability by 13.8–16.3%, increase the ratio of survivors getting rescued by 10.7–12.7%, and decrease the average elapsed time for one site getting rescued by 19.0–26.6%. The proposed rescue plan outperforms the rescue plan based on the F-Max-Sum a little bit. The robustness analysis shows that the proposed rescue plan is relatively reliable on condition that both the search radius and scope of cooperation are larger than thresholds. Furthermore, we have investigated how the number of rescue teams influences the rescue efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing supports multitenancy to satisfy the users’ demands for accessing resources and simultaneously it increases revenue for cloud providers. Cloud providers adapt multitenancy by virtualizing the resources, like CPU, network interfaces, peripherals, hard drives and memory using hypervisor to fulfill the demand. In a virtualized environment, many virtual machines (VMs) can run on the same core with the help of the hypervisor by sharing the resources. The VMs running on the same core are the target for the malicious or abnormal attacks like side channel attacks. Among various side channel attacks in cloud computing, cache-based side channel attack is one that leaks private information of the users based on the shared resources. Here, as the shared resource is the cache, a process can utilize the cache usage of another by cache contention. Cache sharing provides a way for the attackers to gain considerable information so that the key used for encryption can be inferred. Discovering this side channel attack is a challenging task. This requires identification of a feature that influences the attack. Even though there are various techniques available in the literature to mitigate such attacks, an effective solution to reduce the cache-based side channel attack is still an issue. Therefore, a novel fuzzy rule-based mechanism is integrated to detect the cache side channel attackers by monitoring the cache data access (CDA). The factor that determines the attack is CDA in a log file created by the framework during authorization. The proposed framework also utilizes certain security properties including ECC and hashing for the privacy preservation and the decision is made with the aid of a fuzzy logic system.",

Discretization of fractional-order differentiator is essential to implement the fractional-order controller digitally. Discretization methods generally include indirect approach and direct approach to find the discrete-time approximation of fractional-order differentiator in the [Formula: see text]-domain as evident from the existing literature. In this paper, a direct approach is proposed for discretization of fractional-order differentiator in delta-domain instead of the conventional [Formula: see text]-domain as the delta operator unifies both analog system and digital system together at a high sampling frequency. The discretization of fractional-order differentiator is accomplished in two stages. In the first stage, the generating function is framed by reformulating delta operator using trapezoidal rule or Tustin approximation and in the next stage, the fractional-order differentiator has been approximated by expanding the generating function using continued fraction expansion method. The proposed method has been compared with two well-known direct discretization methods taken from the existing literature. Two examples are presented in this context to show the efficacy of the proposed discretization method using simulation results obtained from MATLAB.",

In order to understand ocean eddies from the large volume data produced by simulations, visualizing only eddy distribution at each time step is insufficient; time-variations in eddy events and phenomena must also be considered. However, existing methods cannot precisely find and track eddy events such as amalgamation and bifurcation. In this study, we propose an original approach for eddy detection, tracking, and event visualization based on an eddy classification system. The proposed method detects streams and currents as well as eddies, and it classifies discovered eddies into several categories using the additional stream and current information. By tracking how the classified eddies vary over time, detecting events such as eddy amalgamation and bifurcation as well as the interaction between eddies and ocean currents becomes achievable. We adopt the proposed method for two ocean areas in which strong ocean currents exist as case studies. We visualize the detected eddies and events in a time series of images, allowing us to acquire an intuitive understanding of a region of interest concealed in a high-resolution data set. Furthermore, our proposed method succeeded in clarifying the occurrence place and seasonality of each type of eddy event.",

Accurate segmentation is not an easy task due to the varying size, shape and location of the tumor. After segmentation, volume estimation is necessary in order to accurately estimate the tumor volume. By exactly estimating the volume of abnormal tissue, physicians can do excellent prognosis, clinical planning and dosage estimation. This paper describes a new Euclidean Similarity factor (ESF) based active contour model with deep learning for segmenting the tumor region into complete, core and enhanced tumor portions. Initially, the ESF considers the spatial distances and intensity differences of the region automatically to detect the tumor region. It preserves the image details but removes the noisy details. Then, the 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) segments the tumor by automatically extracting spatiotemporal features. Finally, the extended shoelace method estimates the volume of the tumor accurately for [Formula: see text]-sided polygons. The simulation result achieves a high accuracy of 92% and Jaccard index of 0.912 and computes the tumor volume with effective performance than existing approaches.",

This vibration exposure can be categorized as harmonic and random vibrations. When reliability assessment of modern electronic systems is considered, vibration loading has an important role to play. One of the biggest challenges facing today is the accurate and rapid assessment of fatigue life under the vibration loading. Conventional solder joints were made of lead-tin alloy. According to many environment legislations and rules, lead is prohibited as an ingredient in the solder alloy. The reason for the prohibition of the usage of the lead is that it poisons the environment. In this study, Sn-0.5Cu-3Bi-1Ag is used as the lead-free solder alloy. Fatigue life prediction of electronic package containing SAC405 is conducted with the aid of vibration testing and Finite element analysis under harmonic vibration loading. A specially designed Plastic Ball Grid Array Package (PBGA) component is mounted on Printed Circuit Board (PCB). It is taken as a test vehicle for the vibration test. The test vehicle is excited by a sinusoidal vibration. The frequency of this excitation equals the fundamental frequency of the test vehicle and it is continued till the component fails. Since the solder balls are very small for direct measurement, Finite Element analysis (FEA) is used for noting down the stresses. The stress versus failures cycles (S-N) curve is made by relating both the stresses on the solder balls obtained and the number of failure cycles from vibration analysis. The fatigue life of the component can be estimated from the generated S-N curve. It is analyzed that the methodology is effective in predicting the component’s life. Hence, the reliability of electronic package can be improved.",

Under the model, the observed distributional forms embody two simple, emergent results of capital-market competition: The competitive maximization of aggregate arbitrage profits; and the endogenous formation of the cost of capital from individual measures of RoC, in the presence of dynamic entrepreneurial and monopolistic quasi-rents. The paper’s discussion defines a series of new, observable macroscopic measures of competitive performance in decentralized market economies. It also points to the aptness of understanding prices as parts of structures of generalized Marx–Sraffa “prices of production,” predicated on the characteristics of capital-market statistical equilibria; to a general theoretical approach to the regulation of certain economic quantities by arbitrage; and to the role the costs of informational gains play in shaping observable outcomes in the operation of certain types of goal-seeking, self-organizing systems.",

    "abstract": "Tree skeleton could be useful to agronomy researchers because the skeleton describes the shape and topological structure of a tree. The phenomenon of organs’ mutual occlusion in fruit tree canopy is usually very serious, this should result in a large amount of data missing in directed laser scanning 3D point clouds from a fruit tree. However, traditional approaches can be ineffective and problematic in extracting the tree skeleton correctly when the tree point clouds contain occlusions and missing points. To overcome this limitation, we present a method for accurate and fast extracting the skeleton of fruit tree from laser scanner measured 3D point clouds. The proposed method selects the start point and endpoint of a branch from the point clouds by user’s manual interaction, then a backward searching is used to find a path from the 3D point cloud with a radius parameter as a restriction. The experimental results in several kinds of fruit trees demonstrate that our method can extract the skeleton of a leafy fruit tree with highly accuracy.",

Analysis of the influences of the friction on the seat vibration responses is helpful to improve comfort. Moreover, it is also an important part of promoting the industrialization application of the nonlinear suspension system for seats. In order to verify the influences, a model of the seat with the nonlinear suspension system considering friction effects was established by combining experiments. Based on the model, by using the harmonic balance method, the analytical formulas of the seat frequency-domain vibration response considering friction effects were deduced, and the influences of the friction on the frequency response characteristics of the system were simulated and analyzed. Moreover, the influences of the friction on the time-domain response characteristics were investigated. The results show that the existence of the friction can help to reduce the vibration in the peak region and to increase the system stability, however, it is not conducive to the improvement of the seat comfort under random road conditions.",

Also, the characteristic features, like constrained resources, heterogeneity, uncontrolled environment, and scalability requirement, make the security issues even more challenging. Hence, an effective and secure routing protocol named modified Energy Harvesting Trust-aware Routing Algorithm (mod-EHTARA) is proposed to increase the energy efficiency and the lifespan of the nodes. The proposed mod-EHTARA is designed by adopting the Link Lifetime (LLT) model with the traditional EHTARA. The optimal secure routing path is effectively selected by the proposed mod-EHTARA using the cost metric, which considers the factors like delay, LLT, energy, and trust. The big data classification process is carried out at the Base Station (BS) using the MapReduce framework. Accordingly, the big data classification is progressed using a stacked autoencoder, which is trained by the Adaptive E-Bat algorithm. The Adaptive E-Bat algorithm is developed by integrating the adaptive concept with the Bat Algorithm (BA) and Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). The proposed mod-EHTARA showed better performance by obtaining a maximal energy of 0.9855.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, many MAC protocols were implemented for boosting and improving energy efficiency (EE) in WSNs. Moreover, the cooperative MIMO method is found to be much capable of enhancing the EE of WSNs if configured properly. This paper intends to propose cross-layer design for multihop virtual MIMO system to enhance the end-to-end (ETE) reliability, EE, and QoS of the adopted WSN. The protocol is set here to focus on the energy utilization for transmission of data packets by optimal selection of transmission constraints for each node of the network. Moreover, the protocol’s ETE latency and throughput are also modeled as the dependent variables of BER performance of every link. To discover the improved BER criteria of each link that meets the ETE QoS requirement in reduced energy utilization, this paper employs a new hybrid optimization algorithm named Lion Mutated Dragonfly Algorithm (LM–DA) that is a hybrid variant of both Lion Algorithm (LA) and Dragonfly Algorithm (DA). Finally, the performance of the adopted scheme is validated over other state-of-the-art models. The results state that the energy consumed by the adopted LM–DA approach is about 2.65%, 1.77%, and 1.77% reduced over LA, PSO, and DA schemes, respectively.",

The disease is endemic in many countries and still a serious threat to global public health and development. In this paper, a new deterministic model is designed and analyzed qualitatively to explore the dynamics of schistosomiasis transmission in human, cattle and snail populations. Results from our mathematical analysis show that the model has a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) which is locally asymptotically stable (LAS) whenever a particular epidemiological threshold quantity, also known as basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) is less than unity. Further analysis shows that the model has a unique endemic equilibrium (EE) which is globally asymptotically stable whenever [Formula: see text] and unstable when [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, we adopt partial rank correlation coefficient for sensitivity analysis to reveal the most important parameters for effective control and mitigation of schistosomiasis disease in a community. Finally, we obtain some numerical results by simulating the entire dynamics of the model, which show that the infections in the compartments of each population decrease with respect to time. This further indicates that avoiding contact with infected human, cattle or infested water is vital to prevent the spread of schistosomiasis disease infection.",

Enterprises can borrow from banks based on their own tax credit rating. The experimental results based on the model show that: (i) When the probability of spot check is low, the actual tax behavior of some enterprises is inconsistent with the results of tax credit publicized by tax authorities. (ii) In order to reduce the proportion of tax evasion, we try to change the parameter variables of integral reward, audit probability, punishment, financial subsidy and loan interest rate.

This system allows us to investigate the time-varying distributions of ocean physical properties, additionally from the user's perspective and requirements. In the experiments, we show the generality and expressiveness by applying our system for single- and multi-property visualizations to find some significant ocean water mass.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the effect of geometrical parameters of centrifugal fan on performance has been presented with a system approach. Often, the operators or the design engineers focus on the immediate requirements of the engine/equipment and they neglect the broader question of how the fan parameters are affecting the equipment. For instance, change in fan angles will change the performance e.g., airflow rates and efficiency. However, it also affects the contaminants build-up on the blades. Blade angle with higher angle of attack will promote contaminants build-up on blade surfaces, which in turn causes performance degradation and unstable operation. The system approach in fan parameter selection will result in a more reliable system. Significance of other fan parameters is also discussed. We present an experimental setup and validated computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model. Fan power consumption is determined experimentally and compared with the CFD model. Further parametric simulations were carried out to investigate the effect on fan performance. Effect of system resistance, inlet and outlet angle, blade thickness, and no-uniform spaced blades has been described with discussions on industrial relevance. A fan with higher flow rates is desirable to reduce engine temperatures and enhance the durability. However, higher flow rates result in more fan power consumption at a given fan speed. The test results suggest that a fan with higher power coefficient does not affect the vehicle's mileage significantly. This paper will help design engineers in making informed decision about the interaction between the fans and system, and its effect during the operation.",

    "abstract": "The design of reinforcement learning solutions to many problems artificially constrain the action set available to an agent, in order to limit the exploration/sample complexity. While exploring, if an agent can discover new actions that can break through the constraints of its basic/atomic action set, then the quality of the learned decision policy could improve. On the flipside, considering all possible non-atomic actions might explode the exploration complexity. We present a novel heuristic solution to this dilemma, and empirically evaluate it in grid navigation tasks. In particular, we show that both the solution quality and the sample complexity improve significantly when basic reinforcement learning is coupled with action discovery. Our approach relies on reducing the number of decision points, which is particularly suited for multiagent coordination learning, since agents tend to learn more easily with fewer coordination problems (CPs). To demonstrate this we extend action discovery to multi-agent reinforcement learning. We show that Joint Action Learners (JALs) indeed learn coordination policies of higher quality with lower sample complexity when coupled with action discovery, in a multi-agent box-pushing task.",

    "abstract": "Since social-economic systems increase interdependency, a crucial question arises: Is an interconnected world a safer or a more dangerous place to live? Over the last few years, we have witnessed the dark side of increasing interdependencies. As such, there is a growing need to focus on how to mitigate networked risk and to enhance the system resilience to the impact of a large-scale shock. The traditional engineering approach has been to design systems that are less vulnerable to damage from hazard events. On the other hand, system resilience is the ability to recover from failure and provide the continuity of system function. The goal of the present paper is to investigate the gain from risk sharing. We propose a mechanism of risk sharing that may enhance the resilience of the networked systems. The proposed risk sharing protocols are based on coordinated incentives of agents to survive collectively by absorbing external shocks. The key issue we would like to analyze is how the gain from risk sharing depends on the capacity of each agent to absorb shock and on the interconnections patterns among agents with risk sharing rules. We demonstrate that risk sharing is beneficial from a systems point of view when the agents' capacities to shocks is high and detrimental when it is low. In particular, we evaluate the effectiveness of risk sharing in two domains. In the first domain, in which networked agents have the possibility of cascading failure, risk sharing is useful in mitigating systemic failure, especially if the agents are running at high load. In the second domain, we evaluate the ratio of safe agents who invest in risky portfolios or projects collectively. In this case, risk sharing is only beneficial if the agents' risk absorbing capacity is high.",

    "abstract": "We study Facebook networks at 40 American universities, with focus on the comparison of their degree distributions and mechanism governing their evolution. We find that the heterogeneity indexes of these networks are all small compared with scale-free networks, and different from real-world social networks 5 Facebook networks show significant degree disassortativity; the exponent γ for the power-law model of the degree distributions is large for the networks, indicating obvious homogeneity of network structure. We calculate the goodness-of-fit between the data and power law and find that the p-values are larger than threshold 0.1 for 20 networks, implying that power law is a plausible hypothesis; we compare the power-law model with 4 alternative competing distributions and find that power-law model gives the best fit for all 40 networks. However in wider interval of degrees some other distributions, such as log-normal or stretched exponential, can give the best fit. Further based on the homogeneity of Facebook we propose an analyzable model that integrates the introduction of new vertices and edges. The edges can be established either between new vertices and old vertices or between old vertices. The model captures the real evolution processes of Facebook networks and can well reproduce their degree distributions.",

The results obtained extend our previous study focusing on the solution to the same problem solved using other tools of control engineering.

The volume of fluid (VOF) method is one of such method which takes care of fluid shape in a local domain and reconstructs the interface from volume fraction of one fluid. Maintaining sharp interface during reconstruction is a challenging task and geometrical approach of VOF method better suits for incompressible fluids. This paper provides a complete mathematical discussion of extended form of VOF method using a approach known as piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC). An analytical relation between volume fraction and interface position has been explored with the help of primitive geometrical shapes. The method with this analytical relation has been applied to multiphase fluid flow benchmark problems and found to be in good agreement.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of the 2007–2008 credit crisis has concentrated on issues of relaxed lending standards, and the perception of irrational behavior by speculative investors in real estate and other assets. Asset backed securities have been extensively criticized for creating a moral hazard in loan issuance and an associated increase in default risk, by removing the immediate lender's incentive to ensure that the underlying loans could be repaid. However significant monetary issues can accompany any form of increased commercial bank lending, and these appear to have been overlooked by this analysis. In this paper we propose a general explanation for credit crises based on an examination of the mechanics of the banking system, and in particular its internal controls on the supply of credit. We suggest that the current credit crisis is the result of multiple failures in the Basel regulatory framework, including the removal of central bank reserve requirements from some classes of deposit accounts within the banking system, allowing financial instruments representing debt to be used as regulatory capital, and in particular the introduction of securitized lending which effectively removed a previously implicit control over the total quantity of lending originating from the banking system. We further argue that the interaction of these problems has led to a destabilizing imbalance between total money and loan supply growth, in that total lending sourced from the commercial bank sector increased at a faster rate than accompanying growth in the money supply. This not only created a multi-decade macro-economic debt spiral, but by increasing the ratio of debt to money within the monetary system acted to increase the risk of loan defaults, and consequentially reduce the overall stability of the banking system.",

The interaction between the complex topology of human social structures/communities and the cognitive processes characterizing humans at the microscopic level, are the focus of the classical social cognition paradigm, and it has been deeply researched in the last century. In the present study we used a web based Chat room as an experimental environment for the study of social interactions within a small group of people. The target of the present study is to explore the relations between the affinity among individual and their communication dynamics. We designed three different experimental tasks (social problem), with a crescent degree of social complexity, in order to test the impact of different social constraints on the evolution of the affinity network, as well as on the dynamics of communication. Our aim is to define the \"cognitive recipes\" used by the subjects to solve the required social problems. Our results show that the complexity of the social problem affects the relation between affinity and communication networks, influencing at the same time both affinity and opinion. We use the sociophysics and social cognitive models in order to interpret the results, showing the limits of the most diffused sociophysics models when aiming at forecasting the dynamics of a small group.",

An agent may choose to learn via innovation (individual learning) or via imitation (social learning). The agents are endowed with heterogeneous skills in engaging in the two modes of learning. When the agents choose imitation, they also choose whom to learn from. This leads to the emergence of a social learning network among agents in the population. This paper focuses on the impact the endowed learning skills have on the individual's choice of learning mechanism as well as the micro and macro structure of the evolving network. Finally, it explores the impact the degree of environmental volatility has on the structure of such networks.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that social networks are ubiquitous on the Internet, only few websites exploit the potential of combining user communities and online marketplaces. Not many platforms allow users to engage in a phenomenon called \"group buying\" — buyers joining groups, or coalitions, to bundle their purchasing power towards sellers. We argue that this may be due to a lack of face-to-face interaction on the Internet; often, users do not know which other users to trust, which makes them suspicious of engaging in online business, in particular if many unknown other parties are involved. This situation, however, can be alleviated by leveraging the social networks of users: based on who a user knows and is connected to, a trust metric — for example, the TrustWebRank metric developed by us — can be computed to assess who else may be considered trustworthy to that user. In this paper, we build a simple agent-based model of coalition formation among agents in the setting of group buying in an electronic marketplace. In this model, agents use their trust relationships in order to determine who to form coalitions with. We show that this leads agents to experience high utility and that agents are able to learn who is trustworthy and who is not, even when they have no initial knowledge about the trustworthiness of other agents. This work may provide the foundation for a real-world application of an online coalition formation platform for e-commerce built on a social networking platform such as Facebook.",

Modeling accuracy, with the incorporation of the entrance and exit impedances and the airway, continuous energy storage and dissipation effects are emphasized. Output flow maximization, under quiescent operating conditions is investigated and the optimum relationships between the airway characteristic impedance, entrance and exit resistances are established. The minimization of the vibration and turbulence arising from the continuous compression/expansion effects arising from the input–output volume airflow difference is achieved, whilst simultaneously maximizing the output volume airflow. Variations in the parameter values are employed to confirm the effectiveness of operating under optimum conditions, for ventilation system airways with various dimensions and characteristics.",

In primitive proto-cells (lacking separate genetic machinery) self-maintenance is a necessary condition for the direct reproduction and inheritance of what we here term Cellular Information Processing Networks (CIPNs). Indeed, partially reproduced or defective CIPNs may generally lead to malfunctioning or premature death of affected cells. We explore the interaction of this self-maintenance property with the evolution and adaptation of CIPNs capable of distinct information processing abilities. We present an evolutionary simulation platform capable of evolving artificial CIPNs from a bottom-up perspective. This system is an agent-based multi-level selectional Artificial Chemistry (AC) which employs a term rewriting system called the Molecular Classifier System (MCS.bl). The latter is derived from the Holland broadcast language formalism. Using this system, we successfully evolve an artificial CIPN to improve performance on a simple pre-specified information processing task whilst subject to the constraint of continuous self-maintenance. We also describe the evolution of self-maintaining, cross-talking and multi-tasking, CIPNs exhibiting a higher level of topological and functional complexity. This proof of concept aims at contributing to the understanding of the open-ended evolutionary growth of complexity in artificial systems.",

The model is created based on the theory of solid-particle erosion that characterizes the erosion damage as deformation wear and cutting wear, incorporating the effect of the oxide scale on the eroded surface under high temperature erosion. Then the instantaneous oxide thickness is the result of the synergetic effect of erosion and oxidation. The developed model is applied on a Ni -based Al -containing ( Ni – Al ) alloy to investigate the oxide thickness variation with erosion duration of the alloy at high temperatures. The results show that the thickness of the oxide scale on the alloy surface increases with the exposure time and temperature when the surface is not attacked by particles. However, when particles impact on the alloy surface, the oxide thickness is reduced, although oxidation is continuing. This indicates that oxidation does not benefit the erosion resistance of this alloy at high temperatures due to the low growth rate of the oxide.",

We show that even when the vast majority of a population's history may be well-described by a spatially-unstructured model, spatial structure may nevertheless affect the expected level of diversity seen at a local scale. We demonstrate this phenomenon explicitly by examining the random copying process on small-world networks, and use our results to comment on the use of simple random-copying models in an empirical context.",

    "abstract": "To study the ride comfort of wheel-hub-driven electric vehicles, a simulation and verification method based on a combination of ADAMS and MATLAB modeling is proposed. First, a multibody dynamic simulation model of an in-wheel motor-driven electric vehicle is established using ADAMS/Car. Then, the pavement excitation and electromagnetic force analytical equations are provided based on the specific operating conditions of the vehicle and the in-wheel motor to analyze the impact of the electromagnetic force fluctuation from an unsprung mass increase and motor air gap unevenness on vehicle ride comfort after the introduction of an in-wheel motor. Next, the vibration model and the motion differential equation of the body–wheel dual-mass system of an in-wheel motor-driven electric vehicle are established. The influence of the in-wheel motor on the vibration response index of the dual-mass system is analyzed by using MATLAB/Simulink software. The variation in the vehicle vibration performance index with/without the motor electromagnetic force excitation factor is analyzed and compared with the ADAMS multibody dynamics analysis results. The results show that the method based on a combination of ADAMS and MATLAB modeling can forecast the ride comfort of an in-wheel motor-driven electric vehicle, reducing the cost of physical prototype experiments.",

The input parameters, namely pulse on time, pulse off time, peak current and servo voltage, were considered to study the responses cutting speed (CS) and surface roughness (SR). Each input parameter was set at three levels. Experiments were conducted as per central composite face (CCF) centered design. Based upon the experimental data, Gray relational analysis (GRA), a multi-objective optimization technique has been employed to find the best level of process parameters to optimize the machining profiles. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been conducted for investigating the effect of process parameters on overall machining performance. Finally, it was identified that the process parameters such as pulse on time, current and voltage have more impact on the square and circular profiles.",

Different from the previous studies, we consider all equity capital flows regardless of their size, and their monetary value instead of the corresponding ownership share. We further innovate by applying new methods to measure degree of influence power and hierarchical structure. The resulting picture shows that between the pure EU28 aerospace companies: (i) ownership relationships concern only relatively few companies (10%), which trigger horizontal and vertical structures; (ii) density is extremely low; (iii) relationships are fully hierarchical with no cross-ownership; (iv) capital is seldom transferred across business groups; (v) most of the main topological parameters have a typically polarized scale-free structure. When including also the ownership neighbors, some of those traits change substantially: (i) the share of connected companies substantially grows up to 63%; (ii) size and length of the largest pyramidal structures will grow remarkably, reaching a top of 874 companies; (iii) the industry becomes a full small-world structure, thus allowing huge capital transfer across business groups. Finally, a dramatic financialization, meant as a pivotal and quantitatively heavy role of financial operators, emerges also as a clear characteristic of the extended network.",

    "abstract": "Large crowds are challenging the comfort and safety level of big cities, while music may be a potential method to improve pedestrian flow. This paper focuses on the influence of different tempos and types of background music on pedestrian dynamics. Three tempos (90[Formula: see text]beats/min (BPM), 120[Formula: see text]BPM and 150[Formula: see text]BPM) and two types (pure music and metronome stimuli) of music are considered. It is found that more frequent stop-and-go behaviors emerge with rhythms. Compared with that under a low tempo (90[Formula: see text]BPM) of rhythm condition, stopping is more frequent with a high tempo one (120[Formula: see text]BPM or 150[Formula: see text]BPM). The number of stopping pedestrians per unit time increases 68.57%, 376.00%, 298.29%, 224.00%, 438.29% and 393.71% with 90 BPM, 120[Formula: see text]BPM and 150[Formula: see text]BPM music, 90[Formula: see text]BPM, 120[Formula: see text]BPM and 150[Formula: see text]BPM metronome, compared with that without any rhythm, respectively. The velocity and flow are lower, and higher local densities appear with background music. The step frequency at high density with rhythms ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]Hz for 90[Formula: see text]BPM, 120[Formula: see text]BPM and 150[Formula: see text]BPM music; [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]Hz for 90[Formula: see text]BPM, 120[Formula: see text]BPM and 150[Formula: see text]BPM metronome) is lower than that without any rhythm ([Formula: see text][Formula: see text]Hz). Pedestrians need more time to avoid collisions and to step under background music conditions, because they are influenced by the music and not fully focusing on walking. As a result, step frequency decreases and stopping behavior is more frequent. This in turn leads to the decrease of the velocity and flow and the emergence of higher local densities. Our study will be helpful for understanding the effect of background music on pedestrian dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method of sampling regular and irregular-grid volume data for visualization. The method is based on the Metropolis algorithm that is a type of Monte Carlo technique. Our method enables \"importance sampling\" of local regions of interest in the visualization by generating sample points intensively in regions where a user-specified transfer function takes the peak values. The generated sample-point distribution is independent of the grid structure of the given volume data. Therefore, our method is applicable to irregular grids as well as regular grids. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to regular cubic grids and irregular tetrahedral grids with adaptive cell sizes. We visualize volume data by projecting the generated sample points onto the 2D image plane. We tested our sampling with three rendering models: an X-ray model, a simple illuminant particle model, and an illuminant particle model with light-attenuation effects. The grid-independency and the efficiency in the parallel processing mean that our method is suitable for visualizing large-scale volume data. The former means that the required number of sample points is proportional to the number of 2D pixels, not the number of 3D voxels. The latter means that our method can be easily accelerated on the multiple-CPU and/or GPU platforms. We also show that our method can work with adaptive space partitioning of volume data, which also enables us to treat large-scale/complex volume data easily.",

They have been selected by the editors to appear together in this issue, to highlight current research trends. ‘Complex Networks’ is a booming research area for quite a few years now. Since the work of Watts and Strogatz on ‘small world networks’ published in 1998 (a paper for which Google Scholar lists 7417 citations as of 14th February 2009), a networkmania has exploded in many applied fields of science. This led to the rediscovery of various results already present in the mathematical literature on graphs. However, the increasing interest on networks also led to the rediscovery of some gems in sociology, including the work of Granovetter on social networks already published in 1973. Today, research on complex networks has expanded to various branches of science, ranging from biology to transportation, from economics to linguistics. Hence, it is becoming a truly interdisciplinary endeavor. It is worth noticing that the research in these areas is increasingly driven by available data, in addition to extending theoretical concepts to characterize these networks. The current topical issue reflects some of the recent activities. The first two papers apply the complex network approach to dynamic phenomena in molecular biology, while the next two papers focus on spatial networks. These are followed by papers focusing on economic networks and on networks describing human social interaction. Finally, the last paper demonstrates an application of the complex",

The first type, simulating steady flow, is a field data collected at Elbogdady reach. It is a reach located 712.80 km upstream of Roda's staff gauge on the Nile River. The second type, simulating unsteady flow, is a result of the 1D SOBEK model. It is simulating the flow field at El-Mahrousa canal. It is one of El-Kanobia canal branches at 11.47 km left side, which is fed from El-Mahmoudia canal. Simplifications were made to simulate the flow patterns around the hydraulic structures using the developed hydrodynamic model. Actually, the water levels in many branch canals under continuous flow after implementation of Irrigation Improvement Project (IIP) need to be checked. The model could be applied to estimate the water stage under different abstraction values where some reaches of the Nile River and its branch suffering. In addition, it can be used to assess the impact of water allocation. Good agreement was observed between the model results and the field observations.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a methodology for real-time simulation of electric circuits consisting of linear circuit components combined with nonlinear elements, such as diodes and electronic switches, that exhibit discontinuous behavior. The methodology consists of sub-dividing fixed numerical integration time-steps into sub-steps over which the entire circuit behaves linearly, thus permitting the simulation over each sub-step to be performed using analytic formulas. For non-real-time simulation, this has routinely been accomplished using variable-step numerical integration. In the article, we show how real-time integration can be accomplished using a linear analytic formula over each fixed integration step, where the formula coefficients are stored functions of the sub-step parameters. For example, in a single-phase diode rectifier circuit, each fixed integration step h is divided into two sub-steps, the first of duration he n over which the diode is not conducting and the second of duration h(1 - e n ) over which the diode is conducting, with a simple formula used to calculate the dimensionless sub-step parameter e n . The output current for the n + 1 frame is then calculated with a linear formula requiring four multiplications and four additions. Three of the five coefficients required for this calculation are rather complex functions of the parameter e n . However, by restricting e n to N + 1 equally spaced values between 0 and 1, the 3(N + 1) possible coefficient values can be pre-computed and stored in memory, which results in a sizeable reduction in execution time for each fixed integration step. The article includes a three-phase diode rectifier example that sub-divides each fixed integration step h into three sub-steps of duration hd n , h(e n - d n ) and h(1 - e n ).",

The equation is nonlinear which mimics the ionic processes at a real nerve membrane. A small parameter called singular perturbation parameter is introduced in the highest order derivative term. Keeping other parameters fixed, as this singular perturbation parameter approaches to zero, a boundary layer occurs in the solution. Three-step Taylor Galerkin finite element method is employed on a piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh to solve the equation. To procure more accurate temporal differencing, the method employs forward-time Taylor series expansion including time derivatives of third order which are evaluated from the governing singularly perturbed generalized Hodgkin–Huxley equation. This yields a generalized time-discretized equation which is successively discretized in space by means of the standard Bubnov–Galerkin finite element method. The method is third-order accurate in time. The code based on the purposed scheme has been validated against the cases for which the exact solution is available. It is also observed that for the Singularly Perturbed Generalized Hodgkin–Huxley equation, the boundary layer in the solution manifests not only by varying the singular perturbation parameter but also by varying the other parameters appearing in the model.",

We consider a realistic generation of geographical networks with the SF property, and show the significant improvement of the robustness by adding a small fraction of shortcuts between randomly chosen nodes.

The composite model takes each oriented crystal and its immediate boundary to form a pair. Next, the finite element method in conjunction with the composite model is employed to evaluate the energy dissipation of nano-crystalline material under cyclic loading. The influence of the grain size and the external loading on the energy dissipation is investigated numerically. Energy dissipation in each of the two parts (i.e. grain and grain boundary) is also calculated as an attempt to understand the effect of grain boundary on energy dissipation.",

    "abstract": "A grid is a geographically distributed resource sharing environment across multiple organizations. The most typical grid resources are clusters with high performance/cost ratio. In general, these clusters are shared as non-dedicated grid resources since local users may run their jobs simultaneously. Local jobs are usually queued and processed in a batch mode with uncertain waiting time, while grid jobs always require advance reservations with guaranteed resource allocation. In this paper, we provide quantitative analysis on the impact of advance reservations over queued jobs, in terms of job waiting time and resource utilization, respectively. It is observed that advance reservations will lead to longer job waiting time and lower resource utilization. That is to say, advance reservations should cost more than queued jobs. In this work, based on quantitative experimental results, an empirical formula for cost estimation of advance reservations over queued jobs is presented. It is suggested that compared with queued jobs, advance reservations should be doubly charged to compensate resource utilization loss. If the notice time of an advance reservation is short below a threshold, additional cost should be applied further since queue waiting time is increased.",

Using a game-theoretical model, we find that societies over a critical size benefit from adopting a mode of universal altruism. These \"golden-rule societies\" must justify violence against outsiders by formulating exceptions to this universal rule. For smaller groups, it is more efficient to adopt a rule that simply requires cooperation within the group. Data from the ethnographic record supports a correlation between group size and societal norms of universal cooperation. Our results provide an explanation for the prevalence of the golden rule among contemporary cultures. We find that universal altruism arises due to cultural selection for greater ingroup bias, and is a natural byproduct of the emergence of large-scale societies.",

    "abstract": "Exploiting a precise reproduction of a stock exchange, the robustness of the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism, evaluated by means of the waiting time distributions, has been proved versus 36 different setups made by varying both the operators' behavior and the market micro structure. The obtained results demonstrate that the CDA remains able to clear strongly different order flows, although the Milan stock exchange seemed to be a little more efficient than the NYSE under the allocative point of view, evidencing the intrinsic complexity of the stock market. The simulation has been built as an agent-based model in order to obtain a plausible order flow. The decisions of single agents and their interaction through the market book are realistic and reproduce some empirical analysis results. The mentioned results have been obtained either by the analysis of the complete pending time series or the same computation of the asks and bids series alone.",

    "abstract": "Revealing the corresponding identities of the same individual in different systems is a common task in various areas, e.g., criminals inter-network tracking, homologous proteins revealing, ancient words translating, and so on. With the reason that, recently, more and more complex systems are described by networks, this task can also be accomplished by solving a node matching problem among these networks. Revealing one-to-one matching between networks is for sure the best if we can, however, when the target networks are highly symmetric, or an individual has different identities (corresponds to several nodes) in the same network, the exact one-to-one node matching algorithms always lose their effects to obtain acceptable results. In such situations, one-to-many (or many-to-many) node matching algorithms may be more useful. In this paper, we propose two one-to-many node matching algorithms based on local mapping and ensembling, respectively. Although such algorithms may not tell us the exact correspondence of the identities in different systems, they can indeed help us to narrow down the inter-network searching range, and thus are of significance in practical applications. These results have been verified by the matching experiments on pairwise artificial networks and real-world networks.",

Commercial simulation softwares are commonly used to validate layouts by simulating the real world material flow and production process. To validate a layout scenario of a solar module assembly workshop, a 3D simulation model is presented which was designed on VisualComponents software. To begin with, we introduce the layout characteristics and use the systematic layout planning (SLP) method to design the block layout of workshop. Then, we built components library which contains all the facilities needed in the production line, specifically conveyors, processing equipments, robots, buffers. Finally, we have established a simulation layout model using the components in the customized library according to the block layout, and configured the components which were allocated in the layout by setting the parameters and building the connection between components via signal. To improve the performance of the workshop, we have found the best work-in-process (WIP) value for the workshop and the optimal number of workers. Additionally, the layout model was used to test collision and reachability. It demonstrated the production process in a realistic simulation environment which helped in the sales process as well. The reusable component models we have built make it easy to build a layout within a short time and validate the effectiveness of the layout scenarios for any other projects.",

This periodicity solution concept yields new insight into nontrivial games. In mixed strategy strategic form games, periodic solutions yield values for the utility function of each player that are equal to the Nash equilibrium ones. In contrast to the Nash strategies, here the payoffs of each player are robust against what the opponent plays. Sometimes, periodicity strategies yield higher utilities, and sometimes the Nash strategies do, but often the utilities of these two strategies coincide. We formally define and study periodic strategies in two player perfect information strategic form games with pure strategies and we prove that every nontrivial finite game has at least one periodic strategy, with nontrivial meaning nondegenerate payoffs. In some classes of games where mixed strategies are used, we identify quantitative features. Particularly interesting are the implications for collective action games, since there the collective action strategy can be incorporated in a purely noncooperative context. Moreover, we address the periodicity issue when the players have a continuum set of strategies available.",

Edge computing technologies can improve real-time performance in processing data. By introducing the FPGA into the computing node and using the dynamic reconfigurability of the FPGA, the FPGA-based edge node can increase the edge node capability. In this paper, a task-based collaborative method for an FPGA-based edge computing system is proposed in order to meet the collaboration among FPGA-based edge nodes, edge nodes, and the cloud. The modeling of the task includes two parts, task information and task-dependent file. Task information is used to describe the running information and dependency information required for the task execution. Task-dependent file contains the configuration bit-stream of FPGA in running of the task. By analyzing the task behavior, this paper builds four basic behaviors, analyzes the critical attributes of each behavior, and summarizes the task model suitable for FPGA-based edge nodes. Tasks with specific functions can be created by modifying different attributes of model nodes. Finally, the availability of the model and the task-based collaborative method are verified by simulation experiments. The experimental results that the task model proposed in this paper can meet cloud-edge collaboration in the FPGA-based edge computing environment.",

In this paper, we propose a method, recurrent neural network with self-organizing map, to enhance the prediction accuracy for resource consumption series of software aging problems. In order to smooth the resource consumption series, a pre-processing process and a self-organizing map are used. To make the prediction more accurate, a recurrent neural network is used.

The current communication circulator detection relies on manual experience for identification and classification. This method seriously affects production efficiency; and visual fatigue, physical condition, and working environment will affect the accuracy of manual detection; therefore, the production line of communication circulators urgently needs to be online automatic detection system. This paper will design a set of the stable automatic detection system. The main contributions are: (1) In the sample collection stage, by enhancing the limited samples, it proposes the morphological transformation of the limited defects themselves to realize the diversification of the number of samples and the morphology; (2) By reusing a sample, a cascaded Faster-RCNN and You Only Look Once (YOLO) target detection method is proposed, and the Faster-RCNN and YOLO models are trained, respectively; the model training stage uses migration learning and optimization of hyperparameters to obtain higher accuracy high training model; (3) In the inference stage, by cascading the two excellent target detection algorithms, Faster-RCNN and YOLO, this paper proposes a new decision conflict resolution algorithm, and finally obtains a higher comprehensive detection accuracy; (4) In the deployment phase, in view of the increased performance and computing power overhead caused by algorithm cascading, this paper proposes a solution for graphics processing unit shard sharing. Experimental results explain: The communication circulator surface defect detection system based on the deep learning method can effectively locate and identify various defects. The final recognition accuracy rate is about 98.5%, and the recognition speed can reach about 0.45, which is compared with traditional detection methods, which greatly improves the accuracy and speed of recognition.",

The effect of media advertisements in combating an infectious disease is explored in the present investigation. The numerical results show that the system destabilizes when the growth rate of media advertisements goes above a certain value. For lower ranges of the rate of distribution of awareness through social media platforms, our system showcases stable endemic state. But as the rate of disseminating awareness surpasses a critical value, the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and limit cycle oscillations appear. However, the persistent oscillations are killed out and the system returns to a stable endemic state as the rate of distribution of awareness exceeds another threshold value. Extremely large values of the awareness distribution through media advertisements eradicate the disease from the entire community. Model parameters with significant impacts on the disease prevalence and eradication are identified through sensitivity analysis. We extend our model to encapsulate the seasonal variation in the rate of media advertisements. Sufficient conditions have been derived for which the nonautonomous system exhibits globally attractive positive periodic solution. The nonautonomous system is shown to produce chaotic dynamics under the circumstances of the corresponding autonomous system that exhibits limit cycle oscillations. Overall, our findings deduce that media advertisements play a critical role in raising public awareness and ultimately resulting in the eradication of the disease from the society.",

The distributed decision tree algorithm uses the attribute histogram data structure to merge the category list into each attribute list, reducing the amount of data that needs to reside in the memory. Second, we adopt the strategy of vertically dividing the dataset and synchronously updating the hash table, select the hash table entries that can be used to update according to the minimum Gini value, modify the corresponding entries and use the hash table to record and control each sub-site. In the case of node splitting, it has a high accuracy rate. In addition, for classification problems that meet monotonic constraints in a distributed environment, this paper will extend the idea of building a monotonic decision tree in a distributed environment, supplementing the distributed decision tree algorithm, adding a modification rule and modifying the generated nonmonotonic decision tree to monotonicity. In order to solve the high load problem of the privacy-protected data stream classification mining algorithm under a single node, a Storm platform for the parallel algorithm PPFDT_P based on the distributed decision tree algorithm is designed and implemented. At the same time, considering that the word vector model improves the deep representation of features and solves the problem of feature high-dimensional sparseness, and the iterative decision tree algorithm GBDT model is more suitable for non-high-dimensional dense features, the iterative decision tree algorithm will be integrated into the word vector model (GBDT) in the data retrieval application, using the distributed representation of words, namely word vectors, to classify short messages on the GBDT model. Experimental results show that the distributed decision tree algorithm has high efficiency, good speed-up and good scalability, so that there is no need to increase the number of datasets at each sub-site at any time. Only a small number of data items are inserted. By splitting some leaf nodes, a small amount is added by branching to achieve a monotonic decision tree. The proposed system achieves a massive data ratio of 54.1% while compared with other networks of massive data ratio.",

As a result, on the benchmark rice plant dataset, a modified MobileNet CNN architecture is proposed in this study for nutrient deficiency classification. Insertion of additional new layers, a system to handle dropout and selecting appropriate optimizer are among the alterations included in this proposed method to increase the model performance accuracy. Subsequently, the performance of the modified MobileNet CNN model is evaluated using well-defined performance metrics such as accuracy, [Formula: see text]-score, precision, and recall.

This paper presents an agent-based, evolutionary model of labor market dynamics where workers adjust to technology shocks induced by automation. Firms produce a homogeneous service by combining the outputs of tasks performed by workers while stochastically adapting to automation of tasks causing displacement of workers. We develop a model that includes: (i) the description of occupation mobility as a directed graph where nodes represent occupations, and the directed edges represent the mobility pathways along which displaced workers can get retrained and redeployed (ii) explicit microfoundations of the processes of job matching and wage setting between firms and heterogeneously skilled workers. The model focuses on the influence of workers’ retraining choices on the employment levels and wage inequality in the labor market. Simulation results indicate distinct tipping points for unemployment and wage inequality with changes in mobility pathways along which workers retrain and redeploy across occupations. An increase in the density of mobility pathways induces a reinforcement effect on employment. Retraining displaced workers without building dense and well-distributed mobility pathways across occupations could widen wage inequality due to excessive crowding of workers around specific tasks. Our work focuses on the finance and insurance industry dataset, where we observe that the reskilling of displaced workers along occupation mobility pathways assisted by a lower retraining cost improves the unemployment levels. Also, if the firms aggressively automate their tasks, an increase in the cost of retraining increases inequality of wages in the labor market.",

Second, we simulate the obtained analytical results using a new deep learning method that associates the ordinary differential equations governing the model to neural networks. A general disease-free equilibrium is considered and sufficient conditions of stability and convergence are formulated. A detailed description of the neural network model used in the simulation is provided. Moreover, the proposed deep learning simulation algorithm is compared to the simulation provided by “odeint”, a function from “SciPy” which is a Python library of mathematical routines.",

    "abstract": "The growing number of automobiles on the road has now become a significant source of traffic, accidents, and pollution. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) could be the key to finding solutions that drastically reduce these issues. The linked vehicular networks channel is a fast-expanding topic for workflow management system and development. Traffic detection is a big issue on city streets. To make informed decisions in order to prevent traffic jams, one of the solutions is the Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET). We describe an approach for detecting traffic jams in both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, which provides vehicle drivers with multiple alternatives for determining the location of congestion, its size, and how to prevent becoming stuck in a traffic jam. The data are sent to the driver to assist him in making the appropriate selection. Delivering Quality of Service (QoS) for automotive networks is a difficult challenge due to the characteristics such as terms of transmission or high mobility, congested and fragmented channels, hardware defects, and a large number of vehicular devices. As a result, it is extremely desired to get and distribute resources efficiently. This research uses Reinforcement Learning with Decision-Making Model (RLDMM) method to enhance channel allocation. By using latency, Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) and QoS, the available channel is initially determined. This method is used to determine suitable channel for platoon members. As a result, the proposed RLDMM achieves an SINR reduction of 29 Db, 69 kbps of throughput, 21.4% of collision probability with 4[Formula: see text]ms of latency.",

    "abstract": "The modelling of financial markets presents a problem which is both theoretically challenging and practically important. The theoretical aspects concern the issue of market efficiency which may even have political implications (Cuthbertson, 1996), whilst the practical side of the problem has clear relevance to portfolio management (Elton and Gruber, 1995) and derivative pricing (Hull, 1997). Up till now all market models contain \"smart money\" traders and \"noise\" traders whose joint activity constitutes the market (De Long et al., 1990; Bak et al., 1997). On a short time scale this traditional separation does not seem to be realistic, and is hardly acceptable since all high-frequency market participants are professional traders and cannot be separated into \"smart\" and \"noise\". In this paper we present a \"microscopic\" model with homogenuous quasi-rational behaviour of traders, aiming to describe short time market behaviour. To construct the model we use an analogy between \"screening\" in quantum electrodynamics and an equilibration process in a market with temporal mispricing (Ilinski, 1997; Dunbar, 1998). As a result, we obtain the time-dependent distribution function of the returns which is in quantitative agreement with real market data and obeys the anomalous scaling relations recently reported for both high-frequency exchange rates (Ghashghaie et al., 1996, S&amp;P500 (Mantegna and Stanley, 1994) and other stock market indices (Bouchaud and Sornette, 1994; Matacz, 1997).",

Life is an information system where the information content grows because of selection. It must start with the minimum possible information, or the minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium. It also requires thermodynamically free energy that is accessible by means of its information content. Hence, for its origin, we look for the most benign circumstance or minimum entropy variations over long times with abundant free energy. The unique location for this condition is the pore space in the first few kilometers of the earth's surface. The free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula e.g. iron oxides and fixed hydrocarbon, ( CH 2 ) 16 and the benign environment is the thermal and radiation isolation of the earth's crust. We discuss how this environment occurs naturally and universally astrophysically. We then propose several chemical routes to the formation of life with a minimum entropy departure from thermodynamic equilibrium.",

The essential features of synchronization were reproduced by a numerical calculation regarding the distances among three camphor boats, which changed the driving forces of the individual boats.

Several global topological parameters are used to characterize the protein–protein interaction networks (PINs) for seven organisms. We find that the seven PINs are well approximated by the scale-free networks, that is, the node degree cumulative distribution P cum (k) scales with the node degree k (P cum (k) ~ k -α ). We also find that the logarithm of the average clustering coefficient C ave (k) scales with k (C ave (k) ~ k -β ), for E. coli and S. cerevisiae. In particular, we determine that the E. coli and the S. cerevisiae PINs are better represented by the stochastic and deterministic hierarchical network models, respectively. The current fruit fly protein–protein interaction dataset does not have convincing evidence in favor of the hierarchical network model. These findings lead us to conclude that, in contrast to scale-free structure, hierarchical structure model applies for certain species' PINs only. We also demonstrate that PINs are robust when subject to random perturbation where up to 50% of the nodes are rewired. Average node degree correlation study supports the fact that nodes of low connectivity are correlated, whereas nodes of high connectivity are not directly linked.",

It follows that RNAs whose function depends on the formation of a specific interaction complex with a target RNA molecule will evolve much more slowly than RNAs with a function depending only on their own structure.",

This paper presents new evidence on the effect of different seniority pension reforms, considering the evolution of an agent-based economy in Italy, with heterogeneous workers whose retirement age depends on expected lifetime incomes. Using dynamic aging methods, we examine behavioral changes along proposed pension reform paths. Our model — calibrated to replicate the main demographic and economic features and retirement dynamics of the Italian economy — is used to estimate the age of retirement, total pension expenditures, pension benefits and the trend of inequality and poverty among pensioners under different policy scenarios. More precisely, we compare the current state of affairs (B) with a reform proposed by the Italian Welfare Minister (M) and with an early introduction of a mixed regime for seniority pensions (A) according to two limiting \"retirement behavioral rules.\" Under the individual rationality hypothesis, M produces slightly higher savings with minor redistributive effects; although it leads to an increase in income concentration, M mitigates poverty problems after 2008. The reform is more effective under family-bounded rationality, but it leads to permanent and more significant increases in income concentration and aggravates the diffusion and intensity of poverty.",

One is that a new vertex with the edges is inserted into the network with acceleration at each time step; the other is that, with a given probability, some additional edges are linked with the vertices in proportion to the number of their obtained edges in the latest evolving periods. The new model describes the cases of those complex networks with a few exceptional vertices. The attachment mechanism of the new adding edges for these vertices does not follow the preferential attachment rule. Comparing with the linear edge growth model, the characteristics of the accelerated growth model are studied theoretically and numerically. We show that the degree distributions of these models have a power law decay and the exponents are larger than that of the BA model. We point out that the characteristics of the exceptional vertices and the aging vertices in an aging network are not identical. The reasons for neglecting this attachment in most of evolving networks are also summarized.",

In the locally-interacting model, sites copy the states of randomly-chosen sites in the local neighborhood; in the globally-interacting model, sites copy the states of sites chosen at random from the entire lattice. A multiscale model is also considered, mixing the two types of interactions. Such models can be used to model simple genetic drift, or the spread of opinions or ideas. The pair approximation moment-closure method is used to develop systems of differential equations describing the dynamics of the models with k states per site; stochastic spatially explicit simulations are also used. In simulations on large lattices, state frequencies among sites remain relatively constant at their initial values, while autocorrelations between adjacent sites move toward quasiequilibrium distributions and then remain constant with minor stochastic fluctuations. Full analytical solutions for the transient dynamics of the local autocorrelation (clustering) among adjacent sites are obtained with k = 2 states, and compared with simulations. Both show that increasing global interactions decreases spatial autocorrelation, and that even in the absence of long-distance interaction, there will still be mixing among the states. That is, the lattice will not converge to a quasiequilibrium configuration where regions in different states are maximally isolated from each other (completely segregated), but instead sites will have a strictly positive probability of being adjacent to sites in different states.",

We propose a panorama of models that can be used for action and combined for effective interventions. Notably, the analysis of microregulation carried out in real time in driving situations uses psychoergonomic and cognitive psychology models, while the analysis of traffic accidents uses models developed for the more general diagnosis of safety. Macroregulation of the travel system, carried out with a time delay by network managers, should work in favor of research for consistency among the various actions on the one hand, and the various levels of intervention on space on the other. Safety actions thus require a good understanding of the cognitive models at work in public policies.",

Manipulating the memory horizon available to the agents and the selection criteria they utilize for prediction algorithms, one can maneuver the mean attendance away from the externally provided threshold. We observe that a transition occurs in the attendance distribution at a critical memory, beyond which a larger part of the crowd becomes more comfortable. Agents' confidence in their algorithms and the delayed feedback of attendance data increase the overall collectivity of the system behavior. It is possible to manipulate the time evolution of the attendance either externally, by providing past data with delay, or internally, if agents postpone algorithm modification upon failure.",

    "abstract": "The detection of the low-altitude acoustic target is an important way to compensate for the weakness of radar. Removing the noise mixed in acoustic signal as much as possible to retain the useful information is a challenging task. Inspired by the wavelet threshold, the de-noising method for low-altitude battlefield acoustic signal based on threshold empirical mode decomposition (EMD-T) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the noisy signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to get the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then the IMFs, whose actual energy exceeds its estimated energy, are processed by the EMD threshold. Finally, the processed IMFs are summed to reconstruct the de-noised signal. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, extensive simulations are performed using helicopter sound corrupted with four types of typical low-altitude ambient noise under different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) input values. The performance is evaluated in terms of SNR, root mean square error (RMSE) and smoothness index (SI). The simulations results reveal that the proposed method de-noising method has the perspective of the highest SNR, smallest RMSE and SI in de-noising low-altitude ambient noise compared to other methods, including the wavelet transform (WT) and conventional EMD.",

The sentiment classification through the online incremental learning faces many challenges due to the limitations in the memory and the computing resources available for processing the online reviews. This work has introduced an online incremental learning algorithm for classifying the train reviews. The sentiments available in the reviews provided for the public services are necessary for improving the quality of the service. This work proposes the online kernel optimization-based support vector machine (OKO-SVM) classifier for the sentiment classification of the train reviews. This paper is the extension of the previous work kernel optimization-based support vector machine (KO-SVM). The OKO-SVM classifier uses the proposed fuzzy bound for modifying the weight for each incoming review database for the particular time duration. The simulation uses the standard train review and the movie review database for the classification. From the simulation results, it is evident that the proposed model has achieved a better performance with the values of 84.42%, 93.86%, and 74.56% regarding the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity while classifying the train review database.",

However, the fault-induced impulses are weak especially for the early failure. As to the bearing fault diagnosis, a novel bearing diagnosis method based on scale-varying fractional-order stochastic resonance (SFrSR) is proposed. Signal-to-noise ratio of the SFrSR output is regarded as the criterion for evaluating the stochastic resonance (SR) output. In the proposed method, by selecting the proper parameters (integration step [Formula: see text], amplitude gain [Formula: see text] and fractional-order [Formula: see text]) of SFrSR, the weak fault-induced impulses, the noise and the potential can be matched with each other. An optimal fractional-order dynamic system can be generated. To verify the proposed SFrSR, numerical tests and application verification are conducted in comparison with the traditional scale-varying first-order SR (SFiSR). The results prove that the parameters [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] affect the SFrSR effect seriously and the proposed SFrSR can enhance the weak signal while suppressing the noise. The SFrSR is more effective for bearing fault diagnosis than SFiSR.",

    "abstract": "To meet the rising demand of performing complex tasks in a highly technologized world, the development of mechatronic systems faces two major challenges: First, the system is integrated in a fast changing environment and has to cope with dynamically modified tasks and circumstances. At the same time, the development of new methods has to be fast, cost-effective and efficient. By taking care of both aspects simultaneously, simulations have become an acknowledged tool to cost-effectively and rapidly test and optimize new solutions for complex mechatronic systems, as they are common in, e.g., robotics. Mostly, simulation methods are specialized for one purpose and thus used as a stand-alone tool to analyze the behavior of single components or certain aspects of the whole system. But with size and complexity of the system, the susceptibility to errors rises when the interaction between components fails. If a component shows minimal deviations to its nominal behavior, huge interdependencies between components of complex systems might cause system failure. The structural behavior of a single component is therefore as crucial to the functionality of the whole system as the interplay of all components. Both aspects have to be analyzed in parallel, which is nowadays barely considered. Consequently, this work presents the integration of structural simulations into the overall picture. The developed approach consists of a concept, an implementation and the validation for an automated bidirectional interaction to integrate results from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) into an existing, real-time capable Overall System Simulation for mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular.",

HiLLS defines an automata language that also opens the way to formal verification. This paper provides the building blocks for such a feature.

There are many applications where we need to control these systems by bringing them from their current state to a desired state.

Over the past decades, much focus has been paid on analytical approaches to derive optimal control configurations based on the concept of Minimum Driver node Sets (MDSs) for directed complex networks. However, the underlying control mechanisms of many complex systems rely on quickly controlling a major subspace of a system. In this work, we ask how complex networks behave if driver nodes are randomly selected? We seek to understand and employ the statistical characteristics of MDSs to randomly select driver nodes and analyze the controllability properties of complex network. We propose an algorithm to build Random Driver node Sets (RDSs) and analyze their controllable subspace, the minimum time needed to control, and the cardinality of RDSs.

In addition, outsourcing strategy is adopted to deal with possible shortage caused by the limited capacity. Consequently, the constructed model is involved with joint optimization of the producing and outsourcing quantities, and the selling prices of all the products. For this model with continuous random demands, we first transform it into a nonlinear programming problem by expectation method. Then, an efficient algorithm, called the feasible-direction-based spectral conjugate gradient algorithm, is developed to find a robust solution of the model. By case study and sensitivity analysis, some interesting conclusions are drawn as follows: (a) Budget is a critical constraint for optimizing the decision-making of the retailer, and there exist different threshold values of the budget for the substitute and complementarity scenarios. (b) The price sensitivity matrix seriously affects the maximal expected profit mainly through affecting the optimal outsourcing quantity.",

In old gating casting areas of perimeters 290[Formula: see text]mm and 264[Formula: see text]mm of transmission housing, Reynolds numbers were observed as 16307 and 13806, respectively using simulation software. Data were collected from experiments to change casting area perimeters from 785[Formula: see text]mm and 785[Formula: see text]mm along with the addition of overlap area. New Reynolds numbers at two locations were observed as 3705 and 3393, respectively. Molten metal pressure, velocity and temperature results were related for final shrinkage results of the components on full production. The purpose of the study is to reduce shrinkage and porosity defects in green sand casting part using MAGMAS simulation software. High outcome was the reduction of casting machining rejection in transmission housing casting from 5.8% 0.7% with savings of approximately 0.13 million USD over the period of 14 months. Implications of this work include casting defects study and reduction in different grades and weight range.",

Then the analytical formulas of their stiffness and stress were derived, respectively. With a case study, the deformation and the stress were computed and simulated. The results show that the values computed are close to those simulated. The relative deviations are not more than 5.0%. The results show that the analytical formulas are acceptable. Moreover, it can be seen that for the superimposed Arm-1, when the other structural parameters are fixed, the position of the maximum stress is affected by the thickness ratio of the end thickness to the root thickness for each piece. Finally, a stiffness test was performed on the Z-type guide arm. The results show that the computed stiffness values are closed to those tested and the relative deviations are not more than 3.5%.

The relevance of the research task is determined by the growing interest in practical psychology in the use of computer games as a special diagnostic tool in educational process. There are two original factor models that have been developed and the structural equation modeling of measured parameters has been carried out. The relationships between game dynamic and final individual results in the computer game, on the one hand, and psychometric intelligence and divergent creativity, on the other, are presented. Weak correlation between the above-mentioned and individually measured intellectual and creativity characteristics of the participants with the computer game results was discovered. Consideration of these characteristics in the form of a common latent factor makes it possible to identify the corresponding dependencies only in some cases when there is a dividing the sample into groups according to their ability level. Particularly, the dynamics of game scoring allows to refer participants to the target group with a certain level of abilities (high intelligence and creativity versus low intelligence and creativity), and it is the high level of psychological traits that determines effectiveness in the game behavior, but not vice versa. The qualitative ratios of the two groups of subsets of participants were revealed: weak, medium and strong players and players with three different levels of psychological abilities. The prospects for the further use of computer games for assessment of cognitive abilities in the measurement of combination of psychological abilities are discussed.",

By examining the real price data, we show that the long-term time series includes too much noise obscuring the local information flow; thus, a dynamic calculation is needed. The long-term and short-term sliding transfer entropy (TE) values and the corresponding [Formula: see text]-values, based on daily data, indicate that there is a dynamic information flow.

The primary assumption is that the infected individuals transmit the infection to the susceptible members of the community through direct contact interactions. In the meantime, the susceptibles gather information from the adjacent sites which may lead to taking precautions. The SIR model is used for the diffusion of infection while the Bass equation models the information diffusion. The sociological classification of the individuals indicates that a small percentage of the population take action immediately after being informed, while the majority expect to see some real advantage of taking action. The individuals are assumed to take two different precautions. The precursory measures are getting vaccinated or trying to avoid direct contact with the neighbors. A weighted average of states of the neighbors leads to the choice of action. The fully connected and Scale-free Networks are employed as the underlying network of interactions. The comparison between the simple contagion diffusion and the diffusion of infection in a responsive society showed that a very limited precaution makes a considerable difference in the speed and the size of the spread of illness. Particularly highly connected hubs nodes play an essential role in the reduction of the spread of disease.",

    "abstract": "Climate variability and its changes are issues of broader global concern. This study addresses the annual air temperature movement evaluation and forecasting based on principal component analysis (PCA). An Eigen-temperature model for describing the annual air temperature movement by employing PCA is introduced. Subspace for evaluation is generated by selecting principal orthogonal eigenvectors of covariance matrix of temperature data. The principal eigenvectors are called \"Eigen-temperatures\", since they are eigenvectors and each temperature movement is described by them. Each temperature movement is projected onto the subspace of eigenspace, and described by a linear combination of the Eigen-temperatures. Then, a forecast method for the temperature movement by employing the Eigen-temperatures is proposed. Forecast is implemented with polynomial curve fitting algorithm to estimate subsequent representation weights for the subsequent temperature movement with respect to the \"Eigen-temperatures\" generated by its previous temperature movements. The proposed Eigen-temperature model is applied to evaluation and forecasting for annual temperature movement at Tongchuan observation station of China from 1962 to 1971 and from 1994 to 2002. Experimental results agreeing well with actual observation values show workability of the proposed. Result analysis indicates its effectiveness that the proposed Eigen-temperature model is outperforming the classical AR model and the BP-ANN on the forecast tasks.",

A particular type of pressing is sheet-extrusion which controls the flow of material into special punch and die sets to produce an extruded shape. However, some particularly complex shaped parts cannot be made by sheet-extrusion due to the formation of piping defects. In this study, the finite element method (FEM) was used to investigate the formation of piping defects. In addition, the relationship between the characteristic dimensions of the extruded shape and the piping defect was also examined. Laboratory pressing experiments were performed to validate the accuracy of the FEM simulation results. Based on the stress distribution and velocity profiles within the extruded work piece, the relationship between the extruded shape and the piping defect was clearly identified. Furthermore, the FEM simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental results with regards to the dimensions of the extruded shape and the piping defect.",

Since the extended Boussinesq equations contain high-order derivatives, two different numerical techniques are proposed in this paper in order to simplify the discretization task of the third-order terms. In the first technique, an auxiliary equation is introduced to eliminate the third-order derivatives of the momentum equation while non-overlapping elements with linear interpolating functions are employed to account for the dependent variables. However, in the second method, overlapping elements with quadratic interpolating functions are applied for discretizing the governing equations. Time integration is performed using the Adams–Bashforth–Moulton predictor–corrector method. By considering the truncation error and theoretical analysis for both of the numerical techniques, accuracy and stability of the adopted finite element schemes have been studied. Finally, a computer code is developed based on the proposed schemes. To show the validity as well as the practicality of the developed code, five different test cases are presented, and the results are compared with some analytical solutions and experimental data.

    "abstract": "Epidemic modeling has a long tradition in facilitating an understanding of the spread of infectious agents with direct impact on public health. Recent modeling approaches have specifically improved our understanding of the connections between transmission network topology and epidemic spread: Host populations are generally not well mixed and show heterogeneous and dynamic contact behavior. This results in a broad range of epidemic patterns regarding both speed and width of epidemic expansion. However, there is also a mutual influence between transmission network structure, mixing between susceptible and infected hosts and the epidemic process: epidemic control gets more difficult if infected hosts mix well within the susceptible population. We present a new mathematical framework which allows for a study of mixing patterns between susceptible and infected hosts in populations with very general structural features. While clustering of infected hosts is a qualitatively well known phenomenon, our approach allows for its quantification and puts it in relation to the hosts' overall contact behavior. It shows that different degrees of assortativity emerge depending on the transmission network structure and epidemic stage. This method's use is demonstrated for synthetic populations. It can however easily be transferred to more realistic settings in which information about mixing patterns of epidemic groups is vital for improved epidemic control.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with deriving a dynamic model of a moderately flexible needle inserted into soft tissue, where the model's output is the needle deflection. The main advantages of the proposed dynamic modeling approach are that the presented model structure involves parameters that are all measurable or identifiable by simple experiments and that it considers the same inputs that are currently used in the clinical practice of manual needle insertion. Conventional manual needle insertion suffers from the fact that flexible needles bend during insertion and their trajectories often vary from those planned, resulting in positioning errors. Enhancement of needle insertion accuracy via robot-assisted needle steering has received significant attention in the past decade. A common assumption in previous research has been that the needle behavior during insertion can be adequately described by static models relating the needle's forces and torques to its deflection. For closed-loop control purposes, however, a dynamic model of the flexible needle in soft tissue is desired. In this paper, we propose a Lagrangian-based dynamic model for the coupled needle/tissue system, and analyze the response of the dynamic system. Steerability (controllability) analysis is also performed, which is only possible with a dynamic model. The proposed dynamic model can serve as a cornerstone of future research into designing dynamics-based control strategies for closed-loop needle steering in soft tissue aimed at minimizing position error.",

Prevailing supercomputers with thousands of CPUs and GPUs make it possible to carry out such simulation. The key is to distribute large-scale agents to massive cores of CPUs and GPUs properly for parallel computing with efficient communication and synchronization. For simplicity and efficiency, a modified discrete event system specification (DEVS) is proposed for large-scale artificial society modeling and parallelism is exploited in agent models because similar agents usually share similar behaviors. Through phased synchronization, a two-tier parallel simulation engine is designed with support of MPI and OpenCL where GPU is used as coprocessor. One-sided communication is used for reflection of remote simulation objects and message passing between processes. A general kernel function prototype is elaborately designed and conditionally compiled for execution on both CPU and GPU. An artificial society for epidemic study is used to test the performance on a supercomputer with 1024 CPU cores and 1792 GPU cores. The speedup reaches 3512 for even 2 billion agents with GPU acceleration which is far over 701 when only CPUs are used.

Section 2 is on declarative modeling of component systems as well as its advantages for self-documentation and for computer-aided checks and coupling. As an example for declarative modeling, General System Theory (GEST) implementor is given. In Sec. 3, basic concepts for coupling of component models, and rules for computer-assisted coupling specification are explained. Section 4 is devoted to possible computerized checks in couplings of declarative models such as: (1) automatic unit checking to avoid meaningless input/output matching at the time of coupling specification, (2) automatic threshold checking to provide warnings and/or to avoid disasters, and (3) automatic unit conversion for convenience of using library models. Section 5 is about several layers of nested couplings for modeling systems of systems. In Sec. 6, two types of variable couplings are discussed: (1) couplings with variable connections (to allow input/output relations of models to depend on time or state conditions) and (2) coupling with variable component models (to allow component (or coupled) models to be switched based on time or state conditions). Section 7 is on the use of multimodels as component models in couplings. Section 8 is on types of inputs and their use in couplings as well as on external inputs to simulation studies. In Sec. 9, conclusions and future work for complex systems are outlined. Especially, the values of simulation systems engineering as well as understanding and avoidance of misunderstanding in cognitive and emotive simulations are stressed. Appendix A is a list of almost 50 types of couplings and Appendix B lists over 50 terms related with couplings in modeling and simulation. To show the richness of \"input\" concept which is important in specification of input/output relations of component models, Appendix C lists almost 150 types of inputs. Information shared in this article may be useful in developing advanced modeling and simulation software, tools and environments.",

The proposed scheme suggests that routers and resources comprise VOs within a Grid system, where a router controls locally a number of resources. The router also maintains the connections of each VO with other VOs in the system. Each VO acquires only partial/limited knowledge of the availability of resources controlled by other VOs in the system. When a request for a specific resource is created in a VO of the system, the goal is to discover an appropriate resource for its satisfaction, and subsequently to effectively direct this request. The proposed resource discovery scheme takes into consideration the fact that VOs only acquire a limited knowledge of the system and manages to extend this knowledge without affecting negatively the satisfaction of requests. During the satisfaction of requests, the proposed resource discovery scheme supports and enhances the VOs of the system in order to gain better knowledge of the Grid resource availability. As the creation and satisfaction of requests progress, the VOs manage to acquire an adequate knowledge of the Grid resources, enhancing the overall system's well-function. Finally, this paper presents the performance evaluation of the resource discovery scheme by providing a number of simulation tests in Grid systems of different sizes.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Chinese megacities have suffered serious air pollution. Previous studies have pointed out that transportation systems have become one of the major sources of air pollution and on-road pollutant concentrations are significantly higher than off-road. Electric vehicle (EV) introduction is proposed as a method to alleviate the current situation. In order to better understand the benefit of the use of EVs in Beijing, a simulation platform has been developed to evaluate the improvement of air quality with the use of EVs quantitatively within the selected area. Four scenarios with different EV penetration rates are proposed and the results revealed 5%, 10%, 15% EV penetration rates which will bring about improvement of 0.86%, 9.01% and 12.23% for PM2.5, 0.92%, 9.01% and 13.32% for nitrogen oxides (NO x ), 0.95%, 8.86% and 13.73% for CO, respectively. The results revealed a promising improvement of air quality with the introduction of EVs.",

    "abstract": "A software framework is an infrastructure or architecture intended to enable the integration and interoperation of a set of software components. A specialized type of software frameworks are those specifically designed to support the composition of models or other components within a simulation system. Such frameworks are intended to simplify the process of assembling a complex model or simulation system from simpler component models as well as to promote the reuse of the component models. Several different types of software frameworks for model composition have been designed and implemented; the various framework types have different component types, processes for composing models, and intended applications. The different framework types and the implemented examples of them vary widely in terms of features and capabilities. Comparing alternative frameworks so as to assess their likely utility for a specific application has heretofore been largely subjective and qualitative, and consequently of uncertain reliability. To address this issue an assessment methodology specifically designed for comparing model composition frameworks is developed and explained. The methodology employs a quantitative metric based on a set of well-defined criteria relating to the features and capabilities of simulation frameworks and is intended to be objective and quantitative. The methodology is illustrated and demonstrated by applying it to a set of existing model composition frameworks. The assessment results suggest that using the methodology can, at a minimum, improve the objectivity and reliability of framework selection decisions. The assessment criteria may also be useful as guidelines when designing and developing a framework.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a computing procedure to analyze a network of credit and debt among agents (nodes) from a standpoint of balance sheet dependencies. The aim is to develop a method to assess thoroughly the sensitivity of the network to potential individual insolvencies. For this purpose, given a state of the network, the insolvency of an agent is assumed and the cascade of provoked insolvencies is simulated. Exploring the matrix definition of the network, this is made systematically for all agents. Therefore, in only one run of the procedure, all the possible trajectories of insolvencies, each beginning in a different agent, are calculated. This allows spotting at a glance which agents are “systemically riskier”. Determination of adequate capital levels can be made on a case basis by running the procedure repeatedly. This work contributes with two new aspects to the existing literature. First, given a known situation of a credit and debt network, a computing procedure is presented that allows to assess the network sensitivity to the exogenous insolvency of any of its nodes. Second, continued monitoring of a credit and debt network is computationally feasible. This “proof of concept” software can be extended into a tool useful for research and regulation, if the relevant information is made available.",

Combined with the surface friction and elastic extrusion mechanism between the cutting tool and workpiece, the micro-cutting force model was constructed from two aspects. The micro-cutting depth is deeper than the minimum cutting depth and the micro-cutting depth is shallower than the minimum cutting depth, then the minimum cutting depth value was calculated. Combined with the dislocation properties and microcrystal structure of workpiece’s material, the internal stress of the micromachining force model based on the gradient plasticity theory was calculated, and the force model of the micro-cutting process was studied too. It is significant to control the precision of micromachining process during the micromachining process by constructing the micromachining process force model through studying the small deformation of the material and the mechanism of micromachining.",

Second, a hybrid particle lattice Boltzmann method for shallow water (LBMSW) is recovered from the dynamic geometry on fluid surface. As it is found that the resimulation details fade gradually with LBMSW auto-advection, a physically-based enhancement scheme is presented. A nonlinear algorithm is introduced to stretch the faded density to retain resimulation details. Experiments show that the proposed approach can obtain more realistic resimulation products in several challenging scenarios.",

A finite element model is developed to simulate a VCM with different beams applying a harmonic analysis. The VCM is extracted from a recycled hard disk drive (HDD) and a parametric modal analysis is performed to identify the material parameters of the HDD and the beam. These parameters are obtained comparing the real vibration modes and natural frequencies (VCM-beam) with those determined from the finite element model. A numerical-experimental case study is carried out to demonstrate that if a beam is designed for a specific low frequency vibration between 0 and [Formula: see text], the displacements are maximized in the VCM. For this purpose, real acceleration measurements taken from three individuals are used to provide the vibration signals in the numerical model. A beam is designed for one of the individuals using the natural frequency values determined from the measured signals. Results show that the displacements are maximized in the model which coincides with the natural frequency of the chosen individual. The main purpose of this research is to establish a design tool for energy harvesting purposes with VCM based on low frequency vibration sources as for example gait motions.",

Exergy analysis, being a new and useful thermodynamics tool, will be applied to one of the newest research fields in hydrogen production. One of the many advantages of computer simulation is elimination of the need to construct a pilot plant. Presently, extensive research is underway to come up with the production and use of clean fuels. The research entails performing pilot studies and proof of concept experiments using validated models. The research is further extended to various analyses such as safety, economic sustainability and energy efficiency of the processes involved. The production of hydrogen through thermochemical water splitting processes is one of the newest technologies and is expected to compete with the existing technologies. Among a wide range of thermochemical cycles, the sulfur-iodine (SI) thermochemical cycle process has been proposed as a promising technology for the production of hydrogen. In this research, we demonstrate how a commercial simulator can be used to perform an energy and exergy analysis of the SI water splitting process. Using a commercial simulator, a process flowsheet is developed based on research findings presented by other authors and an energy-exergy analysis is carried out on the process. The method of energy–exergy analysis used in this presentation indicates that an energy and exergy efficiency of 17% and 24% can be attained, respectively, in the conceptual design of the SI cycle.",

It is suitable for military wireless network that has the characteristics of mobility and works effectively under severe environment and electromagnetic interfering conditions. However, military network cannot benefit from existing routing protocol directly; there exists quite many features which are only typical for military network. For example, there are several radios in the same vehicle. This paper presents a new metric for routing, which is employed in A* algorithm. The goal of the metric is to choose a route of less distance and less transmission delay between a source and a destination. Our metric is a function of the distance between the ends and the bandwidth over the link. Moreover, we take frequency selection into account since a node can work on multi-frequencies. This paper proposed the new metric, and experimented it based on A* algorithm. The simulation results show that this metric can find the optimal route which has less transmission delay compared to the shortest path routing.",

The sum rule reflects a tradeoff between the finer and larger scale collective degrees of freedom. For short duration trajectories, where acceleration is irrelevant, the sum rule can be related to the moment of inertia and the kinetic energy (times a characteristic time squared). Thus, two nonequilibrium systems that have the same kinetic energy and moment of inertia can, when compared to each other, have different scales of behavior, but if one of them has larger scales of behavior than the other, it must compensate by also having smaller scales of behavior. In the context of coherence or correlation, the larger scale of behavior corresponds to the collective motion, while the smaller scales of behavior correspond to the relative motion of correlated particles. For longer duration trajectories, the sum rule includes the full effective moment of inertia of the system in space-time with respect to an external frame of reference, providing the possibility of relating the class of systems that can exist in the same space-time domain.",

Employing techniques related to shape analysis, we show that these systems in most cases exhibit self-organization. Moreover, we consider spatial constraints of interactions, and additionaly show that particle systems can self-organize without the emergence of pattern-like structures. However, we will see that regular pattern-like structures help to overcome limitations of self-organization that are imposed by the spatial structure of interactions.",

    "abstract": "A new interactive \"wall game\" is proposed to study the emergence of rules and symbols in interaction dynamics. In this game, two human players alternately configure a pattern on a board to communicate with each other. Distinct from related studies, players in this game have no explicit game scores or tasks to optimize. Any dynamics occurring in this game are therefore ad-hoc and on-going processes. There were three major findings in this paper. (i) The subjects mainly interacted in two modes: a dynamic mode where players proceed through the game without assigning any meanings to the pattern, and a metaphoric mode, where players process with narrative reflection. (ii) Subjects spontaneously switch between the two modes, but this switching is suppressed when playing alone. (iii) A transition diagram of the board pattern can be used to label the two modes, e.g. linearity of the diagram is correlated with the metaphoric mode. One of the main features of grammar is to display subjects' intentionality in a systematic way. We argue that the switching between the two modes observed in our experiment can be taken as a grammatical aspect that emerged in the process. These modes express the speaker's perspective in the same manner as grammatical elements do in natural language. The switching behavior should be seen as a process that embodies a player's intention using the medium (in this case, the patterns in the wall game), and a player's exploration of the medium is a necessary step before generating a grammar structure.",

Image reconstruction in ERT is an ill-posed inverse problem and we have replaced the reverse solver by a two-stage optimization algorithm. The first stage of GA-ERT is reach to an approximate shape and location of the object. Also in this stage, we proposed a new electrode arrangement for ERT forward solver to reduce the process time of the forward problem. In the second stage, the GA employs result of the first stage as an initial population instead of a random group. Therefore with the local zoom, the GA can be employed to obtain the shape and location of the object more precisely. Experimental results of numerically solved ERT by the GA are also presented and compared to those obtained by other more established inversion methods such as modified Newton–Raphson (mNR) and RES2DINV program which is a standard 2-D resistivity inversion program. Results show that the proposed method can efficiently improve the ill-posed condition of ERT image reconstruction problem and can superiorly enhance the quality of ERT images.",

The dimer automaton is a stochastic modeling and simulation framework with a good balance of robustness, generality, and simplicity with capacity to model a wide range of phenomena. A major advantage of dimer automata is the ease in which they can be applied to any space that can be represented as a graph.

The article starts with the development of an evolutionary model of the interactions between corrupt and noncorrupt citizens and functionaries of the state, which is subsequently explored by formal analyses and computer simulation. It turns out that zero-corruption is always evolutionarily stable, whereas pervasive corruption displays only conditional evolutionary stability and thus is empirically rare. Between these two extremes there is organized bureaucratic corruption, which is in most cases quasi-stable with fluctuations around an equilibrium representing the coexistence of corrupt and noncorrupt agents. Empirical analyses of corruption data from 89 countries seem to corroborate these theoretical insights.",

This study complements this research by showing that in settings of interacting individuals, especially in settings of social learning, where individuals can learn from one another, base rate neglect can increase a population's welfare. This study further supports the research arguing that a population with members biased by neglecting base rates does not need to perform worse than a population with unbiased members. Adapting the model of social learning suggested by Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer and Welch (The Journal of Political Economy100 (1992) 992–1026) and including base rates that differ from generic cases such as 50–50, conditions are identified that make underweighting base rate information increasing the population's welfare. The base rate neglect can start a social learning process that otherwise had not been started and thus base rate neglect can generate positive externalities improving a population's welfare.",

At first, some techniques are presented for enriching the EFG approximations near the crack tip such as extrinsic and intrinsic enrichment. Extrinsic enrichment involves the addition of solution form to the trial function, whereas the EFG basis is expanded to include few terms from crack tip solution in intrinsic enrichment. Apart from enrichment techniques, four basic techniques of smoothing meshless approximations near nonconvex boundaries are also presented such as diffraction, transparency, see through and wedge model. These techniques are then used for the parameteric analysis of an edge crack problem under mode-1 loading and results obtained using different approaches are compared with each other as well as with exact solution. Among these techniques, the extrinsic PU enrichment technique was found to be more accurate as compared to other approaches. Extrinsic PU enrichment technique has also been used for the analysis of a shear edge crack problem. In all these techniques, the value of mode-1 stress intensity factor and mode-2 stress intensity factor has been evaluated by interaction integral approach. Effect of crack orientation is also studied for different cases.",

A great deal of research effort has gone into the study of the performance of one such network standard, namely the IEEE 802.16 networks.

In grammar systems theory, the grammars can be interpreted as agents, whilst the generated language describes the behavior of the system. To characterize the various phenomena that may arise in peer-to-peer networks, we apply networks of parallel multiset string processors. The multiset string processors form teams, send and receive information through collective and individual filters. We deal with the dynamics of the string collections. To describe the information harvest of the crawlers, we employ certain regulated rewriting devices in eco-grammar systems. We illustrate the wide range of applicability of the regulated rewriting devices in the field of web crawling techniques.

Purifying selection dominates in large panmictic populations, where the Mendelian law of independent gene assortment is valid. If instead the populations are small, recombination processes are not effective enough to ensure an independent assortment of linked genes, and larger clusters of genes could be inherited as genetic units. There are whole clusters of genes which tend to complement in such conditions instead of single pairs of alleles like in the case of purifying selection. Computer simulations have shown that switching between complementation and purification strategies has the characteristic of a phase transition. This is also responsible for specific distribution of recombination events observed along eukaryotic chromosomes (a higher recombination rate is observed in subtelomeric regions than in central parts of chromosomes) and for sympatric speciation.",

OFDM is a multicarrier modulation technique and considered to offer significant reduction of the data symbol to be carried per carrier channel, especially in ultra-high speed optical communications with bit rate reaching 100 Gb/s or even higher. This paper thus presents a novel and generic OFDM system employing both MATLAB Simulink and FPGA-based development software platform for simulation as well as hardware implementation for the generation and detection of OFDM signals for wireless and optical communications transmission media. Although the transmission medium is modeled with delay distortion filter in the baseband, this model would be valid for passband signals as the amplitude is represented by complex amplitude whose phase would be the phase of the carrier. The Simulink and hardware models presented hereunder are scalable to much higher speed allowing possible implementation in multi-Giga samples per second electronic processors. The sub-systems of the OFDM transmitter and receiver are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of such models for ultra-wideband communication systems such as wireless access and long haul optical fiber communication backbone networks.",

    "abstract": "Can the discussions about new issues challenge the organization of a society? That is, the question we tried to answer with a very simple model considering a society where individuals are organized into groups. An individual discuss its opinion on this new issue following the rule of the bounded confidence model implying that an individual influences and is influenced when it is sufficiently open-minded. One of the main ingredients of the model is the groups that both influence the behavior of the individual and characterize the social network topology. Individuals choose the group membership according to their opinion. Starting from an initial homogeneous group size distribution, four different prototypical regimes can be reproduced by the model, depending on the individual open-mindedness: From a high heterogeneity condition, with one or two largely major groups, to an invariant situation of homogeneity. The heterogeneity is explained by the dynamics of individuals. In this paper, we extend the studies of a previous work on the argument, deepening the analysis on the internal structure of the groups and on the dynamical process itself. To do this, we analyze indicators related to the stability of the obtained virtual society. We found that the dynamics of groups is not stable when open-mindedness is small, even if the dynamics of opinions reaches equilibrium. On the other side, for larger values of the open-mindedness, both the opinion and the group dynamics stabilize. Thus, our study shows that the introduction of a new topic of discussion in a society can strongly challenge group structures, both concerning their stability and their size.",

    "abstract": "We consider a system of heterogeneous agents playing the Minority Game on two markets. At each time step, each agent plays on one of the markets only. The agents can change the market according to some switching scheme. Various switching schemes are investigated: those that depend on the performance of the agents on each of the markets, and those that determine the actual market as a function of the number of games lost on the markets. We discuss the influence of the chosen switching scheme on the overall performance of the system of agents. In particular, we study both aggregate attendance (price returns) and volatilities for various schemes of the market choice.",

    "abstract": "Human cancer may be thought of as Darwinian evolution of cells within the body (somatic evolution). As such, it may be modeled using evolutionary game theory. Winners in this game are able to maintain viable population numbers while losers go extinct. A model for somatic evolution is presented that shows how cancer can evolve to become a winner in this game. Associated with the model is an adaptive landscape that illustrates the evolutionary potential of cells as a function of adaptive parameters used by cells. Normal cells have a novel adaptive landscape that permits coexistence of invading mutant phenotypes. A mutant cellular population needs not immediately form a malignancy due to the existence of cellular constraints that results in limited growth and non-lethal coexistence. However, this coexistence deforms the local adaptive landscape resulting in an unoccupied fitness peak. The existence of this peak provides the potential for evolution to drive the mutant cells from simple coexistence to an evasive cancer. The model presented here suggests all that is required to accomplish this result is the relaxation of constraints that normally prohibit cells to evolve.",

This model uses a \"mapping partial derivative\" and a constrained inverse algorithm to identify the model parameters. The model values depend continuously on all the model parameters, and represent most data which are not multi-dimensional self-affine in R n . Therefore, the result is very general.

Myxobacteria are social bacteria that swarm, glide on surfaces and feed cooperatively. When starved, tens of thousands of cells change their movement pattern from outward spreading to inward concentration; they form aggregates that become fruiting bodies. Cells inside fruiting bodies differentiate into round, nonmotile, environmentally resistant spores. Traditionally, cell aggregation has been considered to imply chemotaxis, a long-range cell interaction. However, myxobacteria aggregation is the consequence of direct cell-contact interactions, not chemotaxis. In this paper, we review biological LGCA models based on local cell–cell contact signaling that have reproduced the rippling, streaming, aggregating and sporulation stages of the fruiting body formation in myxobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing is the distributed computing paradigm continually exposed to different attacks and threats of various origins. The data stored in the cloud framework is easier for external and internal intruders, as access to the cloud framework is done through internet services. Various intrusion detection (ID) methods are developed to detect network intruders in the cloud, but these methods are not primarily effective in generating accurate detection results. Hence, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) is designed to solve the security issues that unfavorably influence the sustainable development of the cloud and enhance the protection of the cloud from malicious attacks. The IDS is modeled using the proposed Feedback Deer Hunting Optimization (FDHO)-based Deep Residual network to detect network intrusions. However, the proposed FDHO algorithm is designed by integrating Feedback Artificial Tree (FAT) with Deer Hunting Optimization (DHOA), respectively. Moreover, the detection of malicious attacks is carried out using a Deep Residual network that significantly increases the training speed, reduces the computational complexity, and generates effective detection results. The performance of the proposed method is comparatively analyzed with the existing techniques, such as Stacked Contractive Auto-Encoder and Support Vector Machine (SCAE+SVM), Artificial Neural Network with ant bee colony optimization algorithm+fuzzy clustering (ANN+ABC+fuzzy clustering), Improved dynamic immune algorithm (IDIA), and Normalized K-means (NK) clustering algorithm with RNN named, (NK-RNN), FAT-based Deep Residual network, and DHOA-based Deep Residual network using the BoT-IoT dataset and KDD cup-99 dataset. The proposed method achieved outstanding performance by considering the metrics, like specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity, with the values of 0.9526, 0.9498, and 0.9214 using the BoT-IoT dataset.",

    "abstract": "Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is fast emerging as a practically useful computational simulation tool for a wide variety of engineering problems. SPH is also gaining popularity as the back bone for fast and realistic animations in graphics and video games. The Lagrangian and mesh-free nature of the method facilitates fast and accurate simulation of material deformation, interface capture, etc. Typically, particle-based methods would necessitate particle search and locate algorithms to be implemented efficiently, as continuous creation of neighbor particle lists is a computationally expensive step. Hence, it is advantageous to implement SPH, on modern multi-core platforms with the help of High-Performance Computing (HPC) tools. In this work, the computational performance of an SPH algorithm is assessed on multi-core Central Processing Unit (CPU) as well as massively parallel General Purpose Graphical Processing Units (GP-GPU). Parallelizing SPH faces several challenges such as, scalability of the neighbor search process, force calculations, minimizing thread divergence, achieving coalesced memory access patterns, balancing workload, ensuring optimum use of computational resources, etc. While addressing some of these challenges, detailed analysis of performance metrics such as speedup, global load efficiency, global store efficiency, warp execution efficiency, occupancy, etc. is evaluated. The OpenMP and Compute Unified Device Architecture[Formula: see text] parallel programming models have been used for parallel computing on Intel Xeon[Formula: see text] E5-[Formula: see text] multi-core CPU and NVIDIA Quadro M[Formula: see text] and NVIDIA Tesla p[Formula: see text] massively parallel GPU architectures. Standard benchmark problems from the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) literature are chosen for the validation. The key concern of how to identify a suitable architecture for mesh-less methods which essentially require heavy workload of neighbor search and evaluation of local force fields from neighbor interactions is addressed.",

In order to improve the dry granulation characteristics and the comprehensive performance of Si 3 N 4 ceramic bearing balls, the atomization mechanism of the spinning nozzle used for Si 3 N 4 dry granulation was studied in detail. The interaction between air and binder in the pressure-swirl nozzle is analyzed based on VOF method, the modified realizable [Formula: see text] turbulence model is used to simulate the flow field inside and outside the pressure-swirl nozzle, the effects of nozzle inlet parameters including the number of tangential inlets and the deflection angle of tangential inlets on the binder volume fraction, velocity distribution and pressure distribution are analyzed. The results show that when the number of tangential inlets increases from 1 to 4, the swirl strength of gas–liquid two-phase in the nozzle increases, the mean diameter of air core increases from 1.51[Formula: see text]mm to 2.01[Formula: see text]mm, and the spray cone angle increases from 18.5[Formula: see text] to 26.4[Formula: see text]. Besides, when the deflection angle of tangential inlet increases from 0[Formula: see text] to 15[Formula: see text], the swirl strength of gas–liquid two-phase in the nozzle with the deflection angle of tangential inlet of 10[Formula: see text] is the largest, and the mean diameter of air core and spray cone angle is 3.04[Formula: see text]mm and 30.7[Formula: see text], respectively.

    "abstract": "Since the first agent-based models (ABM), the scientific community has been interested in making not only the results of computational models understandable but also the modeling description, to facilitate their replication. The form that has been adopted to a greater extent has been the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol, which provides a generic structure for its documentation. This protocol provides a way to clearly explain the procedures and interactions of the complex systems to be analyzed, with applications that have spread across different disciplines. This study presents a bibliometric analysis using Scopus database of the articles that emerged from the first publication of this protocol in 2006. The results show that the use of this form of documenting has grown in Economics, but its participation remains stable in relative terms. Results also show that the top journal both in number of articles and impact is JASSS, but it is not observed that there is a greater dissemination toward specific Economics journals or that it is used for a greater number of topics. Finally, it is found that there is a common core in Economics’ ABM literature, with a bias toward methodological articles in the articles that follow the ODD protocol while there is a bias towards articles on economic models in those that do not follow this protocol.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale social media, sentiment classification is a significant one for connecting gaps among social media contents as well as real-world actions, including public emotional status monitoring, political election prediction, and so on. On the other hand, textual sentiment classification is well studied by various platforms, like Instagram, Twitter, etc. Sentiment classification has many advantages in various fields, like opinion polls, education, and e-commerce. Sentiment classification is an interesting and progressing research area due to its applications in several areas. The information is collected from various people about social, products, and social events by web in sentiment analysis. This review provides a detailed survey of 50 research papers presenting sentiment classification schemes such as active learning-based approach, aspect learning-based method, and machine learning-based approach. The analysis is presented based on the categorization of sentiment classification schemes, the dataset used, software tools utilized, published year, and the performance metrics. Finally, the issues of existing methods considering conventional sentiment classification strategies are elaborated to obtain improved contribution in devising significant sentiment classification strategies. Moreover, the probable future research directions in attaining efficient sentiment classification are provided.",

A tire blowout model was established based on the UniTire model and the change of tire blowout mechanical characteristics. A Carsim/ Simulink joint simulation platform was built to study the dynamic response of the vehicle after the front wheel tire blowout under curve driving. A combined control strategy of outer-loop trajectory control and inner-loop differential braking control based on sliding mode fuzzy control algorithms and fuzzy PID control algorithms was proposed to ensure that the vehicle can still follow the original trajectory stably after tire blowout. The results show that the tire blowout of the front wheel on the same side as the turning direction has a great influence on the instability and yaw of the vehicle, and the designed control strategy can effectively control the running track of the vehicle with tire blowout and the vehicle stability.",

Simplified mathematical models are often used to shed light on the subtle relations between success and luck. Recently, a simple model called “Talent versus Luck” showed that the most successful individual in a population can be just an average talented individual that is subjected to a very fortunate sequence of events. Here, we modify the framework of the TvL model such that in our model the individuals’ success is modelled as an ensemble of one-dimensional random walks. Our model reproduces the original TvL results and, due to the mathematical simplicity, it shows clearly that the original conclusions of the TvL model are the consequence of two factors: first, the normal distribution of talents with low standard deviation, which creates a large number of average talented individuals; second, the low number of steps considered, which allows the observation of large fluctuations. We also show that the results strongly depend on the relative frequency of good and bad luck events, which defines a critical value for the talent: in the long run, the individuals with high talent end up very successful and those with low talent end up ruined. Last, we considered two variations to illustrate applications of the ensemble of random walks model.",

    "abstract": "Twitter is a popular social medium for sharing opinions and engaging in topical debates, yet presents a wide spread of misinformation, especially in political debates, from bots and adversarial attacks. The current state-of-the-art methods for detecting humans and bots in Twitter often lack generalizability beyond English. Here, a language-agnostic method to detect real users and their interactions by leveraging network topology from retweets is presented. To that end, the chosen topic is COVID-19 policies in Mexico, which has been considered by users as polemic. Two kinds of network are built: a directed network of retweets; and the co-event network, where a non-directed link between two users exists if they have retweeted the same post in a given time window (projection of a bipartite network). Then, single node properties of these networks, such as the clustering coefficient and the degree, are studied. Three kinds of users are observed: some with a high clustering coefficient but a very small degree, a second group with zero clustering coefficient and a variable degree, and a third group in which the clustering coefficient as a function of the degree decays as a power law. This third group represents ∼2% of the users and is characteristic of dynamical networks with feedback. The latter seems to represent strongly interacting followers/followed in a real social network as confirmed by an inspection of such nodes. A percolation analysis of the resulting co-retweet and co-hashtag network reveals the relevance of such weak links, typical of real social human networks. The presented methods are simple to implement in other social media platforms and can be used to mitigate misinformation and conflicts.",

In this approach, an investment model is considered where the agent decides at every time step the proportion of wealth to invest in a risky asset, keeping the rest of the budget in a risk-free asset. Every investment is evaluated in the market via stylized return on investment function (RoI), which is modeled by a stochastic process with unknown periodicities and levels of noise. For comparison, two reference strategies are presented which represent the case of agents with zero knowledge and complete knowledge of the dynamics of the returns. An investment strategy based on technical analysis to forecast the next return is also considered. To account for the performance of the different strategies, some computer experiments are performed to calculate the average budget that can be obtained with them over a certain number of time steps. To assure fair comparisons, the parameters of each strategy are first tuned for budget maximization. Afterward, the performance of these strategies is compared for RoI's with different periodicities and levels of noise.",

The game randomly pairs players from opposite populations. It is symmetric at the individual level, but has many equilibria that are more or less favorable to the members of the two populations. Which of these equilibria is then attained is decided by the dynamics at the population level. Players play repeatedly, but in each round with a new opponent. They can learn from their previous encounters and translate this into their actions in the present round on the basis of strategic schemes. The schemes can be quite simple, or very elaborate. We can then break the symmetry in the game and give the members of the two populations access to different strategy spaces. Typically, simpler strategy types have an advantage because they tend to go more quickly toward a favorable equilibrium which, once reached, the other population is forced to accept. Also, populations with bolder individuals that may not fare so well at the level of individual performance may obtain an advantage toward ones with more timid players. By checking the effects of parameters such as the generation length or the mutation rate, we are able to compare the relative contributions of individual learning and evolutionary adaptations.",

We concentrate mainly on selection–mutation systems, showing different implementations of the perturbative framework, developing, for example, perturbative expansions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix. The main focus, however, is on diagrammatic methods, taken from physics, where we show how approximations can be built up using a pictorial representation generated by a simple set of rules, and how the renormalization group can be used to systematically improve the perturbation theory.",

Within Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) working environment, temporal and spatial evolution processes of traffic flow in urban road networks are closely related to strategies of providing traffic information and contents of information. In view of the day-to-day route-choice situations, this study constructs original updating models of the cognitive travel time of travelers under four conditions, including not providing any route travel time, only providing the most rapid route travel time, only providing the most congested route travel time, and providing all the routes travel times. The disaggregate route-choice approach is adopted for simulation to reveal the relationship between the evolution process of network traffic flow and the strategy of providing traffic information. The simulation shows that providing traffic information to all travelers cannot improve the operational efficiency of road networks. It is noteworthy that an inappropriate information feedback strategy would lead to intense variation in various routes traffic flow. Compared with incomplete information feedback strategies, it is inefficient and superfluous to provide complete traffic information to all travelers.",

Specially, in our model, we successfully use a new ENFA-based complex event detection model instead of an NFA-based complex event detection model to realize the detection of the related events for a complex event from the high proportion disordered RFID event stream by expanding the traditional NFA-based detection model, which can effectively address the problems above.

The numerical simulation model of medium flow based on Particle Flow Code (PFC) was established. By setting four kinds of working conditions of amplitude and frequency, the dynamic graphics and curves of the energy field (such as kinetic energy, strain energy, velocity field, force chain and so on) were obtained. In the situation of mid-frequency with large amplitude, the average speed of front medium flow was 1.3–5.03 times that of others and the low-energy region was decreased by 6% to 10%. The largest kinetic energy and strain energy were 3.25 and 2.94 times the average value of others, respectively. The diamond UFG was analyzed in new vibration mills under the conditions of low frequency with large amplitude and mid-frequency with large amplitude. Utilizing a laser particle size analyzer, it was discovered that the particle sizes d(50) in these two models were 3.840[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m and 0.260[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m and bandwidths were 9.940[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m and 3.825[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m. This highlights the effect of mid-frequency with large amplitude in particle refining and bandwidth narrowing, which is of great importance in the fields of ultra-hard particle refining research and energy utilization.",

Comparisons were made for a number of isotherm and kinetic models to examine the performance of the proposed model. The developed model revealed desirable accuracy and superiority over other models in predicting the adsorption behavior and can be used for other systems of concern.

Mathematical model and simulation realization of each part are introduced in this study. Focusing on the shortness of traditional signal sorting methods, we creatively proposed a presorting method based on the Euclidean distance inside signal flows. Simulation results show that the presorting method based on Euclidean distance successfully reduced the pressure on main sorting and appeared good for signal sorting.

The global rot parameter and rot resistance parameter are used to control a dynamic simulation of a rotting process. The rot resistance parameters of every point of a 3D fruit model are generated by an interactive designing method that is similar to the traditional sketch drawing tools. We construct a texture of a rot region on a fruit surface by resistance parameters. The degree of rot that is used to control both shape and appearance of rotten fruit surface can be computed by tuning the resistance parameters and global rot parameters. We derive an exponential function to calculate the depression displacement of geometric shape caused by the rot. In order to render a wrinkle on the rot region, we use a normal noise map to modify a normal vector of fruit model and use an isotropic ward BRDF model to represent an appearance of fruit in which the time-varying diffuse reflectance is derived from the real photos. We utilize a linear function to control the dynamic simulation processes including shape deformation and aging appearance. We have evaluated our method by simulating the rotten apple and moldy orange. The results have shown that our method provides a dynamic, real-time and realistic simulation, and it is flexible, fast and of a general character for digital fruit design as a visualization model.",

The concept of data publishing faces a lot of security issues, indicating that when any trusted organization provides data to a third party, personal information need not be disclosed. Therefore, to maintain the privacy of the data, this paper proposes an algorithm for privacy preserved collaborative data publishing using the Genetic Grey Wolf Optimizer (Genetic GWO) algorithm for which a C-mixture parameter is used. The C-mixture parameter enhances the privacy of the data if the data does not satisfy the privacy constraints, such as the [Formula: see text]-anonymity, [Formula: see text]-diversity and the [Formula: see text]-privacy. A minimum fitness value is maintained that depends on the minimum value of the generalized information loss and the minimum value of the average equivalence class size. The minimum value of the fitness ensures the maximum utility and the maximum privacy. Experimentation was carried out using the adult dataset, and the proposed Genetic GWO outperformed the existing methods in terms of the generalized information loss and the average equivalence class metric and achieved minimum values at a rate of 0.402 and 0.9, respectively.",

The individual model describes a bacterial population interacting with a population of viruses that attack the cells and exploit their reproductive system for their own replication. Coupling between the subsystems is brought about through a unidirectional flow of primary resources. In this way the individual subsystem is modulated by the varying nutrient concentration in the overflow from the upstream habitat. Synchronization of a single subsystem to an external periodic forcing exhibits an unusual bifurcation structure with global bifurcations appearing already at the lowest forcing amplitudes. This peculiarity is also observed for autonomous systems of two and three coupled habitats. Finally, local and global synchronization phenomena are investigated for a chain of 20 coupled population pools.",

An ensemble of 500 single-column model runs using the inferred sub-grid turbulent transport models demonstrated comparable performance to an identical ensemble of runs using the standard, eddy-diffusivity parametrizations for the turbulent transport.

Using this approach, it is possible to efficiently generate self-replicating configurations for fairly arbitrary initial structures. Here, we investigate the properties of self-replicating systems produced using GP in this fashion as the initial configuration's size, shape, symmetry, allowable states, and other factors are systematically varied. We find that the number of GP generations, computation time, and number of resulting rules required by an arbitrary structure to self-replicate are positively and jointly correlated with the number of components, configuration shape, and allowable states in the initial configuration, but inversely correlated with the presence of repeated components, repeated sub-structures, and/or symmetric sub-structures. We conclude that GP can be used as a \"replicator factory\" to produce a wide range of self-replicating CA configurations, and that the properties of the resulting replicators can be predicted in part a priori. The rules controlling self-replication that are created by GP generally differ from those created manually in past CA studies.",

Then, the traditional continuous optimal dynamic and economic control lines are divided into multi-step upshift points. Meanwhile, the corresponding downshift points are set to avoid the interference near shift points. After that, the novel discretized ratio control methods for CVT system are proposed.

    "abstract": "Dimensional variation analysis in multistation manufacturing processes (MMPs) is a challenging research topic with great practical significance. Researchers have been focused on constructing various mathematical models to identify the correlations among the huge amounts of collected production data. However, current models have achieved insufficient insights into the variation correlation laws due to the complexity of the data’s mutual relations. In this study, a data-driven modeling method is developed for deep data-mining and dimensional variation analysis. The proposed initial mathematical expression originates from practical engineering knowledge. Through a mathematical treatment, the mathematical expression is transformed into a first-order AR(1) model format, which contains multiple dimensional variations’ interstation and temporal correlating information. To obtain this information, the estimation of the proposed model is discussed in detail. A simulation case involving two key product characteristics of a grinding process is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method for dimensional variation analysis in MMPs.",

First, the two models and their motion equations were introduced. Then, based on the mechanical parameters of the seat and cab system for a truck, the transmissibility characteristics of the two models were analyzed. The results show that the traditional model can relatively accurately predict the pitch and roll vibration characteristics of the real seat–cab system. However, it overvalues the vertical vibration transmitted from the front suspensions of the cab. Third, the typical excitation conditions and the measuring points were selected. Finally, under the typical excitation conditions, the dynamic responses of the measuring points were calculated. The results show that under the vertical excitation condition, the dynamic responses of the two models have obvious differences. Under the roll excitation condition and the pitch excitation condition, the roll responses and the pitch responses of the cab between the two models show almost no obvious difference. Under the random excitation condition, the vertical acceleration responses have relatively larger deviations between the two models, however, the angular acceleration responses are almost the same. For the preliminary design of the cab system, the traditional cab system model can be used. However, for the accurate design and the optimization of the seat–cab system, the seat–cab coupled model is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, with the advent of the age of Web 2.0, several social recommendation methods that use social network information have been proposed and achieved distinct developments. However, the most critical challenges for the existing majority of these methods are: (1) They tend to utilize only the available social relation between users and deal just with the cold-start user issue. (2) Besides, these methods are suffering from the lack of exploitation of content information such as social tagging, which can provide various sources to extract the item information to overcome the cold-start item and improve the recommendation quality. In this paper, we investigated the efficiency of data fusion by integrating multi-source of information. First, two essential factors, user-side information, and item-side information, are identified. Second, we developed a novel social recommendation model called Two-Sided Regularization (TSR), which is based on the probabilistic matrix factorization method. Finally, the effective quantum-based similarity method is adapted to measure the similarity between users and between items into the proposed model. Experimental results on the real dataset show that our proposed model TSR addresses both of cold-start user and item issues and outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods. These results indicate the importance of incorporating various sources of information in the recommendation process.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and Simulation of Cyber-Physical Systems (MSCPS) is demanding in terms of immediate response to dynamic and complex changes of CPS. Simulation-oriented model reuse can be used to build a whole CPS model by reusing developed models in a new simulation application, which avoid repeated modeling and thus reduce the redevelopment of submodels. Model composition, one of the important methods, enables model reuse by selecting and adopting diversified integration solutions of simulation components to meet the requirements of simulation application systems. In this paper, a real-time model integration approach for global CPS modeling is proposed, which reuses developed submodels by compositing submodel nodes. Specifically, a constrained directed graph of submodels for the whole system which can meet the simulation requirements is constructed by reverse matching. Submodel properties, including co-simulation distance between submodel nodes, reuse benefit and simulation performance of model nodes, are quantified. Based on the properties, the model-integrated solution for the whole CPS simulation is retrieved throughout the model constrained digraph by the Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the experiment, the proposed method is applied to a typical model integrated computing scenario containing multiple model-integration solutions, among which the Pareto optimal solutions are retrieved. Results show that the effectiveness of the model integration method proposed in this paper is verified.",

Thus, in the law enforcement community, more often the physical evidence is collected, preserved, and analyzed. The accused cannot be predicted by normal people or judge just by looking at the evidence obtained at the analysis phase. So, research studies were undertaken on automated recognition as well as retrieval system aimed at forensic Crime Scene Investigation (CSI). A survey on the investigation of forensic CS evidence is depicted here. The main focus is rendered on the computer-centered automated investigation system. The latest research on the different evidence-centered Forensic Investigation (FI), such as the face, Finger-Print (FP), shoeprint, together with other Foot-Wear (FW) impressions, Machine Learning (ML) algorithm-centered FI, ML-centered pattern recognition, features of disparate evidence in forensic CSI, and various matching technique-centered FI, is surveyed here. Finally, centered on the accuracy and other two metrics, the methods’ performance for CSI is compared. Out of all the other methods, OLBP + LSSVM produced better results for precision and recall followed by CLSTM. In terms of accuracy, CLSTM produced better results than any other method.",

Since ordering of intervals involves complexity, hence, we have used fuzzy concept to solve Interval-Valued Transportation Problems (IVTPs). We have proposed new fuzzification methods for conversion of interval number to trapezoidal, pentagonal, hexagonal and heptagonal fuzzy numbers, thereby converting IVTP to Fuzzy Transportation Problem (FTP). Further, we have proposed new ranking functions for conversion of these fuzzy numbers to crisp numbers, which can also be used in other fields of decision making. The crisp-valued transportation problem is then solved using Vogel’s Approximation Method followed by Modified Distribution method. Numerical illustration for the proposed algorithm is given in a later section. The solutions obtained for these examples are used to approximate the solutions for octagonal, nonagonal and decagonal FTPs corresponding to IVTP, using Newton’s Polynomial. On the basis of these solutions, ordering of effectiveness of various types of fuzzy numbers in solving IVTP is done. Lastly, comparison is made between the optimal solutions obtained by various methods. The proposed method can be applied to industrial transportation problems in which the difference between the actual and the proposed demand and supply is quite significant.",

    "abstract": "Load flow (LF) analysis is one of the most important aspects in power system studies. It is the most significant and necessary way to investigate the problems in power system operation and planning. The LF problem comprises a set of nonlinear algebraic equations that must be solved mathematically through iterations. The solution convergence is the most important criteria that is largely affected by the size of power system, which continues to increase in the current modern power system field. Thus, there is no guarantee that the iterative approaches will converge to a valid solution for problems with such large dimensions. This paper develops generalized, effective and simple mathematical models for the solution of the LF problem. The problem is first solved by Gauss–Seidel (GS) method in order to generate the training data. Eureqa software is then adopted for the purpose of data training and mathematical models generation. The models relate bus voltage magnitudes and angles as output parameters with the load active and reactive power values as input parameters. To study the validity of the proposed approach, the mathematical models have been developed for two benchmark test systems; IEEE 5-bus test system and 9-bus test system developed by Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC). When compared with the outputs resulting from GS technique, the results have shown efficient and accurate capability of the generated models for evaluating bus voltages magnitudes and angles as well as generated reactive power. The models have also been compared with other published research. The results have shown efficient performance of the developed models.",

    "abstract": "Along with the rapid development of the Internet technology, social network sites (SNSs) are increasingly emerging. As various types of datasets are easily exposed to the network, privacy security in SNS becomes the focus of the study. Anonymization techniques, such as generalization and bucketization, and data perturbation techniques are usually employed in data publishing for privacy protection. However, in the meanwhile, the privacy protection methods reduce the utility of the data. Thus, the issue of privacy-utility trade-off becomes one very real problem. By considering the privacy-utility trade-off and combining the minimum spanning tree (MST) clustering technique and the sub-graph generalization technique, a privacy protection model is proposed for data publishing in weighted social networks. The MST-based clustering method is one representative and concise graph-based clustering algorithm. Meanwhile, as one MST of an edge-weighted graph is the minimum weight spanning tree, some important properties of the graph like the shortest path are preserved in the MST. Finally, on the basis of sub-graphs (clusters) divided by the MST-clustering, three sub-graph generalization approaches are designed in one reasonable way for data publishing to guarantee the privacy-utility trade-off of the proposed method. Experiments and result analysis indicate workability of the proposed method that the proposed model offers privacy protection for the data publishing by means of the sub-graph generalization approach while it can also improve the data utility especially for occasions like data mining, machine learning, and pattern recognition.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), the emergence and development of social system model, are gradually affecting the development of system engineering technology and methods. AI mainly focuses on acquiring new knowledge or skills by looking for rules from observation data (samples); social system model mainly focuses on the ability of description and model demonstration from the current situation to the future. The combination of AI and social system model can promote the research of social problems related to system engineering. The synergetic growth of various sectors of the economic system depends on the initial level of output of each sector and its internal relations. This paper focuses on the internal relationship of the two-sector economic model and explores the impact of distribution relations on the synergetic growth of sectors. The study found that the necessary conditions for synergetic growth is a function of the profit rate, the difference between the labor income (or capital income) of the two sectors, and the marginal consumption propensity. This function has a more complex and nonlinear characteristic. By demonstrating the effects of changes in some parameters, we find that an increase in the profit rate requires that the income distribution structure of the two sectors tend to be the same; an increase in the marginal consumption propensity can allow for greater differences in the income distribution structure of the two sectors.",

We apply this method, focused on the structural distance, to three significant individuals associated with the Italian Renaissance: Copernicus, Michelangelo, and Pico della Mirandola. The results point to the effectiveness of this approach for discovering new knowledge about the interdisciplinary transactions between people and ideas coming from artistic, scientific and philosophical domains during this period. The emergent network reflects the apparently strong network-level interactions between Michelangelo and Mirandola’s clusters; the importance of Hermeticism across the three clusters; and how the so-called “knowledge dealers” related to Neoplatonism contribute to the depiction of the period by future historians.

    "abstract": "In recent years, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has grasped the attention of all researchers in both industrial and academic fields because it has been regarded as an effective solution for 5G technologies to maximize spectral efficiency and connectivity of the system. Also, it has sufficient potential to maximize the performance of a network. Besides, the deployment of NOMA in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) satisfies the requirements of user’s explosive data traffic. However, the increasing demand for energy consumption of the wireless network provokes the researchers to establish an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme. The applications of NOMA provide better utilization of spectrum efficiency and minimize the cost of resource allocation. The resource allocation problem in wireless networks still remains a challenging task as the HetNets are suffered from mutual cross-tier interference. Hence, this research proposes a new effective hybrid optimization-based energy-efficient resource allocation scheme for NOMA HetNets by introducing a newly proposed method called Feedback Water Cycle Algorithm (FWCA). The method evaluates the user-pairing and sub-channel issue for reducing computational complexity. In addition to this, the network is analyzed for determining the power consumption and energy model with dynamic coefficients. Moreover, the developed FWCO obtained the maximum achievable rate of 25.992[Formula: see text]Mbps/Hz, maximum energy efficiency of 77.398%, maximum sum rate of 31.748[Formula: see text]Mbps/Hz, and maximum throughput of 8.888[Formula: see text]Mbps.",

First, a complex product production abnormal event diagnosis model is constructed, in which physical production workshop, virtual production workshop, workshop twin data platform and abnormal event diagnosis service system work together. Second, the joint method of Bayesian network (BN) and C5.0 decision tree algorithm (C5.0) is used to achieve the diagnosis of production abnormal events. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme are verified by the arithmetic example of key stations in the bogie production workshop. The diagnostic accuracy of 92.49% of the BN–C5.0 model is higher than that of the conventional C5.0 decision tree model with 79.94% accuracy.

The construction is based on an agent-based model with heterogeneity both regarding production characteristics and the strategies agents use to predict future prices as a basis for choosing what to produce. The world is divided into a number of regional markets that collect the locally produced goods and via inter-market trade supply regional demands with goods. We discuss the model features that make it possible to project the agent-based micro-dynamics to a closed form dynamics on the level of regionally aggregate quantities. One advantage of such a projection from a high dimensional agent-based dynamics to a low dimensional dynamical system is that the stability characteristics can be analytically approached, and this is illustrated by a derived condition for when a mix of naive and rational agents can stabilize the system. Some illustrations of the general framework in a model of global agricultural land-use are also given.",

The hybrid method thus formed is compared to methods of the literature on a specific resource allocation problem by taking into account both the development and the transportation cost.

The seven equations model is derived for compressible two-phase flow that is in the nonconservation form. In the present work, two different six equations model are derived for two pressures, two velocities and single temperature with the derivation of the equation of state. The closing equation for one of the six equations model is energy conservation equation while another one is closed by entropy balance equation. The partial differential form of governing equations is hyperbolic and written in the conservative form. At this point, the set of governing equations are derived based on the principle of extended thermodynamics. The method of solving single temperature from both six equation models are simple and direct solution can be obtained. Numerical simulation has been tried using one of the six equation models for air–water shock tube problems. Explicit fourth order Runge–Kutta scheme is used with Finite Volume Shock Capturing method for solving the governing equations numerically. The pressure, velocity and volume fraction variations are captured along the shock tube length through flow solver. Experimental work is carried out to magnify the initial stage of liquid injection into a gas.

Diseases like influenza, despite intervention efforts through vaccination and targeted social distancing, continue to persist intermittently in the population. I have undertaken an analysis of a stochastic epidemic model with the hypothesis that intervention drives epidemic cycles. Intervention indeed is found to induce cycles of epidemic activity. Above a minimum intervention rate, however, activity dies out in finite time. The susceptibility structure of a community could be easily infused into the design of existing surveillance protocols. By tracking that structure, early detection of an impending outbreak is enhanced.",

Analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of possible SAM structures suggests that disordering of interfacial Au atoms is definitely driven by the gold–sulphur interactions. Our MD results reveal a novel structure where two methanethiol molecules are bound to a gold adatom that has been lifted from the surface at 300 K, and the same kind of RS– Au –SR motif was also observed for hexanethiol at 600 K but not at 300 K. What is more, the above motif is only observed for the reactive ReaxFF potential. Moreover, these results are in clear agreement with recent experiments and more costly first principles-based MD simulations. These findings strongly support the use of reactive potentials such as ReaxFF for gathering an accurate description of Au – S interactions in inexpensive classical MD simulations.",

Success achieved for those evolutionary optimization techniques are due to simplicity and flexibility of algorithm structures. In this paper, optimal set of filter coefficients are searched by the evolutionary optimization technique called Opposition-based Differential Evolution (ODE) for solving infinite impulse response (IIR) system identification problem. Opposition-based numbering concept is embedded into the primary foundation of Differential Evolution (DE) technique metaphorically to enhance the convergence speed and the performance for finding the optimal solution. The population is generated with the evaluation of a solution and its opposite solution by fitness function for choosing potent solutions for each iteration cycle. With this competent population, faster convergence speed and better solution quality are achieved. Detailed and balanced search in multidimensional problem space is accomplished with judiciously chosen control parameters for mutation, crossover and selection adopted in the basic DE technique. When tested against standard benchmark examples, for same order and reduced order models, the simulation results establish the ODE as a competent candidate to others in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.",

Whereas existing activity-based models of travel demand simulate a typical day, dynamic models simulate behavioral response to endogenous or exogenous change, along various time horizons. The current study aims at developing a model of endogenous dynamics of activity–travel behavior. Endogenous dynamics are induced by stress, which is regarded as dissatisfaction with current habits. It is assumed that people try to alleviate stress by trying short-term changes, within the options known to them or by exploring new options. If these explorations prove to be unsuccessful, they will consider long-term changes, such as moving to a new residential location, buying a car, etc. Therefore, this self-improvement process can result in both short and long-term adaptations. In the proposed framework, choice-set formation is modeled, the key concepts of aspiration, activation, awareness and expected utility are integrated, while both rational and emotional mechanisms are taken into account. Numerical simulations are conducted in order to check the face validity of the model, as well as the impact of stress tolerance parameters on system performance.",

This study addresses the load movement forecast modeling based on complex matrix interpolation of the S-transform (ST). In complex matrix of time-frequency representation of the ST, each row follows conjugate symmetric property and each column appears a certain degree of similarity. Based on these characteristics, a complex matrix interpolation method for the time-frequency representation of the ST is proposed to interpolate each row of the complex matrix based on the conjugate symmetric property, and then to perform nearest-neighbor interpolation on each column. Then with periodic extension for daily and yearly electric load movement, a forecast model employing the complex matrix interpolation of the ST is introduced. The forecast approach is applied to predict daily load movement of the European Network on Intelligent Technologies (EUNITE) load dataset and annual electric load movement of State Gird Corporation of China and its branches in 2005 and 2006. Result analysis indicates workability and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Despite leverage and accounting rules heterogeneity, the results are robust across countries. The leverage diversity produces financial networks with a modular structure characterized by one large bank community, some small ones, and isolated banks. However, these groups of banks merge together creating a financial network topology that converges to a unique large cluster at a relatively low leverage dependence level. Finally, we simulate the banking system through a model of corporate and interbank loans with credit shocks, where links between banks arise due to insufficient liquidity. The model yields leverage-based networks that are similar to the empirical ones. A model prediction for banks’ growth is presented and tested in the data.",

However, because of the low sampling efficiency of Monte Carlo Simulation in DSMC, this part usually occupies large portion of computational costs to solve the Boltzmann equation. In this paper, by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and multicore programming, we develop Direct Simulation Multi-Chain Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DSMC3): a fast solver to calculate the numerical solution for the Boltzmann equation.

However, there is still no clear, generally accepted understanding of why it exists and under what circumstances it is useful.

We define utility in terms of two metrics — the increase in frequency of fit genotypes, and the increase in average population fitness, relative to those associated with selection only. Explicitly, we explore the full parameter space of a two-locus two-allele system, showing, as a function of the landscape and the initial population, that recombination is beneficial in terms of these metrics in two distinct regimes: a relatively landscape independent regime — the search regime — where recombination aids in the search for a fit genotype that is absent or at low frequency in the population; and the modular regime, where recombination allows for the juxtaposition of fit “modules” or Building Blocks (BBs). Thus, we conclude that the ubiquity and utility of recombination is intimately associated with the existence of modularity and redundancy in biological fitness landscapes.",

We proposed a novel technique in which the inlet grid is intensified to overcome the limitations mentioned above. Inviscid numerical simulations by CFD revealed that the proposed nozzle could meet the requirements for exit Mach number and flow field uniformity.

In this work, a new trigger method for the stimulation is proposed. Blood flow is determined by measuring the pulsatile change of conductivity in the observed segment by impedance plethysmography. The proposed “adaptive stimulation” allows the automatic adjustment of the start and duration of the stimulation to improve transport of venous blood. For this purpose, a mathematical circulation model was developed for optimization of the adaptive functional electrical stimulation. The model takes into account the effects of gravity, muscle pump with or without FES, and venous regurgitation. The model was shown to have a behavior similar to that of clinical measurements. The simulation showed a flow enhancement of up to 14% and, furthermore, that the start of the stimulation is less important than the duration of each stimulation phase. Therefore, an adaptation of the heart rate seems necessary, as the expulsion and refill times must remain relatively constant for an optimal pumping result. For a practical approach, it is reasonable to adapt the duration of stimulation to 56% of the cardiac cycle in order to reach a maximum flow.",

This model is capable of predicting the erosion rates for a material under solid-particle impact over a specific range of particle velocity at the impingement angle between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], provided that the experimental data of erosion rate for the material at a particle velocity within this range and at impingement angles between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are available.

Multi users, multi subjects, multi granularities and multi models in complex system modeling are unified to multi views. The principles and schemes for the decomposition of complex systems are introduced. According to the principle of separation of concerns, a complex system can be decomposed to a variety of model views. Collaborative modeling means that the views can be associated and integrated to form complete system model through their semantic. According to the form of representation, the models are generalizes to three kinds, i.e., view models, semantic models and storage models, which provides a unified framework for conversion and mapping between the models. Under the guidance of the method, a tool for the modeling of warship C2 system is developed. Applications show that the tool can support collaborative modeling and design for C2 system outstandingly.",

This paper proposes a new nonlinear model vehicle model which considers both unsprung mass and sprung mass CG. The CG positions and inertial parameters effects are analyzed in terms of the published vehicle dynamics models. To this end, two 14 degree-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle models are developed and compared to investigate the vehicle dynamics responses due to the different CG height and inertial parameters concepts. The proposed models describe simultaneously the vehicle motion in longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions as well as roll, pitch and yaw of the vehicle about corresponding axis. The passive and active moments and the forces acting on the vehicle are also described and they are considered as a direct consequence of acceleration, braking and steering maneuvers. The proposed model [Formula: see text] takes both the CG of sprung mass, unsprung mass and total vehicle mass into account. The second model [Formula: see text] assumes that the vehicle is one solid body which has a single CG as reported in majority of literature. The two vehicle models are compared and analyzed to evaluate vehicle ride and handling dynamic responses under braking/acceleration and cornering maneuvers. Simulation results show that the proposed model [Formula: see text] could offer analytically some abilities and driving performances, as well as improved roll and pitch in a very flexible manner compared to the second model [Formula: see text].",

Recently, North Korea has completed the test flight of SLBM and it has become a significant threat to international security. North Korea obtained SLBM technologies from Russia while disbanding decommissioned Russian submarines, and it is suspected that North Korea will continue to experiment in related fields along with its continued attempts to miniaturize nuclear weapons. If North Korea completes the development of SLBM and deploys the missiles, it means the completion of the three asymmetric warfare elements (nuclear weapon, ballistic missile, and submarine) and they will be the most significant threats to northeast Asia. Therefore, it is imperative to scientifically analyze SLBM to adeptly respond to such threat. One characteristic of SLBM is capability of attacking its target in a variety of ways based on its range control method. Based on this fact, the current research derives the flight equation of North Korean SLBM and simulates its flight trajectory based on various range control methods. The flight trajectories that we derive can be used to establish an effective anti-ballistic missile defense system in northeast Asia.",

    "abstract": "As opposed to using many unrelated photographs to depict the same scene, image fusions combine multiple, similar images to generate a single, unified image with greater detail. Imaging sensors and the need for a wideband signal to transmit most source images limit their resolution. This study suggests new methods of fusing medical pictures from different modalities in order to increase image quality and, by extension, the accuracy with which brain tumors can be detected and identified. Improved convolutional neural network (ICNN) and region growth-based [Formula: see text]-means clustering (RKMC) are used in the suggested strategy to boost the quality of brain image fusions obtained from Computed tomography scanned image (CTSI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this study. The first stages of this task consist of eliminating noise, segmenting images, extracting and selecting features, and fusing images. AMF (Adaptive Median Filtering) are first used to eliminate noise from MRI images and CTSI of the brain, improving the image quality. With the help of the RKMC algorithm, MRI image and CTSI scans can be segmented into their constituent pieces, which can then be seen either as grayscale images or as pictures of objects. The RKMC algorithm is able to adequately account for the possibility of tumors in white images. More useful image features can be extracted with the use of MPCA (Modified Principal Component Analysis). Afterward, features with the highest fitness values are chosen by using AFO (Adaptive Firefly Optimization). Image fusions of multimodal images are carried out using ICNN, which generates the image’s lower-, middle-, and higher-level contents. Incorporating important and relevant image characteristics from all viewpoints and perspectives improves feature training and testing. The results show that the proposed RKMC+ICNNs outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, PSNR, RMSE, and runtime.",

Uncertainties arise during the operation of the DG, represented by generator power, load requirements and fluctuations in electricity prices. The reactive power problem is the major concern associated with the DG system. This paper analyzes both DG and an energy storage system along with their optimal performance using a specific algorithm. For optimal analysis of DG and ESS, an Improved Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (IABC) is proposed. The IABC evaluates the performance of distribution network. It takes DG and ESS into account for analyzing optimal design problems, the main goal of which is to minimize their reactive power dispersion functions. In addition, there are barriers to reducing the DG’s operating costs. The proposed method is implemented on the MATLAB platform and tested using the IEEE 33-bus system.

    "abstract": "The traditional generation of combat simulation scenarios often requires a manual understanding of conceptual scenarios and transformation into simulation scenarios. This method has the problems of long development time and high development threshold. Conceptual scenarios are usually visual Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, so we can use artificial intelligence technology to extract key semantics from them, and automatically map the extracted semantics to simulation scenarios. This method is called the intelligent generation of combat simulation scenarios. To extract the key semantics from conceptual scenarios in UML form, we propose the UML diagram recognition method based on Keypoint Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN). This method includes three parts: image character recognizer, primitive object detector, and image semantic extractor. First, we use optical character recognition (OCR) technology to achieve image character recognition. Second, we manually annotate the primitive target-detection dataset and propose a new primitive target-detection model—Keypoint R-CNN. This model considers the direction of connecting lines and realizes the detection of symbols and connecting lines. Third, we propose a targeted combined primitive detection and primitive relationship extraction method to extract the high-level semantics of UML diagrams. Then, we carried out experiments and evaluations on the self-made dataset. Compared with other methods, the F1 score of our method is improved by about 7%, and the Jaccard coefficient is improved by about 10%. Finally, we use a case study to implement the intelligent generation process of combat simulation scenarios using the UML recognition method we proposed. This case shows the operability and efficiency of our method. Our method greatly reduces the labor cost and development threshold of combat simulation scenario generation and improves the development efficiency of the combat simulation system.",

The model is defined on a multiplex network that represents a city spatial tiling with its corresponding urban transport infrastructure, allowing to explore the relation between crime hotspot locations and the network topological features. It also allows to explore the effects that cities time evolution and police checkpoints might have on the emergence of crime hotspots. For Mexico City, the model shows that heterogeneous distributions of criminal activity arise from a diffusion-driven instability, as a self-organizing process. The results obtained for this city are in line with several insights from environmental criminology, such as the relationship between urban layout and crime hotspots locations, or the conceptual label assigned to specific locations as crime generators. They also uncover new relationships between cities design and crime hotspot locations, and suggest that routine activity theory alone cannot explain the emergence of heterogeneous crime distributions.",

By leveraging experimental data and agent-based simulations, various data-driven modeling methods can be applied. This provides a great opportunity to quantify and visualize the uncertainty associated with these methods, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the individual and collective behaviors among players. For networked anagram games, player behaviors can be heterogeneous in terms of the number of words formed and the amount of cooperation among networked neighbors. Based on game data, these games can be modeled as discrete dynamical systems characterized by probabilistic state transitions. In this work, we present both Frequentist and Bayesian approaches for visualizing uncertainty in networked anagram games. These approaches help to elaborate how players individually and collectively form words by sharing letters with their neighbors in a network. Both approaches provide valuable insights into inferring the worst, average, and best player performance within and between behavioral clusters. Moreover, interesting contrasts between the Frequentist and Bayesian approaches can be observed. The knowledge and inferences gained from these approaches are incorporated into an agent-based simulation framework to further demonstrate model uncertainty and players’ heterogeneous behaviors.",

Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation technology, our study simulated the building models both before and after the community renovation. Furthermore, our study simulated nine architectural complex models proposed by our study, considering the architectural layout and facade height within the community. By verifying and comparing the simulation results, our study observed that the fishbone bionic architectural form significantly improved the wind environment within the community’s pedestrian areas. Regarding the facade height, our study discovered that taller architectural units should be positioned away from the prevailing wind direction to enhance the airflow within the architectural complex. This research carries substantial implications for the renovation and planning of residential communities, particularly in large urban settings with a substantial population.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion of information through complex networks is of interest in studies such as propagation prediction and influence maximization, both of which have applications in viral marketing and rumor controlling. There are a variety of information diffusion models, all of which simulate the adoption and spread of information over time. However, there is a lack of understanding of whether, despite their conceptual differences, these models represent the same underlying generative structures. For instance, if two different models utilize different conceptual mechanisms, but generate the same results, does the choice of model matter? A classification of diffusion of information models is developed based on the neighbor knowledge of the model infection requirement and the stochasticity of the model. This classification allows for the identification of models that fall into each respective category. The study involves the analysis of the following agent-based models on directed scale-free networks: (1) a linear absolute threshold model (LATM), (2) a linear fractional threshold model (LTFM), (3) the independent cascade model (ICM), (4) Bass-Rand-Rust model (BRRM) (5) a stochastic linear absolute threshold model (SLATM) (6) a stochastic fractional threshold model (SLFTM), and (7) Dodds–Watts model (DWM). Through the execution of simulations and analysis of the experimental results, the distinctive properties of each model are identified. Our analysis reveals that similarity in conceptual design does not imply similarity in behavior concerning speed, final state of nodes and edges, and sensitivity to parameters. Therefore, we highlight the importance of considering the unique behavioral characteristics of each model when selecting a suitable information diffusion model for a particular application.",

    "abstract": "The determination of standard values of vibration transmissibility at the wrist of the human body is very important to understanding vibration exposure and developing a valid model. In this work, the effects of human weight, gender, and other factors on the transmissibility of hand–arm vibration and vibration transmissibility in the [Formula: see text]-axis direction at the wrist site were randomly collected from 200 subjects (154 males and 46 females) as per the requirement of the standard ISO 10819. Moreover, the envelopes of the maximum and minimum values, as well as the mean and standard deviation of the vibration transmissibility at the wrist site, were obtained for both genders. Second, the effect of gender differences on the mean value of vibration transmissibility was analyzed. Finally, two three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) models of the hand–arm system were developed based on the average values of vibration transmissibility at the wrists of male and female subjects, respectively. The study revealed that the mean value of vibration transmissibility was greater in males than in females in the frequency range of 14–39 Hz. For the rest of the frequency ranges of females, their mean vibration transmissibility is greater than that of males, especially in the range 17–30 Hz. It was also observed that the vibration transmissibility of females is 10–18.5% smaller than that of males. The vibration transmissibility of females is greater than that of males by 40–83% when the frequencies are between 150 Hz and 250 Hz. The novelty of this proposed model is the prediction of model differences between males and females compared to other models that do so without considering gender differences. It is validated that the proposed modified model can be used to predict the vibration transmissibility of the wrist.",

    "abstract": "Identifying vital nodes is a fundamental topic in network science. Some methods are proposed to identify vital nodes in a complex network. These measures take into account different aspects of a node’s importance, such as its number of connections, the centrality of its connected nodes, and the distribution of its connections. Applying these measures makes it is possible to identify the nodes that play a vital role in the network and that have the greatest impact on its structure and function. However, there is still an inherent problem with identifying vital nodes accurately and discriminatively. To address the problem, for undirected unweighted networks, we propose an algorithm based on the nodes’ multiplex influences via the network structure to identify vital nodes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by Kendall’s Tau ([Formula: see text]) and monotonicity and compared with well-known existing metrics such as degree centrality, K-shell decomposition, H-index, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, collective influence, and gravity model in 10 real networks. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm in identifying vital nodes.",

    "abstract": "Traditional requirement verification methods often fail to fully consider the modeling of time-dependent behaviors during system execution, which may lead to inconsistent system requirements, thereby compromise software reliability and correctness. To address this limitation, this paper proposes the Scenario-Specific Verification Method for System Requirements Consistency via Time Modeling. The Scenario-Specific Verification Method converts use case descriptions and problem graphs into Clock Constraint Specification Language (CCSL) constraints, transformed into clock graphs for verifying requirement consistency. The resulting constraints are solved with the Z3 solver to validate correctness, thereby enhancing system reliability. The novel time modeling approach provides techniques for verifying temporal dependencies in requirements. A case study demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of the Scenario-Specific Verification Method in detecting inconsistencies. The main contributions include that a technique is demonstrated to formalize use case descriptions as CCSL constraints, improving on natural language and a method is presented utilizing CCSL time modeling and clock graphs to analyze requirements for consistency. Overall, an innovative solution for requirement verification using time modeling is offered by this paper, contributing to the enhancement of system development process reliability and correctness.",

The artificial consumers have to choose each period between different products. Products remain on the market for as long as their market share exceeds a minimum level. If not, it will be replaced by a new product. Simulation experiments are being performed with a population of consumats having different preferences. Results show that the dominating type of cognitive (choice) process has large consequences for the resulting market dynamics.

Although a great number of models have been proposed for studying a variety of social phenomena, no general agent design methodology is available. Moreover, it is difficult to validate the accuracy of these models. For this reason, we believe that some guidelines for ABMs design must be devised; therefore, this paper is a first attempt to analyze the levels of ABMs, identify and classify several aspects that should be considered when designing ABMs. Through our analysis, the following implications have been found: (1) there are two levels in designing ABMs: the individual level, related to the design of the agents' internal structure, and the collective level, which concerns the design of the agent society or macro-dynamics of the model; and (2) the mechanisms of these levels strongly affect the outcomes of the models.",

The importance of individual variation to the stability of the population dynamics predicted by the model and the advantages of the individual-based approach to modelling ecological systems is discussed. The individual-based model is compared with the traditional approach of population ecology — the modelling of populations with state variable equations. The individual-based model built here produces similar patterns of mutual dependence of the populations to those produced by the state variable model but has additional utility. It greatly simplifies the adjustment of individual environmental parameters which may be built into the model and it makes it possible to follow individuals or individual parameter values through the simulation. The cost of the utility of the individual-based approach is in the complexity of the model itself, which is more difficult to build than many state variable models. A common finding in the literature of individual-based modelling in ecology is the importance of individual variation. The individual-based model described here is built with a minimum of biological complexity, but still we find that individual variation in the model has profound effects on the stability of the population levels over long time periods.",

By constructing the F statistics with different inspection levels, evaluation method for influence of the experimental factors on stability indexes were defined. Thus, influence degrees of specified parameters on the stability of roadway were divided into five classes as follows: highly significant influence, significant influence, relatively significant influence, little significant influence, and no influence respectively which realize the quantitative analysis of the influence degrees of experimental factors. The finite element calculation results showed that main failure mode of coal roadway that usually showed as tension failure of coal seam in roof and deformation factors of coal seam had the most remarkable effect on roadway displacements.

Given the circular geometry it is possible to resolve all integrals involved analytically. A Galerkin approach is adopted, giving the solution in the spatial frequency domain. That allows a controlled truncation of the system matrix by choice of which frequency components to keep. It transpires that the low frequency components are the most important ones. Two test cases are used to quantify the accuracy of the solution with respect to truncation and distance from the surface.

Nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions are considered within an anisotropic dielectric medium. As a consequence of the helical topology, certain spin orientations render the lattice frustrated with NN ferroelectric and NNN antiferroelectric bonds. Mapping the problem to a 2D Ising model and employing Monte Carlo methods we find that frozen clusters of spins exist at human physiological temperatures. This suggests a novel biological mechanism for storing information in living organisms, whereby the classical tubulin spin states become information bits and information gets stored in MTs in a way that is robust to thermal fluctuations.",

We therefore develop models to estimate the back/cross edge probabilities and the network coverage of the peers in the presence of these back and cross edges. Extensive simulation is done on random, power-law and Gnutella networks to verify the correctness of the model. The results highlight the fact that for real p2p networks, which are large but finite, the percentage of back/cross edges can increase enormously with increasing distance from a source node, thus leading to huge traffic redundancy.",

    "abstract": "Coordinating multiagent systems to maximize global information collection is a key challenge in many real world applications such as planetary exploration, and search and rescue. In particular, in many domains where communication is expensive (e.g., in terms of energy), the coordination must be achieved in a passive manner, without agents explicitly informing other agents of their states and/or intended actions. In this work, we extend results on such multiagent coordination algorithms to domains where the agents cannot achieve the required tasks without forming teams. We investigate team formation in three types of domains, one where n agents need to perform a task for the team to receive credit, one where there is an optimal number of agents (n) required for the task, but where the agents receive a decaying reward if they form a team with membership other than n, and finally we investigate heterogeneous teams where individuals vary in construction. Our results show that encouraging agents to coordinate is more successful than strictly requiring coordination. We also show that devising agent objective functions that are aligned with the global objective and locally computable significantly outperform systems where agents directly use the global objective, and that the improvement increases with the complexity of the task.",

    "abstract": "Embedded multimedia systems often run multiple time-constrained applications simultaneously. To meet the throughput constraints given in the specification, each application must be provided with enough resources by the underlying architecture, which is generally a multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC). For this purpose, a mechanism for task binding and scheduling is required to provide each application with a timing guarantee, keeping in mind the available resources like processor(s) and memory bandwidth. Commonly, synchronous dataflow graphs (SDFGs) are used to model time-constrained multimedia applications. There are resource allocation strategies for SDFGs that help in formulating efficient techniques for calculating the throughput of a bounded and scheduled SDFG. The strategies are effective in terms of run-time and allocated resources. However, there is no unified modeling technique to simultaneously represent the application and the underlying architecture with resource allocation. This paper discusses a novel modeling technique using Colored Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs), which can be used to model the application as well as the architecture and the resource allocation. Such a representation helps in checking properties like liveness and boundedness for the application, taking into account the resource allocation and thus helping in defining satisfactory schedules for the executable tasks.",

These equations are numerically solved using Keller–Box method. The effect of the governing parameters such as radiation, Prandtl number, Hartman number, heat source/sink parameter on velocity and temperature profile is discussed and shown by plotting graphs. It is found that the temperature is an increasing function of convective parameter A, radiation and heat source parameters.

This work presents a post-processing method that analyzes the solidification pattern formed by simulation of the solidification process of molten metal in a mold to produce shaped castings. Simulations generally involve numerical solutions of differential equations which are discretized by dividing the three-dimensional computational domain into small finite volume elements using a 3D grid. The locations of the grid points and values of the solidification time at these locations are used to divide the spatial data into 3D sections such that starting from a hotspot location within the section that has high solidification time, there is a gradient outwards with lower values of solidification time. Each section is assumed to be fed by one or more feeders that must freeze only after the section has solidified completely. The volume of a feeder can be determined from the volume of the section it is supposed to feed. The volume and surface area of sections are determined approximately to calculate feeder size and dimensions. The post-processing algorithm is a simulation-based quantitative approach to feeder design which in conventional foundry practice has been more of an art than science. It is also general enough for use in other 3D segmentation applications.",

The radial point interpolation method, a partial differential equation solver based on a meshfree approach, enables accurate imposition of displacement boundary conditions and has been successfully applied to elastostatic analysis of various kinds of three-dimensional solids. In this method, stiffness matrix construction accounts for the majority of CPU time required for the entire process, resulting in high computational costs, especially when higher-order numerical integration is applied for accurate matrix construction. An alternative method, modified radial point interpolation, was proposed to overcome this shortcoming and has accomplished fast computation of elastostatic solid analysis. The purpose of this study is to develop an algorithm for time-dependent simulation of three-dimensional elastic solids. We show that the modified radial point interpolation method also accelerates the construction of the mass matrix required for time-dependent analysis in addition to that of the stiffness matrix. In our approach, the problem domain is assumed to have an implicit function representation that can be constructed from a set of surface points measured using a three-dimensional scanning system. Several numerical tests for elastodynamic analysis of complex shape models are presented.",

Established on the frontline of computational organization theory, this paper provides an overall discussion on the difficulties in validation and validation methodology of the computational organization model. First, different from natural engineering system model, and also exceeding the traditional empirical method, the computational organization model is faced with various subjective and objective difficulties during the validation progress; second, in developing the situational validation methodology based on relationships among problem field, modeling purpose and referents, it is important for the computational organization model that the validation is conducted according to certain degree; third, the establishment of verification, validation and accreditation approach (VV&amp;A), which is different from the natural engineering system, is an irresistible trend for future development of the computational organization model. Model validation should be focused on concept validation, operation validation, and data validation, as well as the principle of iterative validation approach and such validation should be conducted throughout the modeling process; finally, the validation of computational organization model should be the process to enhance people's confidence in the model. From the perspective of review, if the model is able to pass through all the validation tests, it is helpful for a better understanding of the model's ability, limitation and applicability. In this case, research from interdisciplinary experts is required urgently.",

We approach this problem by searching for dimer automaton rules exhibiting a broadly defined behavior, self-organization. We expected the simple and asynchronous nature of dimer automata to hinder self-organization, but an exhaustive search quickly yielded three rules that do, in fact, exhibit properties of self-organization. Two of these rules are applicable to actual physical phenomena, motivating searching for additional, more complex rules. However, exhaustive searches scale poorly here because of the rarity of interesting rules combined with the fast growth rate of the search space. To address these challenges we developed the evolutionary motifs algorithm. This algorithm finds the building blocks of the previously found dimer automaton rules, and combines them to form new rules in an evolutionary manner. Our evolutionary algorithm was more effective than an exhaustive search, producing a diverse population of rules exhibiting self-organization.",

We hereby analyze the statistical properties of the cross-correlation coefficients in different time periods, such as the distribution, the mean value, the standard deviation, the skewness and the kurtosis. By using the method of the scaled factorial moment, we observe the intermittence phenomenon in the distribution of the cross-correlation coefficients. Also by employing the random matrix theory (RMT), we find a few isolated large eigenvalues of the cross-correlation matrix, and the distribution of eigenvalues exhibits the power-law tails.

From a thermodynamic point of view the elastic energy contributes to the free energy of the phases and modifies their mutual stability. Therefore, the elastic stresses will have an effect on stability of lamellae, lamellae spacing and growth modes. In this paper, a phase-field model is employed to investigate the influence of elastic misfits in eutectic growth. The model reduces to the traditional sharp-interface model in a thin-interface limit, where the microscopic interface width is small but finite. An elastic model is designed, based on linear microelasticity theory, to incorporate the elastic energy in the phase-field model. Theoretical and numerical approaches, required to model elastic effects, are formulated and the stress distributions in eutectic solidification structures are evaluated. The two-dimensional simulations are performed for directed eutectic growth and the simulation results for different values of the misfit stresses are illustrated.",

Despite the tremendous increase in the computing power of central processing units (CPUs), direct numerical simulation of highly turbulent flows is still not feasible due to the need for resolving the smallest length scale, and today's CPUs cannot keep pace with demand. The recent development of graphics processing units (GPU) has led to the general improvement in the performance of various algorithms. This study investigates the applicability of GPU technology in the context of fast-Fourier transform (FFT)-based pseudo-spectral methods for DNS of turbulent flows for the Taylor–Green vortex problem. They are implemented on a single GPU and a speedup of unto 31x is obtained in comparison to a single CPU.",

    "abstract": "Despite spectacular progress in biophysics, molecular biology and biochemistry our ability to predict the dynamic behavior of multicellular systems under different conditions is very limited. An important reason for this is that still not enough is known about how cells change their physical and biological properties by genetic or metabolic regulation, and which of these changes affect the cell behavior. For this reason, it is difficult to predict the system behavior of multicellular systems in case the cell behavior changes, for example, as a consequence of regulation or differentiation. The rules that underlie the regulation processes have been determined on the time scale of evolution, by selection on the phenotypic level of cells or cell populations. We illustrate by detailed computer simulations in a multi-scale approach how cell behavior controlled by regulatory networks may emerge as a consequence of an evolutionary process, if either the cells, or populations of cells are subject to selection on particular features. We consider two examples, migration strategies of single cells searching a signal source, or aggregation of two or more cells within minimal multiscale models of biological evolution. Both can be found for example in the life cycle of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. However, phenotypic changes that can lead to completely different modes of migration have also been observed in cells of multi-cellular organisms, for example, as a consequence of a specialization in stem cells or the de-differentiation in tumor cells. The regulatory networks are represented by Boolean networks and encoded by binary strings. The latter may be considered as encoding the genetic information (the genotype) and are subject to mutations and crossovers. The cell behavior reflects the phenotype. We find that cells adopt naturally observed migration strategies, controlled by networks that show robustness and redundancy. The model simplicity allow us to unambiguously analyze the regulatory networks and the resulting phenotypes by different measures and by knockouts of regulatory elements. We illustrate that in order to maintain a cells' phenotype in case of a knockout, the cell may have to be able to deal with contradictory information. In summary, both the cell phenotype as well as the emerged regulatory network behave as their biological counterparts observed in nature.",

We follow an artificial life approach to investigate these phenomena, using a system inspired by Anabaena cyanobacteria (which exhibit rudimentary multicellular differentiation and cooperation) in order to look for evidence of emerging differentiation and multicellular cooperation in colonies of individual cells. We first evolve single free-living cells with the help of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). These cells are controlled with genetic regulatory networks. The single cells are evolved to each perform both of two tasks: an abstraction of house-keeping metabolism and a reproductive cycle. Once such a cell was evolved with the GA, the cell is used to seed the growth of a multicellular filamentous colony, whose constituent cells continue to reproduce and evolve. Two types of colonies generated from the seed cell are studied: one with intercellular communication ability and one without. We introduce and apply new measures for assessing the impact of multicellular interaction on individual reproduction and on life span. The conclusion of these studies shows that the colony with the ability to communicate shows, with the help of our new measures, behaviors that hint at the emergence of early cooperation.",

The first parameter, d MAX , is the fractional number of tests, representing the equivalent numbers of independent tests in MAX. If the d tests are dependent, d MAX &lt; d. The second parameter is the fractional degrees of freedom k of the chi-square distribution [Formula: see text] that fits the MAX null distribution. These two parameters, d MAX and k, can be independently defined, and k can be noninteger even if d MAX is an integer. We illustrate these two parameters using the examples of MAX2 and MAX3 statistics in genetic case-control studies. We speculate that k is related to the amount of ambiguity of the model inferred by the test. In the case-control genetic association, tests with low k (e.g. k = 1) are able to provide definitive information about the disease model, as versus tests with high k (e.g. k = 2) that are completely uncertain about the disease model. Similar to Heisenberg's uncertain principle, the ability to infer disease model and the ability to detect significant association may not be simultaneously optimized, and k seems to measure the level of their balance.",

The feasible domain of CO problem is first examined and it is proven that feasible domain remains the same during the CO formulation. So is the same with extreme points. Then based on contemporary research conclusion that the system-level optimization problem suffers from inherent computational difficulties, it is further pointed out that the employment of meta-heuristic optimization methods in CO could eliminate these difficulties. To make CO more computational feasible, a new method collaborative optimization with dimension reduction (CODR) is proposed. It focused on optimization dimension reduction and lets local copy of common shared design variables equal system shared design variables directly. Thus, the number of dimensions that CODR could reduce equal the number of common shared design variables. Numerical experiment suggests that CODR reduces computations greatly without losing of optimization accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In many distributed modeling, control or information processing applications, clustering patterns that share certain similarities is the critical first step. However, many traditional clustering algorithms require centralized processing, reliable data collection and the availability of all the raw data in one place at one time. None of these requirement can be met in many complex real world problems. In this paper, we present an agent-based method for combining multiple base clusterings into a single unified \"consensus\" clustering that is robust against many types of failures and does not require spatial/temporal synchronization. In this approach, agents process clusterings coming from separate sources and pool them to produce a unified consensus. The first contribution of this work is to provide an adaptive method by which the agents update their selections to maximize an objective function based on the quality of the consensus clustering. The second contribution of this work is in providing intermediate agent-specific objective functions that significantly improve the quality of the consensus clustering process. Our results show that this agent-based method achieves comparable or better performance than traditional non-agent consensus clustering methods in fault-free conditions, and remains effective under a wide range of failure scenarios that paralyze the traditional methods.",

It is well known that neural networks can approximate a large set of continuous functions defined on a compact set. If the continuous mathematical model is incomplete or partially known, the methodology based on Differential Neural Network (DNN) provides an effective tool to solve problems on control theory such as identification, state estimation, trajectories tracking, etc. In this paper, a strategy based on DNN for the no parametric identification of a mathematical model described by parabolic partial differential equations is proposed. The identification solution allows finding an exact expression for the weights' dynamics. The weights adaptive laws ensure the \"practical stability\" of DNN trajectories. To verify the qualitative behavior of the suggested methodology, a no parametric modeling problem for a couple of distributed parameter plants is analyzed: the plug-flow reactor model and the anaerobic digestion system.

On the basis of the structure and characteristics of the seat-cabin system for a high-grade fork lift truck, a seat-cabin system vertical dynamic model was created. The vertical dynamic responses of the model under the random irregularities excitation were calculated. The calculated responses including the seat dynamic response and the cabin dynamic responses at the four corners are very close to the field measurement data and the relative deviations of the (root mean square) RMS acceleration responses are all less than 6.0%. The results show that the vertical dynamic model is acceptable and can truly describe the basic mechanical behavior of the seat-cabin system. The model provides a good basis for investigating the relations between the dynamic parameters and the vibration attenuation characteristics of the seat-cabin system to further improve ride comfort.",

In this study, we use a model of asynchrony in a continuous double auction market in the form of noise and order restrictions to link inside- and outside- uncertainties in the economic system. Our model shows intermittent behavior with a small parameter value, which leads to the misapplication of the price-update rule, and consequently drives burst behavior. The statistical property of time development shows a similar tendency to that in previous empirical studies. Thus, it demonstrates the relationship between the asynchronous property and the complexity of economic systems.",

In view of the dynamics of Ebola virus disease, here, the infected class is supposed to be divided into subclasses, viz. primary and secondary infected. The proposed model is analyzed qualitatively using the stability theory of differential equations and quantitatively using numerical simulation. The obtained results, qualitatively and quantitatively, suggest that migration and contact rates play an important role in controlling the spreading of disease. Critical values for migration and contact rates are evaluated and it is revealed that if these rates go beyond their critical values, it leads to delay in the stabilization of the system. It is also found that primary reproductive number increases with increase in migration rate. Besides this, the approximate time required to attain stability of the disease model system is also determined. The model analysis recommends quarantining the noninfected from the secondary infected in order to control the spreading out of disease.",

    "abstract": "Crowd modeling and simulation have drawn much attention in recent decades due to the functionality of recurrence of the crowd movement pattern in an efficient way. Much effort has been paid aiming at generating an accurate simulation result with respect to different aspects of crowd movement pattern. A fact has been observed that footprint left in mud or turf significantly affects pedestrian’s decision making and moving trajectory since those footprints help other pedestrians walk comfortably. Inspired by this, we in this paper propose a crowd simulation model aiming to model how the movement of previous pedestrians affects decision making process of the pedestrians coming later. Unlike pedestrians leaving footprint in mud or turf, pedestrians leave no marks on hard surface. We consider each step of pedestrian moving on hard surface as a mutable invisible footprint which further forms a virtual trail. We first build a model to simulate how the invisible footprint forms and evolves on hard surface, upon which an agent-based crowd simulation model is then built to simulate how pedestrian makes trade-off between the invisible trajectory and the shortest path. The proposed model is validated by case studies with two scenarios. The simulation results indicate that we are able to simulate the impact on pedestrian’s decision making by the invisible footprint.",

To address these wide areas of applications and to improve upon their drawbacks, many variations and modifications of GAs have been proposed. The GA variation proposed in this paper has four basic operators: reproduction, recombination and two mutation operators, particularly applied to the famous and extensively studied Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in large-scale combinatorial optimization. Three of the operators use diversity information (standard deviation of costs) from the current population to adjust the diversity of the next population. The fourth one is an introduced new mutation operator called p-displacement that simulates the Lamarckian evolutionary learning and training concepts of gene improvement to bring chromosomes to their local optimum. We call the proposed GA: Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm-Traveling Salesman Problem (LGA-TSP). Emprical results show performance improvements compared to the classic and other modified GAs, as well as simulated annealing.",

This empirical fact has led some to claim that self-organizing criticality explains power law distributions that occur in human systems. However, unlike grains of sand, people possess both preferences and the ability to act purposefully given those preferences. We find that by including purposive agents and allowing heterogeneity of purposes, the sand pile need not become critical.

To our knowledge, there exist no theoretical frameworks or models of an aggregate loss distribution for smart contracts in this setting. To achieve our goal, we contextualize the problem in the probabilistic graph-theoretical framework using bond percolation models. We assume that the smart contract network topology is represented by a random tree graph of finite size, and that each smart contract is the center of a random star graph whose leaves represent the users of the smart contract. We allow for heterogeneous loss topology superimposed on this smart contract and user topology and provide analytical results and instructive numerical examples.",

Using optimization technique, the magnitude of the stepped reference signal is determined so that the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output voltage waveform is minimum and the fundamental component, RMS value of the voltage is improved for a given modulation index Ma as compared to the sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM). By the implementation of the new scheme, the seven-level of the inverter output voltage level (+Vdc, +2Vdc/3, +Vdc/3, 0, −Vdc, −2Vdc/3, −Vdc) is obtained for any given modulation index. Similarly, if only two stepped reference signals are used then the inverter will act as a five-level inverter for any modulating index Ma.

However, interaction with people having excessive negative emotions may make other people depressed. Taking this aspect into consideration, a SIR nonlinear model is formulated to investigate the transmission dynamics of depression in social connections. Through qualitative analysis of the model, critical value of depression is determined. Two equilibria, viz. depression free and depression state, are obtained and their stability behaviors are analyzed. The stability analysis reveals the fact that both the equilibria are locally and globally stable, depending on critical value of depression. The sensitivity analysis of crucial parameters of critical value of depression is performed to point out the key parameters that can drastically influence the propagation of depression. The results demonstrate the importance of counselling for depressed persons in order to suppress the growth of depression in social connections. The model calibration has been done for the annual depression cases of Zimbabwe. The results of our study show that individuals will catch major depression disorders more quickly once they get initially (primary) depressed. For this, counselling rate for primary depressed population should be increased.",

We modify the incidence rate to incorporate the isolation of infected individuals after detection, and separation of some susceptible individuals from the rest to avoid the infection, without an increase in the number of classes. We find that the system has a unique disease-free equilibrium (DFE) which is locally asymptotically stable when the reproduction number is less than unity. The multiple endemic equilibria may exist irrespective of the basic reproduction number. The existence of bistability is encountered. Supercritical transcritical (forward), as well as subcritical transcritical (backward) bifurcation, may occur at [Formula: see text] where contact rate, [Formula: see text] acts as the bifurcation parameter. Therefore, DFE need not be globally stable. The conditions for the existence of Andronov–Hopf bifurcation are deduced with maximum treatment capacity, [Formula: see text] as the bifurcation parameter. The impacts of isolation of confirmed infected cases and separation of some susceptible from rest are studied numerically as well as the effect of saturation in treatment. The existence of chaotic behavior is deduced by showing the maximum Lyapunov exponent to be positive as well as the sensitivity to initial conditions. The computation of the Kalpan–Yorke dimension to be fractional confirms the existence of fractal-type strange attractor. The positive Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy further strengthens the claim of the existence of chaos.",

In practice, the general heat value of mixed gas can be set in the range of 3500–4400[Formula: see text]kJ/Nm 3 . This paper presents a methodology to simulate operating parameters of CCPP with BFG. A generic model of gas turbine with open loop stage cooling employing air is used to simulate the performance of gas turbines cycle under different compressor pressure ratios and turbine inlet temperatures (TIT). The isentropic efficiencies for gas compressor and gas turbine are supposed to be constants and set corresponding to published industrial experience. The steam cycle is composed of classical double-pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and steam turbines according to gas turbine outlet temperature. Specific work, gas turbine cycle efficiency, cogeneration thermal efficiency and coolant air flow requirements are evaluated to find the optimal compressor pressure ratio and TIT. The research results are useful to select the optimum operating parameters of CCPP with BFG. Performance features were estimated with the help of compression ratios 12.5–20 and combustor exit temperature 1150–1350[Formula: see text]C.",

    "abstract": "In the process of complex product design, modeling in different fields and different disciplines is often involved. Designers often face many different development kits, platforms, and theories, among which significant differences exist. Especially in the process of algorithm-hardware implementation, it is necessary to have mastery of the knowledge including algorithm, hardware, circuit, and system engineering. In this paper, a modeling method of algorithm-hardware based on SysML is proposed to reduce the difficulty of algorithm-hardware modeling. By using the method, the designers who do not know the knowledge of hardware can also easily build the algorithm-hardware model. In this method, a method of graphical system modeling based on SysML is used, where the elements of the algorithm-hardware model are described by SysML graphical models. Then, the SysML graphical models are converted to Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language. At last, a detecting algorithm of random number is complemented by the modeling method in this paper and the simulation results are presented at the conclusion.",

    "abstract": "In recent days, health problems are becoming more prevalent because of changes in lifestyles and inherited factors. Heart disease (HD), in particular, has become increasingly widespread in recent years, putting people’s lives in jeopardy. Blood pressure, cholesterol, and pulse rate are all varied for each person. Normal blood pressure should be 120/90, cholesterol should be 100–129[Formula: see text]mg/dL, pulse rate should be 72, fasting blood sugar level should be 100[Formula: see text]mg/dL, heart rate should be 60–100[Formula: see text]bpm, and ECG should be normal, according to medically established data. The aorta is 25[Formula: see text]mm (1 inch) wide, whereas capillaries are only 8[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m wide, which signifies HD. This paper is based on a public health dataset that also contains a cardiac dataset. In our previous work, a new conventional neural network (CNN) architecture was used to extract and categorize histopathological images using the [Formula: see text]-means consensus clustering. We achieved good results with the cardiac dataset compared to the existing results. The outcome of the proposed work achieves a precision rate of 97%. In this paper, a novel conventional neural network (CNN) architecture was utilized to identify and characterize histopathology pictures with the help of using the consensus [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbor algorithm (CKNN). The usage of a deep neural network, as well as the selection and recovery of functionality, is an essential step until the dataset is classified. As a result, the training process has pre-formed the dataset. The system evaluates the person’s symptoms as input and provides the disease’s possibility as an output. The suggested approach is linked to temporal data modeling and makes use of a prior HD CNN prediction. In comparison to previous outcomes, we had good outcomes with the current cardiac dataset. The proposed model’s conclusion has brought out accuracy of 99.1%.",

The network can evolve in time by means of the creation and the deletion of some connections. When a connexion is created, the individuals have access to the whole history of posts written by the corresponding author and, when a connexion is destroyed, all the posts written by the corresponding author become invisible. The agents’ opinions are described by a set of continuous opinion variables in the closed interval [Formula: see text]. They represent the agreement (or disagreement) of the corresponding agent with respect to a binary question (such as a referendum or an election with two candidates). The model takes into account the effects on public opinion caused by the sign and the intensity of the initial opinions of the agents, their activity in microblogging platforms the presence of leaders and the possible manipulations of the visibility of the posts by the microblogging platform owner. The model is written as a system of integro-differential equations and simulated by using a Runge–Kutta method. We show that hidden manipulation can have an important impact on the public opinion formation and that very mild interventions of the network owner may induce major effects on the population. In our simulations, the effect of hidden manipulation is shown to be more efficient in driving the public opinion than the action of a leader, in the case of bounded confidence models and for short-time intervals.",

The statistical properties of rankings have been studied for almost a century in a variety of fields. More recently, data availability has allowed us to study rank dynamics: how elements of a ranking change in time. Here, we study the rank distributions and rank dynamics of 12 datasets from different sports and games. To study rank dynamics, we consider measures that we have defined previously: rank diversity, change probability, rank entropy, and rank complexity. We also introduce a new measure that we call “system closure” that reflects how many elements enter or leave the rankings in time. We use a random walk model to reproduce the observed rank dynamics, showing that a simple mechanism can generate similar statistical properties as the ones observed in the datasets. Our results show that while rank distributions vary considerably for different rankings, rank dynamics have similar behaviors, independently of the nature and competitiveness of the sport or game and its ranking method. Our results also suggest that our measures of rank dynamics are general and applicable for complex systems of different natures.",

    "abstract": "Presently, the design process of the AI remote server can enable the user to evaluate whether an authorized user can gain emotional responses when they establish an emotional product interface in the approach of the interaction with the device. Therefore, it is necessary for user experience and the ability to address the user’s emotional expectations. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based user face recognition response system (AI-UFRRS) to monitor users’ emotions in real life continually and provide new insights into their emotional responses and transitions. The user face recognition response system design is analyzed based on device intelligence. Eventually, the response system is improved and strategy based on an intelligent device. The proposed AI-UFRRS utilizes reinforcement learning technologies to maintain emotional processing in substantial information relating to the user’s identity. This paper offers AI remote strategies to reduce identification information and maximize information on emotions formed by reinforcement learning. The results suggest that the system provided can perform a convolute transformation to maintain user recognition accuracy and reduce face identity recognition. Thus, the experimental results of AI-UFRRS show the improved accuracy ratio of 95.6%, the recognition rate of 93.4%, emotion ratio of 95.5%, high response system ratio of 96.3%, and to increase user identification ratio of 91.8% and reduced false acceptance rate of 19.2%, the false rejection rate of 19.5% compared to other methods.",

The generalization capacity of the networks is also higher than in the latter.

The structural properties of the merged software-Java class networks were found to correlate with the proportion of Java classes contained within the subset delimited by R coupling .

I stress the term description, because as it occurs in all periods of fast social changes, our conceptual tools tend to become blunt before we realize that normal science keeps failing us. The city is a complex and ambiguous object, as it is constituted by two parts, or orders of facts, inextricably bound. One is visible, i.e. observable through physical wavelengths: the other is not physically visible and can be grasped only by intellectual tools. Arrangements in the second order of facts, though, are responsible for arrangements in the first one, in the sense of producing them, and these in turn affect the former ones, although in ways and in degrees that are far from being clear. In general, decoding between the two order of facts is hazardous and has not produced a set of rules widely consented upon. This is why I remain very skeptical and in some cases outright critical of models stressing continuities in the concepts of civic organization, by referring to traditional urban forms. Reminiscent of Anthony Gidden's sharp statement that the city is one of those social forms that display \"a specious continuity with pre-existing social orders\" (Giddens, (1990) The Consequences of Modernity, Stanford University Press, Stanford, p. 6) I will try to etch analytical tools capable to clarify at least a few processes that are shaping civic life in contemporary metropolis.",

The analysis of the basic model reveals asymptotic stable behavior that is unable to explain any kind of population outburst. We introduce the nonuniform spatial distribution of plankton by considering physical diffusion of the species concerned. The resulting reaction-diffusion equation model is first analyzed with constant diffusivity and then with variable diffusivity for the zooplankton. The model with variable diffusivity is analyzed by using Floquet theory. In both cases, the model is seen to exhibit stable behavior. Finally, we study another characteristic feature of any ecological population, namely, environmental fluctuations. We achieve this by perturbing the growth rate of phytoplankton and death rate of zooplankton by using colored noise. The resulting model is analyzed by evaluating the spectral density functions. It is observed that the stochastic model can generate a large fluctuation in population concentration for high amplitude driving forces.",

This leads to collisions which, once projected onto the horizontal plane, become essentially stochastic and may have an effective restitution coefficient larger than unity. We therefore introduce the model of inelastic hard spheres with random restitution coefficient α (larger or smaller than unity) to describe granular systems heated by vibrations. In the non-equilibrium steady state, we focus in particular on the single particle velocity distribution f(v) in the horizontal plane, and on its deviation from a Maxwellian. We use Molecular Dynamics simulations and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) to show that, depending on the distribution of α, different shapes of f(v) can be obtained, with very different high energy tails. Moreover, the fourth cumulant of the velocity distribution (which quantifies the deviations from Gaussian statistics) is obtained analytically from the Boltzmann equation and successfully tested against the simulations.",

    "abstract": "In order to understand and organize the document in an efficient way, the multi-document summarization becomes the prominent technique in the Internet world. As the information available is in a large amount, it is necessary to summarize the document for obtaining the condensed information. To perform the multi-document summarization, a new Bayesian theory-based Hybrid Learning Model (BHLM) is proposed in this paper. Initially, the input documents are preprocessed, where the stop words are removed from the document. Then, the feature of the sentence is extracted to determine the sentence score for summarizing the document. The extracted feature is then fed into the hybrid learning model for learning. Subsequently, learning feature, training error and correlation coefficient are integrated with the Bayesian model to develop BHLM. Also, the proposed method is used to assign the class label assisted by the mean, variance and probability measures. Finally, based on the class label, the sentences are sorted out to generate the final summary of the multi-document. The experimental results are validated in MATLAB, and the performance is analyzed using the metrics, precision, recall, [Formula: see text]-measure and rouge-1. The proposed model attains 99.6% precision and 75% rouge-1 measure, which shows that the model can provide the final summary efficiently.",

    "abstract": "The development of micro-grid renewable energy system in China has achieved rapid growth in recent years, and the micro-grid renewable energy system has been drawing more and more attention by its flexible operation. Due to the randomness, fluctuation, uncertainty of the wind and photovoltaic renewable generation, abundant flexibility is required to meet the needs of safe, reliable and independent operation of the micro-grid energy system. We need to connect large energy systems to accept outside assistance when the micro-grid renewable energy system is short of adjustment capability. Independent operation and network operation will affect the economic benefit of the micro-grid energy system, so it is practically meaningful to study on the economic benefit evaluation of the micro-grid renewable energy system. This paper proposes a micro-grid energy system operation simulation model about wind and photovoltaic generation, the uncertainty of which is tackled based on the scenario generation and extraction techniques. Based on the proposed indices, the economic benefit could be evaluated by simulating the micro-grid energy system operation. The proposed method is validated by a real micro-grid energy system.",

A fuzzy system is proposed for controlling the mutation and crossover rates of the genetic algorithm, and the corrective strategy is exploited for handling the equilibrium problem constraints. In the model, an approximation algorithm is proposed for obtaining the paths between the origin–destination pairs in the demand matrix. Unlike the traditional deterministic algorithm that has exponential time complexity, this approximation algorithm has polynomial time complexity and is executed much faster. Afterward, the Trasfugen method is applied to the urban network of Tehran metropolitan and the efficiency is investigated. Upon comparing the results obtained from the proposed model with those obtained from the conventional traffic assignment method, namely, the Frank–Wolfe method; it is shown that the proposed algorithm, while acting worse during the initial iterations, achieves better results in the subsequent iterations. Moreover, it prevents the occurrence of local optimal points as well as early/premature convergence, thus producing better results than the Frank–Wolfe algorithm.",

Vortexes induced by tidal currents were also evaluated using a realistic tidal simulation for comparison with the magnitudes of the tsunami vortexes. The tsunami simulation identified the dominant areas of the tsunami vortexes characterized by the magnitude of the vorticity. Unified maps of tsunami speeds and vortexes showed the difficult areas for ship evacuation and indicated that these areas can persist after the approach of the leading wave around the entrances to port areas. The areas of tsunami vortex formation were largely deduced by analyzing the vorticity fields in the tidal simulations, because the magnitude of tsunami-induced vorticities was closely correlated with that of the tide-induced vorticities. The combination of tide and tsunami simulations can identify areas of tsunami vortex formation and provide valuable information to guide measures for safer vessel evacuation.",

    "abstract": "By reaching the first wall of a fusion reactor, charged plasma particles, electrons and ions are recombined into neutral molecules and atoms of hydrogen isotopes. These species recycle back into the plasma volume and participate, in particular, in charge–exchange (cx) collisions with ions. As a result, hot atoms with chaotically directed velocities are generated and some of them hit the wall. Statistical Monte Carlo methods often used to model the behavior of cx atoms are too time-consuming for comprehensive parameter studies. Recently 1 an alternative iteration approach to solve one-dimensional kinetic equation 2 has been significantly accelerated, by a factor of 30–50, by applying a pass method to evaluate the arising integrals from functions, involving the ion velocity distribution. Here, this approach is used by solving a two-dimensional kinetic equation, describing the transport of cx atoms in the vicinity of an opening in the wall, e.g., the entrance of a duct guiding to a diagnostic installation. To assess the erosion rate and lifetime of the installation, one need to know the energy spectrum of hot cx atoms escaping from the plasma into the duct. Calculations are done for a first mirror of molybdenum under plasma conditions expected in a fusion reactor like DEMO. 3,4 The results of kinetic modeling are compared with those found by using a diffusion approximation 5 relevant for cx atoms if the time between cx collisions with ions is much smaller than the time till the ionization of atoms by electrons. The present more exact kinetic consideration predicts a mirror erosion rate by a factor of 2 larger than the approximate diffusion approach.",

This generation dispatch model extends an existing integrated grid and electricity market (IGEM) model covering the Continental European electric power system. By explicitly incorporating the markets for primary and secondary control reserves (PCR and SCR), the model can reproduce the decisions of generating unit operators on which markets get involved. Besides, the introduction of the integrality conditions allows considering start-up costs and the calculus of generating units to pass through the economically unattractive periods with low or even negative prices in order to avoid another start-up. Since this model is too large to be solved with common MILP solvers for the intended simulation time of one year, temporal and geographical interdependencies are used to solve it heuristically. The heuristic therefore splits the model into various sub-problems so that on the one hand, the number of variables, especially of integer variables, per sub-problem is reduced significantly and on the other hand, the relevant interdependencies remain considered. The heuristic is evaluated in terms of accuracy and computation time by means of two case studies. Both case studies show satisfactory accuracy and significant advantages in computation time.",

    "abstract": "Resonant converter (RC) was brought under research in the 80’s widely, which can attain very small switching loss, therefore, facilitating resonant topologies to function at the high switching frequency. It is well addressed in the review that the optimal parameterization of the resonant converter is a crucial task. While the literature has come out with different methodologies, they are highly conceptual and so the uncertainty due to high theoretical impact persists. This paper intends to develop a Parameter Optimization (PO) algorithm for designing and developing of LLC-RC. The proposed algorithm overwhelms the limitation by introducing a nonconceptual model based on the simulated outcome. Specifically, the resonant current under start-up conditions is acquired from the literary outcome, and the intelligent model is constructed. Based on the proposed model, a renowned search algorithm called as Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is exploited to optimize the time constant of the resonant converter, which is a critical design parameter. The objective model is derived as a function of start-up time and so the start-up time can be minimized. Moreover, the response speed of the output voltage is also increased. The proposed Whale Optimization Algorithm based Parameter Optimization (WOAPO) is compared with the conventional techniques such as IAPO, Ant Bee Colony-PO (ABC-PO), Particle Swarm Optimization- PO (PSOPO), FireFly PO (FFPO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWOPO). The obtained result verifies the performance of the proposed method in modeling LLC-RC system.",

    "abstract": "Network clustering is the process of partitioning a network into a number of virtual entities mastered by certain nodes, called cluster centers that are responsible for collecting and maintaining topology information and managing the routing processes. In ad hoc networking, clustering has been introduced to deal with the dynamic topology by providing a temporarily stable network core. Clustering process mainly depends on the metric upon which the selection of cluster centers is performed. A wide range of clustering metrics were introduced in the literature based on network issues including mobility and connectivity degree, giving rise to a variety of clustering schemes. Although clustering provides energy consumption reduction, residual energy has not received enough attention and few studies have addressed the clustering on the basis of this feature. This paper discusses the current clustering metrics and proposes an energy-degree evaluation metric with mobility consideration taking into account the nodes residual energy and the network connectivity as two main keys of clustering.",

To solve these difficulties, computer simulation has become one of the main methods for studying electricity market problems. How to establish a reasonable electricity market has always been a major research issue in the electric power industry, for which a key point is the bidding mechanism. Agent-based modeling and a simulation (ABMS) method are used in this paper to study the imperfect competitive electricity market. An agent-based simulation method of multilateral bargaining game theory in the dynamics of the power bidding market is presented, and a multi-agent power market bidding dynamics simulation model based on game theory is established. The dynamic bidding game behavior among the government, power grid companies, power plant companies, and consumer parties is simulated in the market, and the simulation method is realized by Anylogic software. Finally, an agent-based four-party competitive dynamic game simulation in the electricity market is implemented, which provides a theoretical reference for further understanding resource optimization problems in the electricity market.",

    "abstract": "Exchanging simulation models is currently of utmost importance. To improve interoperability between suppliers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the functional mock-up interface (FMI) is exchanged in a standard format called functional mock-up unit (FMU). Since its first release, many simulation tools took the initiative to support FMI. However, since then, there have been many complaints stating that exchanging models via FMI does not work as stable as expected. The reason usually turned out to be the implementation of tool vendors that sometimes fail to comply with the standard fully. This paper introduces a methodology for testing FMI compliance of importing simulation tools using a set of reference FMUs. The standard defines the implementation of FMI functions calling sequence in a state machine. Therefore, conformance testing (also called fault detection) from automata theory is utilized to produce reference FMUs based on the FMI state-machine.",

First, cybermediaries’ information assists tax authorities in selecting audit objects and discovering unregistered taxpayers, and the second signaling role is the main reason for the improvement of the C2C tax compliance rate in the case of low audit probability. Second, the signaling role of cybermediaries’ information is quite limited if the audit probability is low; the increase of the audit probability can directly improve the C2C tax compliance rate as well as indirectly by enhancing the signaling role of cybermediaries’ information; in addition, if the proportion of honest taxpayers is lower than a certain threshold, the lower the proportion is, the lower the signaling role is, ceteris paribus. Finally, the signaling role of cybermediaries’ information on the selection of audit objects rises with the increase of the correlation degree between cybermediaries’ information and taxable income of taxpayers, and a critical value of the correlation degree exists, below which the signaling role of cybermediaries’ information is negative. We also discuss how to enhance the signaling role of cybermediaries’ information to improve the C2C tax compliance rate.",

First, the complex terrain is modeled by the multi-attribute grid technology to reduce the computational complexity, and a truncation probability sensing model is presented. Two strategies, the local mutation operation and parameter adaptive operation, are introduced to improve the optimization ability of quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, and then an improved multi-objective intelligent search algorithm based on QPSO is put forward to get the Pareto optimal front. Then, considering the multi-objective deployment requirements, a novel multi-sensor deployment method based on the multi-objective optimization theory is built. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively deal with the problem of multi-sensor deployment and provide more deployment schemes at once.

We firstly focused two typical 3D weak discontinuity problems on the influence of different convergence criterions for the computational results of each point on the interface in order to verify the efficiency and convergence of the resulting [Formula: see text]-FEM, and then this method is successfully applied to the numerical simulation of CAMs with different shape aggregates. In addition, an efficient hybrid realization method which combines ANSYS and Hypermesh software is also presented in order to quickly establish the geometric models of 3D CAMs. The numerical results have been shown that the proposed [Formula: see text]-FEM can efficiently solve the concrete-like particle-reinforced composite problems and more accurate numerical results can be obtained under the case of fewer elements used in simulation of CAMs, even there being some elements with poor quality.",

The complex Laplacian-based approach results in a hierarchical structure, with formation of a meta-cluster leading other clusters in the network. The proposed formulation enables flexibility to constrain the eigen spectra of the overall closed-loop dynamics, ensuring desired convergence rate and control input intensity. The sufficient conditions ensuring globally stable formation for proposed formulation are also asserted.

    "abstract": "Many real-world networks are known to exhibit facts that counter our knowledge prescribed by the theories on network creation and communication patterns. A common prerequisite in network analysis is that information on nodes and links will be complete because network topologies are extremely sensitive to missing information of this kind. Therefore, many real-world networks that fail to meet this criterion under random sampling may be discarded. In this paper we offer a framework for interpreting the missing observations in network data under the hypothesis that these observations are not missing at random. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study of a financial trade network, where the awareness of agents to the data collection procedure by a self-interested observer may result in strategic revealing or withholding of information. The non-random missingness has been overlooked despite the possibility of this being an important feature of the processes by which the network is generated. The analysis demonstrates that strategic information withholding may be a valid general phenomenon in complex systems. The evidence is sufficient to support the existence of an influential observer and to offer a compelling dynamic mechanism for the creation of the network.",

However, rectal ultrasound (TRUS) as the main diagnostic tool for prostate diseases remains a challenging issue.

(2) In terms of visual features, ultrasound images of prostate cancer are similar to TRUS images of other tissues and organs, so it is difficult for a single neural network model to accurately learn the feature representation of the disease. To address the above problems, we first establish a high-quality dataset for prostate TRUS imaging, and then design multi teacher knowledge distillation to achieve accurate disease recognition. The experimental results show that, compared with knowledge distillation without a teacher model and a single teacher model, knowledge distillation using multiple teacher models can significantly improve the accuracy of prostate TRUS image cancer prediction. As the number of teacher models increases, the accuracy rate is further improved, which verifies the effectiveness of this method in intelligent systems.",

Complementing the mobility process with two history-determined components leads to an extended mobility process that is Markovian. Although our model is a very much reduced version of the original one, it remains too complex for the application of usual analytic methods. Instead, we employ simulations to examine the functionalities of the two history-determined components. We think that the structure of the analyzed stochastic process is exemplary for many socio-technical, -economic, -ecological systems.

In this paper, we present a new approach, an agent with direction sense for an automatic option discovery. Our agent uses its direction sense to discover shortcuts and shortest paths between states that he has already visited, he detects bottlenecks for building termination conditions and initiation states for options. Thus, at the learning step, the agent uses his previous experience of exploration in parallel with an intrinsically motivated learning. The options discovered are task-independent and could be used for new tasks.

To tackle these challenges, this work introduces a fault diagnosis framework and method for multi-tier edge computing systems based on blockchain smart contracts. The framework primarily adopts a decentralized model to ensure the privacy and security of fault data in multi-tier edge systems. Within this framework, a feature comparison loss function is designed to address the nonIID nature of faults. Additionally, a Byzantine fault-tolerant method is developed to prevent fault threats. Furthermore, we design an incentive method based on reputation to assess the rewards that nodes should receive. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust overall performance without compromising the privacy of local data.",

    "abstract": "In the ever-evolving landscape of online gaming, ensuring secure and efficient communication channels has become paramount. As online gaming continues to flourish, so do the challenges of maintaining secure communication channels. The surge in complexity and evolving cyber threats necessitates innovative solutions. The main aim of the research work is to overcome the existing gap by introducing a novel approach that combines the resilience of ResNet architectures with a multi-level security framework to reduce the complexity, increase the security in online gaming, etc. The increasing complexity of game communication systems, coupled with the rising sophistication of cyber threats, poses a significant challenge. Traditional security measures often fall short of providing comprehensive protection, leaving vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. This study addresses the complexity and threats associated with game communications by proposing an AES-ResNet-based threat mitigation framework with a multi-level security approach. Our approach leverages ResNet’s deep learning capabilities to discern and mitigate threats effectively. The multi-level security framework involves the integration of encryption, authentication, and anomaly detection at different stages of game communication. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in system complexity and enhanced threat mitigation. The integration of ResNet architectures proves effective in identifying and neutralizing malicious activities, contributing to a more secure game communication environment. Further validation and refinement are ongoing, promising a robust solution for the evolving challenges in online gaming security.",

The high complexity of climate-change programs often makes it difficult to determine their effectiveness through standard monitoring and evaluation procedures. ‘complexity-aware monitoring’ is a qualitative approach to monitoring, recently introduced by international development programs. This increasing awareness of complexity in the evaluation sector opens up a window of opportunity for complexity science to support climate change mitigation and adaptation programs. This paper’s contribution is a hands-on methodology for live monitoring and evaluation of development programs. The methodology is rooted in existing literature on social–ecological systems, as pioneered by Ostrom, and in quantitative methods from complexity science. To illustrate the methodology, an existing climate mitigation project in Madagascar, funded, monitored and evaluated by the Green Climate Fund, is discussed.",

First of all, the pixel coordinates of the objects are obtained by target matching, and then the area of the object on the captured image is calculated for rough matching. Finally, the precise coordinates of the objects to be located are obtained through their center values and recognized by the fine matching.

    "abstract": "The research on efficient routing strategies holds paramount importance in mitigating network congestion and enhancing the transmission capacity of complex networks. A Hierarchical Routing Optimization (HRO) strategy is proposed for dual-layer networks featuring both logical and physical layer structures. This strategy employs distinct methods for packet transmission at the logical and physical layers to optimize the utilization of network resources. Comparison with the improved static-weighted routing strategy (ISWR) and the improved effective routing strategy (IER) involves analyzing the relationship between the transmission capacity of the dual-layer network and the coupling method under these three routing strategies. This analysis aims to determine the optimal coupling method for the routing strategy, thereby enhancing overall network capacity. The simulation results reveal that the random coupling method proves most effective when employing the ISWR strategy, the assortative coupling method excels with the IER strategy, and the dissortative coupling method stands out when implementing the HRO strategy. In evaluating the ISWR strategy, IER strategy, and HRO strategy, it becomes evident that the HRO strategy substantially amplifies the transmission capacity of the dual-layer network. Furthermore, the HRO strategy exhibits heightened robustness against both random and deliberate attacks compared to the IER strategy.",

Some groups became legends and survived for decades, while others vanished and are known now only to the most dedicated music history scholars. To explain and predict success, we built a complex network of the groups and their almost 20,000 members based on performers’ sharing using the data from Wikipedia and Google. We calculated the primary network measures: centralities, degree assortativity, and clustering coefficient — and discovered that they could not accurately predict music group success, but they could distinguish between coarse measures of success, such as which groups were above or below the median. In particular, all centralities positively correlate with success, and the clustering coefficient non-linearly maximizes it. The proposed network-based success exploration and prediction methods are transferable to other arts and humanities areas with medium- or long-term team-based collaborations.",

The calibration of microscopic traffic simulation models of non-commercial LPOEs requires a deep understanding of operational processes and driving behavior at these facilities. This paper provides a methodology to guide modelers in calibrating microscopic traffic simulation models of non-commercial LPOEs. The methodology establishes a common framework for modeling operational processes and traffic operations. Moreover, the methodology includes the value of four state variables that characterizes operations of passenger vehicles at non-commercial LPOEs. These variables are speed, acceleration, deceleration, and headway. The authors evaluated this methodology using the Otay Mesa non-commercial LPOE as a case study. Results showed that this methodology could be potentially used to model non-commercial LPOEs along the US–Mexico border and other border regions worldwide.",

    "abstract": "The technical advancement in information systems contributes towards the massive availability of the documents stored in the electronic databases such as e-mails, internet and web pages. Therefore, it becomes a complex task for arranging and browsing the required document. This paper proposes an approach for incremental clustering using the Bat-Grey Wolf Optimizer (BAGWO). The input documents are initially subjected to the pre-processing module to obtain useful keywords, and then the feature extraction is performed based on wordnet features. After feature extraction, feature selection is carried out using entropy function. Subsequently, the clustering is done using the proposed BAGWO algorithm. The BAGWO algorithm is designed by integrating the Bat Algorithm (BA) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for generating the different clusters of text documents. Hence, the clustering is determined using the BAGWO algorithm, yielding the group of clusters. On the other side, upon the arrival of a new document, the same steps of pre-processing and feature extraction are performed. Based on the features of the test document, the mapping is done between the features of the test document, and the clusters obtained by the proposed BAGWO approach. The mapping is performed using the kernel-based deep point distance and once the mapping terminated, the representatives are updated based on the fuzzy-based representative update. The performance of the developed BAGWO outperformed the existing techniques in terms of clustering accuracy, Jaccard coefficient, and rand coefficient with maximal values 0.948, 0.968, and 0.969, respectively.",

This study selected the MUZL420 ring die pellet mill as the research object, from which a 3D flow physical model was established. The numerical simulation of 3D nonisothermal flow in the extrusion pelletizing process of granulated alfalfa was performed with POLYFLOW. The distribution laws of pressure, velocity, shear rate, viscosity, viscous heating and temperature in the flow field were revealed to thoroughly investigate the pelletizing process and provide a reference for structural optimization and process control. The results showed that two extrusion zones in the pelleting chamber were symmetrical with respect to the center, and the significant pressure gradient along the rotating direction of the ring die and the roller caused the material to flow back in the opposite direction. There were larger velocity gradients, shear rates and viscous heating levels in the deformation and compaction zone, the negative pressure zone behind the extrusion zone and the die holes. The distribution of viscosity was opposite to that of the shear rate. The temperature increase area caused by viscous heating gradually expanded from the material inlet to the bottom of the extrusion chamber along the [Formula: see text]-axis direction, and the temperature increased accordingly. The extrusion force and the forming temperature in the extrusion forming zone were captured in the numerical simulation. The extrusion forming density was calculated with the regression prediction model established through the simulation experiment of pelletizing with a ring die. Through a comparison with the results of mean alfalfa pellet density from the ring die pellet mill experiment, the relative error was less than 5%, which indicated that the numerical simulation method was reliable.",

First, the scene was adaptively divided into several meaningful and easily analyzed subregions according to the optimal view distance criterion. Second, a novel viewpoint scoring method based on visual perception and information entropy fusion was developed for optimal viewpoint determination and greedy N-Bestviewpoint selection algorithm was utilized for visual perceptibility calculation. Then evolutionary programming approach for the Traveling Salesman problem was applied for intra-subregion and inter-subregion exploring path optimization. Finally, the Cubic Hermite Curve was introduced to smoothen the inflection point on the exploration path. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively generate an automatic smooth, informative, aesthetic and non-intersecting path, with the characteristics of good exploring comfort, strong immersion and high scene information perception.",

In the network, each node poses less energy due to battery-operated sensor nodes. Numerous methods are devised for routing, but each method suffered from the energy constraint. This paper proposes an energy-efficient multipath routing protocol for exploiting different routes between source and destination to mitigate energy constraints. The key idea is to determine the optimal path from a set of paths available between the source and the target node. To improve the security in routing protocol, the factors, like energy, trust, and mobility are considered as major components. Here, the trust is modeled by considering trust factors, like average encounter rate (AER), successful cooperation frequency (SCF), direct trust, integrity factor, and forwarding rate factor. Moreover, secure routing is performed between the nodes using the proposed Adaptive-Atom Whale Optimization algorithm (Adaptive-AWOA). The proposed Adaptive-AWOA) is designed by incorporating the Adaptive concept in the Atom Whale Optimization algorithm (AWOA). The fitness function is newly modeled considering mobility, energy, and trust factors. The proposed Adaptive-AWOA outperformed the other methods with a minimal end-to-end delay of 0.009, maximal throughput of 85.802% and maximal packet delivery ratio (PDR) of 97.391%, respectively.",

This could also be the case for the COVID-19 spreading because an amount of micro-sized droplet nuclei, often carrying net electric charge, are expected to be electro-dynamically involved in a physical process originated by the natural and unperceivable static electrification of human beings. The effects of the triboelectric charging have long been successfully tested because the phenomenon under examination is also implied in the genesis of the electrostatic discharge (ESD), a demanding key objective in the special context of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Therefore, the ultimate purpose of this technical paper is to provide valuable insights into infection control, building on what is already being done for maintaining static-safe environments. The stature of the applied model can be further appreciated because some currently observed climate-dependent and sex-linked different vulnerabilities to COVID-19 are critically examined by unique sound arguments. These ultimately focus attention on ambient relative humidity and worn shoes, the latter differing for typology, size and material, for their integrated control of the inadvertent human aptitude to buildup tribocharges. These would appear as a dreadful prerequisite for charge bearing droplets in the airborne state to be efficiently attracted/repelled according to the described electrostatic mechanism.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, preconditioned gridless methods are developed for solving the three-dimensional (3D) Euler equations at low Mach numbers. The preconditioned system is obtained by multiplying a preconditioning matrix of the type of Weiss and Smith to the time derivative of the 3D Euler equations, which are discretized under the clouds of points distributed in the computational domain by using a gridless technique. The implementations of the preconditioned gridless methods are mainly based on the frame of the traditional gridless method without preconditioning, which may fail to have convergence for flow simulations at low Mach numbers, therefore the modifications corresponding to the affected terms of preconditioning are mainly addressed in the paper. An explicit four-stage Runge–Kutta scheme is first applied for time integration, and the lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) algorithm is then introduced to form the implicit counterpart to have the further speed up of the convergence. Both the resulting explicit and implicit preconditioned gridless methods are validated by simulating flows over two academic bodies like sphere or hemispherical headform, and transonic and nearly incompressible flows over one aerodynamic ONERA M6 wing. The gridless clouds of both regular and irregular points are used in the simulations, which demonstrates the ability of the method presented for coping with flows over complicated aerodynamic geometries. Numerical results of surface pressure distributions agree well with available experimental data or simulated solutions in the literature. The numerical results also show that the preconditioned gridless methods presented still functions for compressible transonic flow simulations and additionally, for nearly incompressible flow simulations at low Mach numbers as well. The convergence of the implicit preconditioned gridless method, as expected, is much faster than its explicit counterpart.",

The main aim is to solve pilot contamination issue in massive MIMO systems; this research paper utilizes two approaches for reducing the contamination. This paper presents the user grouping approach based on sparse fuzzy C-means clustering (sparse FCM), which groups user parameters based on parameters such as large-scale fading factor, SINR, and user distance. Here, same pilot sequences are assigned to center users in which the impact of pilot contamination is limited, while the algorithm assigns orthogonal pilot sequences to the edge users that suffer severely from pilot contamination. Therefore, the proposed user grouping keeps away from the inappropriate grouping of users, enabling effective grouping even under the worst situations of the channel. Secondly, pilot scheduling is done based on elephant spider monkey optimization (ESMO), which is designed by integrating elephant herding optimization (EHO) into spider monkey optimization (SMO). The performance of pilot scheduling based on grouping-based ESMO is evaluated based on achievable rate and SINR. The proposed method achieves maximal achievable rate of 41.29[Formula: see text]bps/Hz and maximal SINR of 124.31[Formula: see text]dB.",

It is shown that the model is very sensitive to both random sampling and the choice of value for the input parameters. Running the model repeatedly with the same set of input parameters gives a range of output values of over 50% of the mean value. The sensitivity of the inputs of the model is analyzed using a variance-based approach based upon generating Sobol sequences of quasi-random numbers. When using the model to look at the talent associated with an individual who has the maximum capital over a model run it has been shown that the choice for the standard deviation of the talent distribution contributes to 67% of the model variability. When investigating the maximum amount of capital returned by the model the probability of a lucky event at any given epoch has the largest impact on the model, almost three times more than any other individual parameter. Consequently, during the analysis of the model results one must keep in mind the impact that only small changes in the input parameters can have on the model output.",

This phenomenological approach is based on concepts used in linguistics, and provides a formalism that is universal across languages. We put forward an efficient two-parameter form for the word length distribution, and introduce a simple representation of mishearings, which we use in our subsequent modelling of word recognition. In a context-free scenario, word recognition often occurs via anticipation when, part-way into a word, we can correctly guess its full form. We give a quantitative estimate of this anticipation threshold when no mishearings occur, in terms of model parameters. As might be expected, the whole anticipation effect disappears when there are sufficiently many mishearings. Our global approach to the problem of speech perception is in the spirit of an optimisation problem. We show for instance that speech perception is easy when the word length is less than a threshold, to be identified with a static transition, and hard otherwise. We extend this to the dynamics of word recognition, proposing an intuitive approach highlighting the distinction between individual, isolated mishearings and clusters of contiguous mishearings. At least in some parameter range, a dynamical transition is manifest well before the static transition is reached, as is the case for many other examples of complex systems.",

In this paper, a novel model is established to describe the relation between the brain and the CPG with time delay. The artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) consists of various computational modules that are used to model the brain. The brain synchronization under amplitude and frequency variations of the CPG and the effect of the RNN parameters variations on the CPG are investigated. In the paper, the excitatory neuron probability and average connections number are parameter space of RNN and the parameter space of CPG, which include frequency and amplitude. According to the simulation results, the best RNN synchronization could be obtained by finding the optimum parameters space between the RNN and the CPG. I propose that the parameter space of some CPGs is related to the parameter space of the brain. This leads to a brain load decrement that facilities the control action.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the use of interactions as a metric to detect emergent phenomena in the ongoing agent-based simulations. The proposed algorithm aims to detect the flocking behavior in the Boids model. Boids model is simple to understand and to use and always verifies emergence. In recent years, several metrics have been proposed to investigate emergent behaviors in complex systems. Two main limitations of these studies are, how to choose a proper metric to avoid a high coast of computation, and how to detect emergence as it happens, i.e., live detection. In this paper, we propose an interaction-based algorithm to detect emergent behavior in Boids model. The three main contributions of this work are: (1) using interaction as metric, (2) detect emergence when it happens, (3) no need to store simulation data for post-mortem analysis. A prior interactions analysis was done to classify the system interactions. The results show that the algorithm was able to detect the rise of the flocking, i.e., emergence in the Boids model. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Here, the hybrid scheme consists of a cubic spline approximation in the fine mesh region and a midpoint upwind scheme in the coarse mesh region. The error analysis is carried out and it is shown that the proposed scheme is of second-order convergence irrespective of the perturbation parameter.

The state-of-the-art controller requires precise conceptual models and sophisticated optimization principles based on the derived models. However, such processes are limited to known system models, which are uncertain in future systems. Here, the controller for 3-phase qZS-CMI is modeled based on two phases, and the source PV voltage and output grid current are controlled. In Phase I, optimized Proportional Integral (PI) controller is used for finding out the total PV voltage, and Phase II utilizes the optimized Proportional Resonant (PR) controller enabled with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for controlling the grid current. For two phases, the modified optimization algorithm called Fitness Enabled-Rider Optimization Algorithm (FE-ROA) is used. Moreover, in Phase II, ANN is trained in an offline mode with the exact dataset arranged by the proposed FE-ROA, and it guarantees the control of grid current. The two phases plan to optimize the gain of both PI and PR controllers respectively using the same proposed algorithm. The main objective of phase I is to lessen the error among the reference PV voltage, and measured voltage, and phase II is to lessen the error among the reference and measured grid current. Hence, the grid-tie current injection is achieved by the developed module, and system-level control offers independent Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Lastly, the performance of the proposed controller for qZS-CMI is compared over the other controllers and substantiates the efficacy of the proposed one.",

The resulting budget is spent to cover administrative costs and to pay a bonus to cooperative agents, which can be identified correctly only with a probability [Formula: see text]. Agents decide at each time step to choose either cooperation or defection based on different information. In the local scenario, they compare their potential gains from both strategies. In the global scenario, they compare the gains of the cooperative and defective subpopulations. We derive analytical expressions for the critical bonus needed to make cooperation as attractive as defection. We show that for the local scenario the government can establish only a medium level of cooperation because the critical bonus increases with the level of cooperation. In the global scenario, instead full cooperation can be achieved once the cold-start problem is solved because the critical bonus decreases with the level of cooperation. This allows to lower the tax rate, while maintaining high cooperation.",

The majority of location-based services rely mostly on the user’s ongoing and prospective position, indicating a growing need of forecasting the user’s future location. Together with position prediction, forecasting the trajectories between two terminals is beneficial, because it enables to optimize the travel direction between them. This study tackles the problem of increasing prediction accuracy to its maximum level. The proposed work undergoes two major phases: feature extraction and prediction. Initially, antecedent and consequent features, spatio-temporal matching based features, and matching users based features can all be generated from the raw input data. For more precise prediction the most relevant features are extracted. The features will then be fed into the prediction algorithm, which will forecast user mobility. The prediction phase is constructed with an optimized convolutional neural network (CNN). Moreover, the weight of CNN is fine-tuned via a new improved butterfly optimization algorithm (IBOA), which is a conceptual improvement of standard BOA. At last, the supremacy of the presented approach is proved over other models with respect to varied measures. The accuracy of the proposed work is 18.33%, 26.67%, 33.33%, 55.2%, and 61.67% better than the existing models like HS–EH, GAF-WO, CNN, and GSTF.",

Generally, a complex system contains some integrated circuit modules, which can be used for control or calculation of the system. Compared with system model, integrated circuit model is more fine-grained and lower-level and contains logic for control and algorithms. Thus, a method that modeling integrated circuit by unified modeling language is necessary. In this paper, a unified modeling language is introduced, called X language, and a modeling method of algorithm-hardware based on the X language is proposed. First of all, the hardware characteristics of the Kalman filter algorithm are extracted by analyzing the algorithm. Second, X language models are built to describe the algorithm-hardware. Then, the X language models are converted to Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL). Finally, the algorithm-hardware models are simulated and verified. The results show that the algorithm-hardware modeling method based on X language is feasible.",

This study performs system identification by using the NARX model as a base model with the nonlinear functions of a neural network for an industrial air compression system. The identification undergoes a series of analysis (number of neuron, delay and data division) to determine the most suitable NARX-NN model architecture configuration before coming up with a final model. Finally, the validation of model’s predictive performance is carried out through several analyses, namely, mean square error and regression value. The predicted data are compared to the industrial data to verify its accuracy which shows that the final model had successfully ruled out the suspicious random event data.",

By analyzing the fuzzy time and fuzzy risk, the objective functions of this model are optimal satisfaction function and optimal risk function. Related constraints are also described mathematically. The PSO-GA (particle swarm and genetic) hybrid algorithm is used to solve the model when designing the algorithm. Two-level planning is incorporated in the algorithm, the best solution in the lower-level planning is assigned to the upper-level, and the upper-level plan feeds back the result to the lower level, and finally the global optimal Pareto solution is obtained. Decision makers can choose appropriate solutions based on their preference. The simulation experiment compares the multi-objective rescue path optimization model with the traditional time-optimal model. Among the three optimal solution sets, solution 1 decreases by 3.36% in risk and the satisfaction rate increases by 69.44%. Solution 2 rose by 13.96% in risk, but the satisfaction increased by 87.93%, and the risk of solution 3 decreased by 11.41%, while the satisfaction increased by 52.41%.

As a result, the design of complex software systems is faced with many challenges arising from the uncertainty of the environment (UoE). On the one hand, ignoring the UoE to manually describe requirements is not only a tough job, but it can also hinder the discovery of potential requirements; on the other hand, it is a challenge to integrate the representation of and reasoning of UoE into the process of modeling complex systems. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of complex systems engineering, this paper takes solving the UoE caused by stakeholders preferences and complex environment context as the entry point and designs a fuzzy control decision-making framework. Specifically, the framework contributes to the spiral of complex systems while solving the UoE by constructing a closed-loop intelligent system based on automatic data flow between information space and physical space for environment sensing, uncertainty analysis, requirements mining, fuzzy reasoning, decision execution as well as feedback optimization. Finally, the framework is validated with a concrete example of an adaptive treadmill system based on the support tools developed.",

Although the CRUD automation in the web application framework boosts the development process, there are many important aspects of a web application absent from the CRUD output. Therefore, this multivocal literature review investigates the record management aspects that are required in modern WA and the perceived benefit of integrating the record management aspect into CRUD operation. The study extracted 284 publications from respectable scientific resources and the grey resources literature created by WA development practitioners outside academic mediums. After a detailed review process, only 14 scientific primary studies and 13 gray studies were considered for this review based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review shows that the most important aspects required in WA are search, role-based access control, retention, appraisal, search, audit trail, digital archiving, sharing, reporting, inactive files management and several other features. These important aspects have been analyzed and characterized according to its function and features. The method and procedure for integrating the specified aspect into CRUD operation are identified and discussed. Integrating and implementing the specified record management features into CRUD operation will boost the WA development productivity by producing more features as a standard output with integrated record management functions.",

    "abstract": "Today clustering-based machine learning algorithms are the important field in data mining. Here, medical data clustering is one of the core applications of data mining to predict and identify the risk factor of the disease. At the same time, medical data clustering is a very important and challenging task due to its complexity and high frequency of data. In order to achieve proper data clustering, this paper proposed a hybrid data clustering algorithm by the combination of [Formula: see text]-Means and Black Hole Entropic Fuzzy Clustering (BHEFC). [Formula: see text]-Means is the first and one of the most popular and low-computation cost partitioned-based clustering algorithms. There are two modules in this hybrid clustering, first some number of iterations are executed by the first module of this hybrid clustering algorithm, which is [Formula: see text]-Means clustering. After some number of iterations, the clustering solutions are shifted to the second module of this hybrid clustering algorithm, which is Entrophic Fuzzy Clustering. So, it can get the advantages of both algorithms. [Formula: see text]-Means clustering algorithm can produce fast clustering solution due to its low-computation cost. But it can go for premature convergence. To overcome this problem, the second module used BHEFC, which can use large amount of high-frequency medical data. The experimental results are done with the medical practitioners to predict the risk factors of the heart disease patients and doctors can give the suggestions based on the risk factors. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed Hybrid [Formula: see text]-Means and BHEFC is analyzed by three different performance measures.",

For the purpose, six algorithms: Support Vector Machine with Linear kernel (Linear-SVM), Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel (RBF-SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree and Random Forest are used for classification purpose and their comparative accuracy is analyzed. Data Imputation, Oversampling and Feature scaling techniques are the constituents of Data preprocessing pipeline. Experiments are performed on a well-known dataset of National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the PIMA diabetes dataset. The data preprocessing techniques, data imputation and Synthetic Minority Oversample Technique (SMOTE) analysis improved classification accuracy from 77% on raw data, to 88.12% (on Random Forest Classifier) and 91% (on ANN Classifier), respectively. Furthermore, a new feature generation approach is applied and performance is analyzed using the SVM model. Original data attributes BMI and Insulin are replaced with new features BMI_NORMAL and INSULIN_NORMAL, respectively. The significant improvement by proposed technique is confirmed by statistical testing followed by post-hoc analysis.",

The LES statistical results are accessed by measurement results. The measured and simulated instantaneous results show the strong interaction between coherent structures and combustion. It is found that larger secondary-air flow leads to early formation of coherent structures and the transition from large vortexes to small vortices. The flame structures are significantly affected by the coherent structures. The spiral vortex structures formed by swirl lead to intensification of combustion",

This can easily lead to strip breaking at the weld seam in the cold rolling process. In this paper, a finite element model of roll and strip with weld seam is established to investigate the mechanism of strip breaking at weld seam due to thickness difference. By simulating the working conditions in the rolling process for weld seam with different thickness differences, the evolution of the stress state of the weld seam in the rolling process under each working condition is analyzed. The influence of thickness difference in the rolling process of the weld seam is revealed, and the effect of thickness difference on the risk of strip breaking at weld seam during the rolling process is further discussed. According to the research results, the optimization method of strip head and tail shear length was designed and applied to the industrial site. After application, the accident rate of strip breaking is reduced and the effect is as expected.",

Three-dimensional FEA model is created to simulate the target surface and shot peening flow which is generated randomly using the MATLAB program.

Detecting the TD early is a crucial issue. Disparate alternatives approach was generated for it over time, but inaccurate detection of TD remains. Thus, aimed at detecting TD, the work renders an effectual dual classification framework. The framework was split into seven phases. Initially, to convert the string data into a numerical value, data numeralization is performed. After that, preprocessing is executed, which processes the missing value by means of taking the average and eliminating the repeated data. Next, so as to scale the entire data into a single unit, normalization is carried out. And the essential features are extracted, and Modified Discrete Salp Swarm Algorithm (MDSSA) Features Selection (FS) technique is developed in order to get rid of relevant features. Currently, an Improved Sign Preserving Cluster Ensemble (ISPCE) is proposed to cluster the chosen features accurately. It clusters the TD utilizing base clusters and lessens the decision graph complications, time intricacy, etc. Finally, the clustered features are inputted to Improved Raven Roosting Optimization Algorithm with Gradient Cats Boost Artificial Neural Network (IRR-GCBANN) for classifying the TD as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or normal. Experimental outcomes exhibit that the proposed framework attains 96.94% accuracy for detecting the TD when weighted against the existent techniques.",

While there is an abundance of heuristics to identify such influential nodes, the method of quantifying the influence itself, has not been investigated in the research community. Most of the classical and state-of-the-art works use Diffusion tests for influence benchmark of a particular set of nodes in the network. The underlying study challenges this method and conducts thorough experiments to show that for real-world applications, the diffusion test alone is not only insufficient, but in some cases is also an inaccurate method of benchmarking. Using eight widely adopted heuristics, 25 networks were tested using Diffusion tests and compared with resilience test, we found out that no single algorithm performs consistently on both types of tests. Thus, we conclude that a more accurate way of benchmarking a set of influential nodes is to run diffusion tests alongside resilience test, in order to label a certain technique as best performer.",

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation classification (AMC) became an important process in various communication systems including commercial, telecommunication and military applications. Further, the accuracy of AMC impacts the performance of these applications. Various machine learning approaches were developed to improve the performance of AMC. However, they failed to classify the different modulation schemes, which needs to satisfy all the spectrum requirements under multipath fading environment. Further, the conventional methods suffer with computational complexity in training to satisfy the real-time operational requirements. So, this paper focuses on implementation of extreme learning machine (ELM) for reduction of training complexities and improves the classification performance. Initially, deep leaning convolutional neural network (DLCNN) model is introduced for extracting the interdependent modulation features based on different modulation types. Then, red deer optimization algorithm (RDOA) is introduced for selecting the best features from DLCNN extracted features. Further, the hybrid ELM with bagging classifier (HELM-BC) is used to classify the various modulation types, i.e., families. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed AMC system using RDOA-based HELM-BC approach is superior to the conventional AMC systems.",

The retrieval of data from the web is a complex procedure due to the large volume of web domain. The basic uses of the websites are described through web usage mining, which mines the weblog records to identify the pattern of accessing the web pages through the user. The web page prediction assists the web users in finding the plot and obtains the information as to their requirements. Several effective algorithms have been developed to mine association rules that make the predictive model more appropriate for web prediction. They can be commonly revised to ensure the changing feature of web access patterns. The Apriori algorithm involves extracting the recurrent itemset and interrelation rule that learns the relational data is commonly utilized for web page prediction. The Apriori algorithm remains the standard model for deriving the patterns and rules from the datasets in co-operative rule extraction. The Apriori algorithm thus generates large mines associated rules for web page prediction. Hence, to select the best rule, the proposed deer hunting rooster-based chicken swarm optimization algorithm is used by integrating the cockerel search agents’ dominating social search creatures’ hunting habits and their traits of looking for food. Further, the neural network (NN) is employed in this research for the prediction of web pages with minimum error. The trained NN is a technique of unsupervised learning that analyzes a dataset of input to produce the desired result, in which the effectiveness of the NN is enhanced by optimal tuning of weight by the adaptive deer hunting rooster-based chicken swarm optimization algorithm. The experimental analysis illustrates that the proposed adaptive deer hunting rooster-based chicken swarm optimization frameworks inherit lower error measures such as mean deviation = 139.89 and symmetric mean absolute percentage error[Formula: see text]0.45579 for the FIFA dataset. The proposed web page prediction models’ L2 norm and infinity norm are 58.017 and 14, respectively, for the MSNBC_SPMF dataset.",

    "abstract": "New policies are commenced all over the globe to diminish the use of fossil fuels, which gives rise to the augmented utilization of solar energy (SE). The photovoltaic (PV) system’s performance is extremely environmental variables reliant. Long-range transmission of SE is incompetent as well as complex to carry in the PV system. It can be affected by disparate sorts of faults, which cause severe energy loss all through the system operation. Thus, it is vital to incessantly monitor the solar PV (SPV) system to detect as well classify the faults by preventing energy losses. The IoT applications in SE production engage sensor devices that are fixed to the generation, and transmission, together with distribution equipment. These devices assist in monitoring the operation of the SPV power plant (SPVPP) system remotely in real-time. Presenting a new algorithm that can perform fault detection and classification in a PV system to a higher level of accuracy is the major contribution of this work. Thus, this work designs as well as develops an IoT platform for carrying out analytical tasks that can analyze data generated as of IoT operating systems to detect as well as classify faults in the SPVPP. Initially, the data collected from the dataset is pre-processed in which data duplication is performed using Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and then the fault is detected from the pre-processed data using the cosine function based k-means clustering (CFKC) technique in the SPV system. Finally, the obtained fault data is fed into the optimized deep learning centered ENN (ODENN) method which classifies the faults. The proposed techniques detect as well as classify the faults effectively that are experimentally proved by means of comparing them with the prevailing techniques, namely ENN, ANN and SVM, along with KNN in terms of some quality measures. The obtained results for ODENN showed an accuracy of 98.99%, specificity of 97.6%, and a sensitivity of 97.02%.",

We first analyze the structure of the target plant and establish its physical structure model. Then we use the particle system and the plant branch collision detection method to calculate the amount of snow accumulation on the branches and generate the fluctuating snow grid surface based on the Berlin noise function. Finally, the cantilever beam model is used to calculate the deformation of branches under snow pressure. This modeling method proposed in this paper can provide a new research idea and technical reference for simulating the dynamic interaction between plants and environmental factors represented by snow.",

Despite the many advantages of the usage of EVs with PMBLDCMs, there were some disadvantages, among them were speed control and dealing with uncertainty problems in the usage of PMBLDCMs in EVs. In rectifying the above-mentioned problems, this work proposed and implemented an ideology of using the nonlinear controller strategy Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Sliding Mode Control (ANF-SMC) in the Electric Propulsion Subsystem (EPSS) of EVs with the usage of the proposed nonlinear controller under not loaded and fully loaded vehicles with constant, variable and sudden disturbance in speed conditions. Simulation was carried out using MATLAB version R 2 020b with Fuzzy Tool Kit (FTK) and simulation performance comparison was done with the existing four (one linear and three nonlinear) controllers. Comparative simulation results infer that the proposed nonlinear controller performs well with zero overshoot and less settling time than that of the existing four (one linear and three nonlinear controllers).",

    "abstract": "Smart Grid Cyber Physical Systems (SG-CPS) have a substantial impact on power grid infrastructure upgrading. Nonetheless, due to the sophisticated nature of the infrastructure and the critical demand for resilient intrusion prevention systems, the task of protecting its security against data integrity attacks is a significant challenge. The simulation and assessment of security performance in SG-CPS present substantial hurdles in real-world power grid systems, owing mostly to experimental constraints. This necessitates the development of novel ways to improve distribution chain security. This research introduces a novel approach, employing a Deep Adversarial Probabilistic Neural Network (DAPNN)-based Intrusion prevention system in a cloud environment. Combining Bayesian Probabilistic Neural Networks (BEPNNs) with adversarial training and rule-based decision-making enhances precision and resilience. The major goal of this research is to detect and counteract false data injection (FDI) attacks that have the potential to compromise the integrity of power grid data. This paper proposes a novel methodology for intrusion detection in SG-CPS that combines BEPNNs with adversarial training. The addition of rule-based decision-making improves the system’s precision and resilience. The IEEE 24-bus system provides the foundation for providing data points relevant to normal operating conditions, contingency scenarios, and intentional attacks. The training procedure includes the use of a BEPNN for feature extraction, as well as the use of adversarial training approaches. The intrusion detection system has decision-making logic based on rules. The cloud infrastructure solution used in the study is Microsoft Azure. The results show that the DAPNN-based Intrusion Prevention System is effective in detecting and mitigating FDI attacks in SG-CPS. The system outperforms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure, hence improving the security of the power grid infrastructure.",

Solutions utilizing Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) control schemes are employed to control the joints of robotic manipulators. However, the existing control strategies utilize fixed gains, which do not fully account for the inherent nonlinearity of the dynamical structure or the dynamics of reference-tracking error. Additionally, the individual joint’s dynamic performance is optimized independently from the performance of other joints. This work introduces an adaptive integral Reinforcement Learning algorithm to control a four-DoF robotic arm in real time. This is done using a model-free Value Iteration process implemented in a continuous-time mode. The solution does not assume any knowledge of the dynamics of the robot arm and does not require any initial admissible control strategy to proceed with the adaptive learning solution. The self-learning algorithm provides adaptable strategies to control the turntable, forearm, bicep, and wrist joints of the robotic arm. The performance of the adaptive learning solution is compared with those of Proportional–Integral–Derivative and high-order model-free adaptive control schemes to highlight its effectiveness.",

In addition to experiments utilizing nonlinear mathematical structures through five distinct classes of differential operators-smokers contemplating quitting, infrequent smokers, regular smokers, those who have temporarily abstained from smoking, and those who have permanently quit smoking the NSED framework has been established. By allocating 25% of the data for testing and validation and 75% for training, the proposed NNs-BRT can determine the estimated solutions of five different examples based on the numerical computation of the NSED system employing Adams techniques.

    "abstract": "Studying and modeling the process of the disease and spread of blast can guide fertilization and reduce the amount of pesticide application. Since most of the existing research focuses on the pathogenesis of the rice blast fungus and the interaction between the plant structure and the fungus, this paper presents a method to simulate the spread of rice blast among rice populations. The method is divided into the following processes. First, based on the cellular automata grid dynamics model, the cell state corresponds to the degree of infection of the rice blast fungus, and its ability to simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of complex systems is used to simulate the spread of disease spots on the surface of rice leaves. Second, according to the biological mechanism of the rice blast fungus and the position of the first infected leaf in a single rice plant, the normal distribution function is used to calculate the infection probability of the remaining leaves, and then the transmission mode of the disease inside a single rice plant is simulated. Then, in view of the natural phenomenon that the blast fungus spores spread with the wind, the wind factor is added to propose a method for the spread of the rice blast fungus among the population of rice plants, and thus a model for the spread of the pathogen among the entire plant population was established. Finally, we set up a simulation system for the spread of rice blasts in rice fields and visualized the spread and spread trend of rice blasts in rice populations. In the simulation experiment, the infection process of rice blast on the surface of the rice leaf was simulated, and the change process of the shape of the diseased spot can be visually seen. This paper not only provides a new idea for the research on pathogen propagation and diffusion between plants in agricultural production but also provides a reference for how to realistically visualize the pathogen propagation model in the virtual agricultural scene.",

In practical, the properties of important nodes could be different from network to network, and thus a variety of algorithms have been specially designed to identify important nodes of different networks and of different dynamics. In this paper we propose a widely applicable algorithm by employing the percolation model in statistical physics, which describes the behavior of connected clusters when nodes are connected randomly. This algorithm appropriately combines the local and global properties of a network, thus it stresses the significance of nodes that neither have a visibly local importance, such as degree and clustering, nor have a visibly global importance, such as betweenness. The effectiveness of our algorithm has been illustrated in a series of networks, including model networks with different degree distributions and different degree correlations, and empirical networks. As a shell decomposition process, the framework of our algorithm has extensive application prospects in analyzing network structure, such as community, core–periphery structure, and shell structures.",

The fundamental premise of this research is that the budget is not the sole criteria for real-world applications. This study challenges the conventional method to identify influential nodes, and proves that it requires specification of the stoppage criteria and the model used to quantify influence. We analyze the complex interplay of various criteria that can be used to solve IM problem, and prove that changing the criterion also changes the algorithm determined as the top performer. A number of criteria are presented in this paper apart from budget, such as the spread achieved by the algorithm (in terms of number of nodes influenced) and absolute time. The proposed IMine framework provides an interface to apply influence problem on various stoppage criteria, while also providing customization option to change the model of quantifying influence spread.",

These attacks have the potential to disrupt internet services and cause substantial financial and reputational concerns. The major challenge is developing an adaptable and real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can detect and neutralize DDoS attacks effectively and quickly, even when attackers use increasingly advanced ways to avoid detection. The problem concerns the development of a dynamic and real-time intrusion detection technique that combines the benefits of logistic regression for anomaly detection with GoogLeNet for deep learning-based network traffic analysis. This paper proposes a unique framework for intrusion detection that blends logistic regression-based anomaly detection with GoogLeNet deep learning capabilities. The combination of these technologies makes it easier to identify and mitigate DDoS attacks, hence improving the security of internet-based systems. The proposed IDS framework utility is proved through experimental evaluations, which highlight its capacity to effectively identify DDoS attacks while minimizing false positives. The use of this technology in real-time during security games demonstrates its potential to improve online service security infrastructure and reduce the impact of DDoS attacks on critical networks and data resources.",

Then, the MU model, the CPG model, and their coupling model are investigated to explain the biological phenomena. Within this work, it was found that there is consistency between the shape of states generated by the three MUs in this work and the experimental results in previous studies. When the MUs correspond to the parts in limbs, and the CPG connects to the MUs via synapses, the locomotion pattern can be adjusted by CPG to use the variable synaptic weights. Besides, the model with fractional order (FO) has better efficiency than the model with integer order.

These scanned objects are notably invested in a panoply of industries, such as mechanics, aeronautics, vehicle manufacturing, medicine, and art.

In this respect, this work introduces a novel method for reconstructing a CAD model through inserting new points into a given distorted mesh. Walton’s method is employed for accurate rebuilding so as to ensure a high level of accuracy in the fitted surfaces. B-Spline surfaces are estimated relying on the obtained 3D points, and then the geometric model is rebuilt. To assess the performance of the suggested approach, 3D surfaces are reconstructed, applying a 3D reconstruction algorithm to generate an accurate rebuilt model. The accuracy of the elaborated method is manifested through comparing the results of the geometric model reconstruction using the input mesh to those obtained after inserting new points.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion is one of the steps of knowledge graph construction. It aims to complete the incomplete triple data in the initially constructed knowledge graph and make the data in the knowledge graph more abundant and complete. At present, there are few studies on knowledge graph completion in the equipment field, and the attribute and relationship samples in the equipment knowledge graph are prone to uneven distribution, while the traditional knowledge graph completion method is difficult to solve the problem of uneven distribution of attribute and relationship samples. Therefore, this paper proposes an internal instance type completion method of equipment knowledge graph based on EP2TP-TRT. First, the TransE model is used to embed the relationship and attributes of the equipment instance, respectively. Then, the EP2TP model is used to map the instance attributes, and the TRT model is used to map the type relationship. Finally, the scores of the EP2TP and TRT models are integrated by designing different weights, and the training prediction is carried out to enhance the representation ability of instance information and type information. Compared with the mainstream advanced models, this method improves the MRR and HITS @ 1 indicators by about 0.89% and 2.1%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Big Data is a massive collection of data that require secure information transmission in the network. Hence, various existing Cryptography techniques have been used to improve information security in big data. However, the existing techniques cause data extrusion due to truncated transformation and diffusion properties in encryption and key generation processes that cause data leakage and loss. Hence, a novel Enhanced Encryption with Quantum-based Neuro Cryptography technique is introduced in which encryption is performed using logical shift and modulo operation based transformation that removes data extrusion and due to stream of photons in Quantum Cryptography Key has been generated and converted to the secret key via neuro cryptography. This process enhanced diffusion property and removed leakage and data loss. Moreover, malicious activities are happening due to inflexible encryption processes thus reducing confusion property that leads to delay and attack on nonresistance. Hence, a novel Inherited process with cyclic crossover operation has been developed in which one-point cyclic crossover and bit string mutation are achieved to combine ciphertext and key that increase confusion property and eliminate timing attack. The proposed system increases throughput and reduces encryption and decryption time with high diffusion and confusion properties.",

    "abstract": "The cloud-based gaming services have given rise to an abundance of fresh worries around data protection and safety. The present cloud gaming security solutions suffer from a key issue in that they do not include a comprehensive framework. This framework would take into consideration the dynamic and interactive nature of the data center environment. When trying to mitigate risks in today’s continuously moving cyber threat scenario, it is imperative to consider all relevant factors, including the health of the system, individual costs, and potential advantages. The existing works address about how game theory might be used to improve the safety of cloud-based gaming. The purpose of this research is to overcome the research gap by developing a novel model that captures the multiple linkages between security measures and potential attacks, supplying a more holistic perspective on cloud gaming security in the process. In this line of investigation, a Noncooperative Game-Theoretic Model is used to investigate the dynamics of predators and prey. In this research, a Noncooperative Game-Theoretic Model is presented with the purpose of analysing and perfecting security measures inside the dynamic data-center environment of cloud gaming. Precautionary safety measures take on the role of a predator, while potential threats take on the role of prey. The results prove that the Noncooperative Game-Theoretic Model is an effective tool for enhancing safeguards in cloud-based online gaming environments.",

To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Chinese traditional painting style automatic classification model based on dual-channel feature fusion with multi-attention mechanism. First, the spatial attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the Swin-Transformer framework to obtain the salient features of Chinese ancient painting images. Second, a dual-channel attention mechanism is constructed to extract global semantic features and local features of Chinese ancient painting images. Finally, the extracted features are fused and categorized based on the softmax classifier. To verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed model, this paper performs simulations on the Chinese painting dataset and compares it with existing algorithms.The average classification accuracy of the proposed model is 90.6[Formula: see text], with an improvement of 3.14[Formula: see text], which is better than the existing model in both visual effects and objective data comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Interactive scientific visualization applications have been more and more used to observe, analyze and understand the complex phenomena studied in several scientific disciplines such as (nano-sciences, fluid simulations, etc.). To facilitate the coupling of the different computation, visualization and exploration codes, which are often heterogeneous and difficult to cooperate, scientists must be able to use and reuse the different parts of the applications already built in order to interchange and enrich certain parts without being experts. In this context, a middleware called FlowVR has been developed by the scientific community leading to make applications divided into set of components exchanging messages. Moreover, this middleware enables to encapsulate existing codes in components, interconnect them via data links, and deploy them on distributed computing resources. Nevertheless, FlowVR does not offer any capability to check the functional correctness of new developed component-based applications. This paper presents a framework called Model and Component-based framework for Scientific Applications (MCSA) based on a interplay of model-driven and component-based software engineering. On the one hand, we provide a domain specific language dedicated to physics/chemistry scientists in order to built their MCSA applications. This language also allows to capitalize efforts by proposing existing components that have been already developed. On the other hand, we propose a model transformation to check the correctness of instantiated models, for this, we use a new subclass of Petri net called strict Colored FIFO Nets (sCFN). Our approach has been backed by a case study relies on a molecular dynamics application.",

This numerical study aims to deepen our understanding of the combustion dynamics of an H 2 /N 2 mixture within a turbulent diffusion flame. To achieve this, the mixture is injected into a co-flow of hot air, allowing for the simulation of real conditions. The selected mixture model is the Interaction by Exchange with the Mean (IEM). For the Eulerian approach, the number of environments is set to (2,0). In this study, the model was solved using the commercial CFD software, ANSYS Fluent, and the chemical reaction mechanism employed for H 2 comprises of 37 reactions involving 13 distinct species.

The ability of machine learning to foretell the severity of road traffic accidents has shown great promise. The classification of traffic accidents has shown to be a good application for algorithms like random forest. In this paper, performance on a specific dataset has been evaluated using random forest and other models. The dataset used for the analysis came from a publicly accessible source and contained information on several variables like the type of road, the time of day, and the weather. In order to analyze the severity of accidents, a number of algorithms were applied to the dataset, including decision tree, random forest classifier, and logistic regression algorithm. Each model was evaluated on parameters such as model accuracy, precision and recall of the model, and F1 score. The random forest classifier outperformed the other models, achieving an accuracy of 98.48%. The study concludes that machine learning algorithms can accurately predict the severity of road traffic accidents, which could help to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on the road.",

To address these problems, we propose a real-time algorithm based on deep learning, which can simultaneously perform image spatial correction and deblurring in the same network, known as [Formula: see text]. First, a 15-layer depthwise separable convolutional neural network is designed as the basic network for high-speed image deblurring, and four spatial transformer network (STN) modules are integrated into the basic network to achieve image spatial correction capability. Second, the network is divided into three dense blocks, in which dense residual connections are used to improve the PSNR. Finally, a bottleneck structure is created to improve the real-time performance of image reconstruction that can simultaneously perform image space correction and deblurring. The test results on the CCPD dataset demonstrate that the [Formula: see text] algorithm is advanced, with PSNR reaching 30.14[Formula: see text]dB, SSIM reaching 0.911, and image reconstruction only 0.12[Formula: see text]s. The correction and deblurring modules can promote each other, jointly improving the image reconstruction ability of the network, that is, the network achieves more advanced image reconstruction performance while maintaining high real-time performance.",

Further, the reproductive number is determined for the model’s biological feasibility with an analysis of parameter impact through Matlab software. The solutions are examined for global stability using the Lyapunov function with a first derivative.

    "abstract": "The traditional A-Star algorithm has the problem of performing much invalid traversal work of nodes near concave obstacles when dealing with path planning tasks in the presence of concave obstacles. To solve this problem, a fusion algorithm (called IAPF-A-Star here) based on improved artificial potential field (IAPF) and A-Star is proposed. In IAPF-A-Star, to better measure the distances between the nodes and the target node, the potential energy of the artificial potential field is used to represent the node’s proximity to the target node, and an iterative correction method is used to improve the potential field in order to eliminate the local low-potential energy that may exist in the artificial potential field. The improved potential field effectively avoids the occurrence of local low-potential fields and makes it possible to measure the position of nodes in relation to their target node by means of the potential field. Finally, the obtained path is converted to a curve path by using a cubic spline curve. In addition, to solve the problem that the curve path generated by the cubic spline curve may collide with obstacles, a path optimization strategy based on an adaptive cubic spline curve is proposed to make the final path smooth and collision avoidance, shorter and closer to the actual situation. Simulation experiments show that the proposed IAPF-A-Star algorithm in this paper can effectively avoid the problem of additional local energy consumption caused by concave obstacles when processing path planning tasks, and the traversal of invalid nodes facing different complex concave obstacles is effectively avoided.",

    "abstract": "In the new generation of power grids, the smart grid (SG) integrates sophisticated characteristics, including situation awareness, two-way communication, and distributed energy supplies. Integrated SG uses various operational metrics, including devices with sensors, meters, and renewable power sources. There are several challenges when securely disposing and storing electricity data acquired from an SG. It is vulnerable to cyberattacks due to its digitization and integration of an increasing number of links. Issues with latency, security, privacy, and excessive bandwidth consumption will arise when this enormous amount of data is transmitted directly to the cloud. Edge computing (EC) solves this problem by moving data processing to the network’s periphery, close to the embedded devices. With improved data processing speeds, a more responsive and resilient grid may be achieved, instantly responding to energy demand and supply changes. EC reduces the volume of sensitive data sent to central servers, reducing potential security breaches. Data may be better protected from intrusions by being analyzed locally and only pertinent information transferred to the cloud. Thus, a blockchain is an intriguing SG paradigm solution with many benefits. The SG’s decentralization and improved cybersecurity have prompted a lot of work into using blockchain technology; since it is well-known that data saved in the blockchain is immutable, it is crucial to find foolproof ways to verify data are accurate and comply with high-quality standards before storing it in the blockchain. A practical solution for storing precise power data that enables the safe execution of adaptable transactions is a Cloud-Edge Fusion Blockchain model for the smart grid (CEFBM-SG). Consequently, the SG’s dependability, resilience, and scalability will be improved as the number of distributed energy sources (DERs) connected to it increases. Utilizing the idea of computing at the edge to enhance responsiveness and dependability. Executed security analyses and performance evaluations demonstrate CEFBM-SG’s exceptional security and efficiency.",

The variable spiral search strategy which includes spiral search and skip search can improve the global exploration capability and reduce the probability of the algorithm falling into local optima. The optimal solution mutation strategy can increase the diversity of population. To evaluate the performance of VOAEFA, it is compared with AEFA algorithms and other algorithms on 57 benchmark functions and three engineering design problems. The comparison results on benchmark functions indicate that VOAEFA is superior to its competitors. In addition, VOAEFA has the advantage of high accuracy in solving challenging problems.",

    "abstract": "In the era of Industry 4.0, 3D printing has shown significant outcomes. To address the challenges of large-format complex material printing and forming, such as spatial constraints and excessive support structures in traditional 3D printing, the integration of industrial robots with 3D printing technology is proposed. However, robotic 3D printing introduces challenges in path planning and real-time optimization. This paper presents a methodology for path planning and real-time optimization of robotic arms on a 3D printing platform. The approach involves adjusting the printing path by modifying the nozzle printing posture and implementing obstacle avoidance algorithms. The study uses geometric and algebraic methods to optimize the robotic arm trajectory to improve the precision of reaching print points, reduce the printing cycle, and minimize material wastage. To verify the feasibility of this method, a case study in 3D printing is conducted to examine the practical application of motion planning for robotic arms based on digital twin technology.",

Fearon and D. D. Laitin (Explaining Interethnic Cooperation, American Political Science Review, Vol. 90 (1996), pp. 715-735), where the iterated prisoner's dilemma was used to model intra- and interethnic interactions. We reformulated their approach in a form of evolutionary prisoner's dilemma method, where a population of strategies is evolved by applying simple reproduction process with a Darwin metaphor of natural selection (a probability of selection to the reproduction is proportional to a fitness). Our computer simulations show that an application of a principle of collective guilt does not lead to an emergence of an interethnic cooperation. When an administrator is introduced, then an emergence of interethnic cooperation may be observed. Furthermore, if the ethnic groups are of very different sizes, then the principle of collective guilt may be very devastating for smaller group so that intraethnic cooperation is destroyed. The second strategy of cooperation is called the personal responsibility, where agents that defected within interecthinic interactions are punished inside of their ethnic groups. It means, unlikely to the principle of collective guilt, that there exists only one type of punishment, loosely speaking, agents are punished \"personally\". All the substantial computational results were checked and interpreted analytically within the theory of evolutionary stable strategies. Moreover, this theoretical approach offers mechanisms of simple scenarios explaining why some particular strategies are stable or not.",

Current distillations do not utilize machine-learning techniques to model the cognitive abilities of individual combatants but employ agent control paradigms to represent agents as highly instinctual entities. For a team of agents implementing a reinforcement-learning paradigm, the rate of learning is not sufficient for agents to adapt to this hostile environment. However, by allowing the agents to communicate their respective rewards for actions performed as the simulation progresses, the rate of learning can be increased sufficiently to significantly increase the teams chances of survival.

It is assumed that the dynamics of M is govern by the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation (LLGE). We also consider an effective field that includes in-plane uniaxial, H U , and shape anisotropy fields, H D . We show that, in the particular case of uniformly translating profiles, this equation reduces to a damped-forced Duffing's equation, with a family of solutions that describe periodic oscillating (PO), damped oscillating (DO) or exponential front profiles (EF). Of particular interest is the existence of a critical speed, v 0 , below which there are no stable states for the magnetization. When the velocity of the profile exactly equals v osc , the only stable states are the PO profiles. Above v osc , there is an asymptotic speed, v*, that separates the DO profiles from EF profiles. This velocity (v*) is connected with the existence of a non-linear marginal stability point for front propagation. Both v 0 and v* depend on the applied field and on the anisotropy constants of the material. A stability diagram for front propagation and magnetization curves are also calculated.",

    "abstract": "The elastic properties of granular materials can be enormously nonlinear as compared with the properties of non-porous materials. Experiments on isotropic compression of a granular assembly of spheres show that the shear μ, and bulk k, moduli vary with the confining pressure faster than the 1/3 power law predicted by Hertz–Mindlin elasticity theory. Moreover, the ratio between the experimental bulk and shear moduli is found to be constant but with a value larger than the theoretical prediction. Numerical simulations resolve the question as to whether the problem lies with the treatment of the grain-grain contact or with the elastic framework. We find that the problem lies principally with the latter; the affine assumption (which underlies the elastic formulation) is found to be valid for k but to breakdown seriously for μ. This explains why the experimental and numerical values of μ(p) are much smaller than the elastic predictions. In this paper we review recent progress on the understanding of this problem based on microscopic simulations, elasticity theory and more innovative ideas such as jamming, fragility and thermodynamics of granular materials.",

When unperturbed, the system undergoes a single spin flip falling dynamics where only energy lowering moves occur. With this dynamics the system has an exponentially large number of metastable states and gets stuck in blocked or jammed configurations as do granular media. When stuck, the system is tapped, in order to make it evolve, by flipping in parallel each spin with probability p (corresponding to the strength of the tapping). Under this dynamics the system reaches a steady state regime characterized by an asymptotic energy per spin E(p), which is determined analytically. Within the steady state regime we compare certain time averaged quantities with the ensemble average of Edwards based on a canonical measure over metastable states of fixed average energy. The ensemble average yields results in excellent agreement with the dynamical measurements.",

The converter represents a multilayer structure consisting of an ultra thin resonant metamaterial absorber and a perfect emissive layer. The absorber consists of a dielectric self-supporting film that is metallized from both sides. A micro-pattern is fabricated from one side. Resonant absorption of the MM waves induces the converter heating that yields enhancement of IR emission from the emissive layer. IR emission is detected by IR camera. In this contribution an accurate numerical model for simulation of the thermal processes in the converter structure was created by using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The simulation results are in a good agreement with experimental results that validates the model. The simulation shows that the real-time operation is provided for the converter thickness less than 3 μm and time response can be improved by decreasing of the converter thickness. The energy conversion efficiency of MM waves into IR radiation is over 80%. The converter temperature increase is a linear function of a MM-wave radiation power within three orders of the dynamic range. The blooming effect and ways of its reducing are also discussed. The model allows us to choose the ways of converter structure optimization and improvement of image detector parameters.",

    "abstract": "A finite element model for piezoelectric smart beam in extension mode based on First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with an appropriate through-thickness distribution of electric potential is presented. Accuracy of piezoelectric finite element formulations depends on the selection of assumed mechanical and electrical fields. Most of the conventional FSDT-based piezoelectric beam formulations available in the literature use linear through-thickness distribution of electric potential which is actually nonlinear. Here, a novel quadratic profile of the through-thickness electric potential is proposed to include the nonlinear effects. The results obtained show that the accuracy of conventional formulations with linear through-thickness potential approximation is affected by the material configuration, especially when the piezoelectric material dominates the beam cross section. It is shown that the present formulation gives the same level of accuracy for all regimes of material configurations in the beam cross section. Also, a modified form of the FSDT displacements is employed, which utilizes the shear angle as a degree of freedom instead of section rotation. Such a FSDT displacement field shows improved performance compared to the conventional field. The present formulation is validated by comparing the results with ANSYS 2D simulation. The comparison of results proves the improved efficiency and accuracy of the present formulation over the conventional formulations.",

However, BFO shows poor performance on complex and high-dimensional optimization problems. In order to improve the performance of BFO, a new dynamic bacterial foraging optimization based on clonal selection (DBFO-CS) is proposed. Instead of fixed step size in the chemotaxis operator, a new piecewise strategy adjusts the step size dynamically by regulatory factor in order to balance between exploration and exploitation during optimization process, which can improve convergence speed. Furthermore, reproduction operator based on clonal selection can add excellent genes to bacterial populations in order to improve bacterial natural selection and help good individuals to be protected, which can enhance convergence precision. Then, a set of benchmark functions have been used to test the proposed algorithm. The results show that DBFO-CS offers significant improvements than BFO on convergence, accuracy and robustness. A complex optimization problem of model reduction on stable and unstable linear systems based on DBFO-CS is presented. Results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently approximate the systems.",

The outer-loop sliding mode controller (SMC) is designed in order to deal with the impacts from the remainder equivalent disturbances, which is due to the inadequate estimation of the inner-loop DOB. Meanwhile, the existence of DOB can reduce the switching gain of SMC law, which can suppress the high-frequency chattering of control input to a certain extent. Moreover, an approximate differential method is employed in order to reliably acquire the differential information in a noisy environment. From the experiment results on a DC motor servo system, it is presented that the proposed dual-loop control scheme can effectively improve the tracking performances with respect to higher tracking accuracy and stronger system robustness against external disturbances and parameter perturbations, compared with the traditional DOB+PD control scheme.",

NCS is mainly completed by the construction of the simulation task community (STC), the key to which being the dynamic integration of the various services spread in the network in order to form a new STC that meets the requirements of different users. In this study, a simulation task community service selection algorithm (STCSSA) is proposed. The main idea of this algorithm is to transform the construction of STC to the searching of optimal multi-objectives services with QoS global constraints. This paper first introduces the QoS model of STC and evaluates the service composition process, then presents the detailed operating process of STCSSA and design of the dynamic inertia weight strategy of the algorithm, and also proposes an optional variation method. Comparative tests were performed on STCSSA with other particle swarm optimization algorithms. It was validated from the perspective of performance that the proposed algorithm has advantages in improving the rate of convergence and avoiding local optimum, and from the perspective of practical application STCSSA also demonstrated feasibility in the construction of large-scale NCS task community.",

However, for an embedded software, the latency depends upon the hardware heavily. To illuminate the feature clearly, we extend the atomic model of component-based software first. A way to specify the flows involved is further developed to identify the end-to-end latency. What is more, a novel methodology that bridges the gap between a constraint on latency and an execution platform is proposed for the embedded software. By constructing a hierarchical architecture, it is available to consider the methodology as a decision problem where the satisfiability module theory (SMT) can be applied. Experimental results demonstrate how the latency analysis conducts with the proposed model and methodology for the complex software architecture.",

In particular, we show that a lice colony infesting a single isolated host is prone to extinction by stochastic population fluctuations within an interval of several months, while migration over a relatively small group of hosts in contact with each other is enough to insure the prevalence of the infestation for indefinitely long periods. We characterize the interplay of the size of the host group with the host-to-host contagion probability, which controls a transition between extinction of the lice population and a situation where the infestation is endemic.",

The difference in indoor and outdoor temperatures will lead to the refrigerant phase-change, and the gravity difference caused by different heights of condenser and evaporator will make the low boiling point refrigerants carry on natural circulation to realize the indoor heating or cooling. In order to analyze the effect of changes in the RNC system upon the working conditions of the indoor and outdoor units as well as the function of the indoor unit, this paper describes the incidence relations among the various components of the RNC system, and establishes gas–liquid two-phase fluid network mathematical model by using the method of fluid network; besides utilizing the model, it also conducts simulator investigation of coupling characteristics of the RNC system's refrigeration condition, and makes an analysis of indoor temperature, indoor unit's air volume, the number of indoor units and the indoor unit capacity and other factors' changes on the coupling characteristics of the RNC system. The results show that under refrigeration conditions, the increase in the air volume of a single indoor unit or room temperature will result in an increase in the cooling capacity of its own indoor units, a decrease in the cooling capacity of other indoor units and a reduction in the total cooling capacity of indoor units of the RNC system; however, the decrease in the outdoor units' inlet temperature will lead to a drop in the evaporation temperature of the system and increase in the cooling capacity.",

First, through benchmark experiments, the computation ability and routing simulation ability of each simulation machine are measured in the heterogeneous computing environment. Second, based on the computation ability of each simulation machine, the network simulation task is initially partitioned to meet the load balance of packet forwarding simulation in the heterogeneous computing environment, and then according to the routing computation ability, the scale of each partition is fine-tuned to satisfy the balance of the routing computing simulation, meanwhile the load balance of packet forwarding simulation is guaranteed. Experiments based on PDNS indicate that, compared to traditional uniform partition method, the LBPHCE method can reduce the total simulation running time by 26.3% in average, and compared to the liner partition method, it can reduce the running time by 18.3% in average.",

Finally, the forwarding model and scoring policy have been applied to a real short message record dataset from some telecom operator.

Agents differ by their behavior, knowledge, risk aversion and investment horizon. The investor’s demand is defined by a utility maximization under constant absolute risk aversion (CARA). Relaxing the assumption of perfect knowledge of fundamentals enables to identify two components in a bubble. The first one comes from the unperceived fundamental changes due to trader’s belief perseverance. The second one is generated by chartist behavior. In all simulations, speculators make the market less efficient and more volatile. They also increase the maximum amount of assets exchanged in the most liquid time step. However, our model does not show rising average volatility on long term. Concerning the fundamentalists, the belief perseverance has a stabilization impact on the spot price. The closer the anchor is to the true fundamental value, the more efficient the market is, because the prices change smoothly.",

Therefore, the confidence interval for a time averaged measure having autocorrelation structure can also be calculated by the bootstrap methods.

Furthermore, we analyze the distribution of areas of noncommunity residential buildings and residence-use proportions of community zones by Nonlinear Regression. Results indicate that areas of noncommunity residential buildings in Beijing obey the log-normal distribution and residence-use proportions of community zones obey normal distribution.

These simulations have been carried out for a special case of geometries called Tikhonov fitted geometries for alleviating the instability phenomenon commonly known as onset phenomenon in self-field MPD thrusters. The work was also extended to applied field MPD thrusters. A new equation for magnetic field was introduced to incorporate a virtual cathode.

    "abstract": "A fluid jet ejected from micron size nozzle is a commonly occurring phenomenon in biomedical engineering, printing technology and micro-fluidic applications. Disintegration of a jet into drops occurs due to disturbances induced by external sources. This work explores the various sources of perturbation and their effect on jet disintegration through numerical simulation of a two-dimensional non-isothermal model. The mathematical approach uses a novel technique to combine analytical solutions for the energy balance equation in the radial direction to solve the complete two dimensional problem. The two dimensional energy balance equation is simultaneously solved together with the axi-symmetric Navier–Stokes equations using the slender-jet approximation to predict jet velocity. The energy balance takes into account of peripheral heat transfer to the environment through analytical expressions derived from radial approximations. The model helps in understanding the factors in dynamic temperature variations that eventually render the jet unstable. The distinguishing aspect of this work is the analysis of the effect of a periodic thermal perturbation applied at any point in the domain of a progressive jet, a situation typically encountered in thermal inkjet printers and not considered previously. Results presented for non-isothermal jets which are both stationary and moving illustrate the effect of jet velocity in propagation of perturbation and subsequent drop formation. The major contribution of this numerical study is that it provides an insight on novel ways of controlling droplet formation in bubble jet printers. This study demonstrates that thermal disturbance propagating from periodic heating can be manipulated to shape the droplets and control their breakage point along the jet.",

    "abstract": "In advanced gas turbine technology, lean premixed combustion is an effective strategy to reduce peak temperature and thus, NO[Formula: see text] emissions. The swirler is adopted to establish recirculation flow zone, enhancing mixing and stabilizing the flame. Therefore, the swirling flow is dominant in the combustor flow field and has impact on the vane. This paper mainly investigates the swirling flow effect on the turbine first stage vane cooling system by conducting a group of numerical simulations. Firstly, the numerical methods of turbulence modeling using RANS and LES are compared. The computational model of one single swirl flow field is considered. Both the RANS and LES results give reasonable recirculation zone shape. When comparing the velocity distribution, the RANS results generally match the experimental data but fail to at some local area. The LES modeling gives better results and more detailed unsteady flow field. In the second step, the RANS modeling is incorporated to investigate the vane film cooling performance under the swirling inflow boundary condition. According to the numerical results, the leading edge film cooling is largely altered by the swirling flow, especially for the swirl core-leading edge aligned case. Compared to the pressure side, the suction side film cooling is more sensitive to the swirling flow. Locally, the film cooling jet is lifted and turned by the strong swirling flow.",

When the measured admittances are low, the accuracy of the diagonal admittance vectors in the low frequency band is low as well. However, the accuracy at low frequencies obtained using the indirect measurements is improved at nodes with the lowest admittances.

In this study, a joint interception probability evaluation model on RF stealth performance was established, which divided the interception process into two parts: front interception and system interception. Various RF stealth means adopted by different radar equipment were taken into consideration to improve the applicability of this model. Simulation results show that this model is able to effectively characterize almost all the aspects of the RF stealth features and can serve as a good reference to evaluate RF radar stealth performance comprehensively.",

Based on above analysis, we propose a constrained immune memory and immunodominance clone (CIMIC) TVM placement optimization algorithm. By reverse optimization of the initial antibody population, the searching range is reduced. The common antibody population and the immunodominance antibody population evolve simultaneously, which realizes the simultaneous progressing of global searching and local searching of solutions. Further, local optimal is avoided by this means. Memory antibody makes ful use of the unfeasible solutions and the diversity of antibody population is maintained. The constraint information of the problem is utilized to improve the optimization effect.

Theoretical approximations are made over a model based on the standard Newtonian theory.

Interestingly, the incremental higher nose bluntness, semi-vertex angle and center of rotation reduce the dynamic stability. At higher hypersonic Mach numbers [Formula: see text], dynamic stability characteristics of the re-entry module are insensitive to the free stream Mach number.

Of great interest for real social and biological systems are cases in which the payoffs to members of the minority group depend on the size of the minority group. This latter includes the fixed sum game. We find, remarkably, that the phase structure and general scaling behavior of the standard minority game persists when the payoff function depends on the size of the minority group. There is still a phase transition at the same value of z, the ratio of the dimension of the strategy space to the number of agents playing the game. We explain the persistence of the phase structure and argue that it is due to the absence of temporal cooperation in the dynamics of the minority game. We also discuss the behavior of average agent wealth and the wealth distribution in these variable payoff games.",

Knowledge is modeled as a structure, which is expanding through agents' creation behaviors, and becomes \"locally\" available to other agents once it is disclosed. An agent taken randomly at each period of the discrete time is choosing between the acquisition of an accessible piece of knowledge and the creation of one. Knowledge value being a decreasing function of the number of agents sharing it, a higher (exogenous and tunable) rate of disclosure decreases the incentives to create (in increasing the diffusion speed). Using simulations, we show that there is, for each set of values of the different parameters, a non null optimal rate of disclosure (maximizing the collective performances of the set of agents) and discuss the effect of some of the structural parameters on it.",

Based on this part feeding policy, vehicles perform their assigned routes cyclically and provide stations with the exact quantity of parts required until the next arrival of the vehicle. However, if there are uncertain travel times, a shortage of materials in stations will be caused. In this paper, the JIT part feeding optimization problem under travel time uncertainty is studied. The uncertain travel time is represented by the interval number according to the actual situation. To minimize the largest possible vehicle trip time, the optimization model is developed based on robust optimization. In the model, a route-dependent uncertain parameter is introduced. Through this model, the route of each vehicle and the parts load needed to be delivered by the vehicle can be calculated. A hybrid simulated annealing algorithm is designed to solve this model. The parts feeding planning for an engine assembly line is taken as an example. By the Monte Carlo simulation, the relationship between the line stoppage probability and the uncertain parameter is studied to obtain the final solution. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by this case study.",

A cloud environment is developed to support a wide range of users that request the cloud resources in a dynamic environment with possible constraints. Burstiness in users service requests causes drastic and unpredictable increases in the resource requests that have a crucial impact on policies of resource allocation. How can the cloud system efficiently handle such burstiness when the cloud resources are limited? This problem becomes a hot issue in the MCC research area. In this paper, we develop a system model for the resource allocation based on the Semi-Markovian Decision Process (SMDP), able of dynamically assigning the mobile service requests to a set of cloud resources, to optimize the usage of cloud resources and maximize the total long-term expected system reward when the arrival process is a finite-state Markov-Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). Numerical results show that our proposed model performs much better than the Greedy algorithm in terms of achieving higher system rewards and lower service requests blocking probabilities, especially when the burstiness degree is high, and the cloud resources are limited.",

The nontrivial solution of the autonomous model is locally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text]. It is shown that a unique endemic equilibrium point of the autonomous model exists when [Formula: see text] and proved that endemic solution is linearly stable when [Formula: see text]. The nonautonomous model is shown to have a nontrivial disease-free periodic state, which is globally asymptotically stable whenever temperature-dependent reproduction number is less than unity. It is observed that a unique positive endemic periodic solution of the nonautonomous system exists only when a temperature-dependent reproduction number greater than unity, which makes for the persistence of the disease. Numerical simulation has been carried out to support the analytical results and shows the effects of temperature variability in the life span of mosquitoes as well as the persistence of the disease.",

In the population with only local random movement, whether the epidemic information is delayed or not has no effect on the spread of the epidemic. People’s high sensitivity to the epidemic information leads to their risk aversion behavior and the spread of the epidemic is suppressed. In the population with only global person-to-person movement, timely and accurate epidemic information helps an individual cut off the connections with the infected in time and the epidemic is brought under control in no time. A delay in the epidemic information leads to an individual’s misjudgment of who has been infected and who has not, which in turn leads to rapid progress and a higher peak of the epidemic. In the population with coexistence of local and global movement, timely and accurate epidemic information and people’s high sensitivity to the epidemic information play an important role in curbing the epidemic. A theoretical analysis indicates that people’s misjudgment caused by the delayed epidemic information leads to a higher encounter probability between the susceptible and the infected and people’s self-restricted travel behavior helps reduce such an encounter probability. A functional relation between the ratio of infected individuals and the susceptible-infected encounter probability has been found.",

The imbalance comes despite the fact that, the proportion of women publishing impactful papers has increased over the last couple of decades. Here, we explore the potential gender differences in collaboration dynamics of leading academics in Computer Science and contrast it with other researchers in the same discipline. This work aims to demonstrate that productivity patterns differ between men and women; understanding such patterns is fundamental to improving the current situation by driving well-thought interventions. We start by looking at topological features of academics ego-networks and their variability over their career lifespan; we found that women have a higher rate of repeated collaborators, while men have slightly more new collaborators. Second, we show gender differences in the acquisition patterns and maintenance of collaborations over the researchers’ careers. Third, we look at alters’ gender composition and gender role in introducing new collaborations to researchers and found that women are more homophilic than men and that the gender of the person being introduced (alter) tends to match the gender of the ego (the researcher). Last, we show that women reach their highest productivity levels earlier in their careers than men, but the levels attained are not at the same magnitude as men. Our work highlights the importance of studying gender differences by productivity levels, the role of gender-mixed groups in academia and the relation to academic production within these groups. This work contributes to a better understanding of gender roles in Computer Science and points to ways that can help reduce possible gaps.",

The implant-bone system was established and subjected to a load from the head of the femur and abductor muscle sides. The stresses and strains in the implant-bone systems were calculated and compared. The results revealed lower stresses and strains in composite prostheses compared to SS ones. The fiber ply orientation of the carbon/PEEK composite prosthesis is shown to be a key asset in stress and strain distribution of the 13 implant-bone systems. The fiber plies which orientated multidirectionally with −45 and +45 degrees exhibited uniform stress and strain distributions. The results suggested the advantage of using composite prostheses in implant designs as they not only invoke lower stresses and strains in the implant-bone system but also amplify the life span of implants in the body.",

We consider three problems in this paper: (1) selecting the minimum number of leaders in a pre-defined network with guaranteed network controllability; (2) selecting the leaders in a pre-defined network with the minimum control energy; and (3) assigning edges (interactions) between nodes to form a controllable leader–follower network with the minimum control energy. The proposed framework can be applied in designing signed, unsigned, directed, or undirected networks. It should be noted that this work is the first to apply memetic algorithms in the design of controllable networks. We chose memetic algorithms because they have been shown to be more efficient and more effective than the standard genetic algorithms in solving some optimization problems.

    "abstract": "Background: CAR-T cells are chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells; they are target-specific engineered cells on tumor cells and produce T cell-mediated antitumor responses. CAR-T cell therapy is the “first-line” therapy in immunotherapy for the treatment of highly clonal neoplasms such as lymphoma and leukemia. This adoptive therapy is currently being studied and tested even in the case of solid tumors such as osteosarcoma since, precisely for this type of tumor, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors remained disappointing. Although CAR-T is a promising therapeutic technique, there are therapeutic limits linked to the persistence of these cells and to the tumor’s immune escape. CAR-T cell engineering techniques are allowed to express interleukin IL-36, and seem to be much more efficient in antitumoral action. IL-36 is involved in the long-term antitumor action, allowing CAR-T cells to be more efficient in their antitumor action due to a “cross-talk” action between the “IL-36/dendritic cells” axis and the adaptive immunity. Methods: This analysis makes the model useful for evaluating cell dynamics in the case of tumor relapses or specific understanding of the action of CAR-T cells in certain types of tumor. The model proposed here seeks to quantify the action and interaction between the three fundamental elements of this antitumor activity induced by this type of adoptive immunotherapy: IL-36, “armored” CAR-T cells (i.e., engineered to produce IL-36) and the tumor cell population, focusing exclusively on the action of this interleukin and on the antitumor consequences of the so modified CAR-T cells. Mathematical model was developed and numerical simulations were carried out during this research. The development of the model with stability analysis by conditions of Routh–Hurwitz shows how IL-36 makes CAR-T cells more efficient and persistent over time and more effective in the antitumoral treatment, making therapy more effective against the “solid tumor”. Findings: Primary malignant bone tumors are quite rare (about 3% of all tumors) and the vast majority consist of osteosarcomas and Ewing’s sarcoma and, approximately, the 20% of patients undergo metastasis situations that is the most likely cause of death. Interpretation: In bone tumor like osteosarcoma, there is a variation of the cellular mechanical characteristics that can influence the efficacy of chemotherapy and increase the metastatic capacity; an approach related to adoptive immunotherapy with CAR-T cells may be a possible solution because this type of therapy is not influenced by the biomechanics of cancer cells which show peculiar characteristics.",

The performance predictor, including accuracy and reminder, is used to establish how well the device satisfies consumer requirements. The effectiveness of the indexing and retrieval is calculated by contrasting a typical collection of queries and documents with the efficacy, functionality, and systemic approach. Important evaluations are used to measure functionality, performance (precession and retraction), compilation, and interface assessments. Document and query indexing, query assessment, and system assessment are key issues in information retrieval. This paper uses the human–computer interaction based on the intelligent information retrieval method (HCI-IRM). The proposed method concentrates on customer satisfaction, the main success assessment metric. It identifies the collection of related records at a given time within the collection. An information retrieval system’s main objective is to obtain the information. It is either the actual information or the documents containing the information substitutes which completely or partly correspond to the customer’s query evaluation. The extraction and recruitment of knowledge-based data from a database are usually related to the retrieval of information. The retrieval and precise technology are used to assess the efficiency of the data recovery system framework. As a result, HCI-IRM enhances the response time, and the relevance of the outcomes is key to customer satisfaction.

The model is based on classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Basic properties regarding positivity, boundedness and non-negative solutions are discussed. Basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the system has been calculated using next-generation matrix method and it is seen that the disease-free equilibrium is locally as well as globally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text], otherwise unstable. The existence of endemic equilibrium point is established using the Lambert W function. The condition for global stability has been derived. Numerical simulation suggests that fractional order and media have a large effect on our system dynamics. When media impact is stronger enough, our fractional-order system stabilizes the oscillation.",

    "abstract": "Recommendation systems are shrewd applications for knowledge mining that profoundly handle the problem of data overload. Various literature explores different philosophies to create ideas and recommends different strategies according to the needs of customers. Most of the work in the suggested structure space focuses on extending the accuracy of the recommendation by using a few possible methods where the principle purpose remains to improve the accuracy of suggestions while avoiding other plan objectives, such as the particular situation of a client. By using appropriate customer rating data, the biggest test for a suggested system is to generate substantial proposals. A setting is an enormous concept that can think of numerous points of view: for example, the community of friends of a client, time, mindset, environment, organization, type of day, classification of an item, description of the object, place, and language. The rating behavior of customers typically varies in different environments. We have proposed a new review-based contextual recommender (RBCR) system application from this line of analysis, in particular a novel recommender system, which is an adaptable, quick, and accurate piece planning framework that perceives the significance of setting and fuses the logical data using piece stunt while making expectations. We have contrasted our suggested calculation with pre- and post-sifting methods as they have been the most common methodologies in writing to illuminate the issue of setting conscious suggestion. Our studies show that considering the logical data, the display of a system will increase and provide better, appropriate and important results on various evaluation measurements.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have recently been applied to Uncoded Space-Time Labeling Diversity (USTLD) systems to produce labeling diversity mappers. However, the most challenging task is choosing the best parameter setting for the EA to create a more ‘optimal’ mapper design. This paper proposes a ‘meta-Genetic Algorithm (GA)’ used to tune hyperparameters for the Labeling Diversity EA. The algorithm is examined on 16, 32 and 64QAM; 32 and 64PSK; 16, 32 and 64APSK and 16APSK constellations that do not show diagonal symmetry. Furthermore, the meta-GA settings and original GA settings are compared in terms of the number of generations taken to converge to a solution. For QAM constellations, the output using the meta-GA settings matched but did not improve with the original settings. However, the number of generations needed to converge to a solution took 120 times less than the number of generations using the original settings. In the 64PSK constellation, a diversity gain of [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]dB was observed while improving on the actual fitness value from 0.0575 to 0.0661. Similarly, with 32APSK constellation, an improvement in fitness value from 0.1457 to 0.1748 was made while showing diversity gains of [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]dB. 64APSK constellation fitness value improved from 0.0708 to 0.0957, and a [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]dB gain was observed. The most significant improvement was made by the asymmetric 16APSK constellation, with gains of [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]dB and increasing its fitness value three times (0.0981 to 0.3000). A study of the effects of optimizing the GA parameters shows that the number of swaps during crossover [Formula: see text] and the radius [Formula: see text] were the two most important variables to optimize when executing this GA.",

In most of the existing methods, three-dimensional (3D) invariants have been obtained by reconstruction of the object structure, where fundamental matrices between image pairs should be first established. Consequently, there are additional errors introduced during invariants construction and could be very time consuming. In this paper, a novel algorithm to calculate 3D projective invariants from multiple images has been proposed, without reconstructing the object structures explicitly. We have employed the geometric configuration of points and lines in general position to deduce the formulation of 3D invariants. It has been verified in our experiments that our proposed method is considerably accurate when compared with the ground truth, and more efficient when compared with reconstruction based methods.",

The model solutions are obtained by using local basis and asymmetric quadratic weighting functions which can provide a promising alternative to the standard Galerkin formulation for problems with advective and diffusive terms. The results of the model reveal that the precipitation scavenging by rain is quite effective in cleaning the polluted atmosphere. Anticipating the need of pollutant concentration in rain drops regarding acid precipitation (or acid rain), the concentration of the absorbed pollutant in the droplet phase are also analyzed. So, the present study provides an understanding on the concentration distribution of pollutant in gaseous and droplet phases, under the effects of variable wind and diffusivity profiles.",

    "abstract": "Computational grids have the potential for solving large-scale scientific applications using heterogeneous and geographically distributed resources. In addition to the challenges of managing and scheduling these applications, reliability challenges arise because of the unreliable nature of grid infrastructure. Two major problems that are critical to the effective utilization of computational resources are efficient scheduling of jobs and providing fault tolerance in a reliable manner. This paper addresses these problems by combining the checkpoint replication based fault tolerance mechanism with minimum total time to release (MTTR) job scheduling algorithm. TTR includes the service time of the job, waiting time in the queue, transfer of input and output data to and from the resource. The MTTR algorithm minimizes the response time by selecting a computational resource based on job requirements, job characteristics, and hardware features of the resources. The fault tolerance mechanism used here sets the job checkpoints based on the resource failure rate. If resource failure occurs, the job is restarted from its last successful state using a checkpoint file from another grid resource. Globus ToolKit is used as the grid middleware to set up a grid environment and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The monitoring tools Ganglia and Network Weather Service are used to gather hardware and network details, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed approach effectively schedule the grid jobs with fault-tolerant way thereby reduces TTR of the jobs submitted in the grid. Also, it increases the percentage of jobs completed within specified deadline and making the grid trustworthy.",

To further tackle micro- and meso-scale process-based reasons underlying changes in body size, researchers compare natural populations across different habitat structures, assessing which habitat structures correspond to which changes in body size variation. The complex multi-scale dynamics underlying the effect of the external environment on body size evolution, however, inherently limits empirical interpretations with regard to the differential contribution of particular aspects of habitat architecture on body size variation, leaving open many questions as to the how and why of changes in body size variation across different habitats. We develop an agent-based simulation approach with the principal aim of investigating the differential effects of particular habitat conditions on the evolution of body size and other life history traits. Our approach simulates animals' individual decisions with regard to growth and reproduction, and records their effect on population-level variation across different habitat structures. This approach has the potential to include numerous different habitat conditions and/or growth laws and allows detailed controlled comparisons of the isolated effects of particular habitat conditions and/or perturbations. In the current study, we assess the usefulness of our approach in a pilot exploration of the effects of predation and resource distribution on body size variation in mammals. We find independent effects of predation, resource availability and resource predictability on changes in body size and quantify the relation between body size and population size across different habitat conditions.",

Several methodologies have been developed based on classical mathematics, or statistics and also new disciplines — such as soft-computing techniques — appeared. Petri Nets as one of the most naturalistic modeling methodologies are well suited to describe complex process in general. However in some fields of modeling the describing power of basic Petri Nets proved not to be robust enough, therefore several extensions were made to the original concept. Colored tokens (Colored Petri Nets), stochastic delayed streaming of mobile entities (Stochastic Petri Nets), object oriented architecture (Object Oriented Petri Nets), numerical (Numerical Petri Nets) and linguistic attributes (Fuzzy Petri Nets) broaden the range of capabilities. In some fields of problem solving, usage of static and mobile knowledge bases is needed: e.g., flexible manufacturing systems, or intelligent traffic simulation. These problems to be investigated involved new conceptual developments of Petri Nets and led to the introduction of Knowledge Attributed Petri Nets. At the same time distributed control in simulation appeared, intelligent agents supported the connection of mobile knowledge bases and static inference engines in an effective way. The mentioned extensions brought general support in model synthesis, but some unsolved questions remained related to the implementation of intelligent mobile entities. This paper highlights a new level of AI controlled simulation introducing the Extended Knowledge Attributed Petri Nets that offer the capability of easy implementation of mobile inference engines and knowledge base, providing general mobile AI in Petri Nets.",

The models aims at reproducing a distribution of settlements with statistical and spatial characteristics similar to a historically produced pattern. The model operates on a representation of a real territory, taking into account hydrography and relief. The two main goals are to obtain a rank size distribution of the size of settlements which corresponds to a power law (also known as the Zipf Law of settlements) and to place the settlements in the territory in patterns that are close to the real ones, in zones where settlements were the result of a long historical process. The goal of the project was to demonstrate that a set of relatively simple rules could produce a complex pattern, similar to the result of a long and complex historical process. Therefore, it is an assumed reductionist approach. Our conclusions show that a simple territorial logic, taking into account the quality of land, accessibility, population growth and migration preferences could reproduce Zipf distributions and interesting patterns of agent flow among the settlements created. However, achieving spatial patterns closer to the historical record needs an extra dimension involving field of sight. The best results were achieved by creating an artifical population which chooses to create settlements in places where a wide field of view exists of quality territory.",

Dimensional analysis and Pi theorem coupled with a large set of experimental data allow us to evaluate the main physical processes responsible for the characteristics shape. At low current intensity, the plasma is mostly driven by thermal conduction effects while at high current intensity, it is principally governed by radiation losses.

    "abstract": "Thin cylindrical shell structures have wide variety of applications due to their favorable stiffness-to-mass ratio and under axial compressive loading, these shell structures fail by their buckling instability. Hence, their load carrying capacity is decided by its buckling strength which in turn predominantly depends on the geometrical imperfections present on the shell structure. The main aim of the present study is to determine the more influential geometrical parameter out of two geometrical imperfection parameters namely, \"the extent of imperfection present over a surface area\" and its \"amplitude\". To account for these geometrical parameters simultaneously, the imperfection pattern is assumed as a dent having the shape of extent of surface area as a nearly square. The side length of extent of surface area can be considered as proportional to extent of imperfection present over an area and the dent depth can be considered as proportional to amplitude of imperfections. For the present numerical study, FE models of thin short carbon steel perfect cylindrical shells with different sizes of dent are generated at 1/3rd and half the height of cylindrical shells and analyzed using ANSYS nonlinear FE buckling analysis.",

However, it is an open question how self-organization of basic motor primitives and goal-orientation can be combined, which is a prerequisite for the usefulness of such systems. In the paper at hand we propose a goal-orientation framework allowing the combination of self-organization and goal-orientation for the control of autonomous robots in a mutually independent fashion. Self-organization based motor primitives are employed to achieve a given goal. This requires less initial knowledge about the properties of robot and environment and increases adaptivity of the overall system. A combination of self-organization and reward-based learning seems thus a promising route for the development of adaptive learning systems.",

The Geant4 toolkit was originally developed by the high energy physics community to simulate the interactions of elementary particles within complex detector systems. Here its capabilities are utilized to model molecular vacuum transport in geometries where other techniques are impractical. The techniques are verified with an application representing a simple vacuum geometry that has been studied previously both analytically and by basic Monte Carlo simulation. We discuss the use of an application with a very complicated geometry, that of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope camera cryostat, to determine probabilities of transport of contaminant molecules to optical surfaces where control of contamination is crucial.",

The current and future wind power situation is modeled as two cases and a transient fault is simulated. In order to analyze the impact of wind energy integration in electrical power grid, a power system model has been developed, integrated with wind turbine using doubly fed induction generator and transient analysis are performed.

The formal solution can be written in terms of the matrix exponential, [Formula: see text], acting on some vectors. We introduce a general family of time-integrators based on the approximation of [Formula: see text] by Jacobi polynomial expansions. We discuss the efficient implementation of this technique, and based on some test problems, we compare the virtues and shortcomings of the algorithm.

The generalized forms of eddy diffusivity with spatial dependence in both horizontal and vertical directions and vertical height-dependent wind speed are considered. In view of the computational limitation associated with numerical models for Dirac-delta function, the source term is expressed as a limiting case of normal distribution. The accuracy of the employed numerical scheme to solve the resulting partial differential equation with appropriate physically relevant boundary conditions is checked with those obtained from the respective analytical solutions available in literature for the particular forms of eddy diffusivity and wind speed. Concentrations computed from the proposed model are found close to those obtained from analytical models. The concentrations obtained from the proposed model are evaluated for the generalized functional forms of eddy diffusivity (Degrazia and Moraes, 1992; Degrazia et al., 2001) and diabatic logarithmic profile as well as power-law profile of wind speed with the observations from Hanford (Doran et al., 1984) and Copenhagen (Gryning and Lyck, 1984) diffusion experiments in stable and unstable conditions, respectively. Majority of the cases i.e., 64% and 96% are predicted in factor of two to observations in both stable and unstable conditions, respectively.",

By exposing the robots to sounds which co-vary systematically with specific aspects of their experience, the robots can distinguish nouns from verbs and can respond appropriately to simple noun–verb sentences. Robots can also be used to show that, while all animals develop a mental (neural) model of their environment which incorporates the co-variations among different aspects of their experiences, human beings develop a more analytical and modular model because specific sounds co-vary with different aspects of their experiences — and this may explain why human beings have a more articulated and creative behavioral repertoire.",

Afterwards, the two X's move to different positions in the cell nucleus according to their different status (active/silenced). Our models illustrate about the still mysterious physical bases underlying all these regulatory steps, i.e., X-chromosome pairing, random choice of inactive X, and \"shuttling\" of the X's to their post-XCI locations. Our models are based on general and robust thermodynamic roots, and their validity can go beyond XCI, to explain analogous regulatory mechanisms in a variety of cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "The advancement in technologies made the entire manufacturing system, to be operated with more efficient, flexible, user friendly, more productive and cost effective. One such a system to be focused for advancement is plasma cutting system, which has wider industrial applications. There are many researches pursuing at various area of plasma cutting technology, still the automated and optimized parameters value selection is challenging. The work is aimed to eliminate the manual mode of feeding the input parameters for cutting operation. At present, cutting parameters are fed by referring the past cut data information or with the assistance of experienced employers. The cutting process parameters selections will have direct impact on the quality of the material being cut, and life of the consumables. This paper is intended to automate the process parameters selection by developing the mathematical model with existing cutting process parameters database. In this, three different approaches, multiple regression, multiple polynomial regression and AI technique, are selected and analyzed with the mathematical relations developed between the different cutting process parameters. The accuracy and reliability of those methods are detailed. The advantage and disadvantage of those methods for optimal setting conditions are discussed. The appropriate method that can be preferred for automated and optimal settings are elucidated. Finally, the selected technique is checked for accuracy and reliability for the existing cut data.",

    "abstract": "Unlike the traditional independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms and some recently emerging linear ICA algorithms that search for solutions in the space of general matrices or orthogonal matrices, in this paper we propose two new methods which only search for solutions in the space of the matrices with unitary determinant and without whitening. The new algorithms are based on the special linear group SL(n). In order to achieve our target, we first provide a representation theory for any matrix in SL(n), which only simply uses the product of multiple exponentials of traceless matrices. Based on the matrix representation theory, two novel ICA algorithms are developed along with simple analysis on their equilibrium points. Moreover, we apply our methods to the classical problem of signal separation. The experimental results indicate that the superior convergence of our proposed algorithms, which can be expected as two viable alternatives to the ICA algorithms available in publications.",

The novel techniques which can apply to our selected LDPC code is proposed, including parallel blocked layered decoding architecture and simplification of the WiGig networks. State-of-the-art flexible LDPC decoders cannot simultaneously achieve the high throughput mandated by these standards and the low power needed for mobile applications. This work develops a flexible, fully pipelined architecture for the IEEE 802.11ad standard capable of achieving both goals. We use Real Time–Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (RT-PEPA) to evaluate a typical LDPC Decoder system's performance. The approach is more convenient, flexible, and lower cost than the former simulation method which needs to develop special hardware and software tools. Moreover, we can easily analyze how changes in performance depend on changes in a particular mode by supplying ranges for parameter values.",

    "abstract": "All substantive areas of law, with no exception, have a common concern for the processes by which legal disputes get resolved. Naturally, the success of any particular litigation strategy in a legal dispute depends on several factors, such as procedural costs, the judges' accuracy and, most importantly, the litigation strategy followed by the counterpart. Previous work within the legal scholarship has focused on the outcomes of the litigation process and their concordance with the merits of the claims presented by the parties. In contrast, in this paper, we adopt a dynamic view of the legal system as a whole. In order to do this, we propose an evolutionary point of view. That is, we assume that the most successful litigation strategies at a certain time are more likely to be followed in the future, so the prevalence of different strategies in the system will generally change over time. Importantly, this change in the frequency of litigation strategies in the legal system will, in turn, affect the relative success of each litigation strategy, thus creating a double feedback loop between prevalence and success of litigation strategies, which we aim to explore. Furthermore, we will compare the results drawn from our model with the ones proposed by the empirical literature on the topic. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to offer a novel approach to study legal disputes, looking at the whole litigation system as a single entity that evolves through time. In particular, we focus on cases of medical liability, and use agent-based simulation to provide a dynamic view of how various factors affect the type of litigation strategies that are successful and prevail in a certain judicial context.",

In the present paper, in order to study the distribution of producer size in the globalized market, we construct a bipartite network that consists of consumers and producers with community structure. We find that the distribution of producer size in each community in a multi-community network can be projected to that in one-community bipartite network by mapping the globalized market behavior of consumers to an isolated market behavior. The mapped market behavior is dependent on the trade barriers among communities. The distribution of producer size in globalized market is thereby dependent on the mapped loyalty of consumers and the mapped growing rate of purchasing power. Furthermore, simulation results show that the distribution of producer size differs community by community. It follows the power-law distribution if both the mapped loyalty of consumers and growing rate are high.",

However, to date, the basic names have only been defined through a set of linguistic principles. There is no statistical definition that quantitatively separates the basic names from the rest of the color words across languages. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis of the World Color Survey database hosting color word information from 110 non-industrialized languages. The central result is that those names for which a population of individuals show a larger overall agreement across languages turn out to be the basic ones exactly reproducing the color name hierarchy and, thereby, providing, for the first time, an empirical definition of the basic color names.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an optimum technique based on the least squares method for the derivation of the bubble functions to enrich the standard linear finite elements employed in the formulation of Galerkin weighted-residual statements. The element-level linear shape functions are enhanced with supplementary polynomial bubble functions with undetermined coefficients. The best least squares minimization of the residual functional obtained from the insertion of these trial functions into model equations results in an algebraic system of equations whose solution provides the unknown coefficients in terms of element-level nodal values. The normal finite element procedures for the construction of stiffness matrices may then be followed with no extra degree of freedom incurred as a result of such enrichment. The performance of the proposed method has been tested on a number of benchmark linear transport equations with the results compared against the exact and standard linear element solutions. It has been observed that low order bubble enriched elements produce more accurate approximations than the standard linear elements with no extra computational cost despite employing relatively crude mesh. However, for the solution of strongly convection or reaction dominated problems significantly higher order enrichments as well as extra mesh refinements will be required.",

These protocols are Y-\"local\" in the sense that they transmit packets only between Y-adjacent vertices and LLS since they base their \"routing decisions\" dynamically on queue-sizes of their neighbors and their relative distance to the destination. In the system each vertex has specific data-queues indexed by its respective Y-neighbors. The state of a vertex then consists of the collection of queue-sizes. The data-transmission protocols are formally specified in the framework of sequential dynamical systems, which allows us to categorize and classify our experiments. We will investigate the following scenario: for fixed Y we assume a single source/destination pair to be given and a system-update then consists of the collection of local protocol updates according to some fixed permutation of the Y-vertices. We then iterate the system-updates and thereby obtain the time evolution of the queue-sizes of the vertices. We will present and discuss results on the evolution of the load, i.e. the total number of packets in the network, the throughput, i.e. the rate at which packets arrive at the destination, and study the dependence of the queue-size dynamics on various other system parameters. In particular, we will analyze update schedule dependency and the impact of queue-capacity on system stability. We will show that our protocols can adapt and dynamically utilize new routes in a fixed network.",

A point process, regarded as a random measure, can be expressed as a sum of Delta Dirac measures concentrated at some random points. The integration with respect to the point process leads the continuous wavelet transform of the process itself. As possible mother wavelets, we propose the application of the Mexican hat and the Morlet wavelet in order to implement the scale-angle energy density of the process, depending on the dilation parameter and on the three angles which define the direction in the Euclidean space. Such indicator proves to be a sensitive detector of any variation in the direction and it can be successfully implemented to study the isotropy or the filamentary structure in 3D point patterns.",

    "abstract": "The investigation of the new generation of a photovoltaic cell for the optimized parameters is mainly carried out using modeling and simulation, because the fabrication of quantum structures is still a challenge. Hence, new models to simulate realistic devices are developed. In the past, the Drift Diffusion equation has been exploited to simulate quantum well solar cells by introducing various assumptions and new parameters. Non Equilibrium Green Function’s Formalism has been widely used to study the transport in the nanostructures of the photovoltaic devices. We have developed a model of simulating quantum dot (QD) [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] junction solar cell by hybridizing the Drift Diffusion Equation and the Transfer Hamiltonian Approach. The developed model is applied to a QD [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] junction solar cell to determine the optimized position of the QD within the intrinsic region. Our results show that when the QD is placed closer to the edges of the [Formula: see text]-region, the highest possible efficiency is observed.",

This paper also proposes upper, lower and weaker lower bounds of algebraic connectivity.

To date, there has been a great deal of effort invested in providing the highest level of flight realism possible. However, little investment has gone into systems which are used to improve communication skills with ATC while in a populated active airspace. It is important to note that the relatively few SATCEs is not due to the lack of technology, since such products have been available for about a decade. The primary reason for its absence is the inability and unwillingness for operators to justify the investment in such a training tool. In the meantime, the aviation industry has recognized that pilots need to have better communication skills while operating in various conditions. Consequently ICAO, with help from ARINC Industry Activities/FSEMC, has already taken steps to recommend the inclusion of SATCE characteristics in flight simulation devices. The aviation and research communities need to assist efforts by producing the necessary studies and metrics which can be used to evaluate and validate SATCEs used in the flight training.",

In particular, the financial crisis exposed the mainstream general equilibrium models used by economists to their flaws and drawbacks (Fagiolo and Roventini, 2017) and also policymakers claimed to feel ''abandoned'' by the conventional tools (Trichet, 2010). The weaknesses of conducting economic analyses relying on highly sophisticated mathematical models focused on the analysis of the system in equilibrium, are being addressed by many researchers both in the mainstream (Romer, 2016; Reis, 2017) and in the agentbased community. In particular, agent-based models (ABMs) are emerging as a potential new paradigm (D’Orazio, 2017) because of their ability to deal with complexity, heterogeneity, and decentralized interaction mechanisms. In this framework, this topical issue is particularly relevant in that it gathers contributions that aim at developing a multi-disciplinary approach and suggests some advances in the methodology.",

In this research, we analyze one of the deadliest illnesses with a high fatality rate worldwide, the chronic kidney disease (CKD), to provide the finest healthcare services possible to users of e-health and m-health applications by presenting the IoTC services based on healthcare delivery system for the prediction and observation of CKD with its severity level. The suggested architecture gathers patient data from linked IoT devices and saves it in the cloud alongside real-time data, pertinent medical records that are collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and relevant medical documents. We further use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier to predict CKD and its severity. To boost the effectiveness of the DNN classifier, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based feature selection technique is also applied. We compare the performance of the proposed model using different classification measures utilizing different classifiers. A Quick Flower Pollination Algorithm (QFPA)- (DNN)-based IoT and cloud-based CKD diagnosis model, is presented in this paper.

With varying network conditions either because of wireless nature or because of user mobility, it is very difficult to simulate the exact network conditions with the existing network simulators. These network simulators are flexible, re-usable and reliable. But they have a limitation of not being able to replicate the actual network conditions in the laboratories.

    "abstract": "Rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques significantly promotes important medical imaging applications such as disease diagnosis, medical image analysis and cross-modality synthesis. It is valuable to synthesize Computed Tomography (CT) scans of human brains from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans because CT images contain particular information for diseases such as malignant tumors, cerebrovascular malformations and aneurysms. Although there has been many studies trying to apply machine learning methods (e.g., fully convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks) to predict CT images based on MRI, there are still opportunities to increase the quality of synthesized CT images using the latest machine learning algorithms. In this study, we aim to synthesize high-credibility human brain CT images from MRI images using machine learning approaches. We build a dataset of both CT and MRI images of 41 patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive. A data pre-processing pipeline is designed to guarantee that the processed images are suitable as inputs to machine learning algorithms. The pipeline includes (1) pairing MRI and CT scans according to a certain time interval between CT and MRI exams of the same patient, (2) registering all MRI images to a standard MRI template, (3) registering all CT images to paired MRI images, (4) intensity normalization and (5) extracting 2D slices from 3D CT and MRI volumes. Three deep neural networks with encoder–decoder structure are selected and implemented including U-Net, U-Net++ and pix2pix to synthesize human brain CT images from MRI images. Experimental results illustrate that U-Net++ shows better performance than U-Net and pix2pix in synthesizing CT images from MRI by achieving a Mean Squared Error of 0.025, a Mean Absolute Error of 0.082 and a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 67.90, respectively. The trained machine learning models from this work can be applied in future human brain CT image prediction where CT images are absent and MRI images are available for specific patients, thereby supporting disease diagnosis based on CT images.",

    "abstract": "With the broader development of networking, data acquired from IoT and big data have grown significantly in various real-time applications. It provides a transparent role of human life as it shows an extensive bond with data provisioning. On the other hand, it has some challenging issues like verification of authenticity of the enormous data over an un-trusted environment like cloud. It causes privacy leakage, delay, and unidentified data size by third-party. Thus, there is a need for a novel authentication to handle all these problems using a tree data structure for establishing authentication for privacy preservation. Here, a novel graph-based traversing algorithm (GTA) is proposed for realizing the data stream verification and validates the arrival of data streams. This model reduces the failure rate and improves the authentication mechanism and robustness. An integrity verification scheme is used to handle privacy leakage issues during third-party analysis. The simulation is performed in MATLAB 2016b environment to project the significance of the model, and the outcomes are more desirable for authentication and privacy preservation during practical examination. Here, metrics like path length, total verification time, and total insertion time are evaluated. The proposed model gives a better trade-off compared to existing approaches. The path length variation of GTA is 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 for depth rates 6, 8, and 10, respectively. The total verification time with data size is 1, 2, 3, and 4[Formula: see text]GB, respectively. The total insertion time of GTA is 5, 10, 15, and 18[Formula: see text]s for 1, 2, 3, and 4[Formula: see text]GB, respectively. It is remarkably lesser than P-ATHAT and Merkle tree, respectively.

    "abstract": "Detection of any disease in the early stage can save a life. There are many medical imaging modalities like MRI, FMRI, ultrasound, CT, and X-ray used in the detection of disease. In the last decades, neural network-based methods are effective in detecting and classifying the disease based on abnormalities present in the medical images. Acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) is one of the common diseases seen in children among the 0.5–3 years age group which infects the respiratory system that can cause the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Prior detection can lower the risk of spreading and can be treated accurately by a pediatrician. Commonly this infection can be diagnosed though physical examination. But due to the similarity of Covid-19 symptoms urges the physicians to get accurate detection of this disease using X-ray and CT images of the infant’s chest and throat. The proposed work aims to develop a croup diagnose system (CDS) which identify the Croup infection through post anterior (PA) view of pediatric X-ray using deep learning algorithm. We used the well-known transfer learning algorithm VGG19 and ResNet50. Data augmentation being adapted for reducing the overfitting and to improve the quantity of image samples. We show that the proposed transfer learning based CDS method can be used to classify the X-ray images into two classes namely, croup and normal. The experiment results confirm that VGG19 performs better than ResNet50 with promising classification accuracy (90.91%.). The results show that the proposed CDS models can be used for more pediatric medical image classification problem.",

The proposed model works well compared to the various existing approaches. The computation is initiated with the acquisition of damaged images, and pre-processing is performed for data labeling, which is further divided into training and testing samples.

The simulation is done in MATLAB 2020a environment where various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, [Formula: see text]-measure, recall and detection rate are evaluated and compared with conventional learning approaches. The model gives an average precision of 94.5% and [Formula: see text]1-score of 91% which is higher than other approaches.

An accurate and efficient simulation method considering the effects of stochastic disturbances is of critical importance for the analysis of the dynamic performance of power systems. In this paper, a methodology for the simulation of stochastic transients in power systems is developed based on frequency shifting theory. The stochastic differential equations describing the stochastic process of parameter migration are represented through analytic signals. The frequency shifting operation is introduced. The Fourier spectra of analytic signals are shifted to reduce their maximum frequency contents, thereby permitting a larger time-step in time-domain simulation in accordance with Shannon’s sampling theory. Through the trapezoidal Milstein scheme, the stochastic differential equations with shifted analytic signals are discretized. Branch companion models that process analytic signals for the simulation of stochastic transients are formulated. The numerical properties of branch models are further examined. The analysis of test cases demonstrates that the proposed method can be used to represent stochastic transients caused by parameter migrations accurately and efficiently.",

In this paper, a Distributed Posture-based Traffic-Medium Access Control (DPT-MAC) protocol is proposed where the sensor nodes follow the Disc Communication model for the detection of neighbor nodes based on the proximity of the sensing range. Further, the modified IEEE 802.15.4 superframe structure determines the potential sleep posture of a subject to ensure a collision-free data transmission and prioritize the data traffic based on the criticality of the data like critical, periodic and nonregular data. The critical data detection occupies the channel on high priority and will have the probability to access the other channel space during the contention period of the noncritical data. The regular guaranteed time slot (GTS) is reduced from the tradition number of slots to five, which allows the nodes to handle the throughput. This uninterrupted data transmission minimizes the delay rate and collision ratio with any number of sensor nodes as the channel synchronization is strictly followed using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance mechanism. Here, the optimization of the network quality parameters like energy consumption, throughput, delay and collision ratio assures a guaranteed increase in the Network Lifetime. The results show that the distributed topology outperforms the conventional star topology in sustaining the Network Lifetime.",

The results showed that when the time is 20[Formula: see text]min, the throughput of the system is higher than [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]kb/s.

General bipartite community detecting algorithms implicitly contain a fixed generation step to determine the intra-correlations of the two separate vertex sets (denoted as instance set and attribute set), thus ignoring problem-related heuristics. Inspired by this, we propose a bi-community detection framework concerning the problem-related features that directly takes such intra-correlations into account, and can be freely combined with different objective functions and optimization algorithms to cope with various network structures such as directed graphs with negative edge weights. The framework is adopted to analyze international relations on the dispute and alliance datasets, whose results contain the relevant events that support the establishment of each community and are highly consistent with Huntington’s theory. In addition, we analyze the impact of the instance–instance, instance–attribute, and attribute–attribute relations on the detection result through control experiments, and conclude that for the general community searching algorithms (including the bi-community case), appropriately taking these three relations together into account can help obtain different reasonable detection results.",

Parameter errors in the grid model can lead to deviations between simulation calculations and actual grid operation. The strategy based on incorrect calculation data will lead to power outages in the actual power grid, which may cause significant economic losses and personal safety accidents. For the safe operation of power grid, a method for locating the wrong parameters of transmission line based on sensitivity analysis (SA) and deep residual network (DRN) is proposed. By calculating the sensitivity of apparent power to parameter error of each line in the power grid, the propagation characteristics of power flow error are analyzed quantitatively. An error region segmentation method is proposed to reduce the search range of error parameters from large-scale power grids to local networks which can reduce the computational complexity of the search algorithm, and increase accuracy. An error transmission line index for local power grids is proposed to identify error source in local power grids. Then, the specific wrong parameters are identified through the DRN. It can intelligently identify the error parameters from multiple parameters of the error transmission line. The calculation results of the 300-bus system verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "With the development of technology, more and more cities and highways are installing light reducing structures at the tunnel openings to improve traffic safety and reduce the “black hole effect” and low-angle sunlight glare effect. However, the existing scrims have poor road surface uniformity, bright and dark streaks and uneven road surface brightness, which can bring negative impact on driving. In order to balance the safety and comfort of tunnel light sheds, a new technique is proposed to reduce the negative effects of light sheds based on the multi-source effect of light diffusion panels. The results show that by arranging light diffusion panels on the top of the scrim, the daylight is fully diffused and then irradiated to the road surface under the scrim, avoiding the undesirable phenomenon caused by direct sunlight on the road surface. After the indoor test and numerical model analysis, the effectiveness of the technology is proved to be in compliance with the design specification, and the undesirable phenomena such as bright and dark streaks are avoided, thus ensuring the safety and comfort of traffic at the tunnel entrance. In addition, the average brightness of the road surface of the top arrangement of light diffusion panels is better than that of the two sides, and the light intensity distribution curve of No. 2 panel among the four light diffusion panels used in this paper is the best. The technology can also control the brightness level of the road surface under the shed through the area of light diffusion panels, thus reducing the carbon emission of the tunnel lighting system and achieving the unity of safety, comfort and low carbon environment protection.",

In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Membership-Latent Distance Model (HM-LDM) by exploring how a Latent Distance Model (LDM) can be constrained to a latent simplex. By controlling the edge lengths of the corners of the simplex, the volume of the latent space can be systematically controlled. Thereby communities are revealed as the space becomes more constrained, with hard memberships being recovered as the simplex volume goes to zero. We further explore a recent likelihood formulation for signed networks utilizing the Skellam distribution to account for signed weighted networks and extend the HM-LDM to the signed Hybrid Membership-Latent Distance Model (sHM-LDM). Importantly, the induced likelihood function explicitly attracts nodes with positive links and deters nodes having negative interactions. We demonstrate the utility of HM-LDM and sHM-LDM on several real networks. We find that the procedures successfully identify prominent distinct structures, as well as how nodes relate to the extracted aspects providing favorable performances in terms of link prediction when compared to prominent baselines.

Each type is extended from offline identification to online identification. Specifically, interval identification and point estimation methods are reviewed for offline parameter identification. For online parameter identification, point estimation methods are reviewed. In the case that the model is partially unknown or black-box, the modeling methods and identification methods are mainly reviewed. In addition to the traditional methods, this paper focuses on the latest progress in the application of machine learning in system recognition. Finally, at the end of the paper, this paper summarizes the existing methods and points out the key problems that still need to be solved.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the Talent versus Luck model, which examines the impact of talent and luck on an individual’s career success. The original simulation-based model demonstrated that the distribution of capital has a heavy tail, and the most successful individuals are not necessarily the most talented. While the implications of the original model are intriguing, those findings were based solely on numerical calculations, and it was unclear how generally valid they are. Challet et al. generalize the original model using an analytical approach and successfully clarify the relationship between talent, lucky events, and capital when talent is constant and follows a uniform distribution. We reformulate a simplified model and derive more general propositions about the relationship between luck and talent in individual success by introducing the new concept of luck of outcome in addition to the luck of opportunity in previous models. We show that the capital distribution generated from a simplified talent versus luck model follows a lognormal distribution even when the talent is subject to a normal distribution. Moreover, we specify the relationship between the inequality of the distribution, which is indicated by the Gini coefficient, and the parameters of talent distribution.",

    "abstract": "Relation extraction (RE) is a crucial step for knowledge graph construction, which aims to extract meaningful relations between entity pairs in plain texts. Very few works have been studied on Chinese relation extraction (CRE) in the military field. Moreover, recent deep neural network-based methods have achieved considerable performance but still suffer from three inherent limitations, including overlapping of entities, imbalanced data and the ambiguity. Therefore, this work investigates a novel Multi-Grained Lattice Transformer (MGLT), which leverages external information of lexicon and word sense tailored for CRE. In MGLT, self-matched lexicon words and related word senses are fused through a cross-transformer mechanism to alleviate the ambiguity in texts. The finally enriched sequence representation in MGLT captures the relatedness between the head entity and the tail one, which is helpful to alleviate the overlapping of entities. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets and a self-developed dataset constructed from online military news show that the proposed MGLT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with other typical baselines, MGLT achieves better area under curve (AUC) and [Formula: see text]-score by up to 10.46% and 6.90%, respectively. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of using ensemble learning to fully exploit complementary information from multiple MGLT-based base learners to improve the overall performance for imbalanced data classification on the military dataset. Such results indicate that the proposed ensemble learning model is effective and robust to be applied in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "The ride comfort is a significant property of patient transport robots, which is directly related to the performance of rescue instruments and the cause of secondary damage. Previous studies overlook the design optimization of patient transport robots to improve ride comfort in hospital environments. This study designs a mobility system with an improved chassis that enables a more comfortable ride for patients. The system incorporates a longitudinal arm-independent suspension, which has a regulating device that changes the shock absorber angle and longitudinal arm length. A four-wheel vibration coupling response model of the robot vehicle is established. An optimization model with variable stiffness and damping coefficients is built and analyzed. The effective and maximum values of the body’s vertical, pitch angular, and roll angular accelerations are used as evaluation criteria of the robot’s ride comfort, which is analyzed on random roads and roadblocks, comparing its performance before and after the optimization. The results show that the weighted acceleration of the optimized body reduces by 61.9%, and the optimized suspension system improves the overall robot’s ride comfort. The evaluation indices of the optimized robot are measured through experiments. The weighted acceleration in the three directions of the optimized body is 0.18[Formula: see text]m/s 2 , which is less than 0.315[Formula: see text]m/s 2 as required by ISO 2631-1, indicating that the patient does not feel uncomfortable, rendering an excellent evaluation, and verifying the rationality of the suspension system modeling analysis. The establishment of the multi-objective optimization model provides a theoretical basis for improving the ride comfort of mobile robots.",

Subsequently, this paper calculated the weights of indicators based on the backpropagation neural network algorithm and the data in the case library and formulated a model for dynamic risk assessment of road transport of hazardous chemicals. The model takes into account the impact of comprehensive indicators such as drivers, vehicles, goods, roads, and the environment. The accuracy of the model calculation results is 93%.

Many pioneers have analyzed the impact of system’s macro-statistical characteristics, such as degree distribution and giant component, on system performance. But only few research works were conducted on the relation of mesoscopic structure and agent property with system task performance. In this paper, we designed a scenario that, in a multiagent system, agents will try their best to form a qualified team to fulfill more system tasks under the requirements from agent property, structure and task. The theoretical and simulation results show that the agent link network, agent properties and task requirement will co-affect the dynamic team formation and at last have serious effects on a system’s task completion ratio and performance. Some factors such as network density and task introduction period have positive influence. Task execution time and team size have negative influence. Some factors show a counter-intuitive influence. The clustering coefficient has not much influence as people expected and the task publicity time isn’t bigger the better. Notably, system performance is affected by the coupling effect, instead of the independent effects of all factors. The effect of system structure on system function conditionally relies on the support from agent ability and task requirement.",

However, it suffers from dictionary biases and ambiguous entities, resulting in noisy and incomplete labels. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a template augmented distant supervision framework, which generates high-quality labeled training data with minimal human effort. Specifically, we use distant supervision to extract sentences that contain entities and apply a pre-trained language model to encode these sentences. The encoded sentences are clustered and then for each cluster, three sentences are sampled out to form a seed template pool. The seed templates are calibrated and decomposed to decouple the connection between different parts. Finally, the seed templates and entity dictionary are combined with pre-trained language model to generate semantically coherent and precisely labeled training data. Experimental results on the EC and NEWS datasets and a practical electronic after-sale Q&amp;A dataset with multiple pre-trained language models demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to improve the F1 score of the distantly supervised NER models by 7.9%–12.9%.",

Extensive work has been done on the traffic dynamics on multiplex networks, but there remains a lack of sufficient attention towards studying routing strategies for the purpose of suppressing epidemic spreading. In this paper, the impact of global awareness routing (GAR), improved global awareness routing (IGAR), and improved active routing (IAR) strategies on traffic-driven epidemic spreading are investigated. Our findings indicate that in the case of infinite node-delivery capacity and no traffic congestion in the network, adjusting routing parameters can effectively suppress epidemic spreading. In this context, these three strategies show better abilities on the multiplex network built by WS or ER model to minimize the density of infected nodes, thus contributing to the overall inhibition of the epidemic spread. However, in the multiplex network constructed by BA model, GAR strategy has a promoting effect on epidemic spreading compared with the shortest routing strategy. In addition, by controlling traffic flow, limiting node delivery capabilities can contain outbreaks. Our results suggest that adopting appropriate routing strategies in multiplex networks can play a proactive role in controlling epidemic spreading. This is crucial for formulating effective prevention and control measures and improving public health security.",

From the reconstructed response networks for fatty acid degradation and lipid biosynthesis pathways in Mtb, we identified proteins whose involvements in these pathways were not previously suspected. Furthermore, the subcellular localizations of these expressed proteins provide interesting insights into the compartmentalization of these pathways, which appear to traverse from cell wall to cytoplasm.

It is proven that the uni-variate approximation (also called mean-field) is exact for the uniform random neighborhood PCA. The exact results and the approximations are used to investigate phase transitions. We compare the results of two order parameters, the uni-variate marginal and the normalized entropy. Sometimes different transitions are indicated by the Ehrenfest classification scheme. This result shows the limitations of using just one or two order parameters for detecting and classifying major transitions of the stationary distribution.

The theory involves seven constraints that uniquely define the mapping. The compatibility with observational phenomena and sufficiency of these constraints shows the validity of the theory. The principle underlying these constraints is a coding by the most efficient representation of information. The efficiency of representation is evaluated by the coding redundancy of given experiences defined as the number of real numbers that characterize experiences plus the size of the minimum continuous decoding function. The coding redundancy of experiences by the most efficient representation corresponds to the Kolmogorov complexity of the experiences. The mapping accounts for the dependence on neonatal experience of the development of perceptual and motor-control functions. This theory of development can also be seen as a metatheory of cognition that presents us a unified view of the diversity of perceptual and motor-control modules.",

    "abstract": "The amount of produced data required to be visualized and analyzed has grown year by year, and the traditional approach of using larger computational resources or exploiting task and data parallelism seems to have reached its limit. Therefore, a new paradigm for large-scale data visualization becomes highly desired, and in this paper, we propose a new and optimized visualization pipeline which uses a point rendering-based early visibility testing for reducing the unnecessary rendering in the final stage of the visualization pipeline, and we named this technique “Early Visibility Test Point Rendering”. In a densely populated polygonal mesh scene, where multiple triangles may cover a single pixel, unnecessary and wasteful rendering will occur in the final stage of the traditional visualization pipeline, that is, during the rasterization process. Therefore, we propose an alternative visualization pipeline by introducing the “Early Visibility Test Point Rendering” for selecting only the visible polygonal elements for a given visualization scene. This visibility testing can be executed on the CPU side, and only the visible polygonal elements are needed to be sent to the GPU for an optimized rendering. We could verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach by using synthetic datasets, and also a real-world large-scale simulation result.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic virtual plant simulation is an attractive research issue in both botany and computer graphics. Data-driven method is an efficient way for motion analysis and animation synthesis. As a widely used tool, motion capture has been used in plant motion data acquisition and analysis. The most prominent and important problem in motion capture for plants is primary data processing such as missing markers reconstruction. This paper presents a novel physics-based approach to motion capture data processing of plants. Firstly, a physics-based mechanics model is found by Lagrangian mechanics for a motion captured plant organ such as a leaf, and then its dynamic mechanical properties are analyzed and relevant model parameters are evaluated. Further, by using the physical model with evaluated parameters, we can calculate the next positions of a maker to reconstruct the missing makers in motion capture sequence. We take an example of a maize leaf and pachira leaf to examine the proposed approach, and the results show that the physics-based method is feasible and effective for plant motion data processing.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of influenza viruses is a highly complex process that is still poorly understood. Multiyear persistence of similar variants and accumulating evidences of existence of multigenic traits indicates that influenza viruses operate as integrated units and not only as sets of distinct genes. However, there is still no consensus on whether it is the case, and to what extent. One of the main problems is the lack of framework for analyzing and interpreting large body of available high dimensional genomic, clinical and epidemiological data. By reducing dimensionality of data we intend to show whether in addition to gene-centric selective pressure, the evolution of influenza RNA segments is also shaped by their mutual interactions. Therefore, we will analyze how different complexity/entropy measures (Shannon entropy, topological entropy and Lempel–Ziv complexity) can be used to study evolution of nucleotide segments of different influenza subtypes, while reducing data dimensionality. We show that, at the nucleotide level, multiyear clusters of genome-wide entropy/complexity correlations emerged during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Our data are the first empirical results that indirectly support the suggestion that a component of influenza evolutionary dynamics involves correlation between RNA segments. Of all used complexity/entropy measures, Shannon entropy shows the best correlation with epidemiological data.",

Two kinds of noise and the reward for mutual cooperation oscillating between temptation and punishment payoffs with a variable speed were added similarly like few completely new strategies inspired by foreign policy behavior of states. The initial success of generous reciprocal altruists is no surprise, but the lacking relationship between frequency of interactions and cooperativeness at the level of pairs already suggests some similarity with the system of states. Yet, the most important outcome is victory of the balance of threat strategy in all reruns with a heterogeneous pool of actors, despite the fact that this strategy was one of the least cooperative ones. At the same time, rules pre-selected by their success in the homogeneous and cooperative environment were still able to sustain intensive cooperation among themselves even within the heterogeneous pool of strategies.",

For many components in them, service loadings they suffered are usually random and nonstationary due to their remarkable characteristic called cyclic operation. To deal with that, section method can be applied. However, this method will neglect those transition cycles caused by switching load section, which can contribute a lot to fatigue. In order to consider those transition cycles, this paper applied the model called “Switching Markov Chain of Turning Points” (SMCTP). Then the expected rain-flow matrix is compared with the overall rain-flow matrix conducted by section method. The comparison result shows that SMCTP can perform well in processing nonstationary loadings. As a result, the Switching Markov Chain method (SMC) was proved to be effective in stochastically characterizing the nonstationary switching loadings of engineering vehicles.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, using the theoretical analysis method, according to the actual structure of the hanging leaf spring of the traction motor mounted on the frame, the lateral force model of the hanging leaf spring of the traction motor was established. Then, through theoretical deduction, the deformation analytical calculation formula and the stress analytical calculation formula of the hanging leaf spring were established. The correctness of the leaf spring’s lateral force model was established and its deformation and stress analytical formulae were verified using ANSYS finite element analysis software. Based on this, according to the deformation analytical formula and the stress analytical formula of the leaf spring established, the influence of the main structural parameters on the mechanical characteristics of the leaf spring was discussed, and the reliability of the analytical analysis method of the lateral mechanical characteristics of the traction motor hanging leaf spring was verified by the loading–unloading test. The results show that the deformation and the load of the leaf spring change linearly. The changes of leaf spring’s stress at different positions can be considered as being composed of three sections: a linear change section in the root, a nonlinear change section in the middle, and a nonlinear change section in the end. In the structural parameters, the end thickness [Formula: see text] has the greatest influence on the stiffness and the stress of the leaf spring, and the maximum thickness of the leaf spring eye [Formula: see text] has the least influence on the stiffness and the stress of the leaf spring. The influence degree of other parameters on the stiffness of the leaf spring is [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] in order, and the influence degree on the stress of the leaf spring is [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] in order. In addition, when the root thickness [Formula: see text] is greater than a certain value, the maximum stress point of the leaf spring appears at the end position [Formula: see text].

This device synchronizes with normal heart activities to help foster its performance. Consequently, its sensitive design requires high accuracy.

As there are various types of VAD under different designs, it is neither practical nor plausible to experimentally/clinically investigate their performances. Therefore, in the concurrent study, a numerical study was carried out on four different generation prototypes of VAD pumps for reaching an optimum design. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, the software derived, showed and streamlined the flow field shear stress both inside the VAD and its blades. Furthermore, the vortices and flow rate-pressure curves were observed. The results showed that the curved blade pumps operate better compared to that of the straight blade types, concerning the provision of enough pressure and less damage to the red blood cells. The results have implications not only for comparing different types of VAD designs but also for understanding the resulted shear stresses and pressures as a result of the blade’s structure.",

    "abstract": "A cellular automaton model called the Firm Dynamics Model (FDM) is introduced to simulate the dynamics of firms within an economy. The model includes the growth of firms and their mergers and exits. The main objective is to compare the size-frequency distributions in the model with the empirical firm size distributions of several countries (USA, UK, Spain and Sweden). The empirical size distributions were assembled from business censuses and additional information on the country’s largest companies in terms of the number of employees. For the four datasets analyzed here, the firm size distribution is compatible with a power law of the Pareto type with an exponent of close to two (for the probability density). For its part, the model delivers two different size-frequency distributions depending on the type of merger that firms can undergo: the friendly-merger version gives rise to subcritical distributions with an exponential tail, whereas the aggressive-merger version produces power-law distributions. The simulation model was run with underlying lattices in one, two and three dimensions in order to compare the simulated power-law exponent with the empirical one. The best agreement was obtained with the two-dimensional aggressive-merger model version, for which the power-law exponent is [Formula: see text], as compared with an empirical exponent of [Formula: see text] (average over the four datasets). Further simulations with the model on a Bethe lattice confirm that the two-dimensional model provides the best fit to the empirical exponent.",

Consider the event as a nonlinear system and the metrics of analysis consisting of two dependent random variables 0 and 1, with memory and probabilities in maximum finite or infinite lengths, constant and equal to 1/2 for both variables (stationary process). The expressions of the possible trajectories of metric space represented by each binary parameter remain constant in sequences that are repeated alternating the presence or absence of one of the binary variables at each iteration (symmetric or asymmetric). It was observed that the binary variables [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] assume on time [Formula: see text] specific behaviors (geometric variable) that can be used as management tools in discrete and continuous nonlinear systems aiming at the optimization of resource’s usage, nonlinearity analysis and probabilistic distribution of trajectories occurring about random events. In this way, the paper presents a model of detecting fixed-point attractions and its probabilistic distributions at a given population-resource dynamic. This means that coupling oscillations in the event occur when the binary variables [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are limited as a function of time [Formula: see text].",

Although the quantization error cannot be controlled fully, still statistical error analysis helps us to measure the performance of stereo systems that relies on the imaging parameters. Generally, it is assumed that the quantization error in 2D images is distributed uniformly that need not to be true from a practical aspect. In this paper, we have incorporated noise distributions (Triangular and Trapezoidal) for the stochastic error analysis of the quantization error in stereo imaging systems.

From the magnons dispersion curves and group velocity data of 2D spins crystallographic waveguide, we deduce the data used as an up input–output set to feed the ANNM. The input data are being given by the magnons modes over high symmetry points, or, by the group velocity of the magnon modes. However, the basis vectors of matrix notation and the rotation angle that aligns the unit cell of the reconstructed surface are giving the output data. The proposed neurocomputing model was capable of predicting the 2D crystals for the possible arrangements that the surface might take.

These applications are submitted to the cloud in the form of simulation jobs. Meanwhile, the management and scheduling of simulation jobs are playing an essential role to offer efficient and high productivity computational service. In this paper, we design a management and scheduling service framework for simulation jobs in two-tier virtualization-based private cloud data center, named simulation execution as a service (SimEaaS). It aims at releasing users from complex simulation running settings, while guaranteeing the QoS requirements adaptively. Furthermore, a novel job scheduling algorithm named adaptive deadline-aware job size adjustment (ADaSA) algorithm is designed to realize high job responsiveness under QoS requirement for SimEaaS. ADaSA tries to make full use of the idle fragmentation resources by tuning the number of requested processes of submitted jobs in the queue adaptively, while guaranteeing that jobs’ deadline requirements are not violated. Extensive experiments with trace-driven simulation are conducted to evaluate the performance of our ADaSA. The results show that ADaSA outperforms both cloud-based job scheduling algorithm KCEASY and traditional EASY in terms of response time (up to 90%) and bounded slow down (up to 95%), while obtains approximately equivalent deadline-missed rate. ADaSA also outperforms two representative moldable scheduling algorithms in terms of deadline-missed rate (up to 60%).",

Implementing a leaky bucket could be needed to achieve flows effective monitoring by generating network of queues at given output link. Packets associated with different sessions and originated from different hosts may be mixed up and queuing delay may become longer, depending on network segment state, buffering strategy, users’ behavior among other factors. It is interesting to assimilate these stages of packets traveling through network segment to the concept of epidemic control. This paper proposes a SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) approach in modeling data packets transmission at a leaky bucket at peak hour. We focused our analysis on packets buffering and recovery strategy impact on segment forwarding performance in heavy load situation. Numerical results suggested adapting buffering strategy and packets recovery to enhance transmission and network overall performance.",

Subsequently, using the simulation results and for evaluating the scenarios through Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), each scenario was considered as a decision making unit (DMU). Since simulation results of each scenario are uncertain and differ for different iterations, a method was utilized capable of using the results of all iterations. On the other hand, indexes such as satisfaction, patient’s appropriate waiting, helpful servicing with the least number nurses and the maximum number services that have fuzzy nature, are important factors for MIC. Therefore, using the simulation results and considering the system manager’s idea, a method was proposed for determining the fuzzy values of these indexes. Next, a ranking model and an algorithm were proposed for determining a unique ranking and introducing the best scenario to improve the performance of MIC.",

Most of the current load balancing methods have problems such as high data flow loss rate and long response time; therefore, more effective load balancing method is urgently needed. Taking HBase as the research subject, the study analyzed the dynamic load balancing method of data flow. First, the HBase platform was introduced briefly, and then the dynamic load-balancing algorithm was designed. The data flow was divided into blocks, and then the load of nodes was predicted based on the grey prediction GM(1,1) model. Finally, the load was migrated through the dynamic adjustable method to achieve load balancing. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the method for load prediction was high, the average error percentage was 0.93%, and the average response time was short; under 3000 tasks, the response time of the method designed in this study was 14.17% shorter than that of the method combining TV white space (TVWS) and long-term evolution (LTE); the average flow of nodes with the largest load was also smaller, and the data flow loss rate was basically 0%. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can be further promoted and applied in practice.",

    "abstract": "Traffic assignment is an important stage in the task of modeling a transportation system. Several methods for solving the traffic assignment problem (TAP) were proposed, mostly based on iterative procedures. However, little was done in the direction of analyzing the difficulty of such procedures. For instance, why is it that some networks require orders of magnitude more iterations than others? What matters in this task? Clearly, the topology of the network can only give hints up to a certain level; the assignment task is fundamentally tied to how the demand is distributed (among other characteristics of the problem). This means that methods to estimate the complexity of a network (e.g. those based on centrality measures) can only help up to a certain level. The motivation for this work is to, a priori, estimate how hard will the effort underlying solving the TAP be (i.e. without doing the actual assignment). It arose from the fact that after performing assignment in several different networks, we noted that finding the solution for the problem was much easier for some networks than for others. Specifically, the more complex the network, the more difficulty it is to setup the parameters underlying the procedure for solving the TAP. In this work, we propose a new measure of how coupled routes in a network are, based on an estimation of the demand distribution. Our approach involves three main steps: (i) sampling the universe of all possible assignments, (ii) creating a model that gives the incentive a road user has for changing routes, as well as the asymptotic distribution of preference for routes, and (iii) computing the entropy of this distribution. This approach is experimentally validated using several networks of different natures. We then solve the TAP by letting road users use reinforcement learning to learn the user equilibrium. With this, we are able to make important relationships between the entropy values and how hard are the learning tasks. Results suggest that it is possible to use both the entropy values as well as the asymptotic distribution of preferences of the road users to gain important information that guides the traffic expert. For instance, the higher the entropy, the higher the indication that more than one route is perceived as preferable and, hence, the more difficult the learning task.",

In complex real-life systems, this relationship is not trivial and even the result at the macro-level can be counter-intuitive. One of the first models that highlights this is the Sakoda and Schelling’s model of spatial segregation where a person uses a selfish rule to decide whether or not to leave his current place; on the basis of the ratio of “compatible” agents in the neighborhood of each individual, simulations have shown that tolerant agents group together beyond what their own tolerance imposes. This paper compares the macro-behavior arising from either selfish or altruist micro-motives; for this purpose, we propose agent-based computational models based, respectively, on selfishness, altruism and a mixture of both. Computational simulations show that (i) in a totally altruistic population, a vast majority becomes satisfied as if the agents were themselves selfish and end up spatially segregated; (ii) altruist micro-motives allow to reduce both the micro-macro gap and the segregation phenomenon; (iii) in a mixed population, the macro-effect depends both on the respective weight of each micro-motives and the allocation strategy.",

We derive time-continuous formulations of both models, and in particular, we discuss the impact of the time-scaling on the model behavior for the Levy–Levy–Solomon model. For the Franke–Westerhoff model, we proof that a constraint required in the original model is not necessary for stability of the time-continuous model. It is shown that a semi-implicit discretization of the time-continuous system preserves this unconditional stability. In addition, this semi-implicit discretization can be computed at cost comparable to the original model. Furthermore, we discuss possible probabilistic descriptions of time-continuous agent-based computational economic market models. Especially, we present the potential advantages of kinetic theory in order to derive mesoscopic descriptions of agent-based models.

    "abstract": "A system identification approach for the analysis of electrochemical noise data is proposed. The most common techniques, used by many investigators, are based on: (i) the ratio of sample standard deviations, which gives no information about the frequency dependence of the electrode impedance, or (ii) Power Spectral Density estimates, which deliver the modulus of the spectrum with large variations at the lowest frequencies. Phase is, almost invariably, not included. In this work, the electrochemical cell is modeled by an input-output model. With the application of system identification techniques, it is possible to identify values of the parameters of the system model. It is shown that this approach delivers a description of the system under study with: smooth electrode impedance curves, and magnitude and phase information. Some results obtained with the most common electrochemical noise analysis techniques are presented for comparison with the proposed approach. A theoretical limitation of the proposed approach appears if a perfect symmetry between both electrodes is considered.",

The material studied consists of monodisperse spherical glass beads confined to a long, thin cylindrical tube. Changes in vibration intensity are used to induce transitions between two steady state densities that depend on the intensity of the vibrations. We find a complex time evolution similar to previous work on the irreversible relaxation from a loose state toward a steady state. In addition, frequency dependent third order moments of the density fluctuations are measured. The data indicate a coupling between large variations in density on one time scale and noise power over a broad range of higher-frequency scales.",

The agent is assumed to know the state of congestion of only the café he visits, and he learns to predict the café's congestion. The simulation results can be summarized as follows: (i) the agent is not necessarily acquiring the correct cognition for the café's congestion, even though sufficient time goes by; (ii) the agents are bifurcated into two groups which consist of agents with cognitions that the congestion of the café they do not visit is significantly more congested than the actual congestion; and (iii) the system does not necessarily converge to a Nash equilibrium, which is a theoretical solution, when the system's structure changes.",

Moreover, the Fitness function of HACABM is utilized to calculate the support count of each item and to improve the classification accuracy. Thus the proposed models classify the frequently utilized items accurately and arranged those items in descending order.

Our proposed process could support established verification processes by sampling the simulation components to identify whether the model is acceptably error free and which components require correcting. The proposed methodology relies on several statistical constraints but serves the interests of simulation professionals as part of the overall verification process.

Most computation models for mesh saliency focus on geometrical information alone. Nevertheless, the ignored texture, lighting and material also provide more detailed appearance information, especially in the context of static scene rendering. In this paper, we propose a mesh saliency detection algorithm considering both geometrical and colorimetric information to address this challenge. Our model first computes the local curvature entropy at multi-scale to capture the geometrical details. Second, a set of images are projected onto the screen at several viewpoints with specified material and lighting model. Potentially salient regions on the rendered images are detected by fusion of multiple color difference maps measured with an approximated multi-scale Laplacian of Gaussian filter. A Gaussian distribution-based central bias model is applied to the image saliency map to emphasize the global rarity of salient regions. Third, the saliency maps of rendered images are projected back to the 3D mesh via the ray casting method. In the end, both saliency maps are combined linearly as the saliency map of 3D mesh. Experiment on the human fixation database demonstrates the performance of our method compared to the classic methods in terms of linear correlation coefficient and AUC.",

But it still remains a classical scientific problem both in thermodynamics and aerospace science. In view of the complex HV structure and complex heat conduction procedure, three-dimensional numerical simulation is too inefficient for online prediction, while current rapid computation methods cannot meet the requirement of accuracy. Therefore, a hybrid intelligent dynamic modeling approach is proposed to estimate the surface temperature of HV with the combination of mechanism equations, test data and intelligent modeling technology. A simplified model based on a mechanism equation and experimental formulas is presented for predicting or simulating transient heat conduction procedure efficiently, while a case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm is developed to estimate two uncertain coefficients in the simplified model. Furthermore, a support vector regression (SVR)-based model is developed to compensate the modeling error. With the data both from high-precision finite element computation and from real-world HV thermal protection experiments, a number of comparative simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid intelligent modeling approach.",

With IDS, it may mechanically categorize intrusions, attacks, or breaches of security stratagems across host-level within the network and within the organization. The Krill Herd Optimized Deep Neural Network (KH-DNN) is proposed in this document as a multiclass cyberattack methodology. This model is suggested by uniting the network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) and the host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) to advance flexible and actual IDS to categorize and detect unexpected and unpredictable cyber attacks. In this method, two types of IDS are classified, that is, NIDS and HIDS. Classification of the system call is exploited to discriminate behavior into normal and attack categories. In this manuscript accuracy, the parameter of the deep neural network classifier is optimized with the Krill Herd optimization algorithm. Finally, the DNN model is performed in the NIDS dataset and the HIDS dataset. For the HIDS dataset, the KDD Cup 99 dataset was used, which employed two datasets: ADFA-LD and ADFA-WD, and several types of attacks were detected and classified, including Adduser, Hydra-FTP, Java-Meterpreter, Hydra-SSH, and Web-Shell. The suggested IDS-KH-DNN algorithm attains higher accuracy 42.56% and 23.4%, high precision 84.74% and 52.43%, high F-score 53.5% 64.455, high sensitivity 33.4% and 45.23%, and high specificity 31.45% and 44.23% for the NIDS dataset. The proposed system is compared to two current processes: intrusion detection using Gray Wolf optimization-based support vector machine (IDS-GWO-SVM) and intrusion detection using artificial bee colony optimization algorithm based support vector machine (IDS-ABCO-SVM). Finally, the simulation results show that the suggested approach is capable of quickly and accurately locating optimal solutions.",

For a simplicial mesh, the reconstruction which performed on every element rather than on the patch of the elements of the mesh or on the dual mesh is achieved by solving a third (or fourth)-order linear equations on every element and a second-order linear equations on every edge or face.

We evaluate different estimation procedures for parameters of MB family comprehensively. Moreover, the confidence interval and highest posterior density interval estimators of parameters are provided. The different estimation methods of the parameters of two certain cases of the MB family are compared via the simulation data. Based on the simulation approach, we realized the estimates are convergent to the real values of the parameters and the root mean squared error (RMSE) values derived by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are less than Newton–Raphson (NR), stochastic EM (SEM) and Bayes estimators. Also, the higher values of the sample size lead to better estimates in the sense close to true parameter values and having smaller RMSE values. The reliability analysis of MB family is another topic in this paper, with simulation discussion. The Monte Carlo simulations are provided to assess the performances of estimation methods. We concluded the Bayesian shrinkage estimators are better than other methods of the reliability function, which have the smallest values of the RMSE.

    "abstract": "Modeling and Simulation Technology has become an important means to study various complex systems with its extensive application. Thus, the accuracy of the simulation models becomes a critical problem and needs to be assessed by employing an appropriate model validation method. The simulation models often have multivariate dynamic responses with uncertainty, while most of the existing validation methods concentrate on the validation of the static responses. Hence, a new validation method is proposed in this paper to validate the dynamic responses of the simulation models over the time domain at a single validation site and multiple validation sites through introducing the discrete Chebyshev polynomials and area metric. For each time series, the orthogonal expansion coefficients are extracted primarily by representing the time series with the discrete orthogonal polynomials. Then, the area metric and the [Formula: see text]-pooling metric are employed to validate all the uncorrelated coefficients at a single validation site and multiple validation sites, respectively, and the final validation result is obtained by summarizing the metric values. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model validation method are illustrated through the example of the terminal guidance stage of the flight vehicle.",

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are being introduced by different manufacturers as an eco-friendly alternative to vehicles with internal combustion engines, provided with several benefits. In the upcoming years, the count of EVs is expected to expand. However, the uncoordinated charging of these vehicles can put severe stress on the power grid. The problem of charge scheduling of EVs is an important issue and has seen significant research activity in the past few years. Thus, this survey paper intents to perform a review of 65 research works about this scenario that operate with different approaches under a diverse period of time. Particularly, this paper describes about the power flow model, scheduling control mechanism and type of charging followed in EVs. The performance measures recorded in each of the works are described here. Finally, a compact description on research gaps and challenges relying on this aspect is made that aids the researchers in doing future works.",

Although this method can realize the accurate evaluation of the internal structure layout, control devices, and interface display of the cockpit, it is difficult to make modifications once the production is completed, which is not suitable for multi-scheme comparison and rapid iteration in the early stage of civil aircraft design. In this regard, this paper establishes the civil aircraft cockpit physical environment and the corresponding virtual cockpit environment based on the virtual-real matching technology, then proposes a mixed reality simulation evaluation method so as to realize the real-time ergonomic evaluation of the digital human body followed by a real person. Experimental results show that this mixed reality simulation evaluation method can effectively improve the evaluation accuracy of cockpit design, ensure the efficiency of multi-scheme comparison and optimization iteration in the early stage of cockpit design.",

It can be difficult to make an accurate PD diagnosis since the signs and symptoms, especially early on, might be mistaken for other medical diseases or physiological changes associated with normal aging. This research proposed novel technique in predicting PD based on dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan) images of brain using deep learning techniques. Here the aim is to collect the historical data and live DaTscan image of patients with symptoms of PD and predict disease. Initially input data have been pre-processed for image resize, noise removal and smoothening. Then the processed image has been selected based on their features using kernel-based deep convolution neural network (KDCNN). The selected deep features have been classified using reinforcement Q-learning-based neural networks (RQLNNs) to predict the presence of PD. Here experimental results show feature-selected and classified output of DaTscan brain image using the proposed model. For MRI image dataset, the proposed technique obtained accuracy of 97.5%, precision of 93%, recall of 82% and F-1 score of 87%.

We overcome this problem by identifying critical microservices that play a vital role and then propose a fault-tolerant candidate for each critical microservice. The approach finds critical microservices based on the proposed parameter-based greedy strategies and analyzes the vulnerability of the software design in terms of resiliency while removing the important microservices from the software network. We examine our proposed microservice architectural style to fit the requirements of a smart city in cloud-native applications using a new metric introduced in terms of a microservice runtime degree (RD) and aggregative importance links. The results show the decline rate of network efficiency is maximum with removing the nodes based on this new structural metric. Furthermore, the resilience loss triangle metric based on RD, which corresponds to the shaded area between the expected and full performance of the observed curves, will have a greater value than other metrics.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one among the dreadful cancer which is caused due to formation in breast cells. Earlier recognition of breast cancer is most required in the medical field to avoid the dangerous threat to human life. This is carried out in the existing work, namely Predictive Modeling Technique (PMT). Existing work cannot handle the database with noises properly which might lead to inaccurate prediction outcome. These problems are addressed by introducing Deep Learning-based Breast Cancer Disease Prediction Framework (DLBCDPF). The proposed research framework objective is to present the structures for the disease diagnosis in a further accurate way. In this work, feature selection is achieved through optimization algorithm, namely ranking-based bee colony approach by which the most optimal feature is chosen from the training dataset. The fitness values considered in this work for optimal feature selection are F-score values. Each feature’s F-score and N numbers of feature’s F-score are arranged in a descending manner; in addition, feature subset with more than one feature are produced. In this phase, diagnosis of various stomach-related problems is done through a unique hybridized classification methodology. In this hybridization methodology, clustering is accomplished before classification, and data pruning is attained in every classification iteration. This leads to improved classification accuracy owing to efficient diagnosis. The clustering is attained by fuzzy C-means clustering, and classification is done using the improved deep neural network. The entire research analysis is carried out in python platform for breast cancer dataset from which it is substantiated that the suggested research work tends to outperform in an enhanced way than prevailing work.",

It comes along with an abstract simulation algorithm which defines its operational semantics. Many variants of such an algorithm have been proposed by DEVS researchers. Yet, the proper interpretation and analysis of the computational complexity of such approaches have not been systematically addressed and defined. As systems become larger and more complex, the efficiency of the DEVS simulation algorithms in terms of time complexity measure becomes a major issue. Therefore, it is necessary to devise a method for computing this complexity. This paper proposes a generic method to address such an issue, taking advantage of the recursion embedded in the triggered-by-message principle of the DEVS simulation protocol. The applicability of the method is shown through the complexity analysis of various DEVS simulation algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Video surveillance has risen as one of the most promising methods for people who live alone in their dwellings. Few video surveillance innovations have recently been introduced. However, due to various changes in illumination, abrupt shifts in target appearance, identical non-target artifacts in the background, and occlusions, developing a reliable video surveillance algorithm remains a difficult challenge. This work attempts to introduce a new framework for moving object detection and tracking by following four major phases: “Video-to-Frame Conversion, Pre-Processing, Background Subtraction, Feature-Based Multi-object Detection, Multi-object Tracking by Filtering”. Initially, in the Video-to-Frame Conversion process, the recorded input video clips are transformed into distinct frames. During pre-processing, the noise is removed from the video frame using a filtering approach, and thereby the nature of the images will be enhanced. In the proposed work, a Weiner filter is used to remove noise and other undesirable features during the pre-processing. Then, to distinguish the frontal areas of objects, background subtraction is performed using the neutrosophic set in noiseless video frames (pre-processed frames). The objects in the background-subtracted frames are separated using Improved Region Growing (IRG) segmentation model in the Feature-Based Multi-object Detection phase. The objects in the frames are determined from this segmented image. The Modified Full Search Algorithm is being used to track the object (motion estimation) on the video frame after it has been identified in the segmented phase. The Modified full search block matching algorithm (MFSA) is introduced in this research work to find the appropriate mobility. Promising results have been obtained by the proposed work, and also the mathematical excellence of the new method is also proven over other state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer has been identified as the world’s leading cause of death. Precise detection and testing of lung nodules at an early stage are essential for the diagnosis of lung cancer, therefore, it is one of the best ways to prevent deaths of lung cancer. An automated nodule detection system provides a second opinion to radiologists during early diagnosis. Much existing research uses Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNNs) for lung nodules classification. However, DCNNs normally need careful tuning of hyperparameters to reveal their excellent performance. Although, with the increasing size of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, the evaluation cost of the traditional optimization algorithms has become deplorable in most cases. Also, Lung CT scans data have a data imbalance problem inherently. So, to solve those problems, this paper proposes IISH-2D DCNN for lung nodule classification. The proposed methodology consists of pre-processing and classification phases. In the pre-processing phase, the 3D-CT scan slice is converted into a 2D-slice, and then the nodule boundary is extracted by calculation of ROI. After that, the extracted boundary is given as input to the IISH-2D DCNN that classifies the lung nodules. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared to the existing works based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. Thus, the proposed model outperforms existing lung nodule classification methodologies with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity that are 99.8%, 97%, and 99%, respectively. Also, the proposed methodology has fewer errors than the state-of-the-art methods. Hence, the suggested method attains better performance in lung nodule classification and proves to be more effective.",

The proposed method has two main steps: first, possible solution space of the problem is generated using an optical manner and then all invalid solutions are eliminated from the space by several designed optical filters.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the performance of a new probability model developed in terms of the surface area and velocity of an aero-structure, and presents some relevant statistical inferences. Several examples will compare the robustness of three kinds of point estimators developed for the lift coefficient. Four different types of confidence intervals for the lift coefficient are also developed, and it is shown that the shortest length confidence interval is an UMA confidence interval. Using the probability model, the correlation coefficient between lift and velocity, and the relevant regression slope are computed. The inferences and the results of this paper can be used particularly in the designing process of an aero-structure, especially when there is some uncertainty about its surface area; this provides some flexibilities for aerodynamicists in determining some of the unknown design characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that has drawn interest from both industry and academia in the modern digital era. The IoT provides a platform for any device to connect and share data over the Internet. Because of the diverse IoT environment and resource-constrained IoT devices, this nascent technology has numerous security challenges. Due to the lack of fine-grained access control and flexibility, traditional cryptographic algorithms such as private key encryption and public-key encryption are not suitable for providing access control mechanisms. ABE (Attribute-Based Encryption) is a new cryptographic approach that not only provides security but also fine-grained access control. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of ABE and its various forms, such as key policy ABE and ciphertext policy ABE, based on access structure, multi-authority, and hierarchy features. Further access structures used in ABE and applications of the ABE technique in IoT are also discussed. A comparison of different ABE schemes is presented regarding features, efficiency, and security. In addition, numerous schemes are analyzed to uncover obstacles, issues, and gaps that need to be investigated further.",

We apply the model to the analysis of stability of the global input–output sectoral network using the data from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). We show that this sectoral network appears to be very stable with respect to sectoral shocks. However, by introducing synthetic substructure of economic sectors in the WIOD data we show that this stability is to a significant extent an artifact of working with aggregated data. Namely, we show that the impact of economic shocks may be much more pronounced if an underlying disaggregated network is sufficiently sparse.",

    "abstract": "Visual speech is hard to recreate by human hands because animation itself is a time-consuming task: both precision and detail must be considered and match the expectations of the developers, but above all, those of the audience. To solve this problem, some approaches has been designed to help accelerate the animation of characters faces, as procedural animation or speech-lip synchronization, where the most common areas for researching these methods are Computer Vision and Machine Learning. However, in general, these tools can have any of these main problems: difficulty on adapting to another language, subject or animation software, high hardware specifications, or the results can be receipted as robotic. Our work presents a Deep Learning model for automatic expressive facial animation using audio. We extract generic audio features from expressive audio speeches rich in phonemes for nonidiom focus speech processing and emotion recognition. From videos used for training, we extracted the landmarks for frame-speech targeting and have the model learn animation for phonemes pronunciation. We evaluated four variants of our model (two function losses and with emotion conditioning) by using a user perspective survey where the one using a Reconstruction Loss Function with emotion training conditioning got more natural results and score in synchronization with the approval of the majority of interviewees. For perception of naturalness, it obtained a 38.89% of the total votes of approval and for language synchronization obtained the highest average score with 65.55% (98.33 of a 150 total points) for English, German and Korean languages.",

Keralites’ mother tongue, Malayalam, is the most often used language to express themselves on Twitter. As there is no automatic Sentiment Analyzer in Malayalam, the SA of Twitter messages is necessary. In this research work, a Malayalam sentiment analysis model is introduced. The input raw data in the form of reviews are fed for the pre-processing stage. The pre-processing module includes sentence tokenization via Sandi Splitting and parts of speech (POS) tagging. Subsequently, Bag of Word, the Proposed weightage-based Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Unigram with the dictionary and Unigram with dictionary including negation words have been considered for feature vector formation. Finally, the review classification is undergone via the proposed hybrid classifier, which is constructed by hybridizing the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), respectively. To enhance the classification performance, the weight of the CNN classifier will be fine-tuned via an Improved Bumble bee mating Optimization (IBBMO), which is an advanced version of standard BBMO. The performance of the proposed work is compared over other conventional models in terms of positive, negative, convergence, and other measures. The accuracy of the proposed method is 95.436, which is much better than the existing works like DBN[Formula: see text]86.25, NN[Formula: see text]87.080, SVM[Formula: see text]87.234, WOA+Hybrid Classifier[Formula: see text]88.440, LA+Hybrid Classifier[Formula: see text]89.35285, CSO+Hybrid Classifier[Formula: see text]92.021, BBMO+Hybrid Classifier[Formula: see text]93.4248, and ML techniques[Formula: see text]94.014, at the 90th training percentage.",

The neighbor selection rule of nodes is adjusted based on their fitness and collective influence. Under the degree-normalized payoff framework, the findings derived from Monte Carlo simulations reveal that this mixed selecting model can contribute to an impressive improvement in the Barabási-Albert network’s cooperation. In addition, experimental data obtained by investigating the game-learning skeleton indicate that, in this mixed random-conformity selecting model, normalized collective influence at moderate depth length enables influential nodes to maintain a cooperative strategy for an extended period of time. This can promote the emergence of cooperative strategies at low-degree nodes by facilitating the formation of stable cooperation-clusters centered on high-degree nodes. In addition, the normalized collective influence at excessive depth length increases the likelihood that influential nodes become defectors, thereby inhibiting the growth of cooperation-clusters and limiting cooperation.",

    "abstract": "We consider a description of genomic organization based on a neural network model of associative memory (Hopfield's model). This description is consonant with the view that the cell cycle involves transitions between successive phases, each entailing an assortment of metabolically distinct states. A picture emerges where a cell at a particular state in its life cycle fulfills its metabolic needs through a specific set of genetic patterns, comprising a characteristic, stable one, plus those belonging to its basin of attraction in the sense of the neural network metaphor. A gene may belong to more than one stable configuration, so its function will depend on its context as defined by the particular pattern playing a dominant role at any given moment. The model provides a conceptual framework in genomic analysis and yields quantitative results in some cases, that can be assessed using observable data. For example, it allows consideration of a genome's resilience under variation of its genetic interactions. It also suggests an upper bound on the number of stable genetic patterns in prokaryotes and archaeons, close to 14% of their total endowment of genes. We test this estimate against available information from sequenced genomes.",

In particular, our analysis focuses on a multi-item inventory computer model with stochastically dependent demands, a queueing computer network where there are dependent arrival and service processes, or a reliability computer model with stochastically dependent component lifetimes. We discuss cases where this dependence is induced only by a random environmental process which the system operates in. This process represents the sources of variation that affect all deterministic and stochastic parameters of the model. Thus, not only are the parameters of the model now stochastic processes, but they are all dependent due to the common environment they are all subject to. Our objective is to provide a convincing argument that, under fairly reasonable conditions, the analytical techniques used in these models as well as their solutions are not much more complicated than those where there is no environmental variation.",

The achievement of the paper lies in the fact that a multiple-pattern complex event matching model based on merge sharing is presented to successfully realize the quick matching of related primitive events for multiple complex events from the massive event streams. Specifically, in our scheme, we successfully use merge sharing technology to merge all the same prefixes, suffixes or subpatterns existing in single-pattern matching models into shared ones and to construct a multiple-pattern complex event matching model. As a result, our proposed matching model in this paper can effectively solve the above problem.

An algorithm for constructing an aggregated relation based on the summation of preferences by criteria is developed. Aggregate relation depends on the method of specifying the distance between the matrices of preferences. The proposed algorithms for constructing an aggregated relation can use coefficients of importance of criteria. The method can be applied in collective choice problems when assigning estimates to alternatives by experts. A comparison of the proposed algorithms with each other and with known decision-making methods is carried out. The software system of multi-criteria choice is developed. The task of choosing start-up projects for the purpose of investing by a venture fund has been solved.",

    "abstract": "The road damage coefficient [Formula: see text] is a significant indicator to estimate the degree of the road damage caused by vehicles. The existing calculation method of [Formula: see text] is not convenient for the engineering application. To effectively evaluate the damage degree and facilitate the engineering application, this paper studied the simple and reliable analytical calculation method of [Formula: see text]. Firstly, a dynamic model of the vehicle–road system was created. The tire pressure and the tire damping were considered in the model. Moreover, the relationship between the tire vertical stiffness and the tire pressure is approximated as a linear function. Secondly, based on the dynamic model, according to the definition of [Formula: see text], a concise analytical formula of [Formula: see text] was derived and verified by numerical simulations. The relative errors of the analytical calculation results are all less than 0.1%. Thirdly, the influences of the tire pressure [Formula: see text], the damping ratio [Formula: see text] of the suspension system, and the damping ratio [Formula: see text] of the wheel system on [Formula: see text] were analyzed. Moreover, based on the analytical formula of [Formula: see text], a mathematical model of the optimal damping matching for the suspension system was established and a case study was also given. The research results show that the larger the tire pressure [Formula: see text], the larger the value of [Formula: see text] is. For each [Formula: see text], there is an optimal damping ratio [Formula: see text]. If the tire damping is ignored, it will lead to the design error for [Formula: see text]. Finally, some important conclusions were drawn. The analytical formula of [Formula: see text] and the conclusions can provide valuable references for the analysis of the road damage and the initial design of vehicle suspensions.",

Based on the ADAMS software, this paper establishes a simplified vibration mill mechanical model, analyzes the singularity and stability of the system, and determines the critical speed at which the vibration motor becomes chaotic according to the bifurcation diagram. Then the chaotic state of the grinding machine with sinusoidal variation in its motor speed is studied based on the Poincaré principle, singular attractor and maximum Lyapunov exponent. Lastly, a 200[Formula: see text]h vibration test on diamond powder with an average particle size of 10 [Formula: see text]m was carried out. Test results under the two operating conditions of variable and constant speeds are compared and analyzed. Our results show that with variable speed the vibration mill achieved higher grinding efficiency but smaller particle grain size.

Firstly, by Ablowitz–Ladik model (A–L model), the NLSE is discretized into a non-canonical Hamiltonian system. Then, different kinds of coordinate transformations can be used to standardize the non-canonical Hamiltonian system. Therefore, the symplectic schemes and symmetric schemes can be employed to simulate the solitons motion and test the preservation of the invariants of the A–L model and the conserved quantities approximations of the original NLSE. The numerical experiments show that symplectic schemes and symmetric schemes have similar simulation effect, and own significant superiority over non-symplectic and non-symmetric schemes in long-term tracking the motion of solitons, preserving the invariants and the approximations of conserved quantities. Moreover, it is obvious that coordinate transformations with more symmetry have a better simulation effect.",

Transmitted via the mosquito bite, the dengue virus infects Langerhans cells. Monocytes, B lymphocytes, and mast cells infected with dengue virus produce various cytokines although it is not clear which ones are predominant during DHF disease. A mathematical model of the Dengue virus infection is developed according to complex dynamics determined by many factors. Starting from a state of equilibrium that we could define as “virus-free” asymptotically stable with a viral reproduction number lower than one which means a very effective action of the innate immune system: it stops the infectious process, the mathematical analysis of stability in the presence of the virus demonstrates that the proposed model is dynamically influenced. Dengue fever affects more than half of the world’s population, with 1 billion symptomatic cases and multiple genetic serotypes confirmed each year, which simulates a network of interactions between the various populations involved without considering the speeds of the processes in question which are indicated in a separate computation. In this research, a hybrid approach of petri nets is utilized to connect the discrete models of dengue.",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is a well-known characteristic of diverse parameterized supervised learning models. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) face severe catastrophic forgetting or catastrophic interference in the sequential learning of information that is intolerable to both engineering applications and the human memory model. This problem can be solved through the machine learning community. The main intent of this paper is to implement a novel continuous learning model that could overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting. The stream data from diverse benchmark sources are used for experimenting. The proposed model adopts the Deep Neural Network (DNN) with testing weight updates. When new data are given, the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm helps to update the weight that manages to prevent the learning from catastrophic forgetting. The weight update strategy for solving the catastrophic forgetting is done by the hybridization of Shark Smell Optimization (SSO) and Jaya Algorithm (JA) that is named as Hybrid Shark Smell with Jaya Optimization (HSS-JO). A multi-objective function concerning the parameters associated with catastrophic forgetting like accuracy and remembering is used for framing the proposed continuous learning. The proof of the proposed model over conventional models on three publicly available datasets is given for final validation. From the analysis, in Table 3, the accuracy of the proposed HSS-JO-DNN is 38%, 0.5%, 0.55%, 0.14%, 0.98%, and 0.5% superior to DT, NB, KNN, SVM, NN, and RNN, respectively. For dataset 2, the FNR of the proposed HSS-JO-DNN is 90% superior to DT, 89% improved than NB, KNN, and NN, 94% improved than SVM, and 24% improved than RNN. Similarly, the proposed HSS-JO performance is higher in all the results. Thus, the proposed HSS-JO performs better than all the other traditional methods.",
