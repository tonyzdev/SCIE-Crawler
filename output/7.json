    "abstract": "Abstract Personalized medicine has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare sector, its goal being to tailor medication to a particular individual by taking into consideration the physiology, drug response, and genetic profile of that individual. There are many technologies emerging to cause this paradigm shift from the conventional “one size fits all” to personalized medicine, the major one being three-dimensional (3D) printing. 3D printing involves the establishment of a three-dimensional object, in a layer upon layer manner using various computer software. 3D printing can be used to construct a wide variety of pharmaceutical dosage forms varying in shape, release profile, and drug combination. The major technological platforms of 3D printing researched on in the pharmaceutical sector include inkjet printing, binder jetting, fused filament fabrication, selective laser sintering, stereolithography, and pressure-assisted microsyringe. A possible future application of this technology could be in a clinical setting, where prescriptions could be dispensed based on individual needs. This manuscript points out the various 3D printing technologies and their applications in research for fabricating pharmaceutical products, along with their pros and cons. It also presents its potential in personalized medicine by individualizing the dose, release profiles, and incorporating multiple drugs in a polypill. An insight on how it tends to various populations is also provided. An approach of how it can be used in a clinical setting is also highlighted. Also, various challenges faced are pointed out, which must be overcome for the success of this technology in personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "In the race for a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, pharmaceutical formulation science plays a critical role throughout the development, manufacturing, distribution, and vaccination phases. The proper choice of the type of vaccine, carrier or vector, adjuvant, excipients, dosage form, and route of administration can directly impact not only the immune responses induced and the resultant efficacy against COVID-19, but also the logistics of manufacturing, storing and distributing the vaccine, and mass vaccination. In this review, we described the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently tested in clinical trials and provided in-depth insight into the various types of vaccines, their compositions, advantages, and potential limitations. We also addressed how challenges in vaccine distribution and administration may be alleviated by applying vaccine-stabilization strategies and the use of specific mucosal immune response-inducing, non-invasive routes of administration, which must be considered early in the development process.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this review paper is to compare the potential of various techniques developed for production of homogenous, stable liposomes. Traditional techniques, such as Bangham, detergent depletion, ether/ethanol injection, reverse-phase evaporation and emulsion methods, were compared with the recent advanced techniques developed for liposome formation. The major hurdles for scaling up the traditional methods are the consumption of large quantities of volatile organic solvent, the stability and homogeneity of the liposomal product, as well as the lengthy multiple steps involved. The new methods have been designed to alleviate the current issues for liposome formulation. Dense gas liposome techniques are still in their infancy, however they have remarkable advantages in reducing the use of organic solvents, providing fast, single-stage production and producing stable, uniform liposomes. Techniques such as the membrane contactor and heating methods are also promising as they eliminate the use of organic solvent, however high temperature is still required for processing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The human eye is a sophisticated organ with distinctive anatomy and physiology that hinders the passage of drugs into targeted ophthalmic sites. Effective topical administration is an interest of scientists for many decades. Their difficult mission is to prolong drug residence time and guarantee an appropriate ocular permeation. Several ocular obstacles oppose effective drug delivery such as precorneal, corneal, and blood-corneal barriers. Routes for ocular delivery include topical, intravitreal, intraocular, juxtascleral, subconjunctival, intracameral, and retrobulbar. More than 95% of marketed products exists in liquid state. However, other products could be in semi-solid (ointments and gels), solid state (powder, insert and lens), or mixed ( in situ gel). Nowadays, attractiveness to nanotechnology-based carries is resulted from their capabilities to entrap both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, enhance ocular permeability, sustain residence time, improve drug stability, and augment bioavailability. Different in vitro , ex vivo, and in vivo characterization approaches help to predict the outcomes of the constructed nanocarriers. This review aims to clarify anatomy of the eye, various ocular diseases, and obstacles to ocular delivery. Moreover, it studies the advantages and drawbacks of different ocular routes of administration and dosage forms. This review also discusses different nanostructured platforms and their characterization approaches. Strategies to enhance ocular bioavailability are also explained. Finally, recent advances in ocular delivery are described. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The gemstone of 3-dimensional (3D) printing shines up from the pyramid of additive manufacturing. Three-dimensional bioprinting technology has been predicted to be a game-changing breakthrough in the pharmaceutical industry since the last decade. It is fast evolving and finds its seats in a variety of domains, including aviation, defense, automobiles, replacement components, architecture, movies, musical instruments, forensic, dentistry, audiology, prosthetics, surgery, food, and fashion industry. In recent years, this miraculous manufacturing technology has become increasingly relevant for pharmaceutical purposes. Computer-aided drug (CAD) model will be developed by computer software and fed into bioprinters. Based on material inputs, the printers will recognize and produce the model scaffold. Techniques including stereolithography, selective laser sintering, selective laser melting, material extrusion, material jetting, inkjet-based, fused deposition modelling, binder deposition, and bioprinting expedite the printing process. Distinct advantages are rapid prototyping, flexible design, print on demand, light and strong parts, fast and cost-effective, and environment friendly. The present review gives a brief description of the conceptional 3-dimensional printing, followed by various techniques involved. A short note was explained about the fabricating materials in the pharmaceutical sector. The beam of light is thrown on the various applications in the pharma and medical arena.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The importance of lipid-based formulations in addressing solubility and ultimately the bioavailability issues of the emerging drug entities is undeniable. Yet, there is scarcity of literature on lipid excipient chemistry and performance, notably in relation to oxidative stability. While not all lipid excipients are prone to oxidation, those with sensitive moieties offer drug delivery solutions that outweigh the manageable oxidative challenges they may present. For example, caprylocaproyl polyoxylglycerides help solubilize and deliver cancer drug to patients, lauroyl polyoxylglycerides enhance the delivery of cholesterol lowering drug, and sesame/soybean oils are critical part of parenteral nutrition. Ironically, excipients with far greater oxidative propensity are omnipresent in pharmaceutical products, a testament to the manageability of oxidative challenges in drug development. Successful formulation development requires awareness of what, where, and how formulation stability may be impacted, and accordingly taking appropriate steps to circumvent or meet the challenges ahead. Aiming to fill the information gap from a drug delivery scientist perspective, this review discusses oxidation pathways, prooxidants, antioxidants, and their complex interplay, which can paradoxically take opposite directions depending on the drug delivery system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tissue engineering has emerged as an interesting field nowadays; it focuses on accelerating the auto-healing mechanism of tissues rather than organ transplantation. It involves implanting an In Vitro cultured initiative tissue or a scaffold loaded with tissue regenerating ingredients at the damaged area. Both techniques are based on the use of biodegradable , biocompatible polymers as scaffolding materials which are either derived from natural (e.g. alginates, celluloses, and zein) or synthetic sources (e.g. PLGA, PCL, and PLA). This review discusses in detail the recent applications of different biomaterials in tissue engineering highlighting the targeted tissues besides the in vitro and in vivo key findings. As well, smart biomaterials (e.g. chitosan) are fascinating candidates in the field as they are capable of elucidating a chemical or physical transformation as response to external stimuli (e.g. temperature, pH, magnetic or electric fields). Recent trends in tissue engineering are summarized in this review highlighting the use of stem cells, 3D printing techniques, and the most recent 4D printing approach which relies on the use of smart biomaterials to produce a dynamic scaffold resembling the natural tissue. Furthermore, the application of advanced tissue engineering techniques provides hope for the researchers to recognize COVID-19/host interaction, also, it presents a promising solution to rejuvenate the destroyed lung tissues.

    "abstract": "Abstract Hot-melt extrusion (HME) is a globally recognized, robust, effective technology that enhances the bioavailability of poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients and offers an efficient continuous manufacturing process. The twin-screw extruder (TSE) offers an extremely resourceful customizable mixer that is used for continuous compounding and granulation by using different combinations of conveying elements, kneading elements (forward and reverse configuration), and distributive mixing elements. TSE is thus efficiently utilized for dry, wet, or melt granulation not only to manufacture dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, or granule-filled sachets, but also for designing novel formulations such as dry powder inhalers, drying units for granules, nanoextrusion, 3D printing, complexation, and amorphous solid dispersions. Over the past decades, combined academic and pharmaceutical industry collaborations have driven novel innovations for HME technology, which has resulted in a substantial increase in published articles and patents. This article summarizes the challenges and models for executing HME scale-up. Additionally, it covers the benefits of continuous manufacturing, process analytical technology (PAT) considerations, and regulatory requirements. In summary, this well-designed review builds upon our earlier publication, probing deeper into the potential of twin-screw extruders (TSE) for various new applications. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Continuously explored in pharmaceuticals, microemulsions and nanoemulsions offer drug delivery opportunities that are too significant to ignore, namely safe delivery of clinically relevant drug doses across biological membranes. Their effectiveness as drug vehicles in mucosal and (trans)dermal delivery is evident from the volume of published literature. Commonly, their ability to enhance skin permeation is attributed to dispersion size, a characteristic closely related to solubilization capacity. However, the literature falls short on distinctions between microemulsions and nanoemulsions for definitions, behavior, or specific differences in their mechanisms of action in (trans)dermal delivery. The focus is typically on surfactant/cosurfactant ratio and droplet size but the role of mesostructures or the effect of cosolvent (C sol ), oil (O) or water (W) on permeation profile remain poorly explained. Towards a deeper understanding of these vehicles in (trans)dermal drug delivery, this review begins with their conceptual and practical distinctions before delving into the published works for less obvious but potentially important underlying mechanisms; notably composition and the competitive positioning of system constituents in the resulting microstructures and subsequent effect(s) these may have on skin structures and drug permeability. For practical purposes, this review focuses on formulation systems based on ternary diagrams with commonly accepted non-ionic surfactants, cosurfactants, cosolvents, and oils used in pharmaceutical applications.

    "abstract": "A heightened interest in (trans)dermal delivery is in part driven by the need to improve the existing skin therapies and also the demand for alternative routes of administration, notably for pharmaceutical actives with undesirable oral absorption characteristics. The premise of delivering difficult actives to the skin or via the skin however is weighed down by the barrier function properties of the stratum corneum. Short of disrupting the skin by physical means, scientists have resorted to formulation with excipients known to enhance the skin penetration and permeation of drugs. A vehicle that has emerged over the years as a safe solubilizer and enhancer for a broad range of drug actives is the highly purified NF/EP grade of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGEE) commercially known as Transcutol®. Whereas numerous studies affirm its enhancing effect on drug solubilization, percutaneous absorption rate, and/or drug retention in the skin, there are few publications that unite the body of the published literature in describing the precise role and mechanisms of action for Transcutol®. In view of the current mechanistic understanding of skin barrier properties, this paper takes on a retrospective review of the published works and critically evaluates the data for potential misses due to experimental variables such as formulation design, skin model, skin hydration levels, and drug properties. The goal of this review is to mitigate the incongruence of the published works and to construct a unified, comprehensive understanding of how Transcutol® influences skin penetration and permeation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to produce 3D-printed oral dosage forms with a sufficient drug dose displaying various release profiles. Hot-melt extrusion was utilized to produce drug-loaded feedstock material that was subsequently 3D-printed into 6, 8, and 10 × 2.5 mm tablets with 15% and 90% infill levels. The prepared formulations contained 30% (w/w) isoniazid in combination with one or multiple pharmaceutical polymers possessing suitable properties for oral drug delivery. Thirteen formulations were successfully hot-melt extruded of which eight had properties suitable for fused deposition modeling 3D printing. Formulations containing HPC were found to be superior regarding printability in this study. Filaments with a breaking distance below 1.5 mm were observed to be too brittle to be fed into the printer. In addition, filaments with high moisture uptake at high relative humidity generally failed to be printable. Different release profiles for the 3D-printed tablets were obtained as a result of using different polymers in the printed formulations. For 8 mm tablets printed with 90% infill, 80% isoniazid release was observed between 40 and 852 min. Drug release characteristics could further be altered by changing the infill or the size of the printed tablets allowing personalization of the tablets. This study presents novel formulations containing isoniazid for prevention of latent tuberculosis and investigates 3D printing technology for personalized production of oral solid dosage forms enabling adjustable dose and drug release properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An extrusion-based 3D printer was used to fabricate paracetamol tablets with different geometries (mesh, ring and solid) from a single paste-based formulation formed from standard pharmaceutical ingredients. The tablets demonstrate that tunable drug release profiles can be achieved from this single formulation even with high drug loading (&gt; 80% w / w ). The tablets were evaluated for drug release using a USP dissolution testing type I apparatus. The tablets showed well-defined release profiles (from immediate to sustained release) controlled by their different geometries. The dissolution results showed dependency of drug release on the surface area/volume (SA/V) ratio and the SA of the different tablets. The tablets with larger SA/V ratios and SA had faster drug release. The 3D printed tablets were also evaluated for physical and mechanical properties including tablet dimension, drug content, weight variation and breaking force and were within acceptable range as defined by the international standards stated in the US Pharmacopoeia. X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to identify the physical form of the active and to assess possible drug-excipient interactions. These data again showed that the tablets meet USP requirement. These results clearly demonstrate the potential of 3D printing to create unique pharmaceutical manufacturing, and potentially clinical, opportunities. The ability to use a single unmodified formulation to achieve defined release profiles could allow, for example, relatively straightforward personalization of medicines for individuals with different metabolism rates for certain drugs and hence could offer significant development and clinical opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Solid dispersion is the preferred technology to prepare efficacious forms of BCS class-II/IV APIs. To prepare solid dispersions, there exist a wide variety of polymeric carriers with interesting physicochemical and thermochemical characteristics available at the disposal of a formulation scientist. Since the advent of the solid dispersion technology in the early 1960s, there have been more than 5000 scientific papers published in the subject area. This review discusses the polymeric carrier properties of most extensively used polymers PVP, Copovidone, PEG, HPMC, HPMCAS, and Soluplus® in the solid dispersion technology. The literature trends about preparation techniques, dissolution, and stability improvement are analyzed from the Scopus® database to enable a formulator to make an informed choice of polymeric carrier. The stability and extent of dissolution improvement are largely dependent upon the type of polymeric carrier employed to formulate solid dispersions. With the increasing acceptance of transfer dissolution setup in the research community, it is required to evaluate the crystallization/precipitation inhibition potential of polymers under dynamic pH shift conditions. Further, there is a need to develop a regulatory framework which provides definition and complete classification along with necessarily recommended studies to characterize and evaluate solid dispersions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A novel nanofiber insert was prepared with a modified electrospinning method to enhance the ocular residence time of ofloxacin (OFX) and to provide a sustained release pattern by covering hydrophilic polymers, chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol (CS/PVA) nanofibers, with a hydrophobic polymer, Eudragit RL100 in layers, and by glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linking of CS-PVA nanofibers for the treatment of infectious conjunctivitis. The morphology of the prepared nanofibers was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average fiber diameter was found to be 123 ± 23 nm for the single electrospun nanofiber with no cross-linking (OFX-O). The single nanofibers, cross-linked for 10 h with GA (OFX-OG), had an average fiber diameter of 159 ± 30 nm. The amount of OFX released from the nanofibers was measured in vitro and in vivo using UV spectroscopy and microbial assay methods against Staphylococcus aureus , respectively. The antimicrobial efficiency of OFX formulated in cross-linked and non-cross-linked nanofibers was affirmed by observing the inhibition zones of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli . In vivo studies using the OFX nanofibrous inserts on a rabbit eye confirmed a sustained release pattern for up to 96 h. It was found that the cross-linking of the nanofibers by GA vapor could reduce the burst release of OFX from OFX-loaded CS/PVA in one layer and multi-layered nanofibers. In vivo results showed that the AUC 0–96 for the nanofibers was 9–20-folds higher compared to the OFX solution. This study thus demonstrates the potential of the nanofiber technology is being utilized to sustained drug release in ocular drug delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "The world is facing lockdown for the first time in decades due to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. This has led to massive global economic disruption, placed additional strain on local and global public health resources and, above all, threatened human health. We conducted a review of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, written in English, reporting on the current COVID-19 pandemic. This data includes previously used strategies against infectious disease, recent clinical trials and FDA-approved diagnostic and treatment strategies. The literature was obtained through a systematic search using PubMed, Web of Sciences, and FDA, NIH and WHO websites. Of the 98 references included in the review, the majority focused on pathogen and host targeting, symptomatic treatment and convalescent plasma utilization. Other sources investigated vaccinations in the pipeline for the possible prevention of COVID-19 infection. The results demonstrate various conventional as well as potentially advanced in vitro diagnostic approaches (IVD) for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Mixed results have been observed so far when utilising these approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Some treatments have been found highly effective in specific regions of the world while others have not altered the disease process. The responsiveness of currently available options is not conclusive. The novelty of this disease, the rapidity of its global outbreak and the unavailability of vaccines have contributed to the global public's fear. It is concluded that the exploration of a range of diagnostic and treatment strategies for the management of COVID-19 is the need of the hour.",

It has the unrivaled capability of layer-by-layer deposition using different types of biomaterials, stem cells, and biomolecules with a perfectly regulated spatial distribution. The tissue regeneration of hollow organs has always been a challenge for medical science because of the complexities of their cell structures. In this mini review, we will address the status of the science behind tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting of epithelialized tubular hollow organs. This review will also cover the current challenges and prospects, as well as the application of these complicated 3D-printed organs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In transdermal applications of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the rheological and mechanical properties of the dosage form affect the performance of the drug. The aim of this study to develop emulgel and nanostructured lipid carrier NLC-based gel formulations containing ibuprofen, evaluate their mechanical properties, bioadhesive value and ex-vivo rabbit skin permeability. All formulations showed non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior and their viscosity values are suitable for topical application. The particle size of the nanostructured lipid carrier system was found to be 468 ± 21 nm, and the encapsulation efficiency was 95.58 ± 0.41%. According to the index of viscosity, consistency, firmness, and cohesiveness values obtained as a result of the back extrusion study, E2 formulation was found to be more suitable for transdermal application. The firmness and work of shear values of the E2 formulation, which has the highest viscosity value, were also found to be the highest and it was chosen as the most suitable formulation in terms of the spreadability test. The work of bioadhesion values of NLC-based gel and IBU-loaded NLC-based gel were found as 0.226 ± 0.028 and 0.181 ± 0.006 mJ/cm2 respectively. The percentages of IBU that penetrated through rabbit skin from the Ibuactive-Cream and the E2 were 87.4 ± 2.11% and 93.4 ± 2.72% after 24 h, respectively. When the penetration of ibuprofen through the skin was evaluated, it was found that the E2 formulation increased penetration due to its lipid and nanoparticle structure. As a result of these findings, it can be said that the NLC-based gel formulation will increase the therapeutic efficacy and will be a good alternative transdermal formulation. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Verapamil hydrochloride (VRP), an antihypertensive calcium channel blocker drug has limited bioavailability and short half-life when taken orally. The present study was aimed at developing cubosomes containing VRP for enhancing its bioavailability and targeting to brain for cluster headache (CH) treatment as an off-label use. Factorial design was conducted to analyze the impact of different components on entrapment efficiency (EE%), particle size (PS), zeta potential (ZP), and percent drug release. Various in-vitro characterizations were performed followed by pharmacokinetic and brain targeting studies. The results revealed the significant impact of glyceryl monooleate (GMO) on increasing EE%, PS, and ZP of cubosomes with a negative influence on VRP release. The remarkable effect of Poloxamer 407 (P407) on decreasing EE%, PS, and ZP of cubosomes was observed besides its influence on accelerating VRP release%. The DSC thermograms indicated the successful entrapment of the amorphous state of VRP inside the cubosomes. The design suggested an optimized formulation containing GMO (50% w/w) and P407 (5.5% w/w). Such formulation showed a significant increase in drug permeation through nasal mucosa with high E r value (2.26) when compared to VRP solution. Also, the histopathological study revealed the safety of the utilized components used in the cubosomes preparation. There was a significant enhancement in the VRP bioavailability when loaded in cubosomes owing to its sustained release favored by its direct transport to brain. The I.N optimized formulation had greater BTE% and DTP% at 183.53% and 90.19%, respectively in comparison of 41.80% and 59% for the I.N VRP solution. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Typically, colonic absorption of a drug is mandatory for a sustained release formulation to hold the drug's plasma level for more than 12 or 24 h above the minimum therapeutic plasma concentration (efficacy). According to Drugs@FDA, only 7.4% of the oral drugs are extended release forms probably showing colonic absorption. Therefore an early determination of a drug's colonic absorption using the IntelliCap® in animals or humans will provide the mandatory information to initiate or stop a SR form development. Diltiazem (60 mg) is used in the oral swallowable IntelliCap® and the marketed SR form from Mylan (coated beads). A human study with 14 healthy volunteers compared the Mylan formulation with the IntelliCap® device that releases the drug identical to the in-vitro dissolution of the Mylan product. The plasma profiles of IntelliCap® and Mylan formulation are highly similar. The mean AUC (bioequivalence fulfilled) and mean Cmax of IntelliCap® shows only a difference of +15% and −12%, respectively. But the PK profile of the Mylan formulation shows a broader peak around Cmax. About 81.8% diltiazem was absorbed in the colon (IntelliCap®) comparable to former publications. The Mylan is a SR diffusion coated beads form whereas the IntelliCap® is a monolithic capsule. The beads are transported in the gut and spread which results in a longer Tmax and a broader Cmax peak. The IntelliCap® device can quantitatively measure the colonic absorption of a drug in excellent accordance to a standard oral SR dosage form.",

    "abstract": "Children frequently receive medicines that are designed for adults. The dose of commercially available products is adapted, mostly based on the child's bodyweight, thereby neglecting differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters. If commercial products are unsuitable for administration to children or are unavailable, extemporaneous pharmacy preparations are a good alternative. For this particular population, orodispersible films (ODFs) can be a highly attractive dosage form for the oral administration of drugs. ODFs are relatively easy to prepare in a hospital setting, create dose flexibility, and may suit an individual approach, especially for patients having difficulties in swallowing tablets or being fluid restricted. In this article, various aspects related to pharmacy preparations, clinical application, and preparation of ODFs for pediatric patients are highlighted and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Recommended best practices in monitoring of product status during pharmaceutical freeze drying are presented, focusing on methods that apply to both laboratory and production scale. With respect to product temperature measurement, sources of uncertainty associated with any type of measurement probe are discussed, as well as important differences between the two most common types of temperature-measuring instruments—thermocouples and resistance temperature detectors (RTD). Two types of pressure transducers are discussed—thermal conductivity-type gauges and capacitance manometers, with the Pirani gauge being the thermal conductivity-type gauge of choice. It is recommended that both types of pressure gauge be used on both the product chamber and the condenser for freeze dryers with an external condenser, and the reasoning for this recommendation is discussed. Developing technology for process monitoring worthy of further investigation is also briefly reviewed, including wireless product temperature monitoring, tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy at manufacturing scale, heat flux measurement, and mass spectrometry as process monitoring tools.",

    "abstract": "The availability of licensed paediatric drugs is lagging behind those for adults, and there is a lack of safe formulations in suitable doses that children are able and willing to take. As a consequence, children are commonly treated with off-label or unlicensed drugs. As off-label and unlicensed drug use are associated with a greater risk for harm than on-label drug use, a range of global initiatives have been developed to realize “better” medicines for children. This review describes the challenges and achievements of the European Union to realize this goal, with a focus on paediatric drug development and formulation design. In 2007, a European Paediatric Regulation was installed enforcing companies to consider children in the early development of drugs with a new drug substance, for a new indication or with a new route of administration. The Regulation, e.g. requires companies to develop a paediatric investigation plan discussing the proposed clinical trials in children of different ages and the formulations for future marketing. Since 2013, the pharmaceutical design of any newly marketed paediatric drug should comply with the “Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Development of Medicines for Paediatric Use.” Companies should, e.g. justify the route of administration, dosage form, formulation characteristics, safety of excipients, dosing frequency, container closure system, administration device, patient acceptability and user information. In this review, the guideline’s key aspects are discussed with a focus on novel formulations such as mini-tablets and orodispersible films, excipients with a potential risk for harm such as azo dyes and adequate user instructions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An increased interest in using amorphous solid forms in pharmaceutical applications to increase solubility, dissolution, and bioavailability has generated a need for better characterization of key properties, such as the glass transition ( T g ) temperature. Although many laboratories measure and report this value, the details around these measurements are often vague or misunderstood. In this article, we attempt to highlight and compare various aspects of the two most common methods used to measure pharmaceutical T g values, conventional and modulated differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Issues that directly impact the T g , such as instrumental parameters, sample preparation methods, data analysis, and “wet” vs. “dry” measurements, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An emulsion is a biphasic dosage form comprising of dispersed phase containing droplets that are uniformly distributed into a surrounding liquid which forms the continuous phase. An emulsifier is added at the interface of two immiscible liquids to stabilize the thermodynamically unstable emulsion. Various types of emulsions such as water-in-oil (w-o), oil-in-water (o-w), microemulsions, and multiple emulsions are used for delivering certain drugs in the body. Water (aqueous) phase is commonly used for encapsulating proteins and several other drugs in water-in-oil-in-water (w-o-w) emulsion technique. But this method has posed certain problems such as decreased stability, burst release, and low entrapment efficiency. Thus, a novel “solid-in-oil-in-water” (s-o-w) emulsion system was developed for formulating certain drugs, probiotics, proteins, antibodies, and tannins to overcome these issues. In this method, the active ingredient is encapsulated as a solid and added to an oil phase, which formed a solid-oil dispersion. This dispersion was then mixed with water to form a continuous phase for enhancing the drug absorption. This article focuses on the various studies done to investigate the effectiveness of formulations prepared as solid-oil-water emulsions in comparison to conventional water-oil-water emulsions. A summary of the results obtained in each study is presented in this article. The s-o-w emulsion technique may become beneficial in near future as it has shown to improve the stability and efficacy of the entrapped active ingredient. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is intended for oral administration yet suffers poor bioavailability along with undesirable side effects. To enhance its solubility and allow colon targeting, gefitinib (ZD) and blends of different ratios of polymers (ternary dispersion) were prepared in organic solution, and solid dispersions were generated employing the spray drying (SD) technique. The methylmethacrylate polymer Eudragit S 100 was incorporated for colon targeting; polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) were utilised to improve the solubility of ZD. SEM, DSC, XRPD, FT-IR, dissolution and cytotoxicity studies were undertaken to characterise and evaluate the developed formulations. SEM images revealed that the rod-shaped crystals of ZD were transformed into collapsed spheres with smaller particle size in the spray-dried particles. DSC, FTIR and XRPD studies showed that ZD loaded in the spray-dried dispersions was amorphous. ZD dissolution and release studies revealed that while a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the ZD dissolution and release was observed from HPMC-based solid dispersion at pH 7.2 (up to 95% in 15 h), practically no drug was released at pH 1.2 and pH 6.5. Furthermore, the HPMC-based solid dispersions displayed enhanced mucoadhesive properties compared with PVP-based ones. Interestingly, cell viability studies using the neutral red assay showed that PVP and HPMC-based solid dispersions had no additional inhibitory effect on Caco-2 cell line compared to the pure drug.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the current study is the development of a vitamin D3 (VD3)-loaded nanoemulsion (NE) formulation to improve VD3 oral bioavailability for management of vitamin D inadequacy in autistic children. Eight NE formulations were prepared by high-speed homogenization followed by ultrasonication. Four vegetable oils were employed along with two concentrations of Span 20 as the emulsifier. Glycerol, fructose, and mango flavor were included as viscosity modifier, sweetening, and flavoring agents, respectively. The prepared VD3-loaded NE formulations exhibited high drug content (> 98%), droplet size (DS) ranging from 61.15 to 129.8 nm with narrow size distribution, zeta potential values between - 9.83 and - 19.22 mV, and acceptable pH values (4.59-5.89). Storage stability showed that NE formulations underwent coalescence and phase separation during 6 months at room temperature, whereas at refrigerated conditions, formulations showed slight creaming. The optimum formulation (VD3-NE6) revealed a non-significant DS growth at refrigerated conditions and spherical morphology under transmission electron microscopy. VD3-NE6 did not produce any toxic effects to rats treated orally for 3 months, where normal blood picture and kidney and liver functions were observed compared to control rats. Also, serum calcium, oxidative stress, and apoptosis biomarkers remained within normal levels, indicating the safety of the optimum formulation. Furthermore, evaluation of VD3-NE6 oral bioavailability depicted a significant increase in AUC0-72 and Cmax with decreased Tmax compared to plain VD3. The optimum formulation demonstrated improved stability, safety, and oral bioavailability indicating the potential for successful management of vitamin D deficiency in autistic children.",

Silymarin is used as a model drug for its potential effectiveness in liver cancer. A detailed QbD approach was applied. The effect of the critical process parameters was studied on each of the particle size, size distribution, and entrapment efficiency. Response surface designs were applied in the screening and optimization of lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles, to obtain an optimized formula. The release rate was tested, where artificial neural network models were used to predict the % release of the drug from the optimized formula at different time intervals. The optimized formula was tested for its cytotoxicity. A design space was established, with an optimized formula having a molar ratio of 18.33:1 lecithin:chitosan and 38.35 mg silymarin. This resulted in nanoparticles with a size of 161 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.2, and an entrapment efficiency of 97%. The optimized formula showed a zeta potential of +38 mV, with well-developed spherical particles. AI successfully showed high prediction ability of the drug's release rate. The optimized formula showed an enhancement in the cytotoxic effect of silymarin with a decreased IC50 compared to standard silymarin. Lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles were successfully formulated, with deep process and product understanding. Several tools were used as AI which could shift pharmaceutical formulations from experience-dependent studies to data-driven methodologies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLHNs) have been widely used as a vehicle for carrying anticancer owing to its unique framework of polymer and lipid combining and giving the maximum advantages over the lipid and polymer nanoparticle drug delivery system. Surface modification of PLHNs aids in improved targeting and active delivery of the encapsulated drug. Therefore, surface modification of the PLHNs with the cell-penetrating peptide is explored by many researchers and is explained in this review. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are made up of few amino acid sequence and act by disrupting the cell membrane and transferring the cargos into the cell. Ideally, we can say that CPPs are peptide chains which are cell specific and are biocompatible, noninvasive type of delivery vehicle which can transport siRNA, protein, peptides, macromolecules, pDNA, etc. into the cell effectively. Therefore, this review focuses on the structure, type, and method of preparation of PLHNs also about the uptake mechanism of CPPs and concludes with the therapeutic application of PLHNs surface modified with the CPPs and their theranostics.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cyclosporine A (CsA) is a cyclic peptide immunosuppressant drug that is beneficial in the treatment of various ocular diseases. However, its ocular bioavailability in the posterior eye is limited due to its poor aqueous solubility. Conventional CsA formulations such as a solution or emulsion permeate poorly across the eye due to various static and dynamic barriers of the eye. Dissolvable microneedle (MN)-based patches can be used to overcome barrier properties and, thus, enhance the ocular bioavailability of CsA in the posterior eye. CsA-loaded dissolvable MN patches were fabricated using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and characterized for MN uniformity and sharpness using SEM. Further characterization for its failure force, penetration force, and depth of penetration were analyzed using a texture analyzer. Finally, the dissolution time, ex vivo permeation, and ocular distribution of cyclosporine were determined in isolated porcine eyes. PVP MNs were sharp, uniform with good mechanical properties, and dissolved within 5 min. Ocular distribution of CsA in a whole porcine eye perfusion model showed a significant increase of CsA levels in various posterior segment ocular tissues as compared to a topically applied ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis®) ( P &lt; 0.001). Dissolving MNs of CsA were prepared, and the MN arrays can deliver CsA to the back of the eye offering potential for treating various inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern drug carrier technologies, such as microemulsions with small droplet sizes and high surface areas, improve the ability of low water solubility active ingredients to permeate and localize. The goal of this study was to create microemulsion formulations for wound healing that contained both fusidic acid (FA), an antibacterial agent, and benzocaine (BNZ), a local anesthetic. Studies on characterization were carried out, including viscosity, droplet size, and zeta potential. The drug-loaded microemulsion had a stable structure with –3.014 ± 1.265 mV of zeta potential and 19.388 ± 0.480 nm of droplet size. In both in vitro release and ex vivo permeability studies, the microemulsion was compared with Fucidin cream and oily BNZ solution. According to the drug release studies, BNZ release from the microemulsion and the BNZ solution showed a similar profile ( p &gt; 0.05), while FA release from the microemulsion had a higher drug release compared to Fucidin cream ( p &lt; 0.001). The microemulsion presented lower drug permeation ( p &gt; 0.05) for both active ingredients, on the other hand, provided higher drug accumulation compared to the control preparations. Moreover, according to the results of in vitro wound healing activity, the microemulsion indicated a dose-dependent wound healing potential with the highest wound healing activity at the highest concentrations. To the best of our knowledge, this developed BNZ- and FA-loaded microemulsion would be a promising candidate to create new opportunities for wound healing thanks to present the active ingredients, which have low water solubility, in a single formulation and achieved higher accumulation than control preparations.

    "abstract": "Abstract Thymoquinone (TQ) is a phytochemical compound present in Nigella sativa and has potential benefits for treating dermatological conditions such as psoriasis. However, its clinical use is limited due to its restricted bioavailability, caused mainly by its low solubility and permeability. To overcome this, a new transdermal drug delivery system is required. Nanoparticles are known to enhance material solubility and permeability, and hence, this study aimed to synthesize TQ-loaded L -arginine-based polyamide (TQ/Arg PA) nanocapsules incorporated into transdermal patches for prolonged delivery of TQ. To achieve this, Eudragit E polymer, plasticizers, and aloe vera as penetration enhancer were used to develop the transdermal patch. Furthermore, novel TQ/Arg-PA was synthesized via interfacial polymerization, and the resultant nanocapsules (NCs) were incorporated into the matrix transdermal patch. The Arg-PA NCs’ structure was confirmed via NMR and FTIR, and optimal TQ/Arg-PA NCs containing formulation showed high entrapment efficiency of TQ (99.60%). Molecular and thermal profiling of TQ/Arg-PA and the transdermal patch revealed the effective development of spherical NCs with an average particle size of 129.23 ± 18.22 nm. Using Franz diffusion cells and synthetic membrane (STRAT M®), the in vitro permeation profile of the prepared patches demonstrated an extended release of TQ over 24 h, with enhanced permeation by 42.64% when aloe vera was employed. In conclusion, the produced formulation has a potential substitute for corticosteroids and other drugs commonly used to treat psoriasis due to its effectiveness, safety, and lack of the side effects typically associated with other drugs.

The optimized batch exhibited a vesicle size (107.6 nm), a polydispersity index (PDI) (0.248), entrapment efficiency (% EE) (76.9%), and a zeta potential (-33.7 mV). Results from ex vivo skin permeation studies and in vitro drug release demonstrated enhanced improved skin permeation and drug release compared to other formulations. An in vitro antifungal and in vivo pharmacodynamic study, elucidated the enhanced effectiveness of the optimized formulation against Candida albicans .

    "abstract": "The efficacy, safety, and stability of transdermal and topical products (TTPs) are of prime importance to consumer acceptance and compliance. To control the consistent textural quality or overall physical properties of TTPs, texture analysis tests are widely applied to assess potential changes in features and internal structure of products throughout different stages of formulation development, manufacturing, and distribution. As one of the essential texture test types, Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) provides critical insights into the structure, spreadability, adhesion, sensory attributes, and consistency of semisolid formulations via key measured parameters such as hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, elasticity, and compressibility. Recent advancements in automation and multimodal analysis have enhanced the precision and applicability of TPA. For transdermal delivery systems (TDS), adhesion, a critical quality attribute (CQA), which is influenced by viscoelasticity, surface energy, and wetting characteristics of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs), can be assessed through in vitro methods like peel, tack, and shear tests using texture analyzer systems. While in vivo assessments remain subjective, in vitro tests conducted by texture analyzers enable standardized and reproducible evaluations, ensuring reliable comparisons across products and bridging gaps between laboratory and real-world performance. Microneedles (µNDs), another innovative transdermal platform, require robust mechanical strength to ensure effective skin penetration and drug release. Texture analysis plays a pivotal role in characterizing critical properties such as hardness, flexibility, and puncture strength, simulating forces encountered during skin penetration. This analysis offers valuable insights into µND performance, ensuring safety, functionality, and patient compliance. This review systematically curates existing knowledge on using texture analyzers to measure textural properties of pharmaceutical TTPs while highlighting emerging trends and providing methodologies for testing and parameter derivation. By emphasizing the importance of CQA characterization for novel drug delivery platforms, this work underscores the role of texture analysis in optimizing designs of TTPs including µND, focusing on fracture, insertion, and bending forces, ultimately contributing to the development of safer and more efficient transdermal systems.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to describe the current status of several intravaginal anti-HIV microbicidal delivery systems these delivery systems and microbicidal compounds in the context of their stage within clinical trials and their potential cervicovaginal defence successes. The global Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV) pandemic continues to spread at a rate of more than 15,000 new infections daily and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can predispose people to acquiring HIV infection. Male-to-female transmission is eight times more likely to occur than female-to-male transmission due to the anatomical structure of the vagina as well as socio-economic factors and the disempowerment of women that renders them unable to refuse unsafe sexual practices in some communities. The increased incidence of HIV in women has identified the urgent need for efficacious and safe intravaginal delivery of anti-HIV agents that can be used and controlled by women. To meet this challenge, several intravaginal anti-HIV microbicidal delivery systems are in the process of been developed. The outcomes of three main categories are discussed in this review: namely, dual-function polymeric systems, non-polymeric systems and nanotechnology-based systems. These delivery systems include formulations that modify the genital environment (e.g. polyacrylic acid gels and lactobacillus gels), surfactants (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate), polyanionic therapeutic polymers (e.g. carageenan and carbomer/lactic acid gels), proteins (e.g. cyanovirin-N, monoclonal antibodies and thromspondin-1 peptides), protease inhibitors and other molecules (e.g. dendrimer based-gels and the molecular condom). Intravaginal microbicide delivery systems are providing a new option for preventing the transmission of STIs and HIV.",

    "abstract": "Stable solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) formulations to enhance the dissolution rates of poorly soluble drug spironolactone (SP) were being developed. Probe ultra-sonication method was used to prepare SLNs and NLCs. All NLCs contained stearic acid (solid lipid carrier) and oleic acid (liquid lipid content), whereas, SLNs were prepared and optimised by using the solid lipid only. The particles were characterised in terms of particle size analysis, thermal behaviour, morphology, stability and in vitro release. The zeta sizer data revealed that the increase in the concentration of oleic acid in the formulations reduced the mean particle size and the zeta potential. The increase in concentration of oleic acid from 0 to 30% (w/w) resulted in a higher entrapment efficiency. All nanoparticles were almost spherically shaped with an average particle size of about ∼170 nm. The DSC traces revealed that the presence of oleic acid in the NLC formulations resulted in a shift in the melting endotherms to a higher temperature. This could be attributed to a good long-term stability of the nanoparticles. The stability results showed that the particle size remained smaller in NLC compared to that of SLN formulations after 6 months at various temperatures. The dissolution study showed about a 5.1- to 7.2-fold increase in the release of the drug in 2 h compared to the raw drug. Comparing all nanoparticle formulations indicated that the NLC composition with a ratio of 70:30 (solid:liquid lipid) is the most suitable formulation with desired drug dissolution rates, entrapment efficiency and physical stability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Baicalin is a flavone glycoside extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis , a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Numerous pharmacological effects of baicalin were reported ( e.g. antioxidant, anxiolytic); nevertheless, the most important physicochemical properties influencing the pharmacokinetic behaviour and the concomitant oral bioavailability have not yet been described in a comprehensive study. The aim of this project was to characterize the acid-base, lipophilicity, biorelevant solubility and permeability properties of the drug substance and providing scientific data to support the dosage form design. Another important objective was the comparative evaluation of six various baicalin-cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complexes along with the creation of a suitable Drug Delivery System (DDS) for this BCS IV drug. Biorelevant profiling was carried out by NMR-pH titrations, saturation shake-flask and distribution coefficients (log P ) measurements, while CD inclusion studies were fulfilled by experimental methods (phase solubility, 1 H/ 13 C NMR, 2D ROESY) and computational approaches. Due to low aqueous solubility (67.03 ± 1.60 μg/ml) and low permeability ( P app = 0.037 × 10 −6 cm/s), baicalin is classified as BCS IV. The γ-CD complexation significantly increased the solubility of baicalin (~ 5 times). The most promoted chemical shift change occurred in baicalin-γ-CD complex. Computational studies showed disparate binding pattern for baicalin in case of β- and γ-CD; furthermore, the calculated complexation energy was − 162.4 kJ mol −1 for β-CD, while it was significantly stronger for γ-CD (− 181.5 kJ mol −1 ). The physicochemical and structural information of baicalin and its CD complexes introduced herein can create molecular basis for a promising DDS with enhanced bioavailability containing a bioactive phytopharmacon.",

    "abstract": "To ensure consistency of clinical outcomes, orally inhaled therapies must exhibit consistent delivered dose and aerosol properties at the time of manufacturing, throughout storage, and during various patient-use conditions. Achieving consistency across these scenarios has presented a significant challenge, especially for combination products that contain more than one drug. This study characterized the delivered dose and aerosol properties of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler (GFF MDI; Bevespi Aerosphere™). GFF MDI, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, glycopyrrolate (18 μg, equivalent to glycopyrronium 14.4 μg), and a long-acting β2-agonist, formoterol fumarate (9.6 μg; equivalent to formoterol fumarate dihydrate 10 μg), is formulated using innovative co-suspension delivery technology, which suspends micronized drug crystals with spray-dried phospholipid porous particles in hydrofluoroalkane propellant. In this study, delivered dose uniformity was assessed through the labeled number of doses, and aerosol properties, such as percent fine particle fraction (FPF) and mass median aerodynamic diameter, were determined by cascade impaction. GFF MDI achieved reproducible dose delivery and an FPF greater than 55%, whether formulated and delivered as a monocomponent or dual FDC. The performance of GFF MDI was maintained across various manufacturing batches, under extended storage, and with variations in flow rate. Furthermore, unlike a GFF drug crystal-only suspension, drug delivery remained consistent for GFF MDI when simulated patient-handling errors were applied, such as reduced shake energy and delays between shaking and actuation. These results demonstrate that co-suspension delivery technology overcomes well-known sources of variability in MDI drug delivery.",

The specific objective of this study is to establish a convenient method to examine problem of the injectability for the needle-syringe-formulation system when complex formulations with diverse viscosities are used. This work presents the inter-relationship between needle size, syringe volume, viscosity, and injectability of polymeric solutions having typical viscosities encountered in concentrated biologics, by applying a constant probe crosshead speed on the plunger-syringe needle assembly and continuously recording the force-distance profiles. A computerized texture analyzer was used to accurately capture, display, and store force, displacement, and time data. The force-distance curve and area under the curve are determined, and total work done for complete extrusion of the syringe content was calculated automatically by applying an established Matlab program. Various concentrations (i.e., 0.5-4% w/v of polymeric fluids/dispersions) of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) with viscosity ranges of 5-100 cP mimicking concentrated monoclonal antibody solutions and complex biopharmaceutical formulations are investigated. Results indicate that calculated values of total work done to completely extrude the syringe content are the most appropriate parameter that describes viscosity-injection force of dispersed formulations. Additionally, the rheological properties of HPMC and PEO fluids in the context of syringeability and injectability are discussed.",

The dissolution test has been shown repeatedly to have the power to distinguish between significant changes in active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), formulation, and process that relate to the release mechanism of the in vivo performance. Examples will be discussed in the literature where the effects of formulation, drug substance, and manufacturing variables have been measured by dissolution testing. There will be a suggested plan on how to develop and challenge a discriminating method that may be utilized for regulatory purposes. A brief review of other challenges and considerations regarding discriminatory dissolution testing is presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 5-Fluorouracil is a member of cytotoxic drugs with poor selectivity to cancer cells. Currently, systemic administration of this anti-cancer drug (oral or injection) exposes normal tissues to the drug-induced toxicity. Nowadays, attention has been greatly directed towards in situ gel-forming systems that can be injected into the affected tissues in its sol form with a minimally invasive technique. More specifically, chitosan hydrogel systems were in focus due to their antibacterial effect as well as their biodegradable, biocompatible, and mucoadhesive properties. In the present work, 5-fluorouracil was loaded on various thermosensitive chitosan hydrogel systems cross linked with different linking agents like β-glycerophosphate, pluronic F127, and hydroxyapatite. Also, methotrexate was added to 5-fluorouracil in order to gain its previously reported synergistic effects. Firstly, a compatibility study was performed using UV-spectrophotometric, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques to exclude the possibility of any physical or chemical interactions between the selected drugs and excipients. The prepared hydrogel systems were characterized for their physicochemical properties including organoleptic, pH, syringeability and injectability, viscosity, and gelation temperature ( T gel ) by various analysis techniques. Moreover , the in vitro release behavior of 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate was determined with a modified analytical method. The results indicated that chitosan hydrogel system cross-linked with a combination of β- glycerophosphate, and 10 % pluronicF127 (F4) showed the most suitable physicochemical properties and release profile. Accordingly, this formula can be considered as a missionary system for localized sustained delivery of cytotoxic drugs.",

In this study, polylactic acid (PLA), which is widely used in wound management, was chosen as electrospinnable polymer. A triterpene extract (TE) from the outer bark of birch known for its anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and wound healing effects was chosen to produce TE-loaded PLA electrospun fibers for wound dressing. A binary solvent system of dichloromethane (DCM) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was employed, and the ratio of the solvents was optimized for preparing smooth and uniform fibers. The morphology of TE-loaded PLA electrospun fibers was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The entrapment of TE in PLA fibers was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to analyze the solid state of TE in PLA fibers. The release behavior of TE was assayed by a shaking flask method for a period of 96 h. The results revealed that TE-loaded electrospun PLA microfibers could be reliably prepared and are promising future candidates in wound therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the current research, the main focus was to overcome dermal delivery problems of atorvastatin. To this end, atorvastatin solid lipid nanoparticles (ATR-SLNs) were prepared by ultra-sonication technique. The prepared SLNs had a PDI value of ≤ 0.5, and the particle size of nanoparticles was in the range 71.07 ± 1.72 to 202.07 ± 8.40 nm. It was noticed that, when the concentration of lipid in ATR-SLNs increased, the size of nanoparticles and drug entrapment efficiency were also increased. Results showed that a reduction in the HLB of surfactants used in the preparation of SLN caused an increase in the particle size, zeta potential (better stability), and drug entrapment efficiency. Despite Tween and Span are non-ionic surfactants, SLNs containing these surfactants showed a negative zeta potential, and the absolute zeta potential increased when the concentration of Span 80 was at maximum. DSC thermograms, FTIR spectra, and x-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern showed good incorporation of ATR in the nanoparticles without any chemical interaction . In vitro skin permeation results showed that SLN containing atorvastatin was capable of enhancing the dermal delivery of atorvastatin where a higher concentration of atorvastatin can be detected in skin layers. This is a hopeful promise which could be developed for clinical studies of the dermal delivery of atorvastatin nanoparticles as an anti-inflammatory agent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Among the great number of poorly soluble drugs in pharmaceutical development, most of them are weak bases. Typically, they readily dissolve in an acidic environment but are prone to precipitation at elevated pH. This was aimed to be counteracted by the preparation of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) using the pH-dependent soluble polymers methacrylic acid ethylacrylate copolymer (Eudragit L100–55) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) via hot-melt extrusion. The hot-melt extruded ASDs were of amorphous nature and single phased with the presence of specific interactions between drug and polymer as revealed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The ASDs were milled and classified into six particle size fractions. We investigated the influence of particle size, drug load, and polymer type on the dissolution performance. The best dissolution performance was achieved for the ASD made from Eudragit L100–55 at a drug load of 10%, whereby the dissolution rate was inversely proportional to the particle size. Within a pH-shift dissolution experiment (from pH 1 to pH 6.8), amorphous-amorphous phase separation occurred as a result of exposure to acidic medium which caused markedly reduced dissolution rates at subsequent higher pH values. Phase separation could be prevented by using enteric capsules (Vcaps Enteric®), which provided optimal dissolution profiles for the Eudragit L100–55 ASD at a drug load of 10%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Increasing the drug tumor-specific accumulation and controlling their release is considered one of the most effective ways to increase the efficacy of drugs. Here, we developed a vesicle system that can target hepatoma and release drugs rapidly within tumor cells. This non-ionic surfactant vesicle is biodegradable. Galactosylated stearate has been used to glycosylate the vesicles to achieve liver targeting; replacement of a portion (Chol:CHEMS = 1:1) of cholesterol by cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) allows for a rapid release of drugs in an acidic environment. In vitro release experiments confirmed that galactose-modified pH-sensitive niosomes loaded with tanshinone IIA had excellent drug release performance in acid medium. In vitro experiments using ovarian cancer cells (A2780), colon cancer cells (HCT8), and hepatoma cell (Huh7, HepG2) confirmed that the preparation had specific targeting ability to hepatoma cells compared with free drugs, and this ability was dependent on the galactose content. Furthermore, the preparation also had a more substantial inhibitory effect on tumor cells, and subsequent apoptosis assays and cell cycle analyses further confirmed its enhanced anti-tumor effect. Results of pharmacokinetic experiments confirmed that the vesicle system could significantly extend the blood circulation time of tanshinone IIA, and the larger area under the curve indicated that the preparation had a better drug effect. Thus, the results of biodistribution experiments confirmed the in vivo liver targeting ability of this preparation. Niosomes designed in this manner are expected to be a safe and effective drug delivery system for liver cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Topical drug delivery provides several benefits over other conventional routes by providing localizing therapeutic effects and also avoids the gastrointestinal tract circumventing the first-pass metabolism and enzymatic drug degradation. Being painless, the topical route also prevents the difficulties linked with the parenteral route. However, there are limitations to the current topical systems which necessitate the need for further research to find functional excipients to overcome these limitations. This review deals in depth with the ionic liquids concerning their physicochemical properties and applicability as well as their role in the arena of topical drug delivery in permeation enhancement, bioavailability enhancement of the drugs by solvation, and drug moiety modification. The review gives a detailed insight into the recent literature on ionic liquid–based topical formulations like ionic liquid–based emulsions, active pharmaceutical ingredient-ionic liquids, ionic liquid–based bacterial cellulose membranes, topical small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery, and ionogels as a possible solutions for overcoming the challenges associated with the topical route. This review also takes into account the toxicological aspects and biomedical applications of ionic liquids. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "This study was proposed to develop an optimized sertraline hydrochloride (SER)-loaded bilosomal system and evaluate its potential for enhancement of drug oral bioavailability. A full 23 factorial design was used to prepare SER-loaded bilosomal dispersions by thin film hydration using span 60, cholesterol (CHL), and sodium deoxycholate (SDC). The investigated factors included the total concentration of span 60 and CHL (X1), span 60:CHL molar ratio (X2), and SER:SDC molar ratio (X3). The studied responses were entrapment efficiency (EE%) (Y1), zeta potential (Y2), particle size (Y3), and in vitro % drug released at 2 (Y4), 8 (Y5), and 24 h (Y6). The selected optimal bilosomal dispersion (N1) composition was 0.5% w/v (X1), 1:1 (X2), and 1:2 (X3). Then, N1 was freeze dried into FDN1 that compared with pure SER for in vitro drug release, ex vivo permeation through rabbit intestine, and in vivo absorption in rats. Moreover, storage effect on FDN1 over 3 months was assessed. The optimal dispersion (N1) showed 68 ± 0.7% entrapment efficiency, - 41 ± 0.78 mV zeta potential, and 377 ± 19 nm particle size. The freeze-dried form (FDN1) showed less % drug released in simulated gastric fluids with remarkable sustained SER release up to 24 h compared to pure SER. Moreover, FDN1 showed good stability, fivefold enhancement in SER permeation through rabbit intestine, and 222% bioavailability enhancement in rats' in vivo absorption study compared to pure SER. The SER-loaded bilosomal system (FDN1) could improve SER oral bioavailability with minimization of gastrointestinal side effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fungal infections are considered one of the most serious conditions as their occurrence has increased lately. Fungi like Candida , Fusarium , and Aspergillus species mostly affect immunocompromised patients as they are considered opportunistic pathogens. These infections can be superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous, or systemic fungal infections that require specific treatment. There is a wide variety of antifungal drugs that can be used to cure fungal infections; however, most of them have many systemic side effects due to their physicochemical characteristics and high toxicity profile. Hence, the current review focuses on various advanced vesicular carriers with high biocompatibility that can encapsulate the antifungal drugs owing to increase their efficacy and limit the undesirable side effects. These advanced systems can manage stability, solubility, bioavailability, safety, and effectiveness issues present in conventional systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was the improvement of rutin solubility along with targeting its release to colon for effective treatment of colon cancer. Five formulations of compression-coated tablets were prepared with the same core composition including rutin-polyvinyl pyrrolidone K30 solid dispersion (rutin-PVP K30 SD) but differ in being coated with either frankincense alone or different combinations of frankincense with gelatin. The superior formula was selected based on the in vitro drug release then further evaluated in terms of physical properties and in vivo performance in dogs using X-ray. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity of rutin, rutin-PVP K30 SD, frankincense, and a mixture of rutin-PVP K30 SD with frankincense in a ratio representing their concentrations in the selected formula was assessed against human colon cancer (HCT-116) cell lines using sulforhodamine B assay . The formula (F4) with the coat consisted of 65%w/w frankincense and 35%w/w gelatin achieved acceptable in vitro controlled drug release. In vivo X-ray in dogs confirmed that F4 tablet could remain intact in the stomach and small intestine until reaching the colon. In vitro cytotoxicity revealed that mixture of rutin-PVP K30 SD with frankincense was more effective in arresting cancer cell growth than rutin or frankincense alone. Moreover, stability studies revealed that F4 tablets were physically and chemically stable. Thus, improving rutin solubility using solid dispersion technique and formulating it into frankincense-based compression-coated (F4) tablets would be a successful approach for colonic delivery of rutin with potential of improving therapeutic efficacy.

    "abstract": "Abstract To overcome the challenges associated with the co-delivery of AuNPs (gold nanoparticles) and miRNA as an anti-breast cancer combination therapy, niosomal systems were developed using Span 60, cholesterol, and a cationic lipid (CTAB), and the formulations were optimized using Box-Behnken experimental design. The niosomal formulations with the smallest size were selected for further optimization of size, surface charge, entrapment efficiency, and stability. To achieve this, AuNPs and DSPE-PEG2000 (2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000)were added to the formulation. The optimized niosomal formulation could effectively encapsulate AuNPs with an entrapment efficiency of 34.49% ± 0.84 and a spherical particle size of 153.6 ± 4.62 nm. The incorporation of PEG and CTAB led to notable enhancements in the overall characteristics of the delivery system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the combination therapy, various assessments such as cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and gene expression properties were conducted. The results demonstrated that the combination delivery using the new C-PEG-Nio-AuNPs (cationic pegylated niosomal gold nanoparticles) system and miRNA had the lowest IC50, the highest apoptosis rate, and the most significant upregulation of miRNA and BAX/BCL2 expression in MCF-7 cell growth. In conclusion, this innovative co-delivery approach represents a promising breakthrough in the development of therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment. By combining multiple therapeutic agents within a single delivery system, this method has the potential to enhance treatment efficacy, reduce side effects, and improve patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This work reports the development and characterisation of polymeric films composed of gelatin or its chemically modified derivatives (crotonoylated, itaconoylated, and methacryloylated gelatins) blended with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Metronidazole served as an antimicrobial drug in these formulations. Methods The films were produced by casting aqueous solutions of polymers, followed by solvent evaporation. Their structure and physicochemical characteristics were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and mechanical testing. The thickness of the films, their folding endurance, the surface pH, and transparency were also evaluated. The mucoadhesive performance of the films was evaluated through an ex vivo detachment technique involving freshly excised sheep vaginal tissues. In vitro cumulative drug release studies were conducted using Franz diffusion cells. Results The results demonstrate that incorporating unsaturated functional groups into gelatin improves its mucoadhesive properties compared to native gelatin. The drug release experiments conducted in vitro showed that the cumulative release from pure gelatin/PVA films was found to be 49 ± 2%, whereas modified gelatins/PVA (70:30) films released ~ 64–71%. Conclusion These findings suggest that modified gelatins could serve as effective excipients in designing mucoadhesive formulations for vaginal administration, with potential applications extending to other transmucosal drug delivery systems.

    "abstract": "Abstract Pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI) are a vital therapy for the treatment of lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In pMDI, the propellants used to deliver the drug to the lungs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). However, the current HFCs in use have large global warming potential (GWP). In order to reduce or eliminate the use of propellants with large global warming potential, efforts are underway within the pharmaceutical industry to transition to the use of low GWP propellants in pMDI, while maintaining their effectiveness in treating disease. The current switch from higher GWP propellants mirrors the switch from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants to HFCs undertaken in the 1990’s, which was driven by ozone depletion concerns. In this paper, the International Pharmaceutical Aerosol Consortium on Regulation and Science (IPAC-RS) discusses aspects of the switch to low GWP propellants from the perspective of materials compatibility of pMDI components with low GWP propellants. Leveraging the learnings and advances in pMDI component materials implemented following the switch from CFCs, industry is well positioned to make the change. This paper describes the utility of the low GWP propellants being developed for use in pMDI and the learnings from the previous transition that are being leveraged by industry. The current state of development will be described, including a review of available literature supporting the transition to low GWP propellants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Effective acne treatment is critical due to its profound impact on physical and psychological well-being. It was shown that severe systemic side effects, including teratogenicity, ovarian reserve reduction, depression, dry skin, hypertriglyceridemia, and intracranial hypertension limited oral isotretinoin usage. Therefore, this study addresses these challenges by developing isotretinoin-loaded lipid liquid crystal (LLC-IT) nanoparticles for topical application, aiming to enhance localized delivery while minimizing systemic exposure. LLC-IT nanoparticles were prepared using a top-down method and evaluated for their physicochemical properties, photostability, cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity, in-vitro drug release, and in-vivo therapeutic efficacy. A testosterone-induced acne mouse model was used to compare LLC-IT treatment with untreated and commercial isotretinoin gel-treated groups. LLC-IT nanoparticles exhibited a uniform particle size (69.57 ± 0.51 nm), low polydispersity index (0.264 ± 0.01), and stable zeta potential (- 19.3 ± 0.2 mV). High encapsulation efficiency (95% ± 3) and effective loading capacity (1.15% ± 0.13) were achieved. Drug release was diffusion-controlled with minimal UV-induced degradation. Stability assessments over 12 months confirmed consistent properties across varying storage temperatures. LLC-IT displayed significant antibacterial activity and reduced skin irritation in Draize tests compared to commercial gels. In-vivo , LLC-IT reduced inflammation significantly more than untreated or commercial gel-treated groups, indicating enhanced therapeutic efficacy of LLC-IT formulation. The isotretinoin-loaded lipid liquid crystal formulation shows superior stability and efficacy with reduced side effects compared to conventional treatments, offering a more effective and patient-friendly solution, as well as a promising alternative for industrial production in acne management.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is widely used to treat several neglected tropical diseases, including onchocerciasis, helminthiases, and scabies. Additionally, IVM has shown potential as a potent inhibitor of certain RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. However, IVM is highly hydrophobic, essentially insoluble in water, which limits its bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness. The use of liposomes as drug carriers offers several advantages, including enhanced solubility for lipophilic drugs, passive targeting of immune system cells, sustained release, and improved tissue penetration. To address the limitations of IVM, including its poor solubility and bioavailability, liposomal formulations were developed using a combination of soyphosphatidylcholine (SPC), dioleylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), cholesterol (Ch), and diethylphosphate (DCP) in two distinct molar ratios (1.85:1:0.15 and 7:2:1) via the ethanol injection method. The physicochemical properties of the placebo and IVM-loaded liposomes were extensively characterized in our earlier study, including the particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. The present work adds a deeper level of investigation into how to effect cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in vitro of both free IVM and IVM-loaded liposomes in Vero E6 cells. The half-maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC 50 ) for free IVM and IVM-loaded liposomes were 10 μM and &gt; 110 μM, respectively and the cellular uptake of IVM-loaded liposomes ranged from 13 to 60%, whereas free IVM showed a significantly lower uptake of only 2%. These results demonstrate that liposomal encapsulation effectively enhances IVM’s cellular uptake while reducing its cytotoxicity, thus offering a promising strategy for improving the effectiveness of IVM.

    "abstract": "Abstract Novel topical nanosponges were implemented to improve the skin availability of simvastatin (SV) for treating full-thickness wounds while controlling the scarring process. SV exhibits great potential in treating various skin diseases owing to its antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. However, its poor oral bioavailability and systemic side effects have hindered its clinical application in dermatology. For the first time, nanosponges were utilized to target injured skin, creating an SV reservoir within the wound bed to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Herein, SV-loaded ethyl-cellulose nanosponges (SV-NS) were prepared using the emulsion solvent evaporation technique, optimizing organic solvents, SV concentration, and stabilizer concentration. The selected SV-NS (20 mg SV) exhibited nanoporous particles (786.2 ± 50 nm), a specific surface area of 10.3 m 2 /g, and a total pore volume of 0.016 cm 3 /g, offering sustained release and enhanced skin retention capacity. In vivo studies on full-thickness rat wounds confirmed that topical SV-NS (5 mg SV, applied every 5 days) significantly accelerated wound closure ( P &lt; 0.0001), achieving 76.23 ± 3.20% closure by day 8, a 47% improvement over free SV. Consequently, SV-NS facilitated wound closure exceeding 90% by day 11, whereas free SV required 16 days to attain a comparable level, representing a 31.2% faster healing rate. Histological analysis further revealed that SV-NS promoted optimal epidermal layer formation and well-organized collagen deposition, with collagen expression significantly ( P &lt; 0.0001) reaching 59.85 ± 3.17% by day 16. Conclusively, SV-NS enhances SV’s dermal availability, improving wound healing and minimizing side effects, demonstrating a promising approach for wound restoration. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drug delivery through the skin provides several advantages over other administration routes, including the avoidance of first-pass metabolism and gastrointestinal side effects, prolonged drug release, and significant improvement in patient compliance. It is imperative to study the in vitro behavior of drugs and formulations before proceeding to in vivo evaluations. As the ethical guidelines for scientific research evolve, there is an increasing emphasis on adopting alternative methods to reduce animal use. An in vitro permeation study (IVPT) estimates the rate and extent of drug permeation from a topical or transdermal delivery, determining its availability at the skin layers or into the systemic circulation. Vertical Franz diffusion cells are commonly employed for IVPT studies to evaluate the permeation of drugs across skin or other biorelevant membranes. This comprehensive review provides a clear understanding of the importance of optimizing in vitro experimental conditions to obtain reliable and reproducible data. We discuss various in vitro skin models, including excised human and animal skins, human skin equivalents (HSEs), synthetic membranes, and 3D-printed skin models. Additionally, a broad overview of setting up in vitro diffusion cells is provided. Emphasis is given on donor phase design, receptor medium selection, the importance of solubility and stability studies, sampling techniques, and analysis methods. Meticulous design and optimization of in vitro permeation experiments are crucial for generating reproducible data, which are essential for predicting the dermatokinetics of drugs and formulations.

    "abstract": "Abstract Being highly toxic and a quick-acting vesicant, even small amounts of lewisite if not decontaminated immediately are rapidly absorbed into systemic circulation via skin exposure, leading to acute poisoning and death. The skin is the first major target to such chemical weapons. Although the stratum corneum provides a barrier lewisite being a lipophilic molecule that readily permeates this barrier. This necessitates, making early and thorough decontamination prior to manifestation of adverse effects. For this, we aimed to decontaminate skin using an antidote-loaded topical foam, followed by treating local and systemic toxicity using the same formulation. Successful incorporation of 1% antidote into a decontaminating topical foam and the delivery of 1.78 ± 0.21 µg/sq cm into dermatomed porcine ear skin within five minutes of application was achieved. Decontamination after five minutes of exposure (88.43%), as well as prolonged exposure (94.53%; 3 h) to methyl salicylate, a warfare chemical simulant, was demonstrated. The developed formulation demonstrated the potential to back-extract simulant from skin tissue but could not purge simulant penetrated systemic circulation. However, systemic delivery of the antidote was demonstrated, establishing the potential to treat the toxicity caused by the remnant warfare chemicals. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research was the preparation of four formulations containing hydrocortisone acetate (HCA) for topical application, including two aqueous systems (hydrophilic microemulsion and aqueous gel) and two systems with dominant hydrophobicity (hydrophobic microemulsion and ointment). The formulations were tested for the release and permeation of HCA across an animal membrane. The release of HCA was found comparable for the four systems. The two microemulsions promote permeation across an ex-vivo membrane, examined by means of a Franz cell. Hydrophobic microemulsion guarantees the highest solubility (2,370 microg/ml) and flux (133 microg/cm(2).h) of the drug, since it contains almost 40% Transcutol, a permeation enhancer. Gel and ointment provide lower solubility and flux, being the values, related to the ointment, the lowest ones (562 microg/ml and 0.4 microg/cm(2).h). Experimental results allow the conclusion that gel and ointment can be suitable when it is desirable to minimize absorption of topically applied HCA as to keep the drug restricted to the diseased area and prevent side effects of the systemic presence of HCA.",

    "abstract": "This commentary reflects the collective view of pharmaceutical scientists from four different organizations with extensive experience in the field of drug discovery support. Herein, engaging discussion is presented on the current and future approaches for the selection of the most optimal and developable drug candidates. Over the past two decades, developability assessment programs have been implemented with the intention of improving physicochemical and metabolic properties. However, the complexity of both new drug targets and non-traditional drug candidates provides continuing challenges for developing formulations for optimal drug delivery. The need for more enabled technologies to deliver drug candidates has necessitated an even more active role for pharmaceutical scientists to influence many key molecular parameters during compound optimization and selection. This enhanced role begins at the early in vitro screening stages, where key learnings regarding the interplay of molecular structure and pharmaceutical property relationships can be derived. Performance of the drug candidates in formulations intended to support key in vivo studies provides important information on chemotype-formulation compatibility relationships. Structure modifications to support the selection of the solid form are also important to consider, and predictive in silico models are being rapidly developed in this area. Ultimately, the role of pharmaceutical scientists in drug discovery now extends beyond rapid solubility screening, early form assessment, and data delivery. This multidisciplinary role has evolved to include the practice of proactively taking part in the molecular design to better align solid form and formulation requirements to enhance developability potential.",

    "abstract": "Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are digestion products of lipid-rich food and lipid-based formulations, and they are used as transient permeability enhancers in formulation of poorly permeable compounds. These molecules may promote drug absorption by several different processes, including solubilization, increased membrane fluidity, and increased paracellular transport through opening of the tight junctions. Therefore, understanding the aggregation behavior of MCFAs is important. A number of studies have measured the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of MCFAs experimentally. However, CMC is highly dependent on system conditions like pH, temperature, and the ionic strength of the buffer used in different experimental techniques. In this study, we investigated the aggregation behavior of four different MCFAs using the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations with the purpose to explore if CG-MD can be used to study MCFA interactions occurring in water. The ratio of deprotonated and non-charged MCFA molecules were manipulated to assess aggregation behavior under different pH conditions and within the box sizes of 22 × 22 × 44 nm3 and 44 nm3 for 1 μs. CMCs were calculated by performing CG-MD simulations with an increasing number of MCFAs. The resulting aggregate size distribution and number of free MCFA molecules were used to determine the CMC. The CMCs from simulations for C8, C10, and C12 were 1.8-3.5-fold lower than the respective CMCs determined experimentally by the Wilhelmy method. However, the variation of MCFA aggregate sizes and morphologies at different pH conditions is consistent with previous experimental observation. Overall, this study suggests that CG-MD is suitable for studying colloidal systems including various MCFAs.",

    "abstract": "The process of drying thin polymer films is an important operation that influences the film structure and solid state, and the stability of the product. The purpose of this work was to study and model the drying kinetics of multicomponent films based on two polymers: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC, amorphous) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, semicrystalline). The isothermal drying kinetics of the films at different temperatures (40, 60, and 80°C) were studied using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and convection oven methods. Solid-state characterization tools used in the study included polarization and hot-stage microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The drying kinetics of HPMC and PVA films in the TGA apparatus and convection oven were comparable. The three-parameter (W max, τ, n) Hill equation successfully modeled the experimental drying kinetics. The time factor τ in the Hill equation nicely explained two drying phases in the films. Solid-state phase changes occurring in the films during dehydration had a bearing on the drying kinetics and mechanisms. TGA can be used as a simple tool to determine the end points in drying processes using ovens or tunnels. The three-parameter Hill equation explained the drying kinetics and diffusion mechanisms of the solvent through the polymer films for the first time. This study advances our understanding of film drying, in particular for pharmaceutically relevant thin films.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermal processing has gained much interest in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly for the enhancement of solubility, bioavailability, and dissolution of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with poor aqueous solubility. Formulation scientists have developed various techniques which may include physical and chemical modifications to achieve solubility enhancement. One of the most commonly used methods for solubility enhancement is through the use of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs). Examples of commercialized ASDs include Kaletra®, Kalydeco®, and Onmel®. Various technologies produce ASDs; some of the approaches, such as spray-drying, solvent evaporation, and lyophilization, involve the use of solvents, whereas thermal approaches often do not require solvents. Processes that do not require solvents are usually preferred, as some solvents may induce toxicity due to residual solvents and are often considered to be damaging to the environment. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on recent innovations reported for using hot-melt extrusion and KinetiSol® Dispersing technologies to formulate poorly water-soluble APIs in amorphous solid dispersions. We will address development challenges for poorly water-soluble APIs and how these two processes meet these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hydrogel wound dressings are highly effective in the therapy of wounds. Yet, most of them do not contain any active ingredient that could accelerate healing. The aim of this study was to prepare hydrophilic active dressings loaded with an anti-inflammatory compound - trans-resveratrol (RSV) of hydrophobic properties. A special attention was paid to select such a technological strategy that could both reduce the risk of irritation at the application site and ensure the homogeneity of the final hydrogel. RSV dissolved in Labrasol was combined with an aqueous sol of poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA), containing propylene glycol (PG) as a plasticizer. This sol was transformed into a gel under six consecutive cycles of freezing (-80 °C) and thawing (RT). White, uniform and elastic membranes were successfully produced. Their critical features, namely microstructure, mechanical properties, water uptake and RSV release were studied using SEM, DSC, MRI, texture analyser and Franz-diffusion cells. The cryogels made of 8 % of PVA showed optimal tensile strength (0.22 MPa) and elasticity (0.082 MPa). The application of MRI enabled to elucidate mass transport related phenomena in this complex system at the molecular (detection of PG, confinement effects related to pore size) as well as at the macro level (swelling). The controlled release of RSV from membranes was observed for 48 h with mean dissolution time of 18 h and dissolution efficiency of 35 %. All in all, these cryogels could be considered as a promising new active wound dressings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drug delivery into the brain has for long been a huge challenge as the blood–brain barrier (BBB) offers great resistance to entry of foreign substances (with drugs inclusive) into the brain. This barrier in healthy individuals is protective to the brain, disallowing noxious substances present in the blood to get to the brain while allowing for the exchange of small molecules into the brain by diffusion. However, BBB is disrupted under certain disease conditions, such as cerebrovascular diseases including acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, and neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and cancers. This review aims to provide a broad overview of present-day strategies for brain drug delivery, emphasizing novel delivery systems. Hopefully, this review would inspire scientists and researchers in the field of drug delivery across BBB to uncover new techniques and strategies to optimize drug delivery to the brain. Considering the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiological functioning of the BBB in health and disease conditions, this review is focused on the controversies drawn from conclusions of recently published studies on issues such as the penetrability of nanoparticles into the brain, and whether active targeted drug delivery into the brain could be achieved with the use of nanoparticles. We also extended the review to cover novel non-nanoparticle strategies such as using viral and peptide vectors and other non-invasive techniques to enhance brain uptake of drugs. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to develop a bilosomal gel formulation to enhance transdermal permeability of dronedarone hyrdrochloride (DRN) which suffers from poor oral absorption and limited bioavailability. To overcome this obstacle, bilosomes were successfully prepared using 23 full-factorial design. Span®40, cholesterol, sodium deoxycholate (bile salt), clove oil (permeability enhancer), and either Tween® 60 or Tween® 80 (edge activator) were used in bilosome preparation by ethanol injection method. In this design, independent variables were X1, edge activator type; X2, edge activator amount (mg); and X3, permeability enhancer concentration (% w/v). Optimal formula (B2) of the highest desirability of (0.776) demonstrated minimum vesicle size (VS) of 312.4 ± 24.42 nm, maximum absolute value of zeta potential (ZP) - 36.17 ± 2.57 mV, maximum entrapment efficiency (EE %) of 80.95 ± 3.01%, maximum deformability Index (DI) of 8.24 ± 1.26 g and maximum drug flux after 12 h (J12) of 21.23 ± 1.54 µg/cm2 h upon ex vivo permeation study. After 12 h, 70.29 ± 6.46% of DRN was released from B2. TEM identification of B2 showed spherical shaped nanosized vesicles which were physically stable for 3 months at different temperatures. B2 was incorporated into carboxymethylcellulose gel base for easiness of dermal application. B2 gel demonstrated good physical properties, non-Newtonian psuedoplastic flow, and enhanced release (57.0 ± 8.68% of DRN compared to only 13.3 ± 1.2% released from drug suspension after 12 h) and enhanced skin permeation.",

    "abstract": "Analytical method validation is a vital element of drug formulation and delivery studies. Here, high-performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with UV detection (HPLC-UV) has been used to produce a straightforward, quick, yet sensitive analytical approach to quantify carvedilol (CAR). A C18 column was used to isolate the analyte from the mixture by isocratic elution with a mobile phase comprising a mixture of 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile in a ratio of 65:35 v/v at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min-1. Linearity was observed for CAR concentrations within the range of 1.5-50 μg mL-1 (R2 = 0.999) in phosphate buffer saline and within the range of 0.2-6.2 μg mL-1 (R2 = 0.9999) in methanol. The International Council on Harmonization (ICH) requirements were followed throughout the validation of the isocratic approach, rendering it specific, accurate, and precise. Moreover, robustness tests indicated that the method remained selective and specific despite small deliberate changes to environmental and operational factors. An efficient extraction procedure was also developed to extract and quantify CAR from excised neonatal porcine skin, resulting in recovery rates ranging from 95 to 97%. The methods reported here have been successfully utilised to evaluate CAR permeation, both transdermally and intradermally following application of a dissolving microarray patch (MAP) to excised neonatal porcine skin.",

We summarized inefficient and good practices in these papers and provided some practical advice.

The emerging modeling approach demonstrated practical advantages. However, the upfront generation of some input parameters (vial heat transfer coefficient, minimum controllable pressure, and maximum sublimation rate) is essential for model utilization. While the primary drying step can be transferred with a high degree of confidence (e.g., using modeling), and secondary drying is usually fairly straightforward, predicting potential changes in product behavior during freezing remains challenging.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have increased lately around the world, as they are considered essential and popular drugs for effective reduction of pain and inflammation. They have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activities; also, it was reported recently that they protect against various critical disorders like heart attacks and cancer. However, oral use of NSAIDs may cause several pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, cardiovascular, cerebral, and renal complications. Therefore, topical NSAIDs were recommended as a substitute to oral NSAIDs for the treatment of inflammation and pain. Still, the skin permeation of NSAIDs is considered a challenge, as the skin have an effective barrier function. Therefore, this review investigates various advanced vesicular nanocarriers and their applications through the skin, to augment the topical delivery of NSAIDs through stratum corneum over the conventional systems, enhance their effectiveness, and reduce the unwanted side effects. These innovative systems can manage bioavailability, solubility, stability, safety, and efficacy issues present in conventional systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a significant economic impact and a high mortality rate. Telmisartan (TLM) is a potential therapy for HCC, but it has a limited scope in drug delivery due to unpredictable distribution and poor bioavailability. The objective of this study was to prepare, design, and in vitro evaluate lactose-modified chitosan nanoparticles (LCH NPs) as a liver-targeted nanocarrier for TLM with the potential to offer a promising HCC therapy. The combination of chitosan with lactose was successfully attained using the Maillard reaction. TLM-LCH NPs were prepared, characterized, and optimized with the developed 2 3 full factorial design. The optimized formulation (F1) was in vitro and in vivo characterized. LCH was synthesized with an acceptable yield of 43.8 ± 0.56%, a lactosylation degree of 14.34%, and a significantly higher aqueous solubility (6.28 ± 0.21 g/L) compared to native chitosan (0.25 ± 0.03 g/L). In vitro characterization demonstrated that, F1 had a particle size of 145.46 ± 0.7 nm, an entrapment efficiency of 90.21 ± 0.28%, and a surface charge of + 27.13 ± 0.21 mV. In vitro TLM release from F1 was most consistent with the Higuchi model and demonstrated significantly higher release at pH 5.5. Moreover, a significantly higher ratio of liver to plasma concentration was observed with TLM-LCH NPs compared to plain TLM and unmodified TLM-NPs. The obtained results nominate TLM-LCH NPs as a promising carrier for enhancing liver targeting of TLM in treatment of HCC. Graphical abstract",

The MNPs were prepared using the coprecipitation method, and their magnetic properties were investigated based on their composition. Among the compositions tested, Mn0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 MNPs exhibited superparamagnetic properties with a saturation magnetization moment of 34.6 emu/g at room temperature (25°C). To enhance the water solubility of curcumin (Cur), known for its hydrophobic nature, it was successfully loaded onto alginate (Alg)/chitosan (Chit)@Mn0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs). The nanocomposite was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) which revealed a particle size of approximately 20 nm. The crystalline structure of the NPs was analyzed using X-ray diffraction, while Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray, and map analysis techniques were employed for further characterization. In terms of drug release, there was an initial burst release of Cur (around 18%) within the first hour, followed by a slower release (approximately 61%) over the next 36 h. The anti-tumor properties of the Cur-loaded NPs were evaluated using the Methyl Thiazol Tetrazolium (MTT) assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The MTT assay confirmed a higher cytotoxic effect of Cur-loaded Alg/Chit@Mn0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 NPs on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line compared to free Cur, highlighting the significance of incorporating Cur into nano-sized carrier systems.",

The challenges in scale-up and transfer were discussed in the first part of this paper and include vial breakage during freezing at commercial scale, cake resistance differences between scales, impact of differences in refrigeration capacities, and geometry on the performance of dryers. The second part of this work discusses successful and unsuccessful practices in scale-up and transfer based on the experience of the authors. Regulatory aspects of scale-up and transfer of lyophilization processes were also outlined including a topic on the equivalency of dryers. Based on an analysis of challenges and a summary of best practices, recommendations on scale-up and transfer of lyophilization processes are given including projections on future directions in this area of the freeze drying field. Recommendations on the choice of residual vacuum in the vials were also provided for a wide range of vial capacities. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantitative in silico tools may be leveraged to mechanistically predict the dermato-pharmacokinetics of compounds delivered from topical and transdermal formulations by integrating systems of rate equations that describe permeation through the formulation and layers of skin and pilo-sebaceous unit, and exchange with systemic circulation via local blood flow. Delivery of clobetasol-17 propionate (CP) from Dermovate TM cream was simulated using the Transdermal Compartmental Absorption &amp; Transit (TCAT TM ) Model in GastroPlus ® . The cream was treated as an oil-in-water emulsion, with model input parameters estimated from publicly available information and quantitative structure-permeation relationships. From the ranges of values available for model input parameters, a set of parameters was selected by comparing model outputs to CP dermis concentration-time profiles measured by dermal open-flow microperfusion (Bodenlenz et al . Pharm Res. 33(9):2229–38, 2016). Predictions of unbound dermis CP concentrations were reasonably accurate with respect to time and skin depth. Parameter sensitivity analyses revealed considerable dependence of dermis CP concentration profiles on drug solubility in the emulsion, relatively less dependence on dispersed phase volume fraction and CP effective diffusivity in the continuous phase of the emulsion, and negligible dependence on dispersed phase droplet size. Effects of evaporative water loss from the cream and corticosteroid-induced vasoconstriction were also assessed. This work illustrates the applicability of computational modeling to predict sensitivity of dermato-pharmacokinetics to changes in thermodynamic and transport properties of a compound in a topical formulation, particularly in relation to rate-limiting steps in skin permeation. Where these properties can be related to formulation composition and processing, such a computational approach may support the design of topically applied formulations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Berberine is used in the treatment of metabolic syndrome and its low solubility and very poor oral bioavailability of berberine was one of the primary hurdles for its market approval. This study aimed to improve the solubility and bioavailability of berberine by preparing pellet formulations containing drug-excipient complex (obtained by solid dispersion). Berberine-excipient solid dispersion complexes were obtained with different ratios by the solvent evaporation method. The maximum saturation solubility test was performed as a key factor for choosing the optimal complex for the drug-excipient. The properties of these complexes were investigated by FTIR, DSC, XRD and dissolution tests. The obtained pellets were evaluated and compared in terms of pelletization efficiency, particle size, mechanical strength, sphericity and drug release profile in simulated media of gastric and intestine. Solid-state analysis showed complex formation between the drug and excipients used in solid dispersion. The optimal berberine-phospholipid complex showed a 2-fold increase and the optimal berberine-gelucire and berberine-citric acid complexes showed more than a 3-fold increase in the solubility of berberine compared to pure berberine powder. The evaluation of pellets from each of the optimal complexes showed that the rate and amount of drug released from all pellet formulations in the simulated gastric medium were significantly lower than in the intestine medium. The results of this study showed that the use of berberine-citric acid or berberine-gelucire complex could be considered a promising technique to increase the saturation solubility and improve the release characteristics of berberine from the pellet formulation.

    "abstract": "Abstract This review investigates the progression and effectiveness of colon-targeted drug delivery systems, offering a comprehensive understanding of the colon's anatomy and physiological environment. Recognizing the distinctive features of the colon is crucial for successfully formulating oral dosage forms that precisely target specific areas in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) while minimizing side effects through mitigating off-target sites. This understanding forms the basis for designing effective targeted drug delivery systems. The article extensively examines diverse approaches to formulating drugs for colonic targeting, highlighting key polymers and excipients in their production. Special emphasis is given to innovative approaches such as hot-melt extrusion (HME) and three-dimensional printing (3D-P), renowned for their accuracy in drug release kinetics and intricate dosage form geometry. However, challenges arise regarding material standardization and the complex network of regulatory clearances required to confirm safety and effectiveness. The review provides insights into each application’s advantages and potential challenges. Furthermore, it sheds light on the local diseases that necessitate colon targeting and the available marketed products, providing an overview of the current state of colon-targeted drug delivery systems. Additionally, the review emphasizes the importance of testing drugs in a controlled in vitro environment during the development phase. It also discusses the future directions for successful development in this field. By integrating knowledge across anatomy, formulation techniques, and assessment methodologies, this review is a valuable resource for researchers navigating the dynamic field of colonic drug delivery.

    "abstract": "Abstract Antibiotic administration is an adjacent therapy to guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in the management of periodontitis. This is due to the major role of pathogen biofilm in aggravating periodontal defects. This study aimed to fabricate a GTR membrane for sustained delivery of doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) while having a space-maintaining function. The membranes were prepared using a polymeric blend of polycaprolactone/polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan by the electrospinning technique. The obtained membranes were characterized in terms of physicochemical and biological properties. Nanofibers showed a mean diameter in the submicron range of &lt; 450 nm while having uniform randomly aligned morphology. The obtained membranes showed high strength and flexibility. A prolonged in vitro release profile during 68 h was observed for manufactured formulations. The prepared membranes showed a cell viability of &gt; 70% at different DOX concentrations. The formulations possessed antimicrobial efficacy against common pathogens responsible for periodontitis. In vivo evaluation also showed prolonged release of DOX for 14 days. The histopathological evaluation confirmed the biocompatibility of the GTR membrane. In conclusion, the developed nanofibrous DOX-loaded GTR membranes may have beneficial characteristics in favour of both sustained antibiotic delivery and periodontal regeneration by space-maintaining function without causing any irritation and tissue damage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chrysin is a natural flavonoid with a wide range of bioactivities. Only a few investigations have assessed the analgesic activity of chrysin. The lipophilicity of chrysin reduces its aqueous solubility and bioavailability. Hence, self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) were designed to overcome this problem. Kollisolv GTA, Tween 80, and Transcutol HP were selected as oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant, respectively. SNEDDS A, B, and C were prepared, loaded with chrysin (0.1%w/w), and extensively evaluated. The optimized formula (B) encompasses 25% Kollisolv GTA, 18.75% Tween 80, and 56.25% Transcutol HP was further assessed. TEM, in vitro release, and biocompatibility towards the normal oral epithelial cell line (OEC) were estimated. Brain targeting and acetic acid-induced writhing in a mouse model were studied. After testing several adsorbents, powdered SNEDDS B was formulated and evaluated. The surfactant/cosurfactant (S/CoS) ratio of 1:3 w/w was appropriate for the preparation of SNEDDS. Formula B exhibited instant self-emulsification, spherical nanoscaled droplets of 155.4 ± 32.02 nm, and a zeta potential of − 12.5 ± 3.40 mV. The in vitro release proved the superiority of formula B over chrysin suspension (56.16 ± 10.23 and 9.26 ± 1.67%, respectively). The biocompatibility of formula B towards OEC was duplicated (5.69 ± 0.03 µg/mL). The nociceptive pain was mitigated by formula B more efficiently than chrysin suspension as the writhing numbers reduced from 8.33 ± 0.96 to 0 after 60 min of oral administration. Aerosil R972 was selected as an adsorbent, and its chemical compatibility was confirmed. In conclusion, our findings prove the therapeutic efficacy of chrysin self-nanoemulsion as a potential targeting platform to combat pain. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate whether a non-protein nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) resembling high-density lipoprotein (HDL) could deliver a hydrophobic anti-atherogenic drug, lovastatin, to foam cells. Lovastatin-loaded NLC (LT-NLC) was prepared by a nanoprecipitation/solvent diffusion method. The LT-NLC-apoprotein (LT-NLC-apo) was prepared by incubating LT-NLC with native HDL. The physicochemical parameters of LT-NLC were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency, and crystallization behavior. Targeting behavior and mechanism were demonstrated by the incubation of LT-NLC-apo with a RAW 264.7 macrophage-derived foam cell model in the presence or absence of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and lipase. The results showed that LT-NLC was solid spherical or oval in shape with an average diameter of 13.8 ± 2.2 nm, zeta potential of -29.3 ± 0.2 mV and entrapment efficiency of 96.2 ± 1.3%. Phagocytosis studies showed that uptake of LT-NLC-apo by macrophages was significantly lower than LT-NLC (p < 0.01), suggesting that LT-NLC-apo could possibly escape recognition from macrophages in vivo. The uptake was increased twofold when LT-NLC-apo was incubated with transfected foam cells containing VLDL and lipase. These results indicated that non-protein NLC resembling HDL could be a useful tool to deliver lipophilic anti-atherogenic drugs to foam cells, and that uptake could be enhanced by the VLDL receptor pathway.",

    "abstract": "Drug delivery in the brain is limited by slow drug diffusion in the brain tissue. This study tested the hypothesis that ultrasound can safely enhance the permeation of drugs in the brain. In vitro exposure to ultrasound at various frequencies (85 kHz, 174 kHz, and 1 MHz) enhanced the permeation of tritium-labeled molecules with molecular weight up to 70 kDa across porcine brain tissue. A maximum enhancement of 24-fold was observed at 85 kHz and 1,200 J/cm2. In vivo exposure to 1-MHz ultrasound further demonstrated the ability of ultrasound to facilitate molecule distribution in the brain of a non-human primate. Finally, ultrasound under conditions similar to those used in vivo was shown to cause no damage to plasmid DNA, siRNA, adeno-associated virus, and fetal rat cortical neurons over a range of conditions. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that ultrasound can increase drug permeation in the brain in vitro and in vivo under conditions that did not cause detectable damage.",

    "abstract": "The addition of polysorbate 20 (T20) is required to achieve \"sink\" conditions during a dissolution test for tablets with candesartan cilexetil (CC). Polysorbate 20 (0.35%-0.7% w/w) added to 0.05 mol/L of phosphate buffer pH 6.5 dramatically increased the apparent solubility of the drug from 0.8 μg/ml even to 353 μg/ml, while its effect in lower pH or in water was much smaller (20 μg/ml in pH 4.5). The increased concentration of phosphate salts (0.2 mol/l) at pH 6.5 in the presence of 0.7% of polysorbate 20, resulted in further increase of candesartan cilexetil solubility to 620 μg/ml. The change of pH from 1.2 to 7.4 resulted in a 1.5-fold increase of the activation energy and, depending on temperature, 8-14-fold decrease of the degradation rate. When polysorbate 20 increased the activation energy 2-fold, independent of pH, it protected candesartan cilexetil from degradation; however, this effect was temperature dependent and was very small at 310 K-the degradation rate in pH 6.5 decreased by 13% only. It was calculated that in the phosphate buffer pH 6.5 with polysorbate, one can expect during 24 h the degradation at the level of 9.3%, thus a flow-through dissolution apparatus was recommended for testing prolonged release dosage forms.",

    "abstract": "The influence of alkaline and the neutral grade of magnesium aluminometasilicate as a porous solid carrier for the liquid self-emulsifying formulation with ibuprofen is investigated. Ibuprofen is dissolved in Labrasol, then this solution is adsorbed on the silicates. The drug to the silicate ratio is 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6, respectively. The properties of formulations obtained are analyzed, using morphological, porosity, crystallinity, and dissolution studies. Three solid self-emulsifying (S-SE) formulations containing Neusilin SG2 and six consisting of Neusilin US2 are in the form of powder without agglomerates. The nitrogen adsorption method shows that the solid carriers are mesoporous but they differ in a specific surface area, pore area, and the volume of pores. The adsorption of liquid SE formulation on solid silicate particles results in a decrease in their porosity. If the neutral grade of magnesium aluminometasilicate is used, the smallest pores, below 10 nm, are completely filled with liquid formulation, but there is still a certain number of pores of 40–100 nm. Dissolution studies of liquid SEDDS carried out in pH = 1.2 show that Labrasol improves the dissolution of ibuprofen as compared to the pure drug. Ibuprofen dissolution from liquid SE formulations examined in pH of 7.2 is immediate. The adsorption of the liquid onto the particles of the silicate causes a decrease in the amount of the drug released. Finally, more ibuprofen is dissolved from S-SE that consist of the neutral grade of magnesium aluminometasilicate than from the formulations containing the alkaline silicate.",

    "abstract": "Particle size is a critical parameter for controlling pharmaceutical quality. The aim of this study was to assess the size of the micrometer-scale active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in tablets using Raman chemical imaging and to understand the effects of formulation on particle size. Model tablets containing National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable polystyrene microsphere size standards were developed to determine the binarization threshold value of Raman chemical images for API particle sizing in specific formulations and processes. Three sets of model tablets containing 5, 10, and 15 μm polystyrene microspheres, used to mimic API, were prepared using a commercial tablet formulation (Ebastel tablets, mean API particle size was about 5 μm). Raman mapping with a 50× objective (NA, 0.75) was applied to tablet cross-sections, and particle size of polystyrene microspheres was estimated from binary images using several binarization thresholds. Mean particle size for three sets of polystyrene microspheres showed good agreement between pre- and postformulation (the slope = 1.024, R = 1.000) at the specific threshold value ((mean + 0.5σ) of the polystyrene-specific peak intensity histogram), regardless of particle agglomeration, tablet surface roughness, and laser penetration depth. The binarization threshold value showed good applicability to Ebastel tablets, where the API-specific peak intensity histogram showed a pattern similar to that of polystyrene microspheres in model tablets. The model tablets enabled determination of an appropriate binarization threshold for assessing the mean particle size of micrometer-scale API in tablets by utilizing the unique physicochemical properties of polystyrene microspheres.",

    "abstract": "Cryoconcentration of an in-house IgG1 and number of aggregates in a formulation containing trehalose were determined in dependence on freezing protocol and volume. Morphology changes of ice crystals depending on cooling rates were captured by optical cryomicroscopy (OCM) images. UV-Vis and affinity chromatography (ALC) was used to determine protein content and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) for detection of aggregates. Cooling to − 80°C rather than − 20°C is beneficial in avoiding hot spots of high protein concentration. An upscaling of 250 ml to 2 L bottles results in an up to fourfold increase of macroscopic cryoconcentration. There is no direct correlation between number of aggregates and macroscopic cryoconcentration. Aggregate formation of that specific mAb is not caused by macroscopic cryoconcentration but can be directly linked to microscopic cryoconcentration in between the ice dendrites. Slower cooling with set-point and storage temperatures below Tg' has proven to be advantageous for the prevention of aggregate formation. We reveal that the subcooling prior to freezing plays a key role in avoiding aggregates. The lower the solution is supercooled the more likely aggregates form. As a consequence, we suggest controlled initiation of the freezing process to avoid large supercooling.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the major advantages that the liquisolid technology offers, particularly in tackling poor bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs (i.e., BCS Class II drugs), there are a few critical drawbacks. The inability of a high liquid load factor, poor flowability, poor compactibility, and an inability to produce a high dose dosage form of a reasonable size for swallowing are major hurdles, hampering this technology from being commercially feasible. An attempt was therefore made to overcome these drawbacks whilst maintaining the liquisolid inherent advantages. This resulted in the emerging next generation of oral dosage forms called the liqui-pellet. All formulations were incorporated into capsules as the final product. Solubility studies of naproxen were conducted in different liquid vehicles, namely polyethylene glycol 200, propylene glycol, Tween 80, Labrafil, Labrasol, and Kolliphor EL. The scanning electron microscopy studies indicated that the liquid vehicle tends to reduce the surface roughness of the pellet. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) indicated no significant differences in the crystalline structure or amorphous content between the physical mixture and the liqui-pellet formulation. This was due to the presence of a high concentration of amorphous Avicel in the formulation which overshadowed the crystalline structure of naproxen in the physical mixtures. Flowability and dissolution tests confirmed that this next-generation oral dosage form has excellent flowability, whilst maintaining the typical liquisolid enhanced drug release performance in comparison to its physical mixture counterpart. The liqui-pellet also had a high liquid load factor of 1, where ~ 29% of the total mass was the liquid vehicle. This shows that a high liquid load factor can be achieved in a liqui-pellet without compromising flowability. Overall, the results showed that the poor flowability of a liquisolid formulation could be overcomed with the liqui-pellet, which is believed to be a major advancement into the commercial feasibility of the liquisolid concept.",

    "abstract": "The study provides the physicochemical characteristic of bosentan (BOS) in comparison to tadalafil (TA) and sildenafil citrate (SIL). Despite some reports dealing with thermal characteristic of SIL and TA, physicochemical properties of BOS have not been investigated so far. Recent clinical reports have indicated that the combination of bosentan and PDE-5 inhibitor can improve the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, in order to design personalized medicines for therapy of chronic rare diseases, detailed information on the thermal behaviour and solubility of each drug is indispensable. Thus, XRD, DSC and TGA-QMS analyses were applied to compare the properties of the drugs, their thermal stability as well as to identify the products of thermal degradation. The dehydration of BOS started at 70°C and was followed by the chemical degradation with the onset at 290°C. The highest thermal stability was stated for TA, which decomposed at ca. 320°C, whereas the lowest onset of the thermal decomposition process was stated for SIL, i.e. 190°C. The products of the drug decomposition were identified. FT-FIR was applied to study intra- and intermolecular interactions between the drug molecules. FT-MIR and Raman spectroscopy were used to examine the chemical structure of the drugs. Chemoinformatic tools were used to predict the polar surface area, pKa, or logP of the drugs. Their results were in line with solubility and dissolution studies.",

    "abstract": "DNA vaccination can be applied to the treatment of various infectious diseases and cancers; however, technical difficulties have hindered the development of an effective delivery method. The efficacy of a DNA vaccine depends on optimal antigen expression by the injected plasmid DNA. The pyro-drive jet injector (PJI) is a novel system that allows for adjustment of injection depth and may, thus, provide a targeted delivery approach for various therapeutic or preventative compounds. Herein, we investigated its potential for use in delivering DNA vaccines. This study evaluated the optimal ignition powder dosage, as well as its delivery effectiveness in both rat and mouse models, while comparing the results of the PJI with that of a needle syringe delivery system. We found that the PJI effectively delivered plasmid DNA to intradermal regions in both rats and mice. Further, it efficiently transfected plasmid DNA directly into the nuclei, resulting in higher protein expression than that achieved via needle syringe injection. Moreover, results from animal ovalbumin (OVA) antigen induction models revealed that animals receiving OVA expression plasmids (pOVA) via PJI exhibited dose-dependent (10 μg, 60 μg, and 120 μg) production of anti-OVA antibodies; while only low titers (< 1/100) of OVA antibodies were detected when 120 μg of pOVA was injected via needle syringe. Thus, PJI is an effective, novel method for delivery of plasmid DNA into epidermal and dermal cells suggesting its promise as a tool for DNA vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emphasizes drug product development by Quality by Design (QbD). Critical material attributes (CMAs) are a QbD element that has an impact on pharmaceutical operations and product quality. Pharmaceutical drugs often crystallize as needle-shaped (a CMA) particles and affect the process due to poor flowability, low bulk density, and high compressibility, and eventually the product performance. In this study, the product obtained from crystallization was needle-shaped Ciprofloxacin HCl (CIPRO), formed lumps during drying, and compacted during processing through feeders. To delump small amounts of materials and break the needles, multiple available devices (mortar-pestle, Krups grinder) and custom-made grinder were assessed before formulation. The processed CIPRO powder was then used to make tablets in the miniature tablet manufacturing unit developed by the team at MIT. The critical quality attributes (CQA) of the tablets, set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), were then assessed for the drug powder processed with each of these devices. Powder properties comparable to commercial CIPRO were obtained when the custom MIT-designed grinder was used, leading to tablets that meet the USP criteria, with comparable dissolution profiles of those for marketed CIPRO tablets. This study demonstrates how needle-shaped crystals have an impact on pharmaceutical operations, even if it is on a miniature scale, and how proper shape and subsequent flow properties can be obtained by processing the particles through the MIT team-designed grinder.

    "abstract": "Abstract Vial-based lyophilization for biopharmaceuticals has been an indispensable cornerstone process for over 50 years. However, the process is not without significant challenges. Capital costs to realize a lyophilized drug product facility, for example, are very high. Similarly, heat and mass transfer limitations inherent in lyophilization result in drying cycle on the order of several days while putting practical constraints on available formulation space, such as solute mass percentage or fill volume in a vial. Through collaboration with an external partner, we are exploring microwave vacuum drying (MVD) as a faster drying process to vial lyophilization wherein the heat transfer process occurs by microwave radiation instead of pure conduction from the vial. Drying using this radiative process demonstrates greater than 80% reduction in drying time over traditional freeze-drying times while maintaining product activity and stability. Such reduction in freeze-drying process times from days to several hours is a welcome change as it enables flexible manufacturing by being able to better react to changes either in terms of product volume for on-demand manufacturing scenarios or facilities for production ( e.g ., scale-out over scale-up). Additionally, by utilizing first-principle modeling coupled with experimental verification, a mechanism for faster drying times associated with MVD is proposed in this article. This research, to the best of our knowledge, forms the very first report of utilizing microwave vacuum drying for vaccines while utilizing the power of simplified models to understand drying principles associated with MVD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study focused on establishing a novel, (pre-)screening approach that enables the development of promising performing self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDSs) with a limited number of experiments. The strategic approach was based on first identifying appropriate excipients (oils/lipids, surfactants, and co-solvents) providing a high saturation solubility for lipophilic model compounds with poor aqueous solubility. Excipients meeting these requirements were selected for SNEDDS development, and a special triangular mixture design was applied for determining excipient ratios for the SNEDDS formulations. Celecoxib and fenofibrate were used as model drugs. Formulations were studied applying a specific combination of in vitro characterization methods. Specifications for a promising SNEDDS formulation were self-imposed: a very small droplet size (&lt; 50 nm), a narrow size distribution of these droplets ( PDI &lt; 0.15) and a high transmittance following SNEDDS dispersion in water (&gt; 99% in comparison with purified water). Excipients that provided a nanoemulsion after dispersion were combined, and ratios were optimized using a customized mapping method in a triangular mixture design. The best performing formulations were finally studied for their in vitro release performance. Results of the study demonstrate the efficiency of the customized screening tool approach. Since it enables successful SNEDDS development in a short time with manageable resources, this novel screening tool approach could play an important role in future SNEDDS development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is growing concern in the rise of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases globally, and with this rise is the presentation of drug resistance. Like other cancers, current treatment options are either invasive or manifest severe side effects. Thus, there is a move towards implementing safer treatment options. Curcumin (CUR), extracted from Curcuma longa , has received significant attention by scientists as possible alternative to chemotherapeutic agents. It is safe and effective against CRC and nontoxic in moderate concentrations. Crucially, it specifically modulates apoptotic effects on CRC. However, the use of CUR is limited by its low solubility and poor bioavailability in aqueous media. These limitations are surmountable through novel approaches, such as nanoencapsulation of CUR, which masks the physicochemical properties of CUR, thus potentiating its anti-CRC effects. Furthermore, chemical derivatization of CUR is another approach that can be used to address the above constraints. This review spans published work in the last two decades, with key findings employing either of the two approaches, in addition to a combined approach in managing CRC. The combined approach affords the possibility of better treatment outcomes but not widely investigated nor yet clinically implemented. Graphical Abstract",

While Liquid-SNEDDS (L-SNEDDS) effectively solubilize the drug in vivo, they have several drawbacks, including poor storage stability. Solid-SNEDDS (S-SNEDDS) combine the advantages of L-SNEDDS with those of solid dosage forms, particularly stability. The aim of the present study was to convert celecoxib L-SNEDDS into S-SNEDDS without altering their release behavior. Various commercially available adsorptive carrier materials were investigated, as well as novel cellulose-based microparticles prepared by spray drying from an aqueous dispersion containing Diacel® 10 and methyl cellulose or gum arabic as a binder prior to their use. Particle size and morphology of the carrier materials were screened by scanning electron microscopy and their effects on the loading capacity for L-SNEDDS were investigated, and comparative in vitro dissolution studies of celecoxib L-SNEDDS and the different S-SNEDDS were performed immediately after preparation and after 3 months of storage. Among the adsorptive carrier materials, the novel cellulose-based microparticles were found to be the most suitable for the preparation of celecoxib S-SNEDDS from L-SNEDDS, enabling the preparation of a solid, stable formulation while preserving the in vitro release performance of the L-SNEDDS formulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The humanoid nail is considered an exceptional protective barrier that is formed mainly from keratin. Onychomycosis is the cause of 50% of nail infections that is generally caused by dermatophytes. Firstly, the infection was regarded as a cosmetic problem but because of the tenacious nature of onychomycosis and its relapses, these infections have attracted medical attention. The first line of therapy was the oral antifungal agents which were proven to be effective; nevertheless, they exhibited hepato-toxic side effects, alongside drug interactions. Following, the opportunity was shifted to the topical remedies, as onychomycosis is rather superficial, yet this route is hindered by the keratinized layers in the nail plate. A potential alternative to overcome the obstacle was applying different mechanical, physical, and chemical methods to boost the penetration of drugs through the nail plate. Unfortunately, these methods might be expensive, require an expert to be completed, or even be followed by pain or more serious side effects. Furthermore, topical formulations such as nail lacquers and patches do not provide enough sustaining effects. Recently, newer therapies such as nanovesicles, nanoparticles, and nanoemulsions have emerged for the treatment of onychomycosis that provided effective treatment with possibly no side effects. This review states the treatment strategies such as mechanical, physical, and chemical methods, and highlights various innovative dosage forms and nanosystems developed in the last 10 years with a focus on advanced findings regarding formulation systems. Furthermore, it demonstrates the natural bioactives and their formulation as nanosystems, and the most relevant clinical outcomes. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Ibrutinib (IBR) is a biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) class II drug and an irreversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. IBR has an extremely low oral bioavailability due to the activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme. The current intention of the research was to enhance solubility followed by oral bioavailability of IBR using the hot melt extrusion (HME) technique by formulating drug-drug cocrystals (DDCs). Ketoconazole (KET) is an active CYP3A4 inhibitor and was selected based on computational studies and solubility parameter prediction. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluations were employed for estimating the formation of IBR-KET DDCs. The IBR-KET DDC system was discovered to have a hydrogen bond (H-bond) and π-π-stacking interactions, in accordance with the computational results. Further, IBR-KET DDCs showed enhanced solubility, stability, powder dissolution, in vitro release, and flow properties. Furthermore, IBR-KET-DDCs were associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity in K562-CCL-243 cancer cell lines when compared with IBR and KET alone. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies have shown an enhanced oral bioavailability of up to 4.30 folds of IBR and 2.31 folds of KET through IBR-KET-DDCs compared to that of the IBR and KET suspension alone. Thus, the prepared IBR-KET-DDCs using the HME technique stand as a favorable drug delivery system that augments the solubility and oral bioavailability of IBR along with KET.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neurovascular diseases are linked to the brain’s blood vessels. These disorders are complicated to treat due to the strict selective characteristics of the blood–brain barrier. Consequently, the potency of the pharmacological treatments for these conditions is immensely diminished, leading to a rise in neurovascular-associated morbidity and mortality. Carbon nanotubes are regarded as essential nanoparticles with a promise of treating neurovascular disorders. Current findings have demonstrated the effectiveness of carbon nanotubes as vehicles for ferrying drugs to the site of interest. This review accentuates the theoretical utilisation of carbon nanotubes as drug nanocarriers equipped with the penetrating capability to the blood–brain barrier for treating neurovascular disorders such as ischemic stroke. The success of the carbon nanotube system may result in the development of a new and highly relevant drug delivery procedure. This review will also cover carbon nanotube functionalisation for applications in the biomedical fields, toxicity, in vitro and in vivo drugs and biomolecule delivery, and the future outlook of carbon nanotubes.

    "abstract": "Abstract This research aimed to explore the possibilities of Eudragit S100 (ES100) and sodium alginate as carriers for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in the female genital tract. Alginate and alginate-ES100 nanoparticles were prepared using the ionic gelation and emulsion/gelation complexation method, respectively. The nanocarriers were tested using morphological, physicochemical, in vitro drug release, and cytotoxicity analyses. In SEM and TEM images, the presence of spherical and uniformly distributed nanoparticles was revealed. The FTIR spectrum showed that alginate and calcium chloride interacted due to ionic bonds linking divalent calcium ions and the -COO- of alginate groups. Alginate and ES100 interacted via the ester C=O amide stretching. The results obtained from XRD and DSC, on the other hand, revealed a favorable interaction between sodium alginate and ES100 polymers, as evidenced by the crystallization peaks observed. Under experimental design analysis and optimization, overall size distribution profiles ranged from 134.9 to 228.0 nm, while zeta potential results showed stable nanoparticles (−17.8 to −38.4 MV). The optimal formulation exhibited a maximum cumulative in vitro release of 72% (pH 4.2) up to 96 h. The cytotoxicity tests revealed the safety of TDF-loaded nanoparticles on vaginal epithelial cells at concentrations of 0.025 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL, and 1 mg/mL for 72 h. These results indicated that alginate-ES100 nanoparticles have the potential to preserve and sustain the release of the TDF drug in the FGT. The future goal is to develop a low-dose non-toxic microbicide that can be administered long term in the vagina to cater to both pregnant and non-pregnant HIV patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Novel p-coumaric acid microemulsion systems were developed to circumvent its absorption and bioavailability challenges. Simplex-lattice mixture design and machine learning methods were employed for optimization. Two optimized formulations were characterized using in vitro re-dispersibility and cytotoxicity on various tumor cell lines (MCF-7, CaCO2, and HepG2). The in vivo bioavailability profiles of the drug loaded in the two microemulsion systems and in the suspension form were compared. The optimized microemulsions composed of Labrafil M1944 CS (5.67%)/Tween 80 (38.71%)/Labrasol (38.71%)/water (16.92%) and Capryol 90 (0.50%)/Transcutol P (26.67%)/Tween 80 (26.67%)/Labrasol (26.67%)/water (19.50%), respectively. They revealed uniform and stable p-coumaric acid-loaded microemulsion systems with a droplet size diameter of about 10 nm. The loaded microemulsion formulations enhanced the drug re-dispersibility in contrast to the drug suspension which exhibited 5 min lag time. The loaded formulae were significantly more cytotoxic on all cell lines by 11.98–16.56 folds on MCF-7 and CaCo2 cells and 47.82–98.79 folds on HepG2 cells higher than the pure drug. The optimized microemulsions were 1.5–1.8 times more bioavailable than the drug suspension. The developed p-coumaric acid microemulsion systems could be considered a successful remedy for diverse types of cancer. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of pharmaceutical advancements, the strategic application of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the skin through topical and transdermal routes has emerged as a compelling avenue for therapeutic interventions. This non-invasive approach has garnered considerable attention in recent decades, with numerous attempts yielding approaches and demonstrating substantial clinical potential. However, the formidable barrier function of the skin, mainly the confinement of drugs on the upper layers of the stratum corneum, poses a substantial hurdle, impeding successful drug delivery via this route. Ultradeformable vesicles/carriers (UDVs), positioned within the expansive realm of nanomedicine, have emerged as a promising tool for developing advanced dermal and transdermal therapies. The current review focuses on improving the passive dermal and transdermal targeting capacity by integrating functionalization groups by strategic surface modification of drug-loaded UDV nanocarriers. The present review discusses the details of case studies of different surface-modified UDVs with their bonding strategies and covers the recent patents and clinical trials. The design of surface modifications holds promise for overcoming existing challenges in drug delivery by marking a significant leap forward in the field of pharmaceutical sciences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) are the two main drugs used for the management of tuberculosis. They are often used as a fixed drug combination, but their delivery is challenged by suboptimal solubility and physical instability. This study explores the potential of active pharmaceutical ingredient-ionic liquids (API-ILs) to improve the physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of INH and RIF. Antitubercular drugs, INH, or RIF, were paired with different counter ions (ascorbic acid (AsA), citric acid (CA), tartaric acid (TA), benzoic acid (BA), salicylic acid (SA), and p-amino salicylic acid (PAS)) using the solvent evaporation method. INH and RIF API-ILs were formed successfully using AsA and CA counter ions. IL formation was examined and analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), and polarized optical microscopy (POM). XRPD and POM confirmed their amorphous nature, while FTIR analysis demonstrated the contribution of hydrogen bonding to IL formation. IL formation enhanced the storage stability of the INH + RIF mixture in the presence of CA. Moreover, RIF-CA IL significantly increased the rate and extent of RIF dissolution. An effect that is unattainable with the RIF/CA physical mixture. Thus, API-IL formation not only enhances RIF dissolution but also facilitates the preparation of stable, compatible INH-RIF combinations. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The administration of surfactant aerosol therapy to preterm infants receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) respiratory support is highly challenging due to small flow passages, relatively high ventilation flow rates, rapid breathing and small inhalation volumes. To overcome these challenges, the objective of this study was to implement a validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and develop an overlay nasal prong interface design for use with CPAP respiratory support that enables high efficiency powder aerosol delivery to the lungs of preterm infants when needed (i.e., on-demand) and can remain in place without increasing the work of breathing compared with a baseline CPAP interface. Realistic in vitro experiments were first conducted to generate baseline validation data, and then the CFD model, once validated, was used to explore key design parameters across a range of preterm infant nose-throat geometries and aerosol delivery conditions. The most important factors for efficient aerosol delivery were shown to be (i) maintaining the aerosol delivery flow rate below the tracheal flow rate (to minimize CPAP line loss) and (ii) concentrating the aerosol within the first portion of the inhalation waveform. An optimized design was shown to deliver approximately 37–60% of the nominal dose through the system and to the lungs with low intersubject variability (1050–2200 g infants) across two modes of device actuation (automated and manual) with room for further improvement. Ergonomic curvatures and streamlining of the prong geometries were also found to reduce work of breathing and flow resistance compared with a commercial alternative. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Paeoniflorin is a natural pharmaceutical ingredient with a widely biological activity. However, as a hydrophilic drug, the problem of low transdermal rate limits its clinical application. To overcome this shortage, LUVs were used as biocompatible carriers of paeoniflorin in this study. We prepared paeoniflorin-loaded large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with W/O/W structure by microfluidics. We used four kinds of chips to prepare paeoniflorin LUVs and explored the effects of the chip structures on LUVs properties applying both experiments and numerical simulations. The difference of fluid mixing mechanisms was analyzed among four different channels, including straight and curved structures. Then we evaluated the differences in skin permeability among the three groups, paeoniflorin aqueous solution group, drug-loaded liposome group and blank liposome &amp; drug mixture group, using the abdominal skin of male mice. The results showed that the structure of the microfluidic channel was a key factor affecting the flow rate and mixing efficiency. The mixing efficiency further affected the liposome size. The mixing efficiency of curved channel was not better than that of a straight channel due to the low flow rate and long mixing time. By the results of transdermal experiments, LUVs could reduce the transdermal time and increase the total transdermal amount. LUVs effectively improved the transdermal absorption efficiency of paeoniflorin. In conclusion, paeoniflorin LUVs with highly efficient transdermal were successfully prepared by using microfluidics. We explored the underlying fluid dynamics that lead to variations in the preparation with different chip structures. The transdermal effect of the LUVs was verified. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Agricultural waste, such as rice straw, has become increasingly valuable as biocomposites in various industries. For cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors, these biocomposites have improved active substance incorporation and waste reduction, which is pivotal for mitigating environmental impact. This study reports the encapsulation of a protein derivative derived from rice straw within a nanoemulsion for skin care applications, emphasizing stability and efficacy. Protein hydrolysates were produced by extracting proteins in an alkaline medium, followed by precipitation at the isoelectric point. The hydrolysates were enzymatically treated with Alcalase® at 80 °C and pH 10 for 45 min to generate antioxidant-rich formulations. Utilizing Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Deviation (HLD) theory, oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions were formulated by adjusting variables to achieve an HLD near zero. Sunflower oil and surfactants were combined, stirred at 70 °C, and homogenized using a rotor-stator. The final formulation's stability and permeability were evaluated through fluorescence microscopy, particle size analysis, zeta potential measurements, and accelerated stability assays. Nanoemulsion ENE37 showed high stability with 47.25 nm size, PDI 0.21, and excellent dispersion, maintaining integrity without phase separation. Hydrolyzed protein into ENE37 (NE37-HP) improved stability, increasing zeta potential and preventing aggregation while maintaining structure without phase inversion. NE37-HP exhibited shear-thinning behavior and good diffusion capacity, achieving 20.14 μg/cm2.h. The HLD theory and ternary diagrams are valuable methodological tools for formulating stable nanoscale emulsions. Additionally, this dosage form, containing protein hydrolysates derived from rice straw, demonstrated potential for adequate dermal absorption in humans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In vitro methods for quality and equivalence assessment of semi-solid products applied to the skin have increasingly garnered attention because in vivo bioequivalence studies is high cost, complexity, and time-consuming. Regulatory authorities established draft guidelines that outline a modular framework demanding qualitative, quantitative, microstructure and product performance equivalence to support generic products. In line with these guidelines, our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between microstructure and performance attributes in both originator and generic semi-solid products applied to the skin. In this context, reference and three generics of ketoprofen gel were selected as models for semi-solid formulations. Microstructure of all products was assessed regarding pH, specific gravity, drying rate, formulation rheology and potential drug polymorphism. Additionally, performance attributes of products were evaluated using in vitro release testing and in vitro permeation testing. Polymorphism and drying rate data showed no significant difference in microstructure of ketoprofen gels. All tested products exhibited pseudo-plastic flow behavior with thixotropic characteristic. However, differences in pH, specific gravity and viscosity values at low shear stress were observed between reference product and generic products, according to EMA guidance. Although IVRT outcomes did not entirely align with Q3 attributes, IVRT results for reference product versus Generic Product-I and Generic Product-II met the acceptance limits according to FDA guidance, which differs from EMA's assessment. Furthermore, in vitro release rate results were consistent with IVPT data. Consequently, it can be concluded that microstructure of semi-solid products applied to the skin may not consistently correlate with performance attributes due to various alternations influenced by manufacturing process parameters and/or formulation components.

There is a current move away from existing hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-based propellants, specifically the hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-134a and HFA-227ea based pMDI products that are approved for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), towards those that use low global warming potential (LGWP) propellants. Changing the propellant to, for example, the less environmentally-damaging HFA-152a, is a focus for many manufacturers. In this paper, we report an innovative approach to developing new pMDI drug products with a LGWP propellant. Moreover, proof of the hypothesis that products containing the current propellant and those using a LGWP propellant can achieve equivalent performance is reported, by showing comparability of a triple combination pMDI (Trimbow®) formulated using the LGWP HFA-152a propellant compared with HFA-134a. This paper will present the use of in silico mathematical modelling, leveraging on Chiesi proprietary Modulite® principles to predict and validate in vitro performances of the drug product under development. Validation is carried out using realistic aerodynamic particle size distribution (rAPSD), a novel approach that offers a more accurate prediction of aerosol distribution by incorporating variations compared to the standard aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD). Additional in vitro testing validates the prediction of in silico models and confirms good comparability in terms of aerodynamic performance between HFA-152a and HFA-134a, which translates in vivo as evidenced by the preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) in animal models and the formal clinical PK bioequivalence (BE) studies.

    "abstract": "Abstract The application of pH-sensitive polymers has been widely explored in pharmaceutical industry because of their versatile properties. This work aims to delay the release of indomethacin (IND), a commonly used anti-inflammatory drug, using a pH-dependent polymer within orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) and to investigate the effect of the polymer particle size on the ODTs. When developing delayed-release formulations for orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs), it's essential to balance the pellet's matrix properties to maintain integrity and delayed release. Different sizes of Eudragit L100 were used to create IND-containing pellets via extrusion spheronization, which were then embedded into the matrix of ODTs. The particle sizes displayed good elastic properties with low Young's modulus (YM) values, and there was no significant difference between the different sizes (45, 60, 93 µm; p &gt; 0.05). The tensile strength of the pellets was directly proportional to YM ( p &lt; 0.05), providing enough support to maintain their integrity under compression. Pellets made from 63 µm Eudragit L100 had a suitable balance of mechanical and pharmaceutical properties compared to other sizes. 63 µm pellets had an aspect ratio of 1.49 ± 0.26 and 61% yield, while their ODTs showed a fast disintegration time of 14 ± 0.6 s, while modifying the drug release. Furthermore, IND exhibited modified release in acidic media (pH 1.2) and immediate release in buffer media (pH 6.8). Overall, protecting pellet integrity was crucial to delay release in acidic media and enable immediate release in alkaline media. The newly developed formulation will improve compliance and reduce side effects associated with IND and other irritant drugs particularly in elderly populations.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cyclosporine A (CsA) is widely used to treat dry eye disease (DED), and ocular morbidity is on the rise and is a growing concern globally. However, several drug and formulation challenges, such as poor drug solubility, short pre-corneal residence time, and poor patient compliance, have limited the ocular bioavailability of CsA to &lt; 5%. A CsA cyclodextrin-based ternary complex loaded dissolvable nano drug reservoir films were developed to overcome these limitations and efficiently manage DED. Drug-loaded nano-reservoir films were fabricated via lithography using silicone and poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) molds. Different physicochemical characterizations were performed to confirm the formation of stable CsA-cyclodextrin-based ternary complexes. Formation of nanoreservoirs on the films was confirmed using SEM and AFM. Optimized CsA-complex-loaded nano-reservoir films were evaluated for in vitro drug release, ex vivo corneal permeation, and in vivo precorneal retention. Preclinical efficacy studies were performed to assess the efficacy of CsA-complex-loaded nano-reservoirs in an experimental dry-eye mouse model. Physicochemical characterization confirmed the formation of a stable complex and the improved solubility of CsA. In vitro release and ex vivo permeation studies indicated a controlled drug release and improved permeation, respectively. Furthermore, tear volume measurement and corneal damage assessment using slit-lamp imaging suggested decreased dry eye symptoms, significantly increasing tear volume in the drug-loaded nano-reservoir-treated group. Moreover, histopathological studies corroborated the tear volume and slit-lamp imaging results, with reduced inflammation and neovascularization. The poorly water-soluble drug with cyclodextrin complex incorporated nanoreservoir films presents a potential alternative for managing various ocular diseases. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of study was to exploit distinctive features of nasal administration route to boost agomelatine permeation and upgrade its anti-depressant action after being embedded in Brij ® -enriched novasomes (NVs) as non-phospholipid vesicular systems. Different amounts and types of excipients were used to evaluate NVs using definitive screening design (DSD). Optimal NV was incorporated in thermosensitive in-situ gels containing poloxamer 407 (P-407) and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). After evaluation of novasomal in-situ gels (NVGs), optimal NVG was subjected to ex-vivo , in-vivo , and biochemical investigations. Results showed significant increase in entrapment capability (EC%), particle size (P.S), and zeta potential (Z.P) of NVs after increasing free fatty acid, surfactant, and cholesterol amounts. The capability of Brij ® to improve fluidization of lipid bilayers, decrease P.S, and increase Z.P was observed. Lipohilicity, EC%, and Z.P of Brij ® 56-enriched NVs were higher than those containing Brij ® 35. Gradual increase in HPMC concentration and gel/NV ratio led to marked decrease in gelation time and spreadability and increase in gel strength and viscosity values of NVGs. Optimal NVG9 displayed higher permeation profile (538.34 μg/cm 2 ) and drug flux (39.38 μg/cm 2 .h −1 ) through fresh sheep nasal mucosa in comparison to control gel (150.76 μg/cm 2 and 14.44 μg/cm 2 .h −1 , respectively). Rats treated with nasal optimal NVG9 manifested increased sucrose preference (SP) percent (80.73%) and levels of dopamine (50.42 ng/g) and serotonin (44.92 ng/g) with decreased low latency time values (5.86 min). This study confirmed the in-vivo safety and amplification of precognitive and anti-depressant action of agomelatine after intranasal administration. Graphical Abstract",

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of emergency spacers with traditional spacers in delivering salbutamol aerosol from pMDIs.

The study evaluated pMDI alone and with various spacers, including traditional antistatic spacers (Able, Tips-Haler, Aerochamber Plus Flow Vu, Atomizer Chamber) and emergency spacers (Plastic juice cup, MDI PLUS, Lite-Air spacer, DispozABLE spacer, and Paper sheet spacer) at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min with inhalation volumes of 2 L and 4 L, representing children (> 6 years) and adults, respectively. The pMDI alone delivered the highest TED, significantly exceeding all pMDI-spacer combinations at both inhalation volumes (P < 0.001-0.033), except for the Aerochamber Plus Flow Vu at 2 L. The Aerochamber Plus Flow Vu achieved significantly higher TED compared to emergency spacers and the Atomizer Chamber (P < 0.001-0.039) and was non-significantly higher than the Able and Tips-Haler spacers. It also delivered the highest fine particle dose (≤ 5 µg) and exhibited the lowest mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) with significant differences across devices. Traditional spacers, particularly the Aerochamber Plus Flow Vu, demonstrated superior performance in TED and aerodynamic particle size distribution. However, emergency spacers remain viable alternatives in urgent situations due to their acceptable delivery efficiency.",

However, AIs have been limited to low volumes (< 2 mL), partly due to hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan that acts as a barrier to bulk fluid flow in the SC tissue. Recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) is an enzyme that temporarily depolymerizes HA to facilitate the dispersion of SC-administered therapeutics and may enhance the use of AIs capable of delivering high volumes. These studies detail the development and preclinical testing of a novel high-volume AI (HVAI) that successfully delivered 10 mL of a representative macromolecule (immune globulin; Ig) co-administered with rHuPH20 in ≤ 30 s (s) in a miniature pig model. Testing of a surrogate AI informed the development of a novel, clinically-ready prototype HVAI. HVAI injections of Ig co-administered with 2,000 U/mL rHuPH20 improved injection site outcomes (back-leakage, bleb size, swelling, induration) and yielded up to 30% faster injection times compared with injections of Ig alone. In a mock clinical study that replicated clinical settings, the HVAI delivered 10 mL of Ig with 4,000 U/mL rHuPH20 with mean (± standard error of the mean) injection durations of 19.8 s (± 0.5) using a thin-wall 25-gauge (G) needle and 30.0 s (± 1.1) using a standard 25G needle. The data presented here demonstrate the feasibility of the prototype HVAI for rapid, high-volume administration of a concentrated biologic with rHuPH20, and will inform future clinical testing.",

    "abstract": "The reformulation of suspension-based pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI) with low global warming potential (GWP) propellants is challenged by wide-ranging changes to their chemicophysical properties such as vapor pressure, density and latent heat. The effect of low-GWP propellants on spray pattern and plume geometry for suspension pMDIs are not fully understood. There is a lack of data regarding the role of propellant choice and potential interactions with suspended drugs, which may explain performance variations between products and guide development of in-silico models. In this study, high speed imaging was used to measure the plume morphology and optical density of sprays containing HFA134a, HFA152a and HFO1234ze(E) propellants. Propellant-only placebo controls were compared to suspension formulations containing 2 mg/mL salbutamol sulphate. It was found that the presence of suspended particles has a significant effect on plume structure, reducing correlations between propellant thermophysical properties and cone angle, targeting angle, and optical center of mass by 6-7 times. These effects vary depending on propellant type due to variations in flash-evaporation behavior, which is less pronounced in low-GWP propellants compared to HFA134a. HFA152a sprays have a 23% reduction in Jakob number compared to HFA134a; plume width at the mouthpiece exit is commensurately increased by 40%. Equivalent HFO1234ze(E) sprays have less pronounced differences in Jakob number (13% reduced) and plume width (25% increased) compared to equivalent HFA134a sprays. Empirical models and standards which implicitly incorporate the flash-evaporation effects commonly observed in high-GWP HFA propellants may require adjustment to be suitable for use with low-GWP formulations.",

However, its clinical effectiveness is limited by rapid washout, frequent dosing, and poor bioavailability. This study developed a ketotifen fumarate-loaded in situ forming subconjunctival injectable implant (ISFSI) for use in large animal species such as horses and alpacas. ISFSIs were formulated by dispersing ketotifen fumarate in polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) combined with different release retarders (Kolliphor® RH 40, Labrasol®, and Maisine®), then characterized for visual appearance, viscosity, solidification time, and in vitro drug release. The changes in the release medium pH and the solidified ISFSI wet weight were monitored for up to 4 weeks. The selected ISFSI, KFM5, was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and rheological behavior. The injectability of KFM5 was predicted using the power law for five different syringe and needle dimensions. Cytotoxicity was tested using the Alamar Blue assay and Calcein AM/PI staining on a human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE-T). Results showed that all ISFSI formulations were clear yellowish, with drug recoveries exceeding 95%, varying viscosities, and solidified upon contact with the release medium. KFM5 exhibited a triphasic drug release profile with the lowest burst release (4.91 ± 0.55%) and followed Higuchi kinetics. SEM imaging revealed a \"hollow and sponge-like\" structure, while DSC confirmed the crystallinity and thermal transitions of ketotifen fumarate within the solidified implant. Rheological analysis indicated shear-thinning fluid behavior with acceptable injection forces. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed > 90% cell viability, confirming biocompatibility in the ocular tissue.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nasal sprays are extensively researched due to their rapid absorption, high bioavailability, and low side effects. Lipid liquid crystal nanoparticles (LLCNs) are being considered as potential carriers for intranasal delivery. LLCs loaded with cetrorelix (GnRH antagonist) were utilized for intranasal drug delivery to enhance brain targeting while minimizing systemic exposure. A single-phase formulation incorporating HPMC as a mucoadhesive was developed to extend nasal residence time. Following intranasal administration of cetrorelix in rats, its distribution in various brain regions and serum was assessed using LC–MS-MS. In the LLC formulation, the particle diameter, PDI, and Zeta potential were measured as 204.92 ± 0.89 nm, 0.188 ± 0.019, and -21.63 ± 1.72 mV, respectively. A monomodal distribution and low polydispersity index were observed, along with a negative zeta potential. Cetrorelix was released from the LLC in a biphasic profile, with an initial burst release of 30%, followed by a gradual and sustained release phase. The LLCs containing cetrorelix exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared to the LLC base. The nasal administration of cetrorelix via LLCs presents a promising advancement for nose-to-brain drug transport. The pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that the AUC 0-360min for brain tissue analysis, following nasal administration of the single-phase formulation, was 3.104 ng/ml.min. The value was 7.104 ng/ml.min for LLC nasal administration and 6.104 ng/ml.min for subcutaneous injection. The maximum concentration (C max ) values for brain tissue analysis indicated a significant increase with LLC nasal administration (238 ± 6. 2 ng/ml) in comparison to the single-phase formulation (202.5 ± 6.3 ng/ml) and subcutaneous injection (218.2 ± 3. 1 ng/ml). In serum analysis, the C max values were significantly elevated, with subcutaneous injection achieving (4983.3 ± 2.5 ng/ml), followed by LLC nasal administration at (93.1 ± 6.2 ng/ml), and the single-phase formulation at (43.7 ± 2.2 ng/ml). This innovative method aims to target the brain directly, eliminating the need for needles, and reducing adverse effects, hence offering new hope for brain-targeted drug delivery. This study introduces, for the first time, a cetrorelix-loaded lipid liquid crystal (LLC) nanoparticle formulation for intranasal nose-to-brain delivery. The LLC system achieved enhanced brain targeting efficiency while reducing systemic exposure compared to conventional subcutaneous injections and simple nasal formulations, representing a promising advancement in GnRH drug delivery strategies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Wound management in diabetic patients holds significant importance in both clinical and social contexts due to the delayed and compromised healing that these individuals experience. Diabetic wounds exhibit slow and incomplete healing, increasing patients’ susceptibility to infections. Managing wounds in diabetic patients, particularly when complicated by diabetic foot infection or diabetic foot ulcer, becomes challenging. The ideal drug delivery systems for treating diabetic wounds should integrate diverse drugs and/or biological factors, offering advantages such as sustained and localized release of therapeutic compounds and enhanced wound healing outcomes. Several treatment modalities are under investigation for managing diabetic wounds, including advanced local drug delivery systems such as topical 3D scaffolds, particulate systems, and 3D scaffolds combined with particulate systems, in addition to gas therapy and skin grafts as advanced therapies. This review comprehensively discusses the state of the art for each treatment modality for diabetic wound healing associated with bioactive molecules. It also summarizes the forms of topically applied 3D scaffolds, including films, hydrogels, sponges, nanofibers, wafers, microneedles, and foams. The review differentiates their advantages and disadvantages as topical therapies while discussing various scaffold types that integrate therapeutic agents, which include polymeric, inorganic, composite, and biological scaffolds. With the emphasis on the newly investigated locally administered drug delivery systems for the management of diabetic wounds, the review also focuses on the challenges and the future perspectives for the production of such systems with the use of various drugs and biomaterials using innovative technologies such as 3D printing for effective healing of wounds.

    "abstract": "Abstract Wound infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria present a substantial challenge in healthcare. Nanofibers, particularly when infused with natural extracts, are emerging as promising platforms for antimicrobial applications. This study investigates the potential of Anastatica hierochuntica extract-loaded electrospun nanofibers prepared with thermoplastic polyurethane for combating infections and promoting wound healing. Electrospinning was utilized to prepare nanofibers infused with Anastatica hierochuntica extract, resulting in uniform rod-shaped structures confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The hydrophilicity of the nanofibers was assessed through water contact angle (WCA) measurements and swelling tests. Mechanical properties, including strain and stress were evaluated to determine suitability for drug delivery. The formulation with optimal properties, designated as NF20, underwent further investigation. Drug release profiles were analyzed over 72 h, and antimicrobial efficacy was tested against various pathogens, with comparisons made to Silymarin as a standard. A biofilm study evaluated the anti-virulence activity, while wound healing assays assessed the optimized extract loaded nanofibers potential in fostering tissue repair. The extract-loaded nanofibers exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity, with a WCA of 43.1 ± 0.6° and swelling of 216.67 ± 2.36% after 1 h. NF20 demonstrated superior mechanical properties, with strain and stress values of 67.6% and 0.0486 N/mm 2 , respectively. The sustained release profile indicated 73.40 ± 1.31% release after 72 h. Antimicrobial tests revealed significant reductions in minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, and minimum fungicidal concentration against key pathogens. The biofilm study confirmed extract loaded nanofiber’s efficacy in inhibiting biofilm formation and disrupting established biofilms. These findings underscore the potential of the extract-loaded nanofiber composed of thermoplastic polyurethane as innovative wound dressings that enhance antimicrobial properties, promote accelerated healing and support tissue regeneration.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to catalogue in a systematic way the available information about factors that may influence the outcome and variability of cascade impactor (CI) measurements of pharmaceutical aerosols for inhalation, such as those obtained from metered dose inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs) or products for nebulization; and to suggest ways to minimize the influence of such factors. To accomplish this task, the authors constructed a cause-and-effect Ishikawa diagram for a CI measurement and considered the influence of each root cause based on industry experience and thorough literature review. The results illustrate the intricate network of underlying causes of CI variability, with the potential for several multi-way statistical interactions. It was also found that significantly more quantitative information exists about impactor-related causes than about operator-derived influences, the contribution of drug assay methodology and product-related causes, suggesting a need for further research in those areas. The understanding and awareness of all these factors should aid in the development of optimized CI methods and appropriate quality control measures for aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) of pharmaceutical aerosols, in line with the current regulatory initiatives involving quality-by-design (QbD).",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work presents a new user-friendly lyophilization simulation and process optimization tool, freely available under the name LyoPRONTO. This tool comprises freezing and primary drying calculators, a design-space generator, and a primary drying optimizer. The freezing calculator performs 0D lumped capacitance modeling to predict the product temperature variation with time which shows reasonably good agreement with experimental measurements. The primary drying calculator performs 1D heat and mass transfer analysis in a vial and predicts the drying time with an average deviation of 3% from experiments. The calculator is also extended to generate a design space over a range of chamber pressures and shelf temperatures to predict the most optimal setpoints for operation. This optimal setpoint varies with time due to the continuously varying product resistance and is taken into account by the optimizer which provides varying chamber pressure and shelf temperature profiles as a function of time to minimize the primary drying time and thereby, the operational cost. The optimization results in 62% faster primary drying for 5% mannitol and 50% faster primary drying for 5% sucrose solutions when compared with typical cycle conditions. This optimization paves the way for the design of the next generation of lyophilizers which when coupled with accurate sensor networks and control systems can result in self-driving freeze dryers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a rational workflow for developing enabling formulations, such as amorphous solid dispersions, via hot-melt extrusion in less than a year. First, our approach to an integrated product and process development framework is described, including state-of-the-art theoretical concepts, modeling, and experimental characterization described in the literature and developed by us. Next, lab-scale extruder setups are designed (processing conditions and screw design) based on a rational, model-based framework that takes into account the thermal load required, the mixing capabilities, and the thermo-mechanical degradation. The predicted optimal process setup can be validated quickly in the pilot plant. Lastly, a transfer of the process to any GMP-certified manufacturing site can be performed in silico for any extruder based on our validated computational framework. In summary, the proposed workflow massively reduces the risk in product and process development and shortens the drug-to-market time for enabling formulations.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to formulate atorvastatin niosome (Atrosome) through an ultrasonic technique and to determine its contribution to the extent of wound healing in an animal model. The optimized Atrosome formulation (Atrosome-2) was stable at 4 °C for 3 months. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ATR-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis revealed that atorvastatin (ATR) was well encapsulated within the niosomes either in a stabilized amorphous form or a molecularly dispersed state. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM) confirmed the spherical nature of the Atrosomes. The optimized formulation showed polydispersity index, particle size, drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%), and zeta potential of 0.457 ± 0.05, 196.33 ± 6.45 nm, 86.15 ± 0.58 %, and - 20.73 ± 0.98 mV, respectively. ATR release from the Atrosome gel followed the first-order kinetic model and showed no cytotoxicity in the in vitro cytotoxicity test. Cell viability (human foreskin fibroblast cell line) was nearly 99%. An excision wound model was also applied in male Wistar rats to examine the in vivo efficacy of the optimized formulation, followed by investigating malondialdehyde (MDA, an end-product of lipid peroxidation), superoxide dismutase (SOD, an endogenous antioxidant), hydroxyproline levels, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in skin tissue samples. MDA significantly decreased in the Atrosome gel group after 21 days, while GPx, SOD, and hydroxyproline levels demonstrated an increase. According to histological results, rats receiving Atrosomes were treated effectively faster when compared to the other formulation used.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The current study is regarding the development and characterization of Darifenacin-loaded self-assembled liquid crystal cubic nanoparticles (LCCN). An anhydrous approach was used for the preparation of these cubic nanoparticles using a hydrotropic agent (propylene glycol), with minimal energy input. Upon dispersion in aqueous medium, the system was successfully transformed to cubosomal nanoparticles counterpart as depicted by transmission electron micrographs. A Box-Behnken design was used to optimize formulation variables, namely A: amount of GMO, B: amount of Pluronic F127, C: amount of PG, and D: amount of HPMC. The design has generated 29 formulae which were tested regarding drug content uniformity, dispersibility in water, particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, and in vitro release behavior. The numerical optimization algorithms have generated an optimized formula with high desirability ≈ 1. The optimized formula displayed small particle size, good homogeneity, and zeta potential along with controlled in vitro release profile and ex vivo permeation through rabbit intestine. Thus, self-assembled LCCN might offer an alternative anhydrous approach for the preparation of cubosomal nanoparticles with controlled release profile for a possibly better control of overactive bladder syndrome which tremendously affect the overall life quality.

    "abstract": "Abstract Wound healing is a complex biological process with four main phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Current treatments such as cotton and gauze may delay the wound healing process which gives a demand for more innovative treatments. Nanofibers are nanoparticles that resemble the extracellular matrix of the skin and have a large specific surface area, high porosity, good mechanical properties, controllable morphology, and size. Nanofibers are generated by electrospinning method that utilizes high electric force. Electrospinning device composed of high voltage power source, syringe that contains polymer solution, needle, and collector to collect nanofibers. Many polymers can be used in nanofiber that can be from natural or from synthetic origin. As such, electrospun nanofibers are potential scaffolds for wound healing applications. This review discusses the advanced electrospun nanofiber morphologies used in wound healing that is prepared by modified electrospinning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Palatability and patient acceptability are critical attributes of dispersible tablet formulation. Co-processed excipients could provide improved organoleptic profile due to rational choice of excipients and manufacturing techniques. The aim of this study was to identify the most suitable co-processed excipient to use within directly compressible dispersible tablet formulations. Nine excipients, selected based on successful manufacturability, were investigated in a randomised, preference and acceptability testing in 24 healthy adult volunteers. Excipients were classified in order of preference as follows (from most preferred): SmartEx QD100 > F-Melt Type C > F-Melt Type M > MicroceLac > Ludiflash > CombiLac > Pharmaburst 500 > Avicel HFE-102 > Avicel PH-102. Broad differences were identified in terms of acceptability, with SmartEx QD100 being 'very acceptable', F-Melt Type C, F-Melt Type M and MicroceLac being 'acceptable', Ludiflash, CombiLac and Pharmaburst 500 being 'neutral' and Avicel products being 'very unacceptable' based on ratings using five-point hedonic scales. Organoleptic differences were ascribed to different composition and physical properties of excipients, resulting in dissimilar taste and mouth-feel. Excipients with particle size in water larger than 200–250 μm were considered poorly acceptable, which supports the use of this value as a threshold for maximum particle size of dispersible formulation. The most promising co-processed excipients for directly compressible dispersible tablets were successfully identified.",

    "abstract": "Hydrophilic matrix tablets are commonly used for extended release dosage forms. For low aqueous-solubility drugs, there may be challenges in modulation of release profiles and achieving consistent release in physiological conditions. To evaluate potential formulation strategies, matrix tablets of a low-soluble drug, hydrochlorothiazide, were developed using hypromellose and two fillers of different solubility, lactose (soluble) or partially pregelatinized maize starch (partially soluble). Additionally, application of an insoluble barrier membrane, aqueous ethylcellulose coating system, and a hydrophilic pore former onto matrix tablets was evaluated. Drug release from uncoated matrix tablets was variable at different agitation rates. Evaluation of tablets in bio-relevant media using physiologically relevant residence time indicated variable and higher initial release rate for uncoated matrices containing lactose but more robust behavior for tablets containing partially pregelatinized starch. Such in vitro behavior may lead to erratic drug release in vivo, when comparing fed versus fasted conditions. Dissolution profiles from barrier membrane-coated tablets showed initial delay, followed by zero-order release kinetics, with reduction or elimination of variability compared to uncoated matrices. Such reduced variability may mitigate mechanical effects of post-prandial stomach. Effects of coating weight gain and inclusion levels of pore former were evaluated and found to be critical in achieving robust and stable release profiles.",

    "abstract": "Developing a pediatric oral formulation with an age-appropriate dosage form and taste masking of naturally bitter active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are key challenges for formulation scientists. Several techniques are used for taste masking of bitter APIs to improve formulation palatability; however, not all the techniques are applicable to pediatric dosage forms because of the limitations on the kind and concentration of the excipients that can be used. Hot-melt extrusion (HME) technology is used successfully for taste masking of bitter APIs and overcomes some of the limitations of the existing taste-masking techniques. Likewise, analytical taste assessment is an important quality control parameter evaluated by several in vivo and in vitro methods, such as the human taste panel, electrophysiological methods, electronic sensor, and animal preference tests to aid in selecting a taste-masked formulation. However, the most appropriate in vivo method to assess the taste-masking efficacy of pediatric formulations remains unknown because it is not known to what extent the human taste panel/electronic tongue can predict the palatability in the pediatric patients. The purpose of this study was to develop taste-masked caffeine citrate extrudates via HME and to demonstrate the wide applicability of a single bottle-test rat model to record and compare the volume consumed of the taste-masked solutions to that of the pure API. Thus, this rat model can be considered as a low-cost alternative taste-assessment method to the most commonly used expensive human taste panel/electronic tongue method for pediatric formulations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the dissolution properties of poorly soluble drugs from their pure form and their amorphous formulation under physiological relevant conditions for oral administration based on surface dissolution ultraviolet (UV) imaging. Dissolution of two poorly soluble drugs (cefuroxime axetil and itraconazole) and their amorphous formulations (Zinnat® and Sporanox®) was studied with the Sirius Surface Dissolution Imager (SDI). Media simulating the fasted state conditions (compendial and biorelevant) with sequential media/flow rate change were used. The dissolution mechanism of cefuroxime axetil in simulated gastric fluid (SGF), fasted state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) is predominantly swelling as opposed to the convective flow in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF-V1), attributed to the effect of mixed micelles. For the itraconazole compact in biorelevant media, a clear upward diffusion of the dissolved itraconazole into the bulk buffer solution is observed. Dissolution of itraconazole from the Sporanox® compact is affected by the polyethylene glycol (PEG) gelling layer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) matrix, and a steady diffusional dissolution pattern is revealed. A visual representation and a quantitative assessment of dissolution properties of poorly soluble compounds and their amorphous formulation can be obtained with the use of surface dissolution imaging under in vivo relevant conditions.",

    "abstract": "Innovative strategies for periodontal regeneration have been the focus of research clusters across the globe for decades. In order to overcome the drawbacks of currently available options, investigators have suggested a novel concept of functionally graded membrane (FGM) templates with different structural and morphological gradients. Chitosan (CH) has been used in the past for similar purpose. However, the composite formulation of composite and tetracycline when cross-linked with glutaraldehyde have received little attention. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate the drug loading and release characteristics of novel freeze gelated chitosan templates at different percentages of glutaraldehyde. These were cross-linked with 0.1 and 1% glutaraldehyde and loaded with doxycycline hyclate. The electron micrographs depicted porous morphology of neat templates. After cross-linking, these templates showed compressed ultrastructures. Computerized tomography analysis showed that the templates had 88 to 92% porosity with average pore diameter decreased from 78 to 44.9 μm with increasing concentration. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed alterations in the glycosidic segment of chitosan fingerprint region which after drug loading showed a dominant doxycycline spectral composite profile. Interestingly, swelling profile was not affected by cross-linking either at 0.1 and 1% glutaraldehyde and template showed a swelling ratio of 80%, which gained equilibrium after 15 min. The drug release pattern also showed a 40 μg/mL of release after 24 h. These doxycycline-loaded templates show their tendency to be used in a functionally graded membrane facing the defect site.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to improve the functionality of Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) polyphenols by encapsulation in an optimized proliposome formulation. A 23 Box-Wilson central composite design (CCD) was employed to determine lone and interaction effects of composition variables on moisture content (Xp); water activity (Aw); concentration and retention of rosemary polyphenols-rosmarinic acid (ROA), carnosol (CAR), and carnosic acid (CNA); and recovery of spray-dried proliposomes (SDP). Processing conditions which generate proliposomes with optimum physicochemical properties were determined by multi-response analysis (desirability approach). Antioxidant and antifungal activities were evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•) sequestering and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)/minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) assays, respectively. SDP exhibited high polyphenol retention, ranging from 62.0 to 100.0% w/w, showing dependence on composition variables and polyphenol lipophilicity. SDP recovery ranged from 20.1 to 45.8%, with Xp and Aw of 1.7 ± 0.14-2.5 ± 0.23% w/w and 0.30 ± 0.004-0.47 ± 0.003, respectively, evidencing product with good chemical and microbiological stability. Optimum liposomal composition was determined, namely, lipid concentration (4.26% w/w), lyophilized extract (LE) concentration (4.48% w/w), and drying aid:(lipid+extract) ratio (7.55% w/w) on wet basis. Relative errors between experimental and predicted values for SDP properties showed concurrence for all responses except CAR retention, being 22% lower. SDP showed high antioxidant activity with IC50 of 9.2 ± 0.2 μg/mL, superior to results obtained for LE (10.8 μg/mL) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a synthetic antioxidant (12.5 μg/mL). MIC and MFC against Candida albicans (ATCC1023) were 312.5 μg/mL and 1250 μg/mL, respectively, a moderate antimicrobial activity for phytochemical-based products. SDP is shown as a veritable tool to encapsulate hydrophilic and lipophilic rosemary polyphenols generating a product with optimal physicochemical and biological properties.",

Part I focuses on the process design and is described in the current paper, while part II is devoted to process qualification and continued process verification. The intent of these articles is to provide readers with recent updates on lyophilization validation in the light of community-based combined opinion on the process and reflect the industrial prospective. In this paper, the design space approach for process design is described in details, and examples from practice are provided. The approach shows the relationship between the process inputs; it is based on first principles and gives a thorough scientific understanding of process and product. The lyophilization process modeling and scale-up are also presented showing the impact of facility, equipment, and vial heat transfer coefficient. The case studies demonstrating the effect of batch sizes, fill volume, and dose strength to show the importance of modeling as well as the effect of controlled nucleation on product resistance are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the potential use of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) for quantitative determination of the drug amount in inkjet-printed dosage forms. We chose metformin hydrochloride as a model active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and printed it onto gelatin films using a piezoelectric inkjet printing system. An industry-ready NIR-HSI sensor combined with a motorized movable linear stage was applied for spectral acquisition. Initial API-substrate screening revealed best printing results for gelatin films with TiO2 filling. For calibration of the NIR-HSI system, escalating drug doses were printed on the substrate. After spectral pre-treatments, including standard normal variate (SNV) and Savitzky-Golay filtering for noise reduction and enhancement of spectral features, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression were applied to create predictive models for the quantification of independent printed metformin hydrochloride samples. It could be shown that the concentration distribution maps provided by the developed HSI models were capable of clustering and predicting the drug dose in the formulations. HSI model prediction showed significant better correlation to the reference (HPLC) compared to on-board monitoring of dispensed volume of the printer. Overall, the results emphasize the capability of NIR-HSI as a fast and non-destructive method for the quantification and quality control of the deposited API in drug-printing applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a condition caused by the infection of a retrovirus namely, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Currently, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of anti-viral drugs belonging to different classes is considered to be effective in the management of HIV. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (PI), is one of the most important components of the HAART regimen. Because of its lower bioavailability and severe side effects, presently, ritonavir is not being used as a PI. However, this drug is being used as a pharmacokinetic boosting agent for other PIs such as lopinavir and in lower doses. The current study aimed to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) encapsulating ritonavir to reduce its side effects and enhance oral bioavailability. Ritonavir-loaded NLCs were developed using a combination of two different solid lipids and liquid lipids. Alpha-tocopherol, a well-known anti-oxidant, was used as an excipient (liquid lipid) in the development of NLCs which were prepared using a simple hot-emulsion and ultrasonication method. Drug-excipient studies were performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). QbD approach was followed for the screening and optimization of different variables. The developed NLCs were characterized for their particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), and entrapment efficiency (EE). Furthermore, NLCs were studied for their in vitro drug release profile, and finally, pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. The optimized NLC size was in the range of 273.9 to 458.7 nm, PDI of 0.314 to 0.480, ZP of −52.2 to − 40.9 mV, and EE in the range of 47.37 to 74.51%. From in vitro drug release, it was found that the release of drug in acidic medium was higher than phosphate buffer pH 6.8. Finally, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies revealed a 7-fold enhancement in the area under the curve (AUC) and more than 10-fold higher C max with the optimized formulation in comparison to pure drug suspension.",

    "abstract": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are used extensively to achieve site-specific drug delivery with improved bioavailability and reduced toxicity. This work focused on a new approach to provide site-specific stimuli-responsive delivery of SLNs loaded within thermo-sonic nano-organogel (TNO) variants to deliver the model chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU in treating cervical cancer. Pharmaceutically stable nanospherical SLNs comprising poly-L-lactic acid (PLA), palmitic acid (PA), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were prepared and incorporated into TNO variants augmented by external thermal and ultrasound stimuli for release of 5-FU in the cervix. Results revealed that rate-modulated 5-FU release was achieved from SLNs (particle size =450.9 nm; PDI =0.541; zeta potential =-23.2 mV; %DL =33%) within an organogel upon exposure to either a single (thermo-) and/or both (thermo-sonic) stimuli. 5FU was released from all TNO variants with an initial burst on day 1 followed by sustained release over 14 days. TNO 1 provided desirable release over 15 days (44.29% vs. 67.13% under single (T) or combined (TU) stimuli, respectively). Release rates were primarily influenced by the SLN:TO ratio in tandem with biodegradation and hydrodynamic influx. Biodegradation by day 7 revealed that variant TNO 1 (1:5) released 5FU (46.8%) analogous to its initial mass than the other TNO variants (i.e., ratios of 2:5 and 3:5). FT-IR spectra revealed assimilation of the system components and corroborative with the DSC and XRD analysis (i.e., in ratios of PA:PLA 1:1 and 2:1). In conclusion, the TNO variants produced may be used as a potential stimuli-responsive platform for the site-specific delivery of chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU to treat cervical cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Freezing of biological drug substance (DS) is a critical unit operation that may impact product quality, potentially leading to protein aggregation and sub-visible particle formation. Cryo-concentration has been identified as a critical parameter to impact protein stability during freezing and should therefore be minimized. The macroscopic cryo-concentration, in the following only referred to as cryo-concentration, is majorly influenced by the freezing rate, which is in turn impacted by product independent process parameters such as the DS container, its size and fill level, and the freezing equipment. (At-scale) process characterization studies are crucial to understand and optimize freezing processes. However, evaluating cryo-concentration requires sampling of the frozen bulk, which is typically performed by cutting the ice block into pieces for subsequent analysis. Also, the large amount of product requirement for these studies is a major limitation. In this study, we report the development of a simple methodology for experimental characterization of frozen DS in bottles at relevant scale using a surrogate solution. The novel ice core sampling technique identifies the axial ice core in the center to be indicative for cryo-concentration, which was measured by osmolality, and concentrations of histidine and polysorbate 80 (PS80), whereas osmolality revealed to be a sensitive read-out. Finally, we exemplify the suitability of the method to study cryo-concentration in DS bottles by comparing cryo-concentrations from different freezing protocols (-80°C vs -40°C). Prolonged stress times during freezing correlated to a higher extent of cryo-concentration quantified by osmolality in the axial center of a 2 L DS bottle. Graphical Abstract",

Here, we have taken advantage of the unique characteristics that cubosomes have to provide as a drug delivery system. These characteristics include a large surface area, thermal stability, and the capacity to encapsulate molecules that are hydrophobic, amphiphilic, and hydrophilic. The cubosomal formulation was optimized by building a central composite design. The optimum dispersion exhibited a particle size of 88.3 nm, a zeta potential of -43, a polydispersity index of 0.358, and drug entrapment of 95.6%. It was composed of 15% w/w oleic acid and 5% w/w pluronic F127. The optimized cubosome dispersion was incorporated into a sponge formulation. The optimized cubosome sponge achieved a higher drug release compared with the cubosome dispersion. The SEM micrograph of the selected sponge showed that it has an interwoven irregular fibrous lamellar structure with low density and high porosity. The in-vivo data revealed that topical application of the β-sitosterol cubosomal sponge showed significant higher wound closure percentage relative to the β-sitosterol product (Mebo)®.

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim was to employ site-dependent absorption of mirabegron ( MB ) as a guide for fabrication of oral disintegrating controlled release tablet (ODCRT) which undergoes instantaneous release of loading fraction followed by delayed release of the rest of MB. The goal was to release MB in a manner consistent with the chronobiology of overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome. In situ rabbit intestinal permeability of MB was adopted to assess absorption sites. MB was subjected to dry co-grinding with citric acid to develop the fast-dissolving fraction in the mouth. Delayed release fraction was formulated by ethanol-assisted co-processing with increasing proportions of Eudragit polymer (S100) as pH responsive polymer. The developed dry mixtures underwent thermal (DSC) and physical (X-ray diffraction) characterization, in addition to in vitro release behavior. Optimized fast dissolving and delayed release formulations were mixed with tablet excipient before compression in ODCRT which was assessed for release profile using continuous pH variation. MB underwent preferential permeation through ileum and colon. Co-grinding with citric acid provided co-amorphous powder with fast dissolution. Co-amorphization of MB with Eudragit S100 (1:5) showed pH-dependent release to release most of the dose at pH 7.4. The developed ODCRT released 43.5% of MB in the buccal environment and retained MB at acidic pH to start release at pH 7.4. The study successfully fabricated ODCRT guided by site-dependent absorption. The ODCRT instantaneously released loading fraction to support the patient after administration with delayed fraction to sustain the effect. Graphical Abstract",

Thus, current research aims to examine the effect of a bioenhancer (naringin), on oral pharmacokinetics of palbociclib and ribociclib. Naringin's affinity for CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein was studied using molecular docking; its impact on palbociclib/ribociclib CYP3A metabolism and P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux was examined using in vitro preclinical models; and its oral pharmacokinetics in rats were assessed following oral administration of palbociclib/ribociclib in presence of naringin (50 and 100 mg/kg). Naringin binds optimally to both proteins with the highest net binding energy of - 1477.23 and - 1607.47 kcal/mol, respectively. The microsomal intrinsic clearance of palbociclib and ribociclib was noticeably reduced by naringin (5-100 µM), by 3.0 and 2.46-folds, respectively. Similarly, naringin had considerable impact on the intestinal transport and efflux of both drugs. The pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg naringin increased significantly (p < 0.05) the oral exposure of palbociclib (2.0-fold) and ribociclib (1.95-fold). Naringin's concurrent administration of palbociclib and ribociclib increased their oral bioavailability due to its dual inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein; thus, concurrent naringin administration may represent an innovative strategy for enhancing bioavailability of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Since plasmid DNA (pDNA) is unstable in solution, lyophilisation can be used to increase product shelf life. To prevent stress on pDNA molecules during lyophilisation, cryo- and lyoprotectants have to be added to the formulation. This study assessed the effect of disaccharides on naked pDNA stability after lyophilisation using accelerated stability studies. Naked pDNA was lyophilised with sucrose, trehalose, maltose or lactose in an excipient/DNA w/w ratio of 20. To one part of the vials extra residual moisture was introduced by placing the vials half opened in a 25°C/60% RH climate chamber, before placing all vials in climate chambers (25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH) for stability studies. An ex vivo human skin model was used to assess the effect of disaccharides on transfection efficiency. Lyophilisation resulted in amorphous cakes for all disaccharides with a residual water content of 0.8% w/w. Storage at 40°C/75% RH resulted in decreasing supercoiled (SC) purity levels (sucrose and trehalose maintained approximately 80% SC purity), but not in physical collapse. The addition of residual moisture (values between 7.5% and 10% w/w) resulted in rapid collapse except for trehalose and decreasing SC purity for all formulations. In a separate experiment disaccharide formulation solutions show a slight but significant reduction (<3% with sucrose and maltose) in transfection efficiency when compared to pDNA dissolved in water. We demonstrate that disaccharides, like sucrose and trehalose, are effective lyoprotectants for naked pDNA.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the local effect of 10% doxycycline and 1% alendronate combined with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) on bone repair. Thirty rats were divided into three groups, as follows: control group (CG), drug group (DG), and vehicle-PLGA group (VG). Bone defect was created in the right femur and filled with the following: blood clot (CG); PLGA gel, 10% doxycycline and 1% alendronate (DG); or vehicle-PLGA (VG). The animals were euthanized 7 or 15 days after surgery. Bone density, bone matrix and number of osteoclasts were quantified. At 7 days, the findings showed increased density in DG (177.75 ± 76.5) compared with CG (80.37 ± 27.4), but no difference compared with VG (147.1 ± 41.5); no statistical difference in bone neoformation CG (25.6 ± 4.8), VG (27.8 ± 4), and DG (18.9 ± 7.8); and decrease osteoclasts in DG (4.6 ± 1.9) compared with CG (26.7 ± 7.4) and VG (17.3 ± 2.7). At 15 days, DG (405.1 ± 63.1) presented higher density than CG (213.2 ± 60.9) and VG (283.4 ± 85.8); there was a significant increase in percentage of bone neoformation in DG (31.5 ± 4.2) compared with CG (23 ± 4), but no difference compared with VG (25.1 ± 2.9). There was a decreased number of osteoclasts in DG (20.7 ± 4.7) and VG (29.5 ± 5.4) compared with CG (40 ± 9.4). The results suggest that the association of 10% doxycycline and 1% alendronate with PLGA-accelerated bone repair.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, imaging has been introduced as a supplementary method to the dissolution tests, but a direct relationship of dissolution and imaging data has been almost completely overlooked. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of relating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dissolution data to elucidate dissolution profile features (i.e., kinetics, kinetics changes, and variability). Commercial, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose-based quetiapine fumarate controlled-release matrix tablets were studied using the following two methods: (i) MRI inside the USP4 apparatus with subsequent machine learning-based image segmentation and (ii) dissolution testing with piecewise dissolution modeling. Obtained data were analyzed together using statistical data processing methods, including multiple linear regression. As a result, in this case, zeroth order release was found to be a consequence of internal structure evolution (interplay between region's areas-e.g., linear relationship between interface and core), which eventually resulted in core disappearance. Dry core disappearance had an impact on (i) changes in dissolution kinetics (from zeroth order to nonlinear) and (ii) an increase in variability of drug dissolution results. It can be concluded that it is feasible to parameterize changes in micro/meso morphology of hydrated, controlled release, swellable matrices using MRI to establish a causal relationship between the changes in morphology and drug dissolution. Presented results open new perspectives in practical application of combined MRI/dissolution to controlled-release drug products.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report an inorganic hexagonally ordered mesoporous fibre-like carrier made of silica as an effective drug delivery system with mineralisation potential. Fibre-like SBA-15 has been modified by employing a simple surface activation (rehydroxylation) procedure. The surface-rehydroxylated fibre-like SBA-15 (SBA-15-R) was used to investigate the possible mechanism of hydroxyapatite (HA) nucleation and deposition onto silica's surface after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF). Amorphous calcium phosphate, Ca-deficient HA and bone-like HA deposits were observed on SBA-15-R surface consecutively after 7, 14 and 21 days of immersion in SBF. Accordingly, our low-angle XRD, STEM and N2 adsorption/desorption results indicated that deposited ions were mostly located at the silica's surface and could modify the size of the mesopores. The SBA-15-R was studied in vitro as the potential bioactive drug delivery system using doxorubicin (DOX) as a model water-soluble and anticancer drug. The adsorbed DOX molecules were mostly located at the pore walls and pore openings, likely together with the silanol groups. The DOX release was diffusion-controlled and relatively slower in SBF (pH = 7.4) than in phosphate-buffered solution (pH = 5.0), most probably due to both the stronger electrostatic interactions occurring between the DOX and the SBA-15-R and the simultaneous deposition of calcium and phosphates ions from SBF.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Suspension of microparticles in an easy-to-swallow liquid is one approach to develop sustained-release formulations for children and patients with swallowing difficulties. However, to date production of sustained-release microparticles at the industrial scale has proven to be challenging. The aim of this investigation was to develop an innovative concept in coating sustained-release microparticles using industrial scalable Wurster fluidised bed to produce oral liquid suspensions. Microcrystalline cellulose cores (particle size &lt;150 μm) were coated with Eudragit® NM 30 D and Eudragit® RS/RL 30 D aqueous dispersions using a fluidised bed coater. A novel approach of periodic addition of a small quantity (0.1% w /w) of dry powder glidant, magnesium stearate, to the coating chamber via an external port was applied throughout the coating process. This method significantly increased coating production yield from less than 50% to up to 99% compared to conventional coating process without the dry powder glidant. Powder rheology tests showed that dry powder glidants increased the tapped density and decreased the cohesive index of coated microparticles. Reproducible microencapsulation of a highly water-soluble drug, metoprolol succinate, was achieved, yielding coated microparticles less than 200 μm in size with 20-h sustained drug release, suitable for use in liquid suspensions. The robust, scalable technology presented in this study offers an important solution to the long-standing challenges of formulating sustained-release dosage forms suitable for children and older people with swallowing difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Ziyuglycoside I (ZgI), a major effective ingredient of Sanguisorba officinalis L, has shown good activity in increasing leukocyte of myelosuppression mice. However, oral ZgI therapy has been deterred by poor bioavailability because of its low aqueous solubility and permeability. Our study was to develop ZgI-loaded self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) and evaluate its intestinal absorption, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity for increasing leukocyte. The formulation was designed and optimized by measuring the equilibrium solubility of ZgI in different vehicles and the pseudoternary phase diagram. Further, morphology, particle size, stability, in vitro release, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP), in vivo activity, and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) of ZgI-SMEDDS were charactered or studied. Optimized formulations for in vitro dissolution were Obleique CC497, Tween-20, and Transcutol HP with a proportion of 0.25/0.45/0.30 via D-optimal mixture design. Results showed that the solubility of ZgI was enhanced up to 23.93 mg/g and its average particle size was 207.92 ± 2.13 nm. The release of ZgI had been greatly improved by the SMEDDS. In SPIP, the intestinal absorption of SMEDDS was much better than plain ZgI. In PK, we found the oral bioavailability of ZgI-SMEDDS was 6.94-fold higher absolute bioavailability (21.94 ± 4.67) % than ZgI (3.16 ± 0.89) %. The most important was that the mice WBC of ZgI-SMEDDS group was significantly higher than that of the ZgI group. Our study suggested that SMEDDS could increase the solubility of ZgI, which was beneficial to improve oral bioavailability and enhance biological activity.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigates concomitant processes of solid-state disordering and oxidation of simvastatin during milling. The separate dry ball milling of crystalline and amorphous powders of simvastatin were conducted at ambient temperature for 10 and 60 min each. The relative crystallinity was determined using X-ray scattering and oxidative degradation was analyzed using liquid chromatography. The physical and chemical transformations in the milled powder were evaluated using modulated differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The disordering during milling of the crystalline powder was found to progressively decrease the crystallinity. For the amorphous starting material, milling for 10 min induced a large extent of recrystallization, while milling for 60 min largely re-amorphized the powder. This solid-state disordering and/or ordering were accompanied by progressive air oxidation during milling. The infrared spectroscopic analysis revealed the molecular manifestations associated with the physicochemical transformations in the disordered solid states. The melting point of simvastatin depressed systematically with the increase in the degree of disorder as well as the degradation. The in situ cooling in DSC of milled samples from their molten state led to the formation of the co-amorphous phase between the drug and degradation products, which showed a consistent increase in glass transition temperature with the increase in the content of degradation products. The study overall demonstrates the solid-state re-ordering and disordering of crystalline and amorphous simvastatin accompanied by chemical degradation as the consequence of the mechano-activation.",

    "abstract": "Intravitreal (IVT) administration of therapeutics is the standard of care for treatment of back-of-eye disorders. Although a common procedure performed by retinal specialists, IVT administration is associated with unique challenges related to drug product, device and the procedure, which may result in adverse events. Container closure configuration plays a crucial role in maintaining product stability, safety, and efficacy for the intended shelf-life. Careful design of primary container configuration is also important to accurately deliver small volumes (10-100 μL). Over- or under-dosing may lead to undesired adverse events or lack of efficacy resulting in unpredictable and variable clinical responses. IVT drug products have been traditionally presented in glass vials. However, pre-filled syringes offer a more convenient administration option by reducing the number of steps required for dose preparation there by potentially reducing the time demand on the healthcare providers. In addition to primary container selection, product development studies should focus on, among other things, primary container component characterization, material compatibility with the formulation, formulation stability, fill volume determination, extractables/leachables, and terminal sterilization. Ancillary components such as disposable syringes and needles must be carefully selected, and a detailed administration procedure that includes dosing instructions is required to ensure successful administration of the product. Despite significant efforts in improving the drug product and administration procedures, ocular safety concerns such as endophthalmitis, increased intraocular pressure, and presence of silicone floaters have been reported. A systematic review of available literature on container closure and devices for IVT administration can help guide successful product development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fruit juices are successfully proposed as suitable probiotic vehicles, but researchers’ efforts should be developed to avoid effects of bacteria overgrowing on sensory and nutritional cues of final products and to preserve viability of probiotic bacteria during storage. In the present study, encapsulation of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG strain in alginate systems was performed through ionotropic gelation technology. The alginate systems were optimized by using Box-Behnken Design to investigate the influence of three independent variables at three different levels: particle mean size and polydispersity index. The optimized probiotic-loaded alginate particles were added to orange juice samples. The viability of the probiotic strain, both as free and microencapsulated, was evaluated in orange juice stored at 5°C for 35 days. Morphology and size of probiotic-loaded alginate particles were found suitable for incorporation into juice. TEM analysis revealed that unloaded systems were clustered as nanoparticles (CL_NP), while the loaded sample appeared as a coated system (Coated_LGG). Microbiological evaluation revealed that the encapsulation assured the survival of Coated_LGG, with a reduction of less than 1-unit log in cellular density after 35 days of refrigerated storage in orange juice. Results indicated that the encapsulated bacteria did not affect the macroscopic properties neither the microbiological characteristic of orange juice; thus, it can be proposed as functional food.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In order to be at pace with the market requirements of solid dosage forms and regulatory standards, a transformation towards systematic processing using continuous manufacturing (CM) and automated model-based control is being thought through for its fundamental advantages over conventional batch manufacturing. CM eliminates the key gaps through the integration of various processes while preserving quality attributes via the use of process analytical technology (PAT). The twin screw extruder (TSE) is one such equipment adopted by the pharmaceutical industry as a substitute for the traditional batch granulation process. Various types of granulation techniques using twin screw extrusion technology have been explored in the article. Furthermore, individual components of a TSE and their conjugation with PAT tools and the advancements and applications in the field of nutraceuticals and nanotechnology have also been discussed. Thus, the future of granulation lies on the shoulders of continuous TSE, where it can be coupled with computational mathematical studies to mitigate its complications.",

    "abstract": "Pollution is a worldwide environmental risk. Arsenic (As) is an environmental pollutant with a major health concern due to its toxic effects on multiple body organs, including the brain. Humans are exposed to As through eating contaminated food and water or via skin contact. Salix species (willow) are plants with medicinal efficacy. Salix subserrata Willd bark extract-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (SBE.CNPs) was formulated, characterized, and evaluated against As-induced neurotoxicity. The stem bark was selected for nanoparticle formulation based on HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS profiling and in vitro antioxidant assessment using free radical scavenging activity. SBE.CNPs demonstrated an average un-hydrated diameter of 193.4 ± 24.5 nm and zeta potential of + 39.6 ± 0.4 mV with an encapsulation efficiency of 83.7 ± 4.3%. Compared to As-intoxicated rats, SBE.CNP-treated rats exhibited anxiolytic activity and memory-boosting as evidenced in open field test, light-dark activity box, and Y-maze. Also, it increased the antioxidant biomarkers, including superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase associated with reducing the malondialdehyde levels and apoptotic activity. Besides this, SBE.CNPs maintained the brain architecture and downregulated both nuclear factor-kappa B and heme oxygenase-1 expression. These results suggest that SBE.CNP administration showed promising potent neuroprotective and antioxidative efficiencies against arsenic-induced oxidative threats.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The combination of herbal drugs with a topical antibacterial for managing a chronic disease like acne vulgaris has emerged lately to settle side effects and bacterial multidrug resistance. Mixed micelles (MMs) incorporated into nanogel were explored for hybrid delivery of curcumin (Cur) and fusidic acid (FA) combination presenting a multi-strategic treatment. Curcumin-fusidic acid–loaded mixed micelles (Cur-FA-MMs) were assessed for size, surface charge, compatibility, in vitro release, and encapsulation. The selected formula was further loaded into nanogel and investigated for viscosity, ex vivo permeation, and in vivo potential. Cur-FA-MMs exhibited uniform nanosized spherical morphology, and negative surface charge affording high encapsulation for both drugs with a biphasic in vitro release over a period of 48h and good colloidal stability. The attained Cur-FA-MM-loaded nanogel had optimum viscosity with remarkable permeation coefficient values nearly 2-fold that related to plain nanogel. The pharmacodynamic effect of Cur on FA was pronounced by the significant improvement of the skin’s degree of inflammation, epidermal hypertrophy, and congestion in animals treated with Cur-FA-MM-loaded nanogel. In conclusion, micellar nanogel could enable the progressive effect of Cur (an antioxidant with reported antibiotic activity) on FA (antibiotic) and decrease the risk of emerging antibiotic resistance by enhancing the solubility and permeation of Cur.

    "abstract": "Abstract Pravastatin sodium (PVS) is a hypolipidemic drug with poor oral bioavailability due to the first-pass effect. Therefore, this study aims to formulate and evaluate transdermal patches containing PVS-loaded nanoemulsions (PVS-NEs) to increase PVS’s hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective activities. PVS-NEs were prepared using the aqueous titration method, where oleic acid was chosen as an oil phase, and span 80 and tween 80 were used as surfactant and cosurfactant respectively. Droplet size (DS), polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), clarity, and thermodynamic stability of NEs were all characterized. Also, PVS-NEs (NE2) with 50% oil phase, 40% SC mix 2:1, and 10% water were selected as an optimum formula based on the results of DS (251 ± 16), PDI (0.4 ± 0.16), and ZP (-70 ± 10.4) to be incorporated into a transdermal patch, and PVS-NE2 loaded transdermal patches (PVS-NE2-TDPs) were prepared by solvent evaporation method. F1 patch with HPMC E15 and PVP K30 in a ratio of 3:1 represented satisfactory patch properties with good drug-excipients compatibility. Thus, it was selected as an optimum patch formula. The optimized F1 patch was characterized for thickness, moisture content, weight variation, and drug-excipients incompatibility. Therefore, it was subjected to ex vivo skin permeation and finally pharmacodynamic studies. Ex vivo permeation studies of F1 revealed that the cumulative amount of PVS permeated across rat skin was 271.66 ± 19 µg/cm 2 in 72 h, and the pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that the F1 patch was more effective in treating hyperlipidemia than PVS-TDP (control patch) based on both blood analysis and histopathological examination.

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic progressive disease associated with increased collagen deposition and TGF-β1 release. The current therapy and management have been a limited success due to low efficacy and adverse drug reactions. This study aimed to evaluate epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) encapsulated nanoparticles loaded mucoadhesive hydrogel nanocomposite (HNC) for OSF. Developed HNC formulations were evaluated for their permeation behaviour using in vitro as well as ex vivo studies, followed by evaluation of efficacy and safety by in vivo studies using areca nut extract-induced OSF in rats. The disease condition in OSF-induced rats was assessed by mouth-opening and biochemical markers. The optimized polymeric nanoparticles exhibited the required particle size (162.93 ± 13.81 nm), positive zeta potential (22.50 ± 2.94 mV) with better mucoadhesive strength (0.40 ± 0.002 N), and faster permeation due to interactions of the positively charged surface with the negatively charged buccal mucosal membrane. HNC significantly improved disease conditions by reducing TGF-β1 and collagen concentration without showing toxicity and reverting the fibroid buccal mucosa to normal. Hence, the optimized formulation can be further tested to develop a clinically alternate therapeutic strategy for OSF. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite being discovered over five decades ago, little is still known about ivermectin. Ivermectin has several physico-chemical properties that can result in it having poor bioavailability. In this study, polymorphic and co-crystal screening was used to see if such solid-state modifications can improve the oil solubility of ivermectin. Span® 60, a lipophilic non-ionic surfactant, was chosen as co-former. The rationale behind attempting to improve oil solubility was to use ivermectin in future topical and transdermal preparations to treat a range of skin conditions like scabies and head lice. Physical mixtures were also prepared in the same molar ratios as the co-crystal candidates, to serve as controls. Solid-state characterization was performed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The FTIR spectra of the co-crystal candidates showed the presence of Span® 60’s alkyl chain peaks, which were absent in the spectra of the physical mixtures. Due to the absence of single-crystal X-ray data, co-crystal formation could not be confirmed, and therefore these co-crystal candidates were referred to as co-processed crystalline solids. Following characterization, the solid-state forms, physical mixtures and ivermectin raw material were dissolved in natural penetration enhancers, i.e., avocado oil (AVO) and evening primrose oil (EPO). The co-processed solids showed increased oil solubility by up to 169% compared to ivermectin raw material. The results suggest that co-processing of ivermectin with Span® 60 can be used to increase its oil solubility and can be useful in the development of oil-based drug formulations. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The possibility of precisely regulating and targeting drug release with mesophase or Liquid crystal drug delivery systems has drawn much attention recently. This review offers a thorough investigation of liquid crystal drug delivery systems with an emphasis on their mesogenic architecture. It describes the various liquid crystal forms such as thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals and their applicability in advanced drug delivery. Liquid crystals are used as excellent carriers due to their distinctive characteristics, such as stimuli-responsive drug delivery and sustained release patterns. Comprehending the materials that form mesophase provides insight into their distinct physiochemical characteristics and their use in drug delivery. This review highlights the important role lyotropic and thermotropic liquid crystals play in drug delivery, underscoring their considerable potential. The transition of thermotropic liquid crystals from their conventional technological applications to drug delivery has been studied. Nonetheless, a few challenges still need to be addressed, including formulation strategy refinement, regulating release rates, maximising the loading of hydrophilic drugs, and storage stability. In the pharmaceutical field, addressing these issues will open the door to a revolutionary paradigm that will revolutionise therapeutic outcomes and improve patient care. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Infections are a leading complication in patients with burns. Effective antimicrobial treatment with regenerative tissue healing is required. Utilizing components derived from plant origin such as natural oils as a sustainable and eco-friendly approach for managing disease is highly required nowadays. The aim of the current study is to assess the antibacterial and wound-healing activity of clove oil and its novel eco-friendly nanostructured liquid crystals (Eco-friendly-NLCs) formulation in treating infected burn wounds. A 2 3 full factorial design was used to optimize the Eco-friendly-NLCs. Clove oil and its novel nano-formulation were characterized and subjected to in vitro and in vivo assessments for their efficacy. Twenty rats were used experimentally. The optimum Eco-friendly-NLCs had 189.2 ± 1.9 nm, -22.8 ± 0.7 mV and 0.308 as values for particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index. Transmission electron microscope images showed discrete spherical shape NLCs with no aggregations. The microbiological and pharmacological results revealed a superior efficacy regarding clove loaded Eco-friendly-NLCs in inhibiting bacterial growth (inhibition zone of 38 mm), significantly reducing inflammatory biomarker levels ( p &lt; 0.001), promoting angiogenesis and prompt wound healing. The Eco-friendly-NLCs loaded with clove oil could be considered as a promising formulation providing anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and wound healing effects. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Onbrez Breezhaler® is a low-resistance capsule-based device that was developed to deliver indacaterol maleate. The study was designed to investigate the effects of both maximum flow rate (MIF) and inhalation volume (Vin) on the dose emission of indacaterol 150 and 300 μg dose strengths after one and two inhalations using dose unit sampling apparatus (DUSA) as well as to study the aerodynamic characteristics of indacaterol Breezhaler® using the Andersen cascade impactor (ACI) at a different set of MIF and Vin. Indacaterol 150 and 300 μg contain equal amounts of lactose per carrier. However, 150 μg has the smallest carrier size. The particle size distribution (PSD) of indacaterol DPI formulations 150 and 300 μg showed that the density of fine particles increased with the increase of the primary pressure. For both strengths (150 μg and 300 μg), ED1 increased and ED2 decreased when the inhalation flow rate and inhaled volume increased. The reduction in ED1 and subsequent increase in ED2 was such that when the Vin is greater than 1 L, then 60 L/min could be regarded as the minimum MIF. The Breezhaler was effective in producing respirable particles with an MMAD ≤5 μm irrespective of the inhalation flow rate, but the mass fraction of particles with an aerodynamic diameter <3 μm is more pronounced between 60 and 90 L/min. The dose emission of indacaterol was comparable for both dose strengths 150 and 300 μg. These in vitro results suggest that a minimum MIF of 60 L/min is required during routine use of Onbrez Breezhaler®, and confirm the good practice to make two separate inhalations from the same dose.",

    "abstract": "The problem of designing tablet geometry and its internal structure that results into a specified release profile of the drug during dissolution was considered. A solution method based on parametric programming, inspired by CAD (computer-aided design) approaches currently used in other fields of engineering, was proposed and demonstrated. The solution of the forward problem using a parametric series of structural motifs was first carried out in order to generate a library of drug release profiles associated with each structural motif. The inverse problem was then solved in three steps: first, the combination of basic structural motifs whose superposition provides the closest approximation of the required drug release profile was found by a linear combination of pre-calculated release profiles. In the next step, the final tablet design was constructed and its dissolution curve found computationally. Finally, the proposed design was 3D printed and its dissolution profile was confirmed experimentally. The computational method was based on the numerical solution of drug diffusion in a boundary layer surrounding the tablet, coupled with erosion of the tablet structure encoded by the phase volume function. The tablets were 3D printed by fused deposition modelling (FDM) from filaments produced by hot-melt extrusion. It was found that the drug release profile could be effectively controlled by modifying the tablet porosity. Custom release profiles were obtained by combining multiple porosity regions in the same tablet. The computational method yielded accurate predictions of the drug release rate for both single- and multi-porosity tablets.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we showed that the encapsulation and release properties of a liposomal ciprofloxacin formulation could be modified post manufacture, by addition of surfactant in concert with osmotic swelling of the liposomes. This strategy may provide more flexibility and convenience than the alternative of manufacturing multiple batches of liposomes differing in composition to cover a wide range of release profiles. The goal of this study was to develop a surfactant-associated liposomal ciprofloxacin (CFI) formulation possessing good long-term stability which could be delivered as an inhaled aerosol. Preparations of 12.5 mg/ml CFI containing 0.4% polysorbate 20 were formulated between pH 4.7 and 5.5. These formulations, before and after mesh nebulization, and after refrigerated storage for up to 2 years, were characterized in terms of liposome structure by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) imaging, vesicle size by dynamic light scattering, pH, drug encapsulation by centrifugation-filtration, and in vitro release (IVR) performance. Within the narrower pH range of 4.9 to 5.2, these formulations retained their physicochemical stability after 2-year refrigerated storage, were robust to mesh nebulization, and formed respirable aerosols with a volume mean diameter (VMD) of 3.7 μm and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.7. This study demonstrates that it may be possible to provide a range of release profiles by simple addition of surfactant to a liposomal formulation post manufacture, and that these formulations may retain their physicochemical properties after long-term refrigerated storage and following aerosolization by mesh nebulizer.",

    "abstract": "Dosage forms with increased gastric residence time are promising tools to increase bioavailability of drugs with narrow absorption window. Low-density floating formulations could avoid gastric emptying; therefore, sustained drug release can be achieved. Our aim was to develop a new technology to produce low-density floating formulations by melt foaming. Excipients were selected carefully, with the criteria of low gastric irritation, melting range below 70°C and well-known use in oral drug formulations. PEG 4000, Labrasol and stearic acid type 50 were used to create metronidazole dispersion which was foamed by air on atmospheric pressure using in-house developed apparatus at 53°C. Stearic acid was necessary to improve the foamability of the molten dispersion. Additionally, it reduced matrix erosion, thus prolonging drug dissolution and preserving hardness of the moulded foam. Labrasol as a liquid solubiliser can be used to increase drug release rate and drug solubility. Based on the SEM images, metronidazole in the molten foam remained in crystalline form. MicroCT scans with the electron microscopic images revealed that the foam has a closed-cell structure, where spherical voids have smooth inner wall, they are randomly dispersed, while adjacent voids often interconnected with each other. Drug release from all compositions followed Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model. Erosion of the matrix was the main mechanism of the release of metronidazole. Texture analysis confirmed that stearic acid plays a key role in preserving the integrity of the matrix during dissolution in acidic buffer. The technology creates low density and solid matrix system with micronsized air-filled voids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Continuous manufacturing is increasingly used in the pharmaceutical industry, as it promises to deliver better product quality while simultaneously increasing production flexibility. GEA developed a semi-continuous tablet coater which can be integrated into a continuous tableting line, accelerating the switch from traditional batch production to the continuous mode of operation. The latter offers certain advantages over batch production, e.g. , operational flexibility, increased process/product quality, and decreased cost. However, process understanding is the key element for process control. In this regard, computational tools can improve the fundamental understanding and process performance, especially those related to new processes, such as continuous tablet coating where process mechanics remain unclear. The discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are two methods that allow transition from empirical process design to a mechanistic understanding of the individual process units. The developed coupling model allows to track the heat, mass, and momentum exchange between the tablet and fluid phase. The goal of this work was to develop and validate a high-fidelity CFD-DEM simulation model of the tablet coating process in the GEA ConsiGma® coater. After the model development, simulation results for the tablet movement, coating quality, and heat and mass transfer during the coating process were validated and compared to the experimental outcomes. The experimental and simulation results agreed well on all accounts measured, indicating that the model can be used in further studies to investigate the operating space of the continuous tablet coating process.",

    "abstract": "This work describes the lyophilization process validation and consists of two parts. Part one (Part I: Process Design and Modeling) focuses on the process design and is described in the previous paper, while the current paper is devoted to process qualification and continued process verification. The goal of the study is to show the cutting edge of lyophilization validation based on the integrated community-based opinion and the industrial perspective. This study presents best practices for batch size determination and includes the effect of batch size on drying time, process parameters selection strategies, and batch size overage to compensate for losses during production. It also includes sampling strategies to demonstrate batch uniformity as well as the use of statistical models to ensure adequate sampling. Based on the LyoHUB member organizations survey, the best practices in determining the number of PPQ runs are developed including the bracketing approach with minimum and maximum loads. Standard practice around CQA and CPP selection is outlined and shows the advantages of using control charts and run charts for process trending and quality control. The case studies demonstrating the validation strategy for monoclonal antibody and the impact of the loading process on the lyophilization cycle and product quality as well as the special case of lyophilization for dual-chamber cartridge system are chosen to illustrate the process validation. The standard practices in the validation of the lyophilization process, special lyophilization processes, and their impact on the validation strategy are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Cyclodextrin (CD) complexes are frequently used for enhancing the solubility or absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. On the contrary, little is known about their complex formation with water-soluble drugs. Here, we have studied the interaction between 2-hydroxypropyl β-CD (HPβCD) and three water-soluble drugs, namely naloxone (NX), oxycodone (OC), and tramadol (TR), by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) combined with molecular modeling in view of the potential impact on drug release. The results showed that the complex formation of HPβCD with all three drugs occurs spontaneously. The complexes formed with NX and OC were found to be 2NX:1HPβCD and 3OC:2HPβCD, respectively. TR was found to form 2 complexes with HPβCD; of 1:2 and 1:1 complexation ratios. The binding of HPβCD to NX was greater than to OC due to the higher hydrophobicity of the structure of the former. Moreover, the binding affinity of HPβCD to TR was higher than to OC, which indicated the effect of the higher flexibility of the guest in increasing the binding affinity. In vitro drug release experiments from the various complexes revealed a significant impact of the stoichiometry of the complex on the release profiles. Accordingly, the co-administration of cyclodextrins with water-soluble drugs should be closely monitored, as it may result in unintentional complex formation that can potentially impact the drugs' gastrointestinal absorption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An increasingly large dataset of pharmaceutics disciplines is frequently challenging to comprehend. Since machine learning needs high-quality data sets, the open-source dataset can be a place to start. This work presents a systematic method to choose representative subsamples from the existing research, along with an extensive set of quality measures and a visualization strategy. The preceding article (Muthudoss et al. . in AAPS PharmSciTech 23, 2022) describes a workflow for leveraging near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to obtain reliable and robust data on pharmaceutical samples. This study describes the systematic and structured procedure for selecting subsamples from the historical data. We offer a wide range of in-depth quality measures, diagnostic tools, and visualization techniques. A real-world, well-researched NIR dataset was employed to demonstrate this approach. This open-source tablet dataset ( http://www.models.life.ku.dk/Tablets ) consists of different doses in milligrams, different shapes, and sizes of dosage forms, slots in tablets, three different manufacturing scales (lab, pilot, production), coating differences (coated vs uncoated), etc. This sample is appropriate; that is, the model was developed on one scale (in this research, the lab scale), and it can be great to investigate how well the top models are transferable when tested on new data like pilot-scale or production (full) scale. A literature review indicated that the PLS regression models outperform artificial neural network-multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP). This work demonstrates the selection of appropriate hyperparameters and their impact on ANN-MLP model performance. The hyperparameter tuning approaches and performance with available references are discussed for the data under investigation. Model extension from lab-scale to pilot-scale/production scale is demonstrated. Highlights • We present a comprehensive quality metrics and visualization strategy in selecting subsamples from the existing studies • A comprehensive assessment and workflow are demonstrated using historical real-world near-infrared (NIR) data sets • Selection of appropriate hyperparameters and their impact on artificial neural network-multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP) model performance • The choice of hyperparameter tuning approaches and performance with available references are discussed for the data under investigation • Model extension from lab-scale to pilot-scale successfully demonstrated Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Best practices for performing freeze dryer equipment qualification are recommended, focusing on identifying methods to quantify shelf thermal uniformity (also known as “shelf surface uniformity”), equipment capability, and performance metrics of the freeze dryer essential to the pharmaceutical Quality by Design paradigm. Specific guidelines for performing shelf temperature mapping, freeze dryer equipment limit testing (the capability curve), and condenser performance metrics have been provided. Concerning shelf temperature mapping and equipment capability measurements, the importance of paying attention to the test setup and the use of appropriate testing tools are stressed. In all the guidelines provided, much attention has been paid to identifying the balance between obtaining useful process knowledge, logistical challenges associated with testing in the production environment vs that at laboratory scale, and the frequency of the testing necessary to obtain such useful information. Furthermore, merits and demerits of thermal conditions maintained on the cooled surfaces of the freeze dryer condenser have been discussed identifying the specific influence of the condenser surface temperature on the process conditions using experimental data to support the guidelines. Finally, guidelines for systematic leak rate testing criteria for a freeze dryer are presented. These specific procedural recommendations are based on calculations, measurements, and experience to provide useful process and equipment knowledge. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLnPs) are usually utilized as lipid-based formulations for enhancing oral bioavailability of BCS class IV drugs. Accordingly, the objective of this work was to investigate the effect of formulation and processing variables on the properties of the developed SLnPs for oral delivery of apixaban. Randomized full factorial design (24) was employed for optimization of SLnPs. With two levels for each independent variable, four factors comprising both formulations and processing factors were chosen: the GMS content (A), the Tween 80 content (B), the homogenization time (C), and the content of poloxamer 188 used (D). The modified hot homogenization and sonication method was employed in the formulation of solid lipid nanoparticles loaded with apixaban (APX-SLnPs). The size of APX-SLnPs formulations was measured to lie between 116.7 and 1866 nm, polydispersity index ranged from 0.385 to 1, and zeta potential was discovered to be in the range of - 12.6 to - 38.6 mV. The entrapping efficiency of APX-SLnPs formulations was found to be in the range of 22.8 to 96.7%. The optimized formulation was evaluated in vivo after oral administration to rats. Oral administration of APX-SLnPs resulted in significant prolongation in bleeding time compared with both positive and negative control. This indicates the ability of this system to enhance drug therapeutic effect either by increasing intestinal absorption or trans-lymphatic transport. So, this study highlighted the capability of SLnPs to boost the pharmacological effect of apixaban.",

    "abstract": "The analytical properties of two commercially available bortezomib products (VELCADE(®) and Bortenat) were compared using nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography. The data showed differences between the two products. Based on these data, Bortenat samples contained more active ingredients than indicated by the label (mean, 116.5% and 117.9% of label, in 2-mg and 3.5-mg vials, respectively). In comparison, VELCADE samples contained a mean of 99.3% of active ingredient, which was consistent with the approved specification range (US, 90-110%; EU, 95-105%). Clinical data demonstrate that patients exposed to higher than recommended doses of bortezomib on the standard twice-weekly dosing schedule are likely to have an increased risk of major toxicities. Bortenat 2-mg vials contained an isovaleraldehyde impurity; the origin of this is unknown. Additionally, the ratio of boronic acid to boronic ester differed between Bortenat 2 mg (0.27:1) and 3.5 mg (0.13:1) and VELCADE (0.10:1) samples reconstituted in saline indicating that the Bortenat product is not equivalent to the VELCADE product.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of biopharmaceuticals. As such, there are no specific guidelines addressing impurity limits and qualification requirements. The current ICH guidelines on impurities, Q3A (Impurities in New Drug Substances), Q3B (Impurities in New Drug Products), and Q6B (Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products) do not adequately address how to assess small molecule impurities in ADCs. The International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) formed an impurities working group (IWG) to discuss this issue. This white paper presents a strategy for evaluating the impact of small molecule impurities in ADCs. This strategy suggests a science-based approach that can be applied to the design of control systems for ADC therapeutics. The key principles that form the basis for this strategy include the significant difference in molecular weights between small molecule impurities and the ADC, the conjugation potential of the small molecule impurities, and the typical dosing concentrations and dosing schedule. The result is that exposure to small impurities in ADCs is so low as to often pose little or no significant safety risk.",

The hard capsule is an established pharmaceutical dosage form used worldwide in development and manufacturing. The empty hard capsules are supplied as an excipient that is filled by pharmaceutical manufacturers with a variety of different formulations and products. To understand the potential variations of the empty hard capsules as an input parameter and its potential impact on the finished product quality, a study was performed investigating the critical quality parameters within and in between different batches of empty hard gelatin capsules. The variability of the hard capsules showed high consistency within the specification of the critical quality parameters. This also accounts for the disintegration times, when automatic endpoint detection was used. Based on these data, hard capsules can be considered as a suitable excipient for product development using QbD principles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Development of generic extended-release (ER) formulations is challenging. Especially under fed conditions, the risk of failure in bioequivalence trials is high because of long gastric residence times and susceptibility to food effects. We describe the development of a generic trazodone ER formulation that was aided with a biorelevant dissolution evaluation. Trazodone hydrochloride 300-mg monolithic matrix tablets were dissolved both in USP and EMA compliant conditions and in the StressTest device that simulated both physicochemical and mechanical conditions of the gastrointestinal passage. The final formulation was tested against the originator, Trittico XR 300 mg, in a randomized cross-over bioequivalence trial with 44 healthy volunteers, in agreement with EMA guidelines. Initially developed formulations dissolved trazodone similarly to the originator under standard conditions (f 2 factor above 50), but their dissolution kinetics differed significantly in the biorelevant tests. The formulation was optimized by the addition of low-viscosity hypromellose and mannitol. The final formulation was approved for the bioequivalence trial. Calculated C max were 1.92 ± 0.77 and 1.92 ± 0.63 [μg/mL], AUC 0-t were 27.46 ± 8.39 and 29.96 ± 9.09 [μg∙h/mL], and AUC 0-∞ were 28.22 ± 8.91 and 30.82 ± 9.41 [μg∙h/mL] for the originator and test formulations, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals of all primary pharmacokinetic parameters fell within the 80–125% range. In summary, biorelevant dissolution tests supported successful development of a generic trazodone ER formulation pharmaceutically equivalent with the originator under fed conditions. Employment of biorelevant dissolution tests may decrease the risk of failure in bioequivalence trials of ER formulations.",

    "abstract": "Food and drinks are commonly used to facilitate administration of paediatric medicines to improve palatability and enhance patient compliance. However, the impact of this practice on drug solubility and on oral drug bioavailability is not usually studied. Based on recommended strategies for oral administration of paediatric medicines with food and drink vehicles, the aims of this study were (i) to measure the physicochemical properties of (soft) food and drink vehicles, commonly mixed with paediatric medicines prior to administration, and (ii) to assess the impact of the co-administered vehicles on the solubility of two poorly soluble paediatric drugs. Montelukast (sodium) and mesalazine were selected as the model compounds. Distinct differences were observed between the physicochemical properties (i.e. pH, surface tension, osmolality, viscosity and buffer capacity) and macronutrient composition (i.e. fat, sugar and protein content) of the different soft foods and drinks, not only among vehicle type but also within vehicles of the same subtype. Solubility studies of the two model compounds in selected drinks and soft foods resulted in considerably different drug solubility values in each vehicle. The solubility of the drugs was significantly affected by the vehicle physicochemical properties and macronutrient composition, with the solubility of montelukast being driven by the pH, fat and protein content of the vehicles and the solubility of mesalazine by vehicle osmolality, viscosity and sugar content. This vehicle-dependent impact on drug solubility could compromise its bioavailability, and ultimately affect the safety and/or efficacy of the drug and should be taken into consideration during paediatric product development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In vitro dissolution testing conditions that reflect and predict in vivo drug product performance are advantageous, especially for the development of paediatric medicines, as clinical testing in this population is hindered by ethical and technical considerations. The aim of this study was to develop an in vivo predictive dissolution test in order to investigate the impact of medicine co-administration with soft food and drinks on the dissolution performance of a poorly soluble compound. Relevant in vitro dissolution conditions simulating the in vivo gastrointestinal environment of infants were used to establish in vitro - in vivo relationships with corresponding in vivo data. Dissolution studies of montelukast formulations were conducted with mini-paddle apparatus on a two-stage approach: infant fasted-state simulated gastric fluid (Pi-FaSSGF; for 1 h) followed by either infant fasted-state or infant fed-state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF-V2 or Pi-FeSSIF, respectively; for 3 h). The dosing scenarios tested reflected in vivo paediatric administration practices: (i.) direct administration of formulation; (ii.) formulation co-administered with vehicles (formula, milk or applesauce). Drug dissolution was significantly affected by co-administration of the formulation with vehicles compared with after direct administration of the formulation. Montelukast dissolution from the granules was significantly higher under fed-state simulated intestinal conditions in comparison with the fasted state and was predictive of the in vivo performance when the granules are co-administered with milk. This study supports the potential utility of the in vitro biorelevant dissolution approach proposed to predict in vivo formulation performance after co-administration with vehicles, in the paediatric population.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of multiple nasal prong interface configurations on nasal depositional loss of pharmaceutical aerosols in a preterm infant nose-throat (NT) airway model. Benchmark in vitro experiments were performed in which a spray-dried powder formulation was delivered to a new preterm NT model with a positive-pressure infant air-jet dry powder inhaler using single- and dual-prong interfaces. These results were used to develop and validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of aerosol transport and deposition in the NT geometry. The validated CFD model was then used to explore the NT depositional characteristic of multiple prong types and configurations. The CFD model highlighted a turbulent jet effect emanating from the prong(s). Analysis of NT aerosol deposition efficiency curves for a characteristic particle size and delivery flowrate (3 µm and 1.4 L/min (LPM)) revealed little difference in NT aerosol deposition fraction (DF) across the prong insertion depths of 2-5 mm (DF = 16-24%) with the exception of a single prong with 5-mm insertion (DF = 36%). Dual prongs provided a modest reduction in deposition vs. a single aerosol delivery prong at the same flow for insertion depths < 5 mm. The presence of the prongs increased nasal depositional loss by absolute differences in the range of 20-70% compared with existing correlations for ambient aerosols. In conclusion, the use of nasal prongs was shown to have a significant impact on infant NT aerosol depositional loss prompting the need for prong design alterations to improve lung delivery efficiency.",

To address this, we have developed a two-stage workflow for the dissolution method development followed by demonstration of discrimination power through an analytical Quality by Design (aQbD) approach. In the first stage, an optimal dissolution method was achieved by determining the method operable design region (MODR) through a design of experiment study of the high-risk method-related parameters. In the second stage, we established a Formulation-Discrimination Correlation Diagram strategy to examine the method discrimination capability, through which one can determine the method discriminative design region (MDDR) and visualize the impact of each formulation parameter and their interactions on dissolution. The application of aQbD principles into a workflow provides a scientific-driven guidance for robust method development and demonstrating discrimination power for dissolution methods.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate possible usefulness of pectins for direct compression of tablets. The deformation behavior of pectin grades of different degree of methoxylation (DM), namely, 5%, 10%, 25%, 35%, 40%, 50%, and 60% were, examined in terms of yield pressures (YP) derived from Heckel profiles for both compression and decompression and measurements of elastic recovery after ejection. All pectin grades showed a high degree of elastic recovery. DM 60% exhibited most plastic deformation (YP 70.4 MPa) whereas DM 5% (104.6 MPa) and DM 10% (114.7 MPa) least. However, DM 60% gave no coherent tablets, whereas tablet tensile strengths for DM 5% and DM 10% were comparable to Starch 1500®. Also, Heckel profiles were similar to Starch 1500®. For sieved fractions (180–250 and 90–125 μm) of DM 25% and DM 40% originating from the very same batch, YPs were alike, indicating minor effects of particle size. These facts indicate that DM is important for the compaction behavior, and batch-to-batch variability should also be considered. Therefore, pectins of low degree of methoxylation may have a potential as direct compression excipients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Highly potent active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and low-dose excipients, or excipients with very low density, are notoriously hard to feed with currently available commercial technology. The micro-feeder system presented in this work is capable of feeding low-dose rates of powders with different particle sizes and flow properties. Two different grades of lactose, di-calcium phosphate, croscarmellose sodium, silicon dioxide, a spray-dried intermediate, and an active ingredient were studied to vary material properties to test performance of the system. The current micro-feeder system is a volumetric feeder combined with a weighing balance at the outlet that measures feeder output rates. Feeding results are shown as a so-called “displacement-feed factor” curve for each material. Since the powder mass and volume are known in the micro-feeder system, in this work, we characterized an observed density variation during processing via a “displacement-feed factor” profile for each of the fed powders. This curve can be later used for calibrating the system to ensure an accurate, constant feed rate and in addition predicting feeding performance for that material at any feed rate. There is a relation between powder properties and feeding performance. Powders with finer particles and higher compressibility show densification during their feeding process. However, powders with larger particles and lower compressibility show both “densification” and “powder bed expansion,” which is the manifestation of dilation and elastic recovery of particles during the micro-feeding process. Through the application of the displacement-feed factor, it is possible to provide precise feeding accuracy of low-dose materials. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glycerides are the main components of oils, and fats, used in formulated products in the food and cosmetic industry as well as in the pharmaceutical product industry. However, there is limited literature available on the analysis of the chemical composition of glycerides. The lack of a suitable analytical method for complete chemical profiling of glycerides is one of the bottlenecks in understanding and controlling the change in chemical composition during processing, formulation, and storage. Thus, the aim of the present study is to develop a calibration-free quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance (qHNMR) method for the simultaneous quantification of different components of glycerides. The qHNMR method was developed for the quantification of mono-, di-, and triglycerides; their positional isomers; free fatty acids; and glycerol content. The accuracy, precision, and robustness of the developed method were evaluated and were found suitable for the quantitative analysis of five batches of marketed excipient. The study demonstrates the potential of qHNMR method for the quantification of different components of glycerides in various marketed products. The method has the ability to identify the variability of glycerides among different batches and suppliers in terms of chemical composition and also to discern the changes during storage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) facilitates subcutaneous (SC) delivery of co-administered therapeutic agents by locally and transiently degrading hyaluronan in the SC space, and can be administered with therapeutics using a variety of devices. Two SC delivery studies were carried out to assess auto-injector (AI) performance, each in 18 Yucatan miniature pigs. Abdominal injections were administered using three auto-injectors of 1 mL (AI1) and 2 mL (AI2 and sAI2) with different injection speeds and depths (5.5–7.5 mm) and two pre-filled syringe (PFS) devices of 1 and 2 mL. The injection included a placebo buffer with and without rHuPH20 to evaluate the effect of rHuPH20 on SC injection performance. The feasibility of using similar devices to deliver a placebo buffer in humans was investigated. rHuPH20 was not studied in humans. In miniature pigs, postinjection swelling was evident for most PFS/AI injections, particularly 2 mL. Swelling heights and back leakage were typically lower with rHuPH20 co-administration versus placebo for most device configurations (1 or 2 mL PFS or AI). Auto-injections with versus without rHuPH20 also resulted in reduced swelling firmness and faster swelling resolution over time. Slow injections with rHuPH20 had shorter and more consistent injection time versus placebo. In humans, minimal injection site swelling and negligible back leakage were observed for 2-mL injections of placebo, while more erythema was observed in humans versus miniature pigs. Even at high delivery rates with PFS or AI, the addition of rHuPH20 resulted in improved SC injection performance versus placebo in miniature pigs.",

In our study, AddaVax and PolyI:C combined adjuvant (AP adjuvant) were used for influenza vaccine development. After immunizing BALB/c mice and Wistar rats intramuscularly, Split inactivated H3N2 vaccine adjuvanted with AP elicited higher serum hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies and IgG titers. We demonstrated that AP induced a transient innate immune cytokines production at the injection site, induced H3N2 uptake by DCs, increased recruitment of monocytes and DCs in LNs, and promoted H3N2 vaccine migration; AP facilitated vaccines to induce a vigorous adaptive immune response. Besides, AP showed good safety as shown by lymph nodes (LNs) size, spleens index of BALB/c mice, and weight changes and C-reaction protein level of BALB/c mice and Wistar rats after repeated administration of high-dose vaccine with or without adjuvant. These findings indicate that AP is a potential novel adjuvant and can be used as a safe and effective adjuvant for MDCK-based influenza inactivated vaccine to induce cellular and antibody protective response.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) could act synergistically with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to kill cancer cells. To facilitate their simultaneous transport in the bloodstream, we synthesized, for the first time, liposomes (LIPUFU) containing 5-FU in the aqueous core and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at a ratio of 1:2 in the lipid bilayer. LIPUFU werestable with uniform size of 154 ± 4 nm, PDI of 0.19 ± 0.03 and zeta potential of -41 ± 2 mV. They contained 557 ± 210 μmol/l DHA, 1467 ± 362 μmol/l EPA, and 9.8 ± 1.1 μmol/l 5-FU. Control liposomes without (LIP) or with only 5-FU (LIFU) or n-3 PUFAs (LIPU) were produced in a similar way. The effects of these different liposomal formulations on the cell cycle, growth, and apoptosis were evaluated in two human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines differing in sensitivity to 5-FU, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. LIPUFU were more cytotoxic than LIP, LIFU, and LIPU in both LS174T (p53+/+, bax-/-) and HT-29 (p53-/0, bax+/+) cell lines. Similar to LIFU, LIPUFU increased the percentage of cells in S phase, apoptosis, and/or necrosis. The cytotoxic potential of LIPUFU was confirmed in vivo by tumor growth inhibition in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model. These results suggest that LIPUFU could be considered to facilitate the simultaneous transport of 5-FU and n-3 PUFAs to the tumor site, in particular in case of CRC liver metastases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bedaquiline is used to treat multi-resistant tuberculosis in adults. The fumarate salt is commercially available and used in the product Sirturo. To provide open access to bedaquiline molecule once the patent on the chemical substance expires, new salts were screened. This work offers additional information on the bedaquiline system, as new salts may present better pharmacokinetic properties. The current studies focus on the attempted isolation of the acetate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, hydrobromide, succinate, hydrochloride, tartrate, lactate, maleate, malate, and mesylate salts of bedaquiline. Potential salts were screened using a unique combination of conventional screening, and small-scale experiments supplemented by crystallographic analysis and infrared microspectroscopy. Salts were prepared on a larger scale by dissolving 1:1 ratios of the individual salt formers and bedaquiline base (30 mg, 0.055 mmol) in different solvents and allowing the solutions to evaporate or crystallize. X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and spectroscopic and thermal analyses were employed to characterize the salts. The benzoate and maleate salts were selected as lead candidates after reviewing preliminary characterization data. To determine the most stable forms for the leads, a polymorph screen was conducted using solvents of various polarities. These salt screens successfully generated five new salts of bedaquiline, namely, benzoate, maleate, hydrochloride, besylate, and mesylate. The existence of these salts was confirmed by powder XRD, proton NMR, and IR spectroscopies. TGA and DSC thermal analysis along with hot-stage optical microscopy were further used to characterize the salts. The polymorph screen conducted on the salts suggested the absence of additional polymorphs at 1 g scale.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to prepare drotaverine hydrochloride superporous hydrogel hybrid systems (DSHH systems) to prolong its residence time in the stomach, provide extended release and reduce its frequency of administration. Drotaverine hydrochloride (DRH) is a spasmolytic drug that suffers from brief residence due to intestinal hypermotility during diarrheal episodes associated with gastrointestinal colics resulting in low bioavailability and repeated dosing. Eight DSHH systems were prepared using gas blowing technique. The prepared DSHH systems were evaluated regarding their morphology, incorporation efficiency, density, porosity, swelling ratio, viscoelastic property, erosion percentage and release kinetics. The FH8 formula containing equal proportion of chitosan (3%) /polyvinyl alcohol (3%) as strengthener and crosslinked with tripolyphosphate showed the highest incorporation efficiency (91.83 ± 1.33%), good swelling ratio (28.32 ± 3.15% after 24 h), optimum viscoelastic properties (60.19 ± 3.82 kPa) and sustained release profile (88.03 ± 2.15% after 24 h). A bioequivalence study was done to compare the bioavailability of the candidate formula versus Spasmocure®. Statistical analysis showed significant (P < 0.05) increase in bioavailability 2.7 folds with doubled Tmax (4 h) compared to the marketed product (2 h). These results declared that the superporous hydrogel hybrid systems could be a potential gastroretentive approach for the sustained delivery of drugs with short residence time with enhanced viscoelasticity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present research aims to investigate the miscibility, physical stability, solubility, and dissolution rate of a poorly water-soluble glibenclamide (GLB) in solid dispersions (SDs) with hydrophilic carriers like PEG-1500 and PEG-50 hydrogenated palm glycerides (Acconon). Mathematical theories such as Hansen solubility parameters, Flory Huggins theory, Gibbs free energy, and the in silico molecular dynamics simulation study approaches were used to predict the drug-carrier miscibility. To increase the solubility further, the effervescence technique was introduced to the conventional solid dispersions to prepare effervescent solid dispersions (ESD). Solid dispersions (SDs) were prepared by microwave, solvent evaporation, lyophilization, and hot melt extrusion (HME) techniques and tested for different characterization parameters. The theoretical and in silico parameters suggested that GLB would show good miscibility with the selected carriers under certain conditions. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the drug and carrier(s) was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Solid-state characterizations like powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and microscopy confirm the amorphous nature of SDs. The addition of the effervescent agent improved the amorphous nature, due to which the solubility and drug release rate was increased. In vitro and ex vivo intestinal absorption studies showed improved flux and permeability than the pure drug, suggesting an enhanced drug delivery. The GLB solubility, dissolution, and stability were greatly enhanced by the SD and ESD technology. Graphical Abstract",

Herein, CsNPs have been synthesized by ionic gelation method at pH 3 (CsNPs3) and pH 5 (CsNPs5), followed by characterization of morphology, size, polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge, and loading efficiency of UEERO. An in vitro sporulation inhibition assay (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.62, 0.31, 0.15, 0.07, 0.04, 0.02, and 0.01 mg/ml normal saline solution) against E. tenella was conducted. Results showed that free CsNPs and UEERO-CsNPs3/5 were cubic- and spherical-shaped with positive charge and average size of ~ 150.8 nm (314.4 nm) and 151.7 nm (321.1 nm), respectively. The total loading efficiency using UV-vis spectrophotometer, was 80.05 at pH 5 and 64.39% at pH 3. The in vitro sporulation inhibition assay revealed that UEERO, CsNPs3/5, and UEERO-CsNPs3/5 showed a potential inhibitory effect on sporulation (%), distortion in wall (%), and sporocyst abnormality (%) in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, the concentration (10 mg/ml) showed the best efficacy after 24 h in UEERO, free CsNPs, and UEERO-CsNPs. Moreover, UEERO-CsNPs3 and UEERO-CsNPs5 had stopped the sporulation (%) after 72 h. Taken all together, UEERO-CsNPs3 and UEERO-CsNPs5 are best effective against E. tenella in a dose-dependent manner in terms of sporulation (%), distortion in wall (%), and sporocysts abnormality.",

Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed using olive oil or castor oil (oily phase), Tween 80 (surfactant), and sodium carbonate solution (aqueous phase). Microemulsion and liquid crystal (LC) formulations were selected from the constructed phase diagrams and were evaluated for rheological properties and in vitro drug release. The efficacy of the developed formulations in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) was assessed in vivo. In vitro release study showed slower release rate from LC and ME compared with drug solution with the release from LC being the slowest. Ocular application of acetazolamide ME formulations or aqueous solution resulted in significant reduction in IOP from baseline. The recorded Tmax values indicated faster onset of action for acetazolamide aqueous solution (1 h) compared with ME systems (3 h). However, the duration of action was prolonged and the reduction in IOP continued for up to 10 h in case of MEs, while that of aqueous solution was only for 4-5 h. The study suggested ME formulations for ocular delivery of acetazolamide with enhanced efficacy and prolonged duration of action.",

    "abstract": "A severe form of autoimmune-mediated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is termed as ulcerative colitis (UC) which ultimately results in significant mucosal damage and ulceration. Herbal remedies may be employed as an alternative for treatment of UC instead of conventional medications such as Sulfasalazine. Promising natural remedies for the treatment of IBD, including colitis, are propolis extract (PP) and thymoquinone (TQ). This study is aimed at assessing the potential of liposomal formulations of TQ and Egyptian PP in combination therapy on improving their therapeutic efficacy against ulcerative colitis in order to maximize the potential of their beneficial clinical effects. Clinical, biochemical, and histological evaluations of colonic mucosal damage and inflammation were evaluated. The results exhibited a significant increase in tissue MDA, TNFα, and nitrite levels with activation of caspase-3 in the acetic acid-induced colitis group, which is predominantly downregulated in the treatment groups. The prepared formulations of TQ and PP revealed liposomal vesicles in a nanoscale size (192 ± 20.3 and 98.2 ± 20.3 nm, respectively) and accepted stability indicated with a zeta potential of 19.3 ± 0.11 and 17.1 ± 0.25 mV, respectively. They showed an entrapment efficiency of 85.3 ± 12.6% and 69.3 ± 11.8%, respectively. At comparable doses, combination therapy with thymoquinone liposomes and propolis liposomes considerably outperformed free TQ and free PP in reducing inflammation of UC as shown in the present study by clinical, biochemical, and histological evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although nasal inhalation products are becoming more and more important for the delivery of medicines, characterization of these products for quality control and assessment of bioequivalence is complicated. Most of the problems encountered are associated with the assessment of aerodynamic droplet/particle size distribution (APSD). The droplets produced by the various nasal devices are large, and for suspension products, individual droplets may contain multiple drug particles or none at all. Assessment of suspension products is further complicated by the presence of solid excipient particles. These complications make it imperative that the limitations of the instruments used for characterization as well as the underlying assumptions that govern the interpretation of data produced by these instruments are understood. In this paper, we describe various methodologies used to assess APSD for nasal inhalation products and discuss proper use, limitations, and new methodologies on the horizon.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral dispersible films have received broad interest due to fast drug absorption and no first-path metabolism, leading to high bioavailability and better patient compliance. Saxagliptin (SXG) is an antidiabetic drug that undergoes first-path metabolism, resulting in a less active metabolite, so the development of SXG oral dispersible films (SXG-ODFs) improves SXG bioavailability. The formula optimisation included a response surface experimental design and the impact of three formulation factors, the type and concentration of polymer and plasticiser concentration on in-vitro disintegration time and folding endurance. Two optimised SXG-ODFs prepared using either polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were investigated. SXG-ODFs prepared with PVA demonstrated a superior rapid disintegration time, ranging from 17 to 890 s, with the fastest disintegration time recorded at 17 s. These short durations can be attributed to the hydrophilic nature of PVA, facilitating rapid hydration and disintegration upon contact with saliva. Additionally, PVA-based films displayed remarkable folding endurance, surpassing 200 folds without rupture, indicating flexibility and stability. The high tensile strength of PVA-based films further underscores their robust mechanical properties, with tensile strength values reaching up to 4.53 MPa. SXG exhibits a UV absorption wavelength of around 212 nm, posing challenges for traditional quantitative spectrophotometric analysis, so a polyaniline nanoparticles-based solid-contact screen-printed ion-selective electrode (SP-ISE) was employed for the determination of SXG release profile effectively in comparison to HPLC. SP-ISE showed a better real-time release profile of SXG-ODFs, and the optimised formula showed lower blood glucose levels than commercial tablets. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a multifaceted gasotransmitter molecule which has potential applications in many pathological conditions including in lowering intraocular pressure and providing retinal neuroprotection. However, its unique physicochemical properties pose several challenges for developing its efficient and safe delivery method system. This study aims to overcome challenges related to H 2 S toxicity, gaseous nature, and narrow therapeutic concentrations range by developing polymeric microparticles to sustain the release of H 2 S for an extended period. Various formulation parameters and their interactions are quantitatively identified using Quality-by-Design (QbD) approach to optimize the microparticle-based H 2 S donor (HSD) delivery system. Microparticles were prepared using a solvent-evaporation coacervation process by using polycaprolactone (PCL), soy lecithin, dichloromethane, Na 2 S.9H 2 O, and silicone oil as polymer, surfactant, solvent, HSD, and dispersion medium, respectively. The microparticles were characterized for size, size distribution, entrapment efficiency, and H 2 S release profile. A Main Effects Screening (MES) and a Response Surface Design (RSD) model-based Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was developed to establish the relationship between critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) qualitatively and quantitatively. The MES model identified polymer to drug ratio and dispersion medium quantity as significant CPPs among others, while the RSD model established their quantitative relationship. Finally, the target product performance was validated by comparing predicted and experimental outcomes. The QbD approach helped in achieving overall desired microparticle characteristics with fewer trials and provided a mathematical relationship between the CPPs and the CQAs useful for further manipulation and optimization of release profile up to at least 30 days.

Using the same ultrasonic device, subsequently, hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) were obtained by the hard template of nano-CaCO 3 . HMSNs were selected as carriers for the antifungal drug voriconazole (VOR) loading to overcome poor water solubility. Three-dimensional CaCO 3 nanosheets HMSNs were obtained under gentle sonication. Three-dimensional CaCO 3 nanosheets of 24.5 nm (hydrodynamic diameter) were obtained under 17.6 W for 3 min. HMSNs were synthesized by double-template method with nano-CaCO 3 as the hard template. Transmission electron microscopy measurements showed that the prepared HMSNs possess hollow structures with particle size between 110 and 120 nm. Nitrogen physisorption at -196 °C revealed that the HMSNs had high surface area (401.57 m 2 /g), high pore volume (0.11 cm 3 /g), and uniform pore size (2.22 nm) that facilitated the effective encapsulation of VOR in the HMSNs. The loading capacity of VOR (wt%) on the HMSNs was 7.96%, and the total VOR release amount of VOR-HMSNs material was 71.40% at 480 min. The kinetic model confirmed that the release mechanism of HMSNs nanoparticles followed Fickian diffusion at pH = 7.4 and 37 °C. Moreover, the cumulative VOR release at 42 °C (86.05%) was higher than that at 37 °C (71.40%). The cumulative release amount of VOR from the VOR-HMSNs material was 92.37% at pH = 5.8 at the same temperature. Both nano-CaCO 3 templates and HMSNs were prepared by sonication at 19.5 kHz. The as-prepared HMSNs can effectively encapsulate VOR and released drug by Fickian diffusion. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of orally administered rapid mini-tablets containing atomoxetine hydrochloride (ODMT) relative to the conventional capsule formulation of atomoxetine hydrochloride (ATO). To mask the bitter taste of ATO and render it more palatable for pediatric administration in individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), an inclusion complex of ATO with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was synthesized. The ODMT and conventional capsule ATO formulations were administered orally to a cohort of ADHD rat pups born to nicotine-exposed dams, facilitating an in vivo efficacy assessment. Behavioral assays, including the open field test, novel object recognition test, and Barnes maze test, were conducted pre- and post-administration of the therapeutics. The outcomes suggested that the ODMT formulation, incorporating ATO-β-CD inclusion complexes, shows promise as a viable alternative to the capsule form of ATO. Conclusively, the preparation of the ATO-β-CD complexes and ODMTs leveraged a factorial experimental design, with the animal model being subjected to nicotine-induced hyperactivity to provide a unique evaluative framework for the ODMT formulation under development.

Here we introduce a novel TSWG approach with reduced downstream processing steps by using non-volatile solvents as granulating binders. Methods Herein, TSWG was carried out using Transcutol a non-volatile protic solvent as a granulating binder and dissolution enhancer of ibuprofen (IBU) blends with cellulose polymer grades (Pharmacoat ® 603, Affinisol™, and AQOAT ® ). Results The physicochemical characterisation of the produced granules showed excellent powder flow and the complete transformation of IBU into the amorphous state. Dissolution studies presented immediate release rates for all IBU formulations due to the high drug-polymer miscibility and the Transcutol solubilising capacity. Conclusions Overall, the study demonstrated an innovative approach for the development of extruded granules by processing water-insoluble APIs with non-volatile solvents for enhanced dissolution rates at high drug loadings.

    "abstract": "Cellulite (CLT) is one of the commonly known lipodystrophy syndromes affecting post-adolescent women worldwide. It is topographically characterized by an orange-peel, dimpled skin appearance hence, it is an unacceptable cosmetic problem. CLT can be modulated by surgical procedures such as; liposuction and mesotherapy. But, these options are invasive, expensive and risky. For these reasons, topical CLT treatments are more preferred. Caffeine (CA), is a natural alkaloid that is well-known for its prominent anti-cellulite effects. However, its hydrophilicity hinders its cutaneous permeation. Therefore, in the present study CA was loaded into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) by high shear homogenization/ultrasonication. CA-SLNs were prepared using Compritol® 888 ATO and stearic acid as solid lipids, and span 60 and brij™35, as lipid dispersion stabilizing agents. Formulation variables were adjusted to obtain entrapment efficiency (EE > 75%), particle size (PS < 350 nm), zeta potential (ZP < -25 mV) and polydispersity index (PDI < 0.5). CA-SLN-4 was selected and showed maximized EE (92.03 ± 0.16%), minimized PS (232.7 ± 1.90 nm), and optimum ZP (-25.15 ± 0.65 mV) and PDI values (0.24 ± 0.02). CA-SLN-4 showed superior CA release (99.44 ± 0.36%) compared to the rest CA-SLNs at 1 h. TEM analysis showed spherical, nanosized CA-SLN-4 vesicles. Con-LSM analysis showed successful CA-SLN-4 permeation transepidermally and via shunt diffusion. CA-SLN-4 incorporated into Noveon AA-1® hydrogel (CA-SLN-Ngel) showed accepted physical/rheological properties, and in vitro release profile. Histological studies showed that CA-SLN-Ngel significantly reduced mean subcutaneous fat tissue (SFT) thickness with 4.66 fold (p = 0.035) and 4.16 fold (p = 0.0001) compared to CA-gel, at 7th and 21st days, respectively. Also, significant mean SFT thickness reduction was observed compared to untreated group with 4.83 fold (p = 0.0005) and 3.83 fold (p = 0.0043), at 7th and 21st days, respectively. This study opened new avenue for CA skin delivery via advocating the importance of skin appendages. Hence, CA-SLN-Ngel could be a promising nanocosmeceutical gel for effective CLT treatment.",

The antimuscarinic Darifenacin hydrobromide (DRF) was selected as a model drug used to treat overactive bladder-associated nocturia. The DRF-SNE/SAC lyophilized tablet was prepared so that upon reconstitution a mixture of DRF-loaded cubic nanoparticles and nanoemulsion dispersion is obtained. The nanoemulsion portion is responsible for the fast release followed by controlled release of the remaining dose loaded in cubic nanoparticles. A comparative pharmacokinetic study adopting randomized crossover design in male albino rabbits versus marketed product Frequefenacine® tablet was performed. Half of the dose (52.05% ± 4.21%) was rapidly released in the first 4 h followed by sustained release of the remaining drug where (90.16% ± 8.85%) was released in 24 h. The tested system showed 2.45 folds higher % relative bioavailability and 1.57 folds higher C max with 1.62 longer residence time relative to reference product. The results endow the ability of the developed DRF-SNE/SAC lyophilized tablet to be considered as a propitious approach for the treatment of overactive bladder-associated nocturia without midnight dose administration.

    "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium stearate (MgSt) is a common tablet lubricant. As variations in MgSt properties are known to influence tablet attributes, the impact of MgSt fatty acid composition, particularly the significance of the stearate and palmitate contents, and its effects on tablet properties warrant further investigation. This study investigated the effect of MgSt with different stearate and palmitate contents but comparable physical properties (e.g. particle size, crystallinity, specific surface area and morphology) on lubrication performance and resulting tablet quality attributes, including mechanical strength, disintegratability and drug release. The influence of MgSt concentration and blending duration on the resulting tablet properties was also examined. Tablets produced using the lower stearate content MgSt had slightly higher tensile strength. The effect of MgSt stearate content was more apparent in the disintegration time and drug release, whereby MgSt of lower stearate content resulted in tablets with longer disintegration time and slower drug release. The lower stearate content also resulted in a lower lubrication performance, leading to a lesser reduction in tablet ejection force. As expected, a longer blending time of the tablet formulation blend with MgSt yielded tablets with reduced tensile strength, shorter disintegration time and slower drug release. Tablets with higher MgSt concentration showed a greater reduction in tensile strength, longer disintegration time and faster drug release. The study findings reinforced observations by other researchers and provided a better understanding of the fatty acid composition effects of MgSt on lubrication performance and the resulting tablet properties.

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this study was to assess the use of pMDI alone and pMDI with different spacers in asthmatic patients and to identify any associations between errors in handling the device for the first time and the sessions needed to reach the correct handling method, considering patient demographics and clinical characteristics. A total of 150 Asthmatic patients were crossed over to handle pMDI alone and with add-on inhalable devices (Aerochamber plus, Tips Haler, Able, Dispozable and Aer-8) randomly, without receiving verbal or demonstrative instruction (baseline assessment). The assessment of the inhaler technique was performed using checklists that had been set beforehand. Subsequently, the proper utilization of the inhaler was exhibited, and the patient's inhaler usage was reassessed. The demonstration was repeated until an optimal technique was attained. The number of counselling attempts required to achieve successful management, together with patient demographics and clinical factors, were documented. The mean percentage of total errors at baseline shows that pMDI alone is significantly higher than pMDI attached to add-on devices (53.90 ± 9.71, 32.54 ± 13.93, 24.53 ± 14.93, 21.6 ± 14.48, 25.14 ± 10.99, 27.47 ± 10.28) for pMDI alone, Aerochamber plus, Tips Haler, Able, Dispozable and Aer-8 respectively at p &lt; 0.01. Able and Tips Haler spacers are significantly lower than other spacers with pMDI and pMDI alone in terms of total sessions needed to attain the complete optimal handling technique at p &lt; 0.01. Weak and very weak correlations were observed between the percentage of total errors at baseline and the total sessions with education years, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and age as well as some demographics and clinical variables. Handling pMDI can be challenging however the introduction of spacers simplifies this procedure.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surface mineralization activity and in vitro drug behavior potential of two forms of mesoporous silica: powder and granulate. Ordered mesoporous SiO2 powder was synthesized by surfactant-assisted sol-gel process using tetraethoxysilane as a silica precursor and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as the structure-directing agent. The granulate was prepared using silica powder and ethyl cellulose as a binding agent. Metronidazole (MT)—an anti-inflammatory substance and doxorubicin hydrochloride (ChD)—an anti-cancer drug were chosen as drug models for delivery studies. The results of structural characteristic studies, utilizing transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nitrogen adsorption–desorption (BET) measurements, show that obtained materials have two-dimensional hexagonal p6mm symmetry, high specific surface area, narrow pore size, and a satisfactory mineralization behavior in the simulated body solution (SBF, pH = 7.4). The release rate of drugs depends upon the structural features of the drug molecules and the form of the carrier material. Of both the drugs analyzed, faster release was observed for small MT molecules characterized by weaker interactions with the carrier. In addition, the slower drug release was observed with granulate form due to increased diffusion barrier for drugs. Obtained results prove that the MT/ChD-loaded silica formulations could be attractive materials for filling bone defects and for local delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study used dual asymmetric centrifugation (DAC) to produce a topical vehicle for Pirfenidone (Pf; 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2[1H]-pyridone)—a Food and Drug Administration-approved antifibrotic drug indicated for idiopathic fibrosis treatment. Pf was loaded (8 wt%) in a poloxamer nanoemulsion gel (PNG) formulation consisting of water (47.8 wt%), triacetin (27.6 wt%), poloxamer 407 (P407, 13.8 wt%), polysorbate 80 (1.8 wt%), and benzyl alcohol (0.9 wt%). To our knowledge, poloxamer gels are typically processed with either high-shear methods or temperature regulation and have not been emulsified using DAC. Using a single-step emulsification process, 2 min mixed at 2500 RPM resulted in the lowest Pf loading variability with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.96% for a 1.5 g batch size. Batch sizes of 15 g and 100 g yield higher RSD of 4.18% and 3.05%, respectively, but still in compliance with USP guidelines. Ex vivo permeation in full thickness porcine skin after 24 h showed total Pf permeation of 404.90 ± 67.07 μg/cm 2 . Tested in vitro on human dermal fibroblasts stimulated with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), Pf-PNG resulted in a &gt; 2 fold decrease in α-SMA expression over vehicle control demonstrating that formulated Pf retained its biological activity. One-month stability testing at 25°C/60% relative humidity (RH) and 40°C/75% RH showed that % drug content, release kinetics, and biological activity were largely unchanged for both conditions; however, pH decreased from 6.7 to 5.5 (25°C/60% RH) and 4.5 (40°C/75% RH) after 1 month. Overall, these data demonstrate the utility of DAC to rapidly and reproducibly prepare lab-scale batches of emulsified gels for pharmaceutical formulation development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study was conducted to formulate buccal films consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly- N -hydroxyethyl-aspartamide (PHEA), to improve the dissolution of the drug through the oral mucosa. Ibuprofen sodium salt was used as a model drug, and the buccal film was expected to enhance its dissolution rate. Two different concentrations of PVA (5% w/v and 7.5% w/v) were used. Solvent casting was used to prepare films, where a solution consisting of drug and polymer was cast and allowed to dry. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to investigate the properties of films. In vitro dissolution studies were also conducted to investigate drug release. SEM studies showed that films containing a higher concentration of PVA had larger particles in microrange. FTIR studies confirmed the presence of the drug in films and indicated that ibuprofen sodium did not react with polymers. DSC studies confirmed the crystalline form of ibuprofen sodium when incorporated within films. In vitro dissolution studies found that the dissolution percentage of ibuprofen sodium alone was increased when incorporated within the film from 59 to 74%. This study led to the development of solid microcrystalline dispersion as a buccal film with a faster dissolution rate than the drug alone overcoming problem of poor solubility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Paediatric medicines are not always age-appropriate, causing problems with dosing, acceptability and adherence. The use of food and drinks as vehicles for medicine co-administration is common practice, yet the impact on drug bioavailability, safety and efficacy remains unaddressed. The aim of this study was to use in vitro dissolution testing, under infant simulating conditions, to evaluate the effect of co-administration with vehicles on the dissolution performance of two poorly soluble paediatric drugs. Dissolution studies of mesalazine and montelukast formulations were conducted with mini-paddle apparatus on a two-stage approach: simulated gastric fluid followed by addition of simulated intestinal fluid. The testing scenarios were designed to reflect daily administration practices: direct administration of formulation; formulation co-administered with food and drinks, both immediately after mixing and 4 h after mixing. Drug dissolution was significantly affected by medicine co-administration with vehicles, compared to the direct administration of formulation. Furthermore, differences were observed on drug dissolution when the formulations were mixed with different vehicles of the same subtype. The time between preparation and testing of the drug-vehicle mixture also impacted dissolution behaviour. Drug dissolution was shown to be significantly affected by the physicochemical properties and composition of the vehicles, drug solubility in each vehicle and drug/formulation characteristics. Ultimately, in this study, we show the potential of age-appropriate in vitro dissolution testing as a useful biopharmaceutical tool for estimating drug dissolution in conditions relevant to the paediatric population. The setup developed has potential to evaluate the impact of medicine co-administration with vehicles on paediatric formulation performance.",

    "abstract": "Biologics manufacturing technology has made great progress in the last decade. One of the most promising new technologies is the single-use system, which has improved the efficiency of biologics manufacturing processes. To ensure safety of biologics when employing such single-use systems in the manufacturing process, various issues need to be considered including possible extractables/leachables and particles arising from the components used in single-use systems. Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers, together with single-use suppliers, members of the academia and regulatory authorities have discussed the risks of using single-use systems and established control strategies for the quality assurance of biologics. In this study, we describe approaches for quality risk management when employing single-use systems in the manufacturing of biologics. We consider the potential impact of impurities related to single-use components on drug safety and the potential impact of the single-use system on other critical quality attributes as well as the stable supply of biologics. We also suggest a risk-mitigating strategy combining multiple control methods which includes the selection of appropriate single-use components, their inspections upon receipt and before releasing for use and qualification of single-use systems. Communication between suppliers of single-use systems and the users, as well as change controls in the facilities both of suppliers and users, are also important in risk-mitigating strategies. Implementing these control strategies can mitigate the risks attributed to the use of single-use systems. This study will be useful in promoting the development of biologics as well as in ensuring their safety, quality and stable supply.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in molded vial manufacturing enabled manufacturers to use a new manufacturing technique to achieve superior homogeneity of the vial wall thickness. This study evaluated the influence of the different manufacturing techniques of molded vials and glass compositions on vial heat transfer in freeze-drying. Additionally, the influence of using empty vials as thermal shielding on thermal characteristics of edge and center vials was investigated. The vial heat transfer coefficient K v was determined gravimetrically for multiple vial systems. The results showed superior heat transfer characteristics of the novel manufacturing technique as well as differences in heat transfer for the different glass compositions. Empty vials on the outside of the array did not influence center vial K v values compared to a full array. The direct contact area and vial bottom curvature and their correlation to heat transfer parameters were analyzed across multiple vial systems. A new approach based on light microscopy to describe the vial bottom curvature more accurately was described. The presented results for the contact area allowed for an approximation of the pressure-independent heat transfer parameter KC. The results for the vial bottom curvature showed a great correlation to the pressure-dependent heat transfer parameter KD. Overall, the results highlighted how a thorough geometrical characterization of vials with known heat transfer characteristics could be used to predict thermal characteristics of new vial systems as an alternative to a time-consuming gravimetric K v determination. Primary drying times were simulated to show the influence of K v on drying performance.",

    "abstract": "Solubility determination of poorly water-soluble drugs is pivotal for formulation scientists when they want to develop a liquid formulation. Performing such a test with different ratios of cosolvents with water is time-consuming and costly. The scarcity of solubility data for poorly water-soluble drugs increases the importance of developing correlation and prediction equations for these mixtures. Therefore, the aim of the current research is to determine the solubility of acetylsalicylic acid in binary mixtures of ethanol+water at 25 and 37°C. Acetylsalicylic acid is non-stable in aqueous solutions and readily hydrolyze to salicylic acid. So, the solubility of acetylsalicylic acid is measured in ethanolic mixtures by HPLC to follow the concentration of produced salicylic acid as well. Moreover, the solubility of acetylsalicylic acid is modeled using different cosolvency equations. The measured solubility data were also predicted using PC-SAFT EOS model. DSC results ruled out any changes in the polymorphic form of acetylsalicylic acid after the solubility test, whereas XRPD results showed some changes in crystallinity of the precipitated acetylsalicylic acid after the solubility test. Fitting the solubility data to the different cosolvency models showed that the mean relative deviation percentage for the Jouyban-Acree model was less than 10.0% showing that this equation is able to obtain accurate solubility data for acetylsalicylic acid in mixtures of ethanol and water. Also, the predicted data with an average mean relative deviation percentage (MRD%) of less than 29.65% show the capability of the PC-SAFT model for predicting solubility data. A brief comparison of the solubilities of structurally related solutes to acetylsalicylic acid was also provided.",

In order to meet these and other critical quality attributes (CQAs), quality by design is encouraged. According to this approach, formulation and compression process factors were systematically studied using design of experiments (Plackett-Burman for screening purposes, full and fractional factorial design for in-depth characterization) to understand their influence on CQAs of orodispersible minitablets containing melatonin. Mathematical models describing the relationships between processing variables and attributes such as resistance to crushing and disintegration time were successfully developed, characterized by high coefficients of determination (R2adj = 0.90-0.97) and prediction errors in the range (+2.4 to -10.8%). In conclusion, based on these models, the design space was created for melatonin ODMTs, ensuring the product's quality and process robustness. Moreover, the study demonstrated the suitability of texture analysis as an alternative to compendial measurement methods of resistance to crushing and disintegration time. Graphical abstract.",

    "abstract": "Hypericum perforatum (HP) is characterized by potent medicinal activity. However, the poor water solubility of many HP constituents limits their therapeutic effectiveness. Self-nanoemulsifying self-nanosuspension loaded with HP (HP.SNESNS) was formulated to improve the bioefficacy of HP. It was prepared using 10% triacetin, 57% Tween 20, and 33% PEG 400 and then incorporated with HP extract (100 mg/mL). HP.SNESNS demonstrated a bimodal size distribution (258.65 ± 29.35 and 9.08 ± 0.01 nm) corresponding to nanosuspension and nanoemulsion, respectively, a zeta potential of -8.03 mV, and an enhanced dissolution profile. Compared to the unformulated HP (100 mg/kg), HP.SNESNS significantly improved cardiac functions by decreasing the serum myocardial enzymes, nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) as well as restoring the heart tissue's normal architecture. Furthermore, it ameliorates anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and cognitive dysfunction by decreasing brain TNF-α, elevating neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and serotonin), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition, HP.SNESNS augmented the immunohistochemical expression of cortical and hippocampal glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels while downregulating the cortical Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression levels. Surprisingly, these protective activities were comparable to the HP (300 mg/kg). In conclusion, HP.SNESNS (100 mg/kg) exerted antidepressant and cardioprotective activities in the post-MI depression rat model.",

It is claimed that these principles make the elimination in the liver and kidney more straight forward to model and provide a rationale for understanding why sometimes during bioavailability studies one arrives at bioavailability values greater than 100%. In this paper it will be shown that these claims are based on incorrect translations of the Kirchhoff’s Laws to pharmacokinetics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lung inflammation is a hallmark of several respiratory diseases. Despite the great effectiveness of the synthetic antiinflammatory agents, they cause potential side effects. Polydatin (PD), a natural phytomedicine, has antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects. Its clinical applications are hindered due to poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and rapid metabolism by first-pass effect. Herein, we report the development of a novel chitosan oligosaccharide-coated PD-loaded Poly dl-lactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles (COS-coated PD/PLGA NPs) against a bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation in a rat model. The NPs exhibited a small particle size of 188.57 ± 5.68 nm and a high zeta potential of + 18.13 ± 2.75 mV with spherical architecture and sustained release pattern of PD. In vivo studies in bleomycin-induced lung inflammation in a rat model revealed the superior prophylactic activity of COS-coated PD/PLGA NPs over the free drug (PD) as demonstrated by histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses, alongside biochemical assays evaluating oxidative stress biomarkers and inflammatory cytokine levels. Overall, the optimized COS-coated PD/PLGA NPs formulation offers a promising prophylactic platform against many respiratory diseases. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lipid based nanocarriers are a commonly used drug delivery system with cargos ranging from small molecules to complex RNA-based therapies. There are several hypotheses how such carriers can enter the cell, in which organelles they reside, and how they cross or escape the endo-lysosomal system. To provide additional insights, the cell-nanocarrier interplay was visualized exemplarily with lipid-based nanocarriers and macrophage-like cultured cells (J774A.1 cells) using high resolution electron microscopy. Nanocarrier uptake into J774A.1 cells was detectable after the first 15 min by intracellular accumulation of electron-dense material. These accumulations were identified as lysosomes and lipid droplets, indicating complete degradation and a subsequent formation of storage organelles as early as 15 min. Inhibition of lysosomal acid lipase did not block lipid droplet formation, but rather resulted in accumulation of lipid droplets within lysosomes. This suggests that other cellular lipases already degrade acylglycerols before they reach lysosomes. Chloroquine co-treatment allowed visualization of nanocarriers inside endosomal vesicles, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery blockage, the most common cardiovascular problem, is often treated with drug-eluting stents (DES). This study aims to address the main limitation of traditional angioplasty therapy. Thus, designing, fabricating, and analyzing a novel drug-eluting polymeric stent using liquid crystal display (LCD) technology may potentially represent an innovative approach to DES in the near future. Therefore, a poly (lactic acid) (PLA) based 3D-printed stent was designed using SolidWorks software and fabricated using the liquid crystal display (LCD) method. The cyclosporine-loaded stent was prepared and analyzed using optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Loading efficiency percentage and release characteristics were estimated. The polymeric stent platform was successfully designed and manufactured using PLA resin. Based on the characterization of cyclosporine eluting stent, a loading efficiency of 48.66 ± 5.92% was estimated through the immersion method. The FTIR and DSC results confirmed molecular interactions between cyclosporine and the PLA-based 3D-printed stent compared with physical mixture formulations. A sustained release profile of cyclosporine was also observed where approximately 50% of the drug was released within the first three hours. The sustained-release profile, characterized by the absence of a burst release, holds significant clinical potential by ensuring consistent therapeutic levels, reducing side effects, and potentially improving patient outcomes. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of LCD technology in printing the stent platform using PLA resin. The results demonstrated a significant cyclosporine loading with a sustained release profile without any stent coating procedure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study aims to develop and characterize cannabidiol (CBD) solid dispersions using Vacuum Compression Molding (VCM) to enhance the drug solubility and release profile. Solid dispersions of CBD and polymers were processed using VCM at 130 °C for 4 min after a prior physical mixing. Five percent w/w of CBD was used with 5% w/w of poloxamer 188 and 90% w/w of polymeric carrier (Polyethylene Oxide, PEO-N80 or Hydroxypropyl cellulose, HPCEF). Discs were collected and milled to obtain formulations (F1V, F2V). The degradation temperature of CBD was determined using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The formulations were further characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). In vitro dissolution testing of pure CBD and formulations was evaluated using USP apparatus II. TGA showed that CBD degradation occurs after 200 °C. FTIR spectra of formulations indicate potential interactions between the drug and polymers. DSC thermograms of F1V showed a thermal peak at 65 °C that could correspond to PEO-N80. F2V did not show any of the thermal event peaks, which suggests the conversion of the drug to the amorphous state. Images from the SEM showed irregular surfaces for both formulations. The release profile showed an increase in the CBD dissolution rate by 4.75 folds for F1V and 3.63 folds for F2V in four hours. In this study, solid dispersions of CBD formulations were successfully achieved. The VCM technology has proven to be successful in formulating solid dispersions of CBD for early-stage drug development. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis is a serious life-threatening hereditary disease that occurs due to a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Ivacaftor (IVA) is a drug that targets the mutated CFTR protein. IVA is highly hydrophobic (log P = 5.6) with poor aqueous solubility (0.05 µg/mL) and is formulated as an amorphous solid dispersion tablet under the brand name Kalydeco®. The recommended daily dose of Kalydeco® is twice per day with a high fat meal to aid in IVA's absorption. In this research, we studied the application of cyclodextrins (CDs) to improve the dissolution of IVA. Phase solubility studies between IVA and four different CDs (α-, β-, γ-, and hydroxypropyl-β-CD [HP-β-CD]) were conducted and a significant improvement in IVA's aqueous solubility with HP-β-CD was observed. Solid state characterizations confirmed the formation of IVA/HP-β-CD inclusion complexes. In vitro dissolution studies were conducted at pH = 6.8 and showed improvement in IVA's rate and extent of dissolution with IVA/HP-β-CD (1:2) complexes in comparison to uncomplexed IVA. In vivo pharmacokinetics in mice showed a 2-fold increase in area under the curve (AUC) after the oral administration of the IVA/HP-β-CD complex in comparison to Kalydeco tablets. In addition, HP-β-CD extended the release of IVA from the IVA/HP-β-CD complexes with a longer Tmax of 7.05 h compared to 2.96 h with Kalydeco® tablets. These results demonstrate that CD inclusion complexes of IVA using HP-β-CD can be a successful alternative approach to improving the solubility of IVA while extending its release.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present work examines the in vitro drug delivery performance of degradable microspheres (DrugMic) composed of a crosslinked hydrogel of poly(ethylene glycol), with particular interest on the effect of e-beam sterilization on the stability of loaded active substances , i.e. niflumic acid (14% w/w), tadalafil (7% w/w), travoprost (0.2% w/w), buprenorphine (1.4% w/w), teicoplanin (6% w/w), and polymyxin B (5.6% w/w). Drug loading was performed on preformed microspheres degradable in 3 days, 1 or 2 weeks. Drugs were loaded onto microspheres (50–100 µm or 500–700 µm) via 1 h room-temperature incubation. After freeze-drying, drug-loaded microspheres were sterilized using e-beam irradiation (15 or 25 kGy). In vitro drug releases were done in PBS, drug elution profiles and radiostability were assessed by RP-HPLC with diode array detection. Following irradiation, DrugMic delivered niflumic acid and tadalafil for 3 days, teicoplanin and polymyxin B for 1 week, buprenorphine and travoprost for 2 weeks from microspheres degradable in 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks. Radiolysis was observed in each fraction collected during buprenorphine (0.7–20%) and travoprost (1.8–139%) release, while the HPLC profiles of polymyxin B were completely altered, indicating substantial degradation. Niflumic acid, tadalafil and teicoplanin showed no signs of radiolysis. Extemporaneous loading of buprenorphine and polymyxin B onto sterilized microspheres was attempted to avoid radiolysis. The sustained release profiles were maintained without degrading the drug. DrugMic appears to be a suitable platform for sustained drug release. The loading mode can be adapted according to the stability of the drug to irradiation. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Improving nasal spray use experience is typically not addressed as a key product requirement even though sensations of bitterness, sourness, astringency, or burning after intranasal application can cause significant repulsion, consumer non-compliance from recommended usage and product rejection. Extensive studies have been carried out by academia and industry alike into the formulation characteristics of sprays and consumer preferences to make nasal sprays more “acceptable” by patients. Due to lack of a collative synopsis of these works, this review article attempts to gather and summarize these studies, address the various attributes that impact post spray experience, and provide suggestions towards maximizing user compliance. We systematically categorized a range of factors which can contribute to unpleasant experiences using nasal sprays including anatomical characteristics of the nose, formulation and device properties, formulation components and dosages, etc. Furthermore, we collated relevant information from pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical domains to create a comprehensive knowledge base to frame the scope of the issue. Unpleasant sensorial attributes can be controlled by designing the formulation with a thorough understanding of product-device interactions and novel use of excipients. By choosing excipients such as taste masking agents, flavors, and novel polymers the behavior of the product in the nasal canal can be modulated to block the burning, astringent or bitterness sensation on spray use.

    "abstract": "Abstract NanoCubes loaded film-forming spray (NanoCuboSpray) is a new formulation that can be explored for nanoscale drug delivery. In the present work, epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) was encapsulated into NanoCuboSpray (NCS) for oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) treatment. The newly formulated EGCG NCS is then evaluated for ex vivo permeation, drug retention, in vivo efficacy, and safety. The developed formulation was homogeneous, viscous, spreadable and mucoadhesive on the buccal mucosa. EGCG NCS had good permeation and buccal mucosal retention in the ex vivo studies. The NCS with 81.81 mg/kg EGCG dose significantly enhanced mouth opening and effectively upregulated collagen and downregulated TGF-β1 in rats with areca nut extract-induced OSF. EGCG NCS demonstrated better improvements in histopathological and antioxidant parameters compared to EGCG hydrogel and betamethasone injection (BTM Inj.). In the safety evaluation, NCS treatment had negligible changes in histopathological features and serum biochemical markers, maintaining results comparable to the normal control group. Therefore, the optimized NCS presents a safer alternative strategy for treating OSF and holds the potential for further evaluation of its clinical efficacy. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Luteolin (LUT) is a brilliant anti-inflammatory drug having a potential role in wound healing. Nevertheless, its clinical application is inadequate due to its hydrophobicity and poor skin permeation. Pressure ulcers are chronic wounds that have limited and definite treatments. This work aimed to develop a LUT-zein nanocomposite in a bioactive polymeric scaffold as a topical treatment for pressure ulcer wounds by assessing its effect on the pressure ulcers' immune microenvironment. LUT loaded scaffolds were prepared and evaluated regarding particle size, zeta potential, swelling &amp; erosion capacity. Structure elucidation was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The scaffold (F6) that utilized hyaluronic acid (HA) and sodium alginate (SA) in a concentration of 4:1 revealed the most promising results and it was selected for the in vivo studies. The scaffold (F6) showed a nanosize (240.00 ± 8.54 nm) and a negative ZP (-38.2 ± 2.49 mV). SEM revealed a vastly porous structure in both cross-sections and surface views. In vivo wound healing potential and histological study were evaluated using male Sprague Dawley rats. This is the first study to design LUT-Zn nanpcomposite loaded in HA/SA scaffolds to enhance healing rate and decrease ulcer formation. The selected scaffold showed superior efficacy in modulating the immune microenvironment of the pressure ulcer wound in-vivo as it significantly inhibited IL17A secretion, upregulated IL13 and VEGF, increased miRNA-223 expression, and reduced cell apoptosis within the wound microenvironment, making it a promising treatment for chronic pressure ulcers. The elaborated F6 scaffold could be considered as a talented nanotherapy for enhanced pressure ulcer healing and wound closure rate .",

    "abstract": "Bio-ionic liquid (BIL)-based ionogels have been researched for improved solubility, permeability, and bioavailability of poorly soluble drug/s. This study aimed to develop a thermoreversible ionogel for nose-to-brain delivery (NBD) of Tetrabenazine hydrochloride (TBZ), a BCS Class IV drug. Initially, a BIL-based micellar system of TBZ was developed using choline oleate ([Cho][Ole]) and decorated with Pluronic F-127 (PF-127). Further, the micellar system was formulated as a thermoreversible ionogel and optimized using central composite design (CCD). The resulting TBZ-[Cho][Ole]-PF-127, an optimized ionogel was evaluated for drug loading, particle size, polydispersity, zeta potential, morphology, pH, gelation behavior, mucoadhesive strength, and drug release (in vitro and ex vivo). All ionogel batches exhibited suitable physicochemical characteristics for NBD. TBZ-[Cho][Ole] micelles demonstrated a particle size of 94.23 ± 0.76 nm, whereas the optimized ionogel exhibited a size of 164.98 ± 0.89 nm, significantly smaller than the plain gel (247.65 ± 1.93 nm) at p < 0.05. The optimized ionogel showed a zeta potential of -38.12 ± 1.64 mV, drug loading of 37.92 ± 1.45%, and entrapment efficiency of 83.12 ± 2.53%. SEM and TEM studies confirmed that spherical micelles have the desired particle size. Ionogel in vitro and ex vivo evaluations divulged 1.37-fold and 1.42-fold enhancements in drug release and permeation, respectively, over plain gel (p < 0.05), following zero-order kinetics. Short-term stability studies further confirmed the robustness of the formulation. Conclusively, the ionogel demonstrated improved delivery of TBZ, opening up the vista of BIL and ionogel customizability for NBD for diverse drug/s used in the management of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing interest in transdermal drug delivery systems has led to the exploration of novel methods to enhance skin permeability and drug bioavailability. In this study, the effects of various electromagnetic fields (EMF) configurations on the physicochemical properties and transdermal performance of ketoprofen, a commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, were investigated. Ketoprofen samples were exposed for 8 hours to oscillating, pulsed, static (positive and negative polarity), and rotating magnetic fields. Subsequent analyses included FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, thermal stability, aqueous solubility, lipophilicity (log P), skin permeability (measured using Franz diffusion cells), and accumulation in porcine skin. The results showed that, while the molecular structure of ketoprofen remained unchanged, exposure to a magnetic field induced subtle changes in the crystal structure, thermal behaviour, solubility, and lipophilicity properties. Among all tested conditions, pulsed magnetic fields (particularly PMF 10/10) and rotating fields (RMF 50 Hz) significantly improved both transdermal permeation and dermal accumulation. These enhancements correlated with increased solubility, suggesting that EMFs may modulate molecular interactions with biological barriers. In contrast, static fields with negative polarity reduced the transport and retention of drugs in skin tissue. This study confirms the potential of electromagnetic stimulation as a non-invasive and effective strategy for enhancing the dermal delivery of poorly permeable active substances, such as ketoprofen. Optimization of EMF parameters may provide a promising direction for the development of advanced transdermal drug delivery systems. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Voriconazole, a potent antifungal agent, has emerged as a promising candidate for managing vulvovaginal candidiasis. The market availability of voriconazole as tablets or injections, along with potential side effects, highlights the need for a successful alternative delivery system. Through comprehensive experimental design, voriconazole-loaded spanlastics were developed using a 3 2 -factorial design. The optimized system based on factorial outcomes exhibited desirable characteristics in terms of entrapment efficiency (74.31 ± 0.39%), vesicle size (246.4 ± 2.2 nm), polydispersibility index (0.369 ± 0.01), &amp; zeta potential (-37.5 ± 0.17 mV). Further characterization for the optimized system was performed in terms of transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in-vitro antifungal assessment, where the latter showcased the potent effectiveness of voriconazole against various Candida species. Moreover, the integration of the optimized voriconazole-loaded spanlastic system into a gel was implemented for the assessment of ex-vivo permeation through the vaginal mucosa of rats, where the optimized system gel revealed a remarkable 1.3-fold enhancement in permeation relevant to the control VCZ gel. Notably, the clinical performance of optimized system gel was involved in a randomized controlled study for assessment of safety and efficacy in comparison to a market product (Canesten ® 2% clotrimazole). Clinical evaluation revealed that the optimized VCZ-loaded SP gel and the market product, Canesten. (2% clotrimazole) exhibited comparable efficacy in terms of clinical satisfaction, side effects, and time to clinical cure from VVC. These findings highlight the potential of the optimized system as a promising approach for improved treatment outcomes in women with vaginal candidiasis with no adverse effects. Graphical Abstract",

Gabapentin, commonly used for neuropathic pain, offers therapeutic potential but necessitates careful dosing due to its variable bioavailability. This study investigates the integration of Hot Melt Extrusion and Fused Deposition Modeling in the development of polycaprolactone-based implants for sustained release of Gabapentin. A preliminary screening using Vacuum Compression Molding optimized formulations for Hot Melt Extrusion, enhancing material efficiency and process streamlining. Filaments with a diameter of 1.75 mm were successfully extruded and used for 3D printing of Gabapentin implants. Several tests were undertaken to characterize the prepared filaments and implants. Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the uniform distribution of Gabapentin within the implant matrix. Solid-state characterization techniques were employed to assess the compatibility of implant components and to verify the solid-state of Gabapentin within the implant structure. In vitro drug release studies were conducted. Filaments with varying drug loadings were examined, revealing that a 20% w/w drug loading achieved an optimal balance between rapid and sustained release. Additionally, implants with different infill densities were analyzed, demonstrating that varying infill densities allow control over the amount and percentage of drug released. The 100% infill density resulted in the most sustained release effect, achieving approximately 40% drug release by day 28. These findings underscore the feasibility of 3D printing for producing personalized implants, emphasizing the potential for tailored drug release profiles to meet specific needs of pediatric patients.

    "abstract": "Abstract Roller compaction is often utilized as the first step to improve flow properties and homogeneity of pharmaceutical mixtures. Since the dry granulation process is less complicated than its counterparts in the industry, it is possible to perform screening experiments readily to investigate granulate quality for further operations. In this study, the aim of the investigation focused on the effect of roller compaction on the dissolution of granules and tablets of two pharmaceutical formulations that contain APIs of different biopharmaceutical classification. This study underscores the benefits of granule dissolution testing as a crucial early-stage technique for optimizing granulate quality and facilitating progression through formulation manufacturing operations. For active pharmaceutical ingredients characterized by poor dissolution properties, this approach provides valuable insights during the initial development phases. By integrating granule dissolution testing into the development process, product manufacturability can be enhanced and optimal product performance can be ensured. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine developed by the University of Oxford (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) showed good stability when stored in refrigerator. However, the vaccine manufacturer prefers its transportation in frozen condition. Data regarding the stability of the vaccine after exposure to repeated freezing processes have not been explored yet. In the present study, different batches were exposed to 3 repeated freezing/thawing cycles. An orthogonal testing using various techniques was employed to assess any induced changes in the properties of the vaccine in comparison with control samples. Physicochemical properties, including appearance, pH, and molecular size distribution by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were evaluated. Anion-exchange chromatography (AEC) was used for the determination of virus particles, and DNA to-protein ratio to study the biochemical attributes of the vaccine. Furthermore, the immunological properties were evaluated employing in-vivo test to compare the results obtained by the testing protocol to the vaccine efficiency in animals. Results revealed that the physicochemical attributes of the vaccine were not affected by the applied freeze–thaw cycles. Although the virus particles measured for thawed samples by AEC were below the specified limits of 0.7 – 1.3 × 10 11 VP/mL, the values of DNA to protein ratio remained unaffected (1.1 – 1.5), and there was no reduction in the in vivo potency of the tested samples. Statistical analysis of the results of the quantitative tests implied that the vaccine could withstand up to three successive freezing and thawing cycles during transportation without significant loss in its structural integrity and biological potency.

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of dry powder inhalers (DPIs) for pulmonary drug delivery is complex, requiring optimization of variable factors to ensure effective lung deposition. This study investigates the factors influencing the dispersibility of glycopyrronium bromide (GLP) and indacaterol maleate (IND) in adhesive mixtures using both in vitro and in silico approaches. The formulation was designed to match the reference listed drug (RLD), using lactose and magnesium stearate as excipients. Key variables examined included mixing energy, carrier particle size distribution (PSD), and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) particle size characteristics across multiple suppliers. A Next Generation Impactor (NGI) was employed to assess the aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) of 67 formulations. The collected impactor data were analyzed using machine learning (ML) models, leveraging the h2o AutoML framework. Stacked ensemble models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (R 2 : 0.940 for GLP, 0.969 for IND), identifying key formulation parameters affecting dispersibility. SHAP analysis revealed that GLP dispersibility was influenced primarily by GLP PSD (d90, d50, SPAN), lactose d10, and mixing energy, while IND was more dependent on lactose PSD and its own particle size. The findings confirm that both APIs interact with each other within the formulation, significantly impacting their reciprocal deposition profiles. These insights highlight the challenge of developing bioequivalent DPI formulations and emphasize the importance of PSD control, mixing energy optimization, and advanced ML modeling in predicting therapeutic equivalence. The study provides a predictive framework to support the development of generic inhalation products, improving regulatory approval pathways and ensuring effective pulmonary drug delivery.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the influence of phospholipid saturation by comparing hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) and egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EPC) on the physicochemical characteristics, colloidal stability, drug release behavior and antioxidant activity of quercetin-loaded ceramide-containing liposomes for topical delivery. Liposomes composed of EPC:Cer:Que and HSPC:Cer:Que were prepared by thin-film hydration followed by sonication. The nanosystems were studied for particle size, polydispersity index, ζ-potential, and entrapment efficiency. Colloidal stability was evaluated under mechanical stress, accelerated aging, and long-term storage, while in vitro drug release, drug retention, and antioxidant activity were assessed under simulated skin conditions. Incorporation of ceramides into EPC bilayer reduced stability issues associated with unsaturated phospholipids and maintained a fluid structure, promoting drug release. Both formulations exhibited enhanced colloidal stability with EPC-based liposomes maintaining their properties at all conditions, whereas HSPC-based liposomes showed increased particle size following mechanical stress. HSPC-based liposomes demonstrated higher quercetin entrapment efficiency (63 ± 5%), improved retention over time (75% at 90 days), and a more sustained release (45% at 480 min). EPC-based ceramide-containing liposomes exhibited faster release (50% at 240 min), resulting in greater antioxidant activity as indicated by DPPH assay (0.474 ascorbic acid equivalents), while FRAP assay results were comparable for both formulations (0.012 Fe 2+ equivalents), indicating consistent ferric reducing potential after release. These findings highlight the significance of phospholipid composition in liposome behavior and provide insights into the design of stable and effective ceramide-containing nanosystems for topical delivery of poorly water-soluble compounds such as quercetin, with potential applications in managing photoaging, inflammation, and wound healing.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cancer remains one of the most significant global health challenges, with its burden continuing to rise. The limitations of conventional anticancer therapies caused by the lack of tissue selectivity, demands urgent development of safer and more selective therapies to target tumors. Identifying the fundamental cancer hallmarks provided a comprehensive understanding of cancer biology for effective tumor targeting, encompassing tumor-promoting inflammation, metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, genomic instability, phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic reprogramming, and polymorphic microbiomes. Moreover, drug repurposing is a cost-effective and time-saving method for cancer therapy that accelerates the drug discovery process by reusing drugs for new indications. Current research is focusing on combining drug repurposing with nanocarriers that enhance tumor targeting, reduce the side effects, and improve the bioavailability of the drug in a single nanoformulation. This article analyzes various types of nanoparticles encapsulating different classes of drugs, such as phenelzine, fexofenadine, telmisartan, losartan, metformin, canagliflozin, atorvastatin, and fenbendazole, highlighting their anticancer effects and the influence of nanocarriers on the drug’s therapeutic effect. Results revealed that drug-encapsulated nanoparticles enhanced antitumor effects compared to the free drug solutions. This is attributed to the synergism from the nanocarrier’s functionalization, sustained drug release, and improved cellular uptake within tumors that leads to targeting multiple cancer hallmarks. Additionally, this review highlights the present challenges in the clinical translation of nanoformulation and demonstrates how artificial intelligence may facilitate drug screening and identification, therapeutic optimization, and large-scale manufacture. Finally, using these technologies in combination with drug repurposing presents a promising direction for advancing cancer treatment. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Famotidine suffers from low oral bioavailability due to poor aqueous solubility, short half-life, and limited gastric retention. This study aimed to develop gastro-retentive floating tablets of famotidine using hot-melt extrusion (HME) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing approach to enhance its solubility, prolong gastric residence, and achieve extended drug release. Famotidine was incorporated into various polymeric carriers, including hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC LF) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC E5), to produce drug-loaded filaments using an 11 mm twin-screw co-rotating extruder. The filaments were subsequently 3D-printed into low-density, hollow tablets to achieve prolonged gastric floatation. The solid-state characterization by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed the absence of famotidine’s crystalline melting peak in both filaments and 3D-printed tablets, suggesting amorphization within the polymer matrix. FTIR spectroscopy indicated hydrogen bonding interactions between famotidine and polymer hydroxyl groups, supporting the stabilization of the solid dispersion. The lead formulation demonstrated excellent buoyancy of about nine hours and extended drug release in 0.1 N HCl, confirming the potential of the system for extended gastric retention. This work highlights the utility of HME-FDM 3D printing for developing tailored, gastro-retentive dosage forms that enhance the performance of poorly soluble drugs like famotidine through amorphous solid dispersion and formulation-driven design.

    "abstract": "Capsule-based dry powder inhaler (DPI) products can be influenced by a multitude of interacting factors, including electrostatic charging. Tribo-charging is a process of charge transfer impacted by various factors, i.e., material surface characteristics, mechanical properties, processing parameters and environmental conditions. Consequently, this work aimed to assess how the charging behavior of capsules intended for inhalation might be influenced by environmental conditions. Capsules having different chemical compositions (gelatin and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)) and distinct inherent characteristics from manufacturing (thermally and cold-gelled) were exposed to various environmental conditions (11%, 22% and 51% RH). Their resulting properties were characterized and tribo-charging behavior was measured against stainless steel and PVC. It was observed that all capsule materials tended to charge to a higher extent when in contact with PVC. The tribo-charging of the thermally gelled HPMC capsules (Vcaps® Plus) was more similar to the gelatin capsules (Quali-G™-I) than to their HPMC cold-gelled counterparts (Quali-V®-I). The sorption of water by the capsules at different relative humidities notably impacted their properties and tribo-charging behavior. Different interactions between the tested materials and water molecules were identified and are proposed to be the driver of distinct charging behaviors. Finally, we showed that depending on the capsule types, distinct environmental conditions are necessary to mitigate charging and assure optimal behavior of the capsules.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to develop a PAT strategy for the supervision of hot melt coating processes. Optical fibers were placed at various positions in the process chamber of a fluid bed device. Experiments were performed to determine the most suitable position for in-line process monitoring, taking into account such requirements as a good signal to noise ratio, the mitigation of dead zones, the ability to monitor the product over the entire process, and reproducibility. The experimental evidence suggested that the position at medium fluid bed height, looking towards the center, i.e., normal to particle movement, proved to be the most reliable position. In this study, the advantages of multipoint monitoring are shown, and an in-line-implementation was created. This enabled the real-time supervision of the process, including the fast detection of inhomogeneities and disturbances in the process chamber, and the compensation of sensor malfunction. In addition, a model for estimating the particle size distribution via NIR was successfully created. This ensures that the quality of the product and the endpoint of the coating process can be determined correctly.",

A long-term stability study was also carried out on the bacteria in the fibers. Effect of storage conditions (temperature, presence of oxygen) and growth conditions on the bacterial viability in the fibers was investigated. The viability of the sporulated anaerobic bacteria in the fibers was maintained during 12 months of room temperature storage in the presence of oxygen. Direct compression was used to prepare tablets from the produced bacteria-containing fibers after milling (using an oscillating mill) and mixing with tableting excipients, making easy oral administration of the bacteria possible. No significant decrease was observed in bacterial viability following the processing of the fibers (milling and tableting).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The two main components of starch — amylose and amylopectin, are responsible for its interaction with moisture. This study investigated how moisture sorption properties of the starches with different amylose-amylopectin ratio impacted tablet properties including drug stability. The starch samples were equilibrated to 33, 53, and 75% relative humidity (RH) and then assessed for tabletability, compactibility, and yield pressure. Effect of humidity on viscoelastic recovery was also evaluated. Tabletability and compactibility of high-amylose starch were better than that of high-amylopectin starch at 33 and 53% RH. However, at 75% RH, the reverse was observed. In terms of yield pressure, high-amylose starch had lower yield pressure than high-amylopectin starch. High-amylose starch tablets also exhibited lower extent of viscoelastic recovery than high-amylopectin starch tablets. The variations in the tableting properties were found to be related to relative locality of the sorbed moisture. Degradation of acetylsalicylic acid in high-amylose starch tablets at 75% RH, 40°C was less than the tablets with high-amylopectin starch. This observation could be attributed to the greater amount of water molecules binding sites in high-amylose starch. Furthermore, most of the sorbed moisture of high-amylose starch was internally absorbed moisture, therefore limiting the availability of diffusible sorbed moisture for degradation reaction. Findings from this study could provide better insights on the influence of amylose-amylopectin ratio on tableting properties and stability of moisture-sensitive drugs. This is of particular importance as starch is a common excipient in solid dosage forms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to formulate and optimize solid-dispersion of meloxicam (MX) employing response-surface-methodology (RSM). RSM allowed identification of the main effects and interactions between studied factors on MX dissolution and acceleration of the optimization process. 3 3 full factorial design with 27 different formulations was proposed. Effects of drug loading percentage (A), carriers’ ratio (B), method of preparation (C), and their interactions on percent MX dissolved after 10 and 30 min (Q 10min &amp; Q 30min ) from fresh and stored samples were studied in distilled water. The considered levels were 2.5%, 5.0%, and 7.5% (factor A), three ratios of Soluplus®/Poloxamer-407 (factor B). Physical mixture (PM), fusion method (FM), and hot-melt-extrusion (HME) were considered factor (C). Stability studies were carried out for 3 months under stress conditions. The proposed optimization design was validated by 3-extra checkpoints formulations. The optimized formulation was selected via numerical optimization and investigated by DSC, XRD, PLM, and in vitro dissolution study. Results showed that HME technique gave the highest MX dissolution rate compared to other techniques (FM &amp; PM). At constant level of factor (C), the amount of MX dissolved increased by decreasing MX loading and increasing Soluplus in carriers’ ratio. Actual responses of the optimized formulation were in close consistency with predicted data. Amorphous form of MX in the optimized formulation was proved by DSC, XRD, and PLM. Selected factors and their levels of the optimization design were significantly valuable for demonstrating and adapting the expected formulation characteristics for rapid dissolution of MX (Q 10min = 89.09%) from fresh and stored samples.

    "abstract": "NIR spectroscopy is a non-destructive characterization tool for the blend uniformity (BU) assessment. However, NIR spectra of powder blends often contain overlapping physical and chemical information of the samples. Deconvoluting the information related to chemical properties from that associated with the physical effects is one of the major objectives of this work. We achieve this aim in two ways. Firstly, we identified various sources of variability that might affect the BU results. Secondly, we leverage the machine learning-based sophisticated data analytics processes. To accomplish the aforementioned objectives, calibration samples of amlodipine as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) with the concentrations ranging between 67 and 133% w/w (dose ~ 3.6% w/w), in powder blends containing excipients, were prepared using a gravimetric approach and assessed using NIR spectroscopic analysis, followed by HPLC measurements. The bias in NIR results was investigated by employing data quality metrics (DQM) and bias-variance decomposition (BVD). To overcome the bias, the clustered regression (non-parametric and linear) was applied. We assessed the model's performance by employing the hold-out and k-fold internal cross-validation (CV). NIR-based blend homogeneity with low mean absolute error and an interval estimates of 0.674 (mean) ± 0.218 (standard deviation) w/w was established. Additionally, bootstrapping-based CV was leveraged as part of the NIR method lifecycle management that demonstrated the mean absolute error (MAE) of BU ± 3.5% w/w and BU ± 1.5% w/w for model generalizability and model transferability, respectively. A workflow integrating machine learning to NIR spectral analysis was established and implemented. Impact of various data learning approaches on NIR spectral data.",

Our objective was to compare nebulization performance according to the low temperature and concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) solutions in different types of nebulizers, and to evaluate the stability of IgG aerosols and the amount delivered to the lungs. The output rate of the mesh nebulizers decreased according to the low temperature and high concentration of IgG solution, whereas the jet nebulizer was unaffected by the temperature and concentration of IgG. An impedance change of the piezoelectric vibrating element in the mesh nebulizers was observed because of the lower temperature and higher viscosity of IgG solution. This affected the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric element and lowered the output rate of the mesh nebulizers. Aggregation assays using a fluorescent probe revealed aggregates in IgG aerosols from all nebulizers. The delivered dose of IgG to the lungs in mice was highest at 95 ng/mL in the jet nebulizer with the smallest droplet size. Evaluation of the performance of IgG solution delivered to the lungs by three types of nebulizers could provide valuable parameter information for determination on dose of therapeutic antibody by nebulizers.",

The present study aimed to incorporate MC co-crystals with enhanced solubility into 3D-printed floating tablets. MC co-crystals were prepared via the green method using Saccharin sod. as a co-former at a (1:1) molar ratio. The prepared co-crystals were assessed for solubility, FTIR, thermal behavior, and SEM. Then, it was incorporated into zero % infill 3D-printed tablets of different configurations at two thickness levels by the FDM printing technique. Printed tablets were evaluated for dimensions, weight deviation, friability, and in vitro floating behavior. Drug release and kinetic of the MC release were also assessed. Solubility study of the co-crystals showed a significant ( p value &lt; 0.05) increased solubility over pure MC. FTIR and thermal behavior confirmed hydrogen bonding formation during co-crystallization. The obstructed particles had an erratic protrusion form, similar to a nodule, as illustrated by SEM. The printed tablets showed acceptable physicochemical properties. Tablets floated for about ≥ 12 h without floating lag time. In vitro drug release exhibited variable extended release profiles with different lag times depending on the configuration indicating that the tablet’s wall thickness and surface area were the factors manipulated to control drug release. Kinetic analysis of the release data displayed intermediate kinetics between zero-order and diffusional kinetics. The intragastric extended release profile for MC co-crystals of improved solubility could be successfully, economically, and quickly developed utilizing the 3D printing technique.

Our work aims to quantify geometric variations and aerosol deposition patterns during upper airway development in subjects between 3.5 months–6.9 years old using a library of 24 pediatric models and 4 adult models. Computational fluid–particle dynamics was performed with varying particle size (0.1–10 μm) and flow rate (10–120 Lpm), which was rigorously analyzed to compare anatomical metrics (epiglottis angle ( θ E ), glottis to cricoid ring ratio (GC-ratio), and pediatric to adult trachea ratio ( H -ratio)), inhaler metrics (particle diameter, $${d}_{p}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi> </mml:msub> </mml:math> , and flow rate, Q ), and clinical metrics (age, sex, height, and weight) against aerosol deposition. Multivariate non-linear regression indicated that all metrics were all significantly influential on resultant deposition, with varying influence of individual parameters. Additionally, principal component analysis was employed, indicating that $${d}_{p}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi> </mml:msub> </mml:math> , Q , GC-ratio, θ E , and sex accounted for 90% of variability between subject-specific deposition. Notably, age was not statistically significant among pediatric subjects but was influential in comparing adult subjects. Inhaler design metrics were hugely influential, thus supporting the critical need for pediatric-specific inhalable approaches. This work not only improves accuracy in prescribing inhalable therapeutics and informing pediatric aerosol optimization, but also provides a framework for future aerosol studies to continue to strive toward optimized and personalized pediatric medicine.

    "abstract": "Data variations, library changes, and poorly tuned hyperparameters can cause failures in data-driven modelling. In such scenarios, model drift, a gradual shift in model performance, can lead to inaccurate predictions. Monitoring and mitigating drift are vital to maintain model effectiveness. USFDA and ICH regulate pharmaceutical variation with scientific risk-based approaches. In this study, the hyperparameter optimization for the Artificial Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) was investigated using open-source data. The design of experiments (DoE) approach in combination with target drift prediction and statistical process control (SPC) was employed to achieve this objective. First, pre-screening and optimization DoEs were conducted on lab-scale data, serving as internal validation data, to identify the design space and control space. The regression performance metrics were carefully monitored to ensure the right set of hyperparameters was selected, optimizing the modelling time and storage requirements. Before extending the analysis to external validation data, a drift analysis on the target variable was performed. This aimed to determine if the external data fell within the studied range or required retraining of the model. Although a drift was observed, the external data remained well within the range of the internal validation data. Subsequently, trend analysis and process monitoring for the mean absolute error of the active content were conducted. The combined use of DoE, drift analysis, and SPC enabled trend analysis, ensuring that both current and external validation data met acceptance criteria. Out-of-specification and process control limits were determined, providing valuable insights into the model's performance and overall reliability. This comprehensive approach allowed for robust hyperparameter optimization and effective management of model lifecycle, crucial in achieving accurate and dependable predictions in various real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dustiness and the spatial distribution of dust are major problems when working with highly active pharmaceutical ingredients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a chamber setup that allows a reproducible atomization of small powder quantities and the detection of not only dustiness but also the spatial distribution of airborne dust at extremely low concentrations, to prove that an emission site may be localized with stationary sampling even in a confined space. For this purpose, the time required for evacuation of the chamber setup was determined with fuming sulfuric acid. In subsequent atomization experiments, the safe surrogate acetaminophen was used. The spatial distribution of the surrogate was detected with nine IOM samplers (Institute of Occupational Medicine) and its quantification was carried out via HPLC. A linear tendency of the quantity of aerosol formed in dependence of the sample mass was demonstrated. In addition, significant differences between individual spots of detection and thus a spatial distribution in the detection chamber was observed. These results indicated a strong convective mass transport within the chamber setup. To verify these results, the airflow used for atomization was simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics, confirming the convective mass transport and the spatial distribution of the airborne acetaminophen dust. In summary, it was shown that an emission site may be localized based on stationary exposure data even at concentrations as low as those mandatory in the contained manufacture of HPAPI-containing pharmaceuticals.

    "abstract": "Facilitating utility of prior knowledge to accelerate evidence-based new drug development is a focus of several communities of knowledge, such as clinical pharmacology. For example, progress has been made via modeling and simulation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships in the more effective use of \"End of Phase 2\" regulatory meetings for a New Drug Application (NDA). Facilitating utility of prior \"Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls\" (CMC) knowledge to accelerate new drug development and regulatory review process is also a topic of significant interest. This paper focuses on facilitating the utility of prior pharmaceutical formulation knowledge to accelerate drug product development and regulatory review of generic and biosimilar products. This knowledge is described as New Prior Knowledge (NPK) because research is often needed to fill ontological (i.e., the domain of connectivity between concepts and phenomena), epistemological (i.e., distinguishing knowledge or justified belief from the opinion), and methodological gaps in information derived a decade or so ago. The corporate economic advantages of such knowledge are derived, in part, when significant portions remain a trade secret. The proposed NPK seeks to generate knowledge about critical aspects of pharmaceutical quality and failure modes to place it in the public domain and to facilitate accelerated and more confident development and regulatory review of generic products. The paradoxical combination of \"new\" and \"prior knowledge\" is chosen deliberately to highlight both a distinction from proprietary and trade secret information and to acknowledge certain historical dogmas inherent in the current practices. Considerations for operationalizing NPK are also summarized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Niacin (nicotinic acid, NA) is administered orally as an antihyperlipidemic agent in extended-release (ER) tablets in high doses. Due to rapid absorption and extensive metabolism (non-linear pharmacokinetics), the drug plasma levels are highly variable, which may correlate with side effects. Interestingly, this erratic drug delivery behavior of niacin ER products cannot be clarified by compendial in vitro release testing. The standard dissolution tests do not allow to mimic the selected GI tract characteristics in order to estimate the robustness of formulation under the variability of the physiological conditions. These are characterized by the pH value, impact of motility forces and composition, as well as volume of GI liquids. Our paper demonstrates a comparison of a newly developed ER HPMC niacin formulation with an originator product. The research aimed to design a robust matrix tablet of comparable biopharmaceutical behavior, safety and efficacy. The extensive in vitro investigation, including dynamic studies in flow-through cell apparatus and stress test device, forms the basis for the evaluation of nicotinic acid plasma concentrations in vivo . The occurrence of erratic, multiple NA plasma peaks after the administration of both extended-release products is a result of its local input excess over the metabolic threshold (at the level corresponding to maximum 2% of the administered dose, i.e., 20 mg of drug) due to the mechanical stresses of physiological intensity. We demonstrate how this behavior is similar for both marketed and test products. In this context, we describe how a robust ER matrix and well-designed formulation does not guarantee the test product’s bioequivalence to the comparator one out of reasons unrelated to technology and biopharmaceutical properties, but because of the active compound’s intrinsic pharmacokinetic characteristics, i.e . , highly variable, extensive metabolism of nicotinic acid.",

    "abstract": "Low solubility of active pharmaceutical compounds (APIs) remains an important challenge in dosage form development process. In the manuscript, empirical models were developed and analyzed in order to predict dissolution of bicalutamide (BCL) from solid dispersion with various carriers. BCL was chosen as an example of a poor water-soluble API. Two separate datasets were created: one from literature data and another based on in-house experimental data. Computational experiments were conducted using artificial intelligence tools based on machine learning (AI/ML) with a plethora of techniques including artificial neural networks, decision trees, rule-based systems, and evolutionary computations. The latter resulting in classical mathematical equations provided models characterized by the lowest prediction error. In-house data turned out to be more homogeneous, as well as formulations were more extensively characterized than literature-based data. Thus, in-house data resulted in better models than literature-based data set. Among the other covariates, the best model uses for prediction of BCL dissolution profile the transmittance from IR spectrum at 1260 cm-1 wavenumber. Ab initio modeling-based in silico simulations were conducted to reveal potential BCL-excipients interaction. All crucial variables were selected automatically by AI/ML tools and resulted in reasonably simple and yet predictive models suitable for application in Quality by Design (QbD) approaches. Presented data-driven model development using AI/ML could be useful in various problems in the field of pharmaceutical technology, resulting in both predictive and investigational tools revealing new knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The current study evaluated the effect of location and amount of various superdisintegrants on the properties of tablets made by twin-screw melt granulation (TSMG). Sodium-croscarmellose (CCS), crospovidone (CPV), and sodium starch glycolate (SSG) were used in various proportions intra- and extra-granular. Tabletability, compactibility, compressibility as well as friability, disintegration, and dissolution performance were assessed. The extra-granular addition resulted in the fasted disintegration and dissolution. CPV performed superior to CCS and SSG. Even if the solid fraction (SF) of the granules was lower for CPV, only a minor decrease in tabletability was observed, due to the high plastic deformation of the melt granules. The intra-granular addition of CPV resulted in a more prolonged dissolution profile, which could be correlated to a loss in porosity during tableting. The 100% intra-granular addition of the CPV resulted in a distinct decrease of the disintegration efficiency, whereas the performance of SSG was unaffected by the granulation process. CCS was not suitable to be used for the production of an immediate-release formulation, when added in total proportion into the granulation phase, but its efficiency was less impaired compared to CPV. Shortest disintegration (78 s) and dissolution (Q 80 : 4.2 min) was achieved with CPV extra-granular. Using CPV and CCS intra-granular resulted in increased disintegration time and Q 80 . However, at a higher level of appx. 500 s and appx. 15 min, only SSG showed a process and location independent disintegration and dissolution performance.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge to overcome in the solid dosage forms technology is the selection of the most biopharmaceutically efficient polymeric excipients. The excipients can be selected, among others, by compatibility studies since incompatibilities between ingredients of the drug formulations adversely affect their bioavailability, stability, efficacy, and safety. Therefore, new, fast, and reliable methods for detecting incompatibility are constantly being sought. Hence, the purpose of this work was to assess the usefulness of a heating, cooling, and reheating differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) program for detecting potential incompatibilities between atenolol, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and polymeric excipients. Hot-stage microscopy (HSM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) were used as supporting techniques. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) served as tools to support the interpretation of the data acquired from the DSC curves and FTIR spectra. As the alterations in the shape of the DSC peak of atenolol which are indicative of incompatibility are visible only on the cooling and reheating curves of the mixtures, the DSC heating-cooling-reheating program was found to be very useful for identifying potential incompatibilities in the binary mixtures of atenolol and polymeric excipients. The melting and recrystallization of atenolol alone and in its mixtures were also confirmed by HSM, while FTIR displayed changes in the spectra of mixtures due to incompatibility. These studies revealed that atenolol is incompatible with hydroxyethylcellulose, hypromellose, and methylcellulose. PXRD measurements at room temperature revealed that the crystallinity of atenolol did not change in these mixtures. However, its crystallinity was reduced in the mixtures previously heated up to 155 °C and then cooled to 25 °C.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although inhalation therapy represents a promising drug delivery route for the treatment of respiratory diseases, the real-time evaluation of lung drug deposition remains an area yet to be fully explored. To evaluate the utility of the photo reflection method (PRM) as a real-time non-invasive monitoring of pulmonary drug delivery, the relationship between particle emission signals measured by the PRM and in vitro inhalation performance was evaluated in this study. Symbicort® Turbuhaler® was used as a model dry powder inhaler. In vitro aerodynamic particle deposition was evaluated using a twin-stage liquid impinger (TSLI). Four different inhalation patterns were defined based on the slope of increased flow rate (4.9–9.8 L/s 2 ) and peak flow rate (30 L/min and 60 L/min). The inhalation flow rate and particle emission profile were measured using an inhalation flow meter and a PRM drug release detector, respectively. The inhalation performance was characterized by output efficiency (OE, %) and stage 2 deposition of TSLI (an index of the deagglomerating efficiency, St2, %). The OE × St2 is defined as the amount delivered to the lungs. The particle emissions generated by four different inhalation patterns were completed within 0.4 s after the start of inhalation, and were observed as a sharper and larger peak under conditions of a higher flow increase rate. These were significantly correlated between the OE or OE × St2 and the photo reflection signal ( p &lt; 0.001). The particle emission signal by PRM could be a useful non-invasive real-time monitoring tool for dry powder inhalers. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) alters the innate cervicovaginal immunity, which provides an important barrier against viruses and other infections. The incidence of this disease has not decreased in the last 30 years, so effective treatments are still needed. Nanoparticles (NPs) of cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) and clotrimazole (CLZ) were prepared by the emulsification-diffusion method. NPs were characterized using dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry; their release profile was determined by the dialysis bag technique and mucoadhesion was evaluated with the mucin-particle method. The growth inhibition study of Candida albicans was carried out using the plate counting technique. Finally, accelerated physical stability tests of NPs were carried out, both in water and in SVF. The CAP-CLZ NPs had an average diameter of 273.4 nm, a PDI of 0.284, smooth surfaces and spherical shapes. In vitro release of CLZ from the CAP NPs was categorized with the Weibull model as a matrix system in which initial release was rapid and subsequently sustained. The inhibition of C. albicans growth by the CAP-CLZ NPs was greater than that of free CLZ, and the CAP-only NPs had a microbicidal effect on C. albicans. The NPs showed poor mucoadhesiveness, which could lead to studies of their mucopenetration capacities. An accelerated physical stability test revealed the erosion of CAP in aqueous media. A nanoparticulate system was developed and provided sustained release of CLZ, and it combined an antifungal agent with a microbial polymer that exhibited antifungal activity against C. albicans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant for avoidance and therapy of thromboembolic disorders. Unfortunately, oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban is compromised with dose increments. Accordingly, the aim was to test nano-vesicular lipid systems for improved oral anticoagulation activity of rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban loaded niosomes, bilosomes and spanlastic formulations were prepared. The prepared systems were assessed in terms of particle size, zeta potential, transition electron microscopic features (TEM), entrapment efficiency, in-vitro drug release, and in-vivo anticoagulation performance in rats. The prepared vesicular systems exposed spherical negatively charged vesicles with mean particle size values between 136.6 nm to 387.9 nm depending on the composition. Rivaroxaban was efficiently entrapped in the vesicular systems with entrapment efficiency values ranging from 92.4% to 94.0%. Rivaroxaban underwent sustained release from the fabricated vesicular systems. The in vivo performance of the tested preparation revealed significant enhancement of the anticoagulation parameters. This was manifested from the prolonged clotting time, and prothrombin time. Moreover, the cut tails of the examined rats receiving the formulated nano-systems exposed a lengthy tail bleeding time compared to those receiving the un-processed rivaroxaban aqueous dispersion. In Conclusion, niosomes, bilosomes and spanlastic nano-dispersions have a potential to overwhelm the oral anticoagulation efficiency of rivaroxaban with spanlastic ranked as best.

Despite some similarities, there are crucial differences separating these two technologies. Liqui-Pellet uses liqui-mass system (wet mass/paste admixture), and liquisolid pellet uses liquisolid system (flowable powder admixture). The understanding of the well-defined term 'liquisolid system' is crucial to understand what is and is not liquisolid formulation. Spireas, who is the inventor of liquisolid technology, clearly defined liquisolid system in his patent document and publications. Since his first publication in 1998, there are around 200 articles about liquisolid formulations (extracted from Scopus), and with no exception, every single one of them followed the original definition of liquisolid system. Liqui-Pellet does not use liquisolid system and so calling it the same as liquisolid pellet, which uses liquisolid system, is incorrect and misleading. The purpose of this commentary is to resolve misunderstanding and support furthering knowledge.",

With the continuous spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in even the world, prevention and treatment of the disease have become urgent tasks. The drugs currently being developed are not adequate to deal with this critical situation. In addition to being controlled through effective isolation, we need a rapid response from the healthcare and biotechnology industries to accelerate drug treatment research. By reviewing the currently available literature published at home and abroad, we summarize the current research progress of drug treatment during the epidemic period. At present, the drugs that can be used for treatment mainly include antiviral drugs, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine. The effectiveness and safety of drug therapy need to be confirmed by more clinical studies.",

Both methods gave equivalent results, but the minimum controllable pressure method is preferred, since it is easier, faster, and less subjective. The ratio of chamber pressure to condenser pressure corresponding to the onset of choked flow was considerably higher in this investigation (up to about 20:1) than in previously published reports. This ratio was not affected by the location of the pressure gauge on the condenser; that is, on the foreline of the vacuum pump versus on the body of the condenser itself. The total water loss due to sublimation as measured by tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy was consistently within 5% of gravimetrically determined weight loss, regardless of whether the measurement took place during choked versus non-choked process conditions.",

Due to the high transmission of this disease, rate precautions have been implemented, such as the use of masks by the population, personal protective equipment (PPE), and safety protocols, mainly to health workers. Thus, we performed a patent review to evaluate the current patents related to the protective mask. The review was carried out in the patent database in the period of May 2019 to May 2020. After the process of screening and eligibility, 563 patents were selected for our analysis according to the aim of the study which used masks such as a PPE against dust particles and pathogens, mostly when it is about airborne transmission, such as viruses and bacteria. Here, an overview of the main materials used in the mask manufacturing and their efficiency was described. The results of the review showed that most of the masks used cotton, nylon, silver fiber fabrics, among others as fabrics to develop the masks. It also makes an analysis of masks composed of nanotechnology which provide high filtration efficiency. Moreover, the review also brought possibilities of masking the population, which already have been done in countries such as China and Korea and ways of sterilization for reuse of PPE during COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, this review can further researchers in the developing of masks to decrease the spread of a pandemic disease. Graphical abstract.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the importance of drug release testing of parenteral depot formulations, the current in vitro methods still require ameliorations in biorelevance. We have investigated here the use of muscle tissue components to better mimic the intramuscular administration. For convenient handling, muscle tissue was used in form of a freeze-dried powder, and a reproducible process of incorporation of tested microspheres to an assembly of muscle tissue of standardized dimensions was successfully developed. Microspheres were prepared from various grades of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or ethyl cellulose, entrapping flurbiprofen, lidocaine, or risperidone. The deposition of microspheres in the muscle tissue or addition of only isolated lipids into the medium accelerated the release rate of all model drugs from microspheres prepared from ester-terminated PLGA grades and ethyl cellulose, however, not from the acid-terminated PLGA grades. The addition of lipids into the release medium increased the solubility of all model drugs; nonetheless, also interactions of the lipids with the polymer matrix (ad- and absorption) might be responsible for the faster drug release. As the in vivo drug release from implants is also often faster than in simple buffers in vitro , these findings suggest that interactions with the tissue lipids may play an important role in these still unexplained observations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several drugs have poor oral bioavailability due to low or incomplete absorption which is affected by various effects as pH, motility of GI, and enzyme activity. The gastroretentive drug delivery systems are able to deal with these problems by prolonging the gastric residence time, while increasing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. Previously, we developed a novel technology to foam hot and molten dispersions on atmospheric pressure by a batch-type in-house apparatus. Our aim was to upgrade this technology by a new continuous lab-scale apparatus and confirm that our formulations are gastroretentive. At first, we designed and built the apparatus and continuous production was optimized using a Box–Behnken experimental design. Then, we formulated barium sulfate-loaded samples with the optimal production parameters, which was suitable for in vivo imaging analysis. In vitro study proved the low density, namely 507 mg/cm 3 , and the microCT record showed high porosity with 40 μm average size of bubbles in the molten suspension. The BaSO 4 -loaded samples showed hard structure at room temperature and during the wetting test, the complete wetting was detected after 120 min. During the in vivo study, the X-ray taken showed the retention of the formulation in the rat stomach after 2 h. We can conclude that with our device low-density floating formulations were prepared with prolonged gastric residence time. This study provides a promising platform for marketed active ingredients with low bioavailability.",

It was found that the ITR, under the influence of a standard 25 kGy dose of radiation used for the sterilization of drug substances, decomposed at 0.4%. Moreover, a gentle change of colour and a decrease in melting point does not exceed pharmacopoeial standards causing that ITR can be sterilized by radiation method. The use of high 400 kGy radiation doses resulted in a 6.5% decomposition of the ITR and eight radiodegradation products were found. However, with the exception of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) methods showed no changes in the form and the morphology of the crystals. The structures of all those compounds were investigated. It was confirmed that the ITR decomposition takes place by dehalogenation (one of Cl atom elimination), the oxidation in isobutyl residue (beside the triazole ring) and C-O bond rupture.",

    "abstract": "The thermodynamic analysis of tablet formation includes the thermal and mechanical analysis during compression. The aim of this study was to evaluate alterations of force-displacement data upon temperature rise as an indicator for changed excipient properties. The tablet press was equipped with a thermally controlled die to imitate the heat evolution from tableting on an industrial scale. Six predominantly ductile polymers with a comparably low glass transition temperature were tableted at temperatures ranging from 22-70°C. Lactose served as a brittle reference with a high melting point. The energy analysis included the net and recovery work during compression, from which the plasticity factor was calculated. The respective results were compared to the changes in compressibility obtained via Heckel analysis. Elevated temperatures reduced the necessary work for plastic deformation for the ductile polymers, which was reflected in decreasing values for the net work of compaction and the plasticity factor. The recovery work slightly increased for the maximum tableting temperature. Lactose showed no response to temperature variations. Changes in the net work of compaction showed a linear correlation to the changes in yield pressure, which could be correlated to the glass transition temperature of a material. It is therefore possible to detect material alterations directly from the compression data, if the glass transition temperature of a material is sufficiently low.",

    "abstract": "The current International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) methods for determining the supported shelf life of a drug product, described in ICH guidance documents Q1A and Q1E, are evaluated in this paper. To support this evaluation, an industry data set is used which is comprised of 26 individual stability batches of a common drug product where most batches are measured over a 24 month storage period. Using randomly sampled sets of 3 or 6 batches from the industry data set, the current ICH methods are assessed from three perspectives. First, the distributional properties of the supported shelf lives are summarized and compared to the distributional properties of the true shelf lives associated with the industry data set, assuming the industry data set represents a finite population of drug product batches for discussion purposes. Second, the results of the ICH “poolability” tests for model selection are summarized and the separate shelf life distributions from the possible alternative models are compared. Finally, the ICH methods are evaluated in terms of their ability to manage risk. Shelf life estimates that are too long result in an unacceptable percentage of nonconforming batches at expiry while those that are too short put the manufacturer at risk of possibly having to prematurely discard safe and efficacious drug product. Based on the analysis of the industry data set, the ICH-recommended approach did not produce supported shelf lives that effectively managed risk. Alternative approaches are required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most of the commercially available pharmaceutical products for oral administration route are marketed in the tablet dosage forms. However, compression of multiparticulate systems is a challenge for the pharmaceutical research and industry, especially if the individual unit is a coated particle, as the release of the active ingredient depends on the integrity of the coating. In the present study, polymer-coated pellets tableted with different types of excipients (powder, granules, pellets) then were investigated by various tablet-destructive (microscopic) and tablet non-destructive (microfocus X-ray; microCT) imaging methods. The information obtained from the independent evaluation of the in vitro drug release profiles model is confirmed by the results obtained by image analysis, regardless of whether X-ray or stereomicroscopic images of the coated, tableted pellets were used for image analysis. The results of this study show that the novel easy-to-use, fast, and non-destructive MFX method is a good alternative to the already used microscopic image analysis methods regarding the characterization of particulates, compressed into tablets.",

    "abstract": "Measuring tablet disintegration is essential for quality control purposes; however, no established method adequately accounts for the timeframe or small volumes of the medium associated with the dissipation process for fast disintegrating tablets (FDTs) in the mouth. We hypothesised that digital imaging to measure disintegration in a low volume of the medium might discriminate between different types of FTD formulation. A digital image disintegration analysis (DIDA) was designed to measure tablet disintegration in 0.05-0.7 mL of medium. A temperature-controlled black vessel was 3D-printed to match the dimensions of each tablet under investigation. An overhead camera recorded the mean grey value of the tablet as a measure of the percentage of the formulation which remained intact as a function of time. Imodium Instants, Nurofen Meltlets and a developmental freeze-dried pilocarpine formulation were investigated. The imaging approach proved effective in discriminating the disintegration of different tablets (p < 0.05). For example, 10 s after 0.7 mL of a saliva simulant was applied, 2.0 ± 0.3% of the new pilocarpine tablet remained, whereas at the same time point, 22 ± 9% of the Imodium Instants had not undergone disintegration (temperature within the vessel was 37 ± 0.5°C). Nurofen Meltlets were observed to swell and showed a percentage recovery of 120.7 ± 2.4% and 135.0 ± 6.1% when 0.05 mL and 0.7 mL volumes were used, respectively. Thus, the new digital image disintegration analysis, DIDA, reported here effectively evaluated fast disintegrating tablets and has the potential as a quality control method for such formulations.",

    "abstract": "Proteolytic enzymes are often used in dissolution testing of cross-linked gelatin capsules that do not conform to the dissolution specification. Their catalytic activity, however, can be affected when they are added to a dissolution media containing solubility enhancers, such as surfactants. The aim of this study was to assess the activity of pancreatic proteases in presence of four commonly used surfactants. We found that pancreatin exhibits remarkable proteolytic activity in the presence of Tween 80, even at the concentrations as high as 250 times its critical micelle concentration (cmc) in water, whereas, Triton X-100 enhanced the proteolytic activity of pancreatin when added at concentrations above its cmc in water. Both surfactants are non-ionic surfactants. On the other hand, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which are ionic surfactants, have a detrimental effect on the proteolytic activity of pancreatin. For example, a 50% reduction of the pancreatin activity was found in samples which contain a minor amount of SDS (0.05% w/v) in comparison to a surfactant-free reaction. Additionally, no activity was observed for the pancreatin-SDS samples which were incubated for 30 min at 40°C prior to testing. CTAB had an impact on pancreatin activity at concentrations higher than its cmc. Data from this manuscript can be used as a benchmark for optimization of the dissolution procedures that require use of both surfactants and enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Process simulation facilitates scale-up of hot-melt extrusion (HME) and enhances proper understanding of the underlying critical process parameters. However, performing numeric simulations requires profound knowledge of the employed materials' properties. For example, an accurate description of the compounds' melt rheology is paramount for proper simulations. Hence, sample preparation needs to be optimized to yield results as predictive as possible. To identify the optimal preparation method for small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) rheological measurements, binary mixtures of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate or methacrylic acid ethyl acrylate copolymer (Eudragit L100-55) together with the model drugs celecoxib and ketoconazole were prepared. The physical powder mixtures were introduced into the SAOS as a compressed tablet or a disk prepared via vacuum compression molding (VCM). Simulations with the derived parameters were conducted and compared to lab-scale extrusion trials. VCM was identified as the ideal preparation method resulting in the highest similarity between simulated and experimental values, while simulation based on conventional powder-based methods insufficiently described the HME process.",

    "abstract": "The identification of new contaminants is critical in the development of new medicinal products. Many impurities, such as pentanedioic acid, hexanedioic acid, heptanedioic acid, octanedioic acid, decanedioic acid, undecanedioic acid, dodecanedioic acid, tridecanedioic acid, and tetradecanedioic acid, have been identified in samples of azelaic acid. The aim of this study was to identify impurities observed during the stability tests of a new liposomal dosage form of azelaic acid that is composed of phosphatidylcholine and a mixture of ethyl alcohol and water, using high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD), gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection (GC-FID), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. During the research and development of a new liposomal formulation of azelaic acid, we developed a method for determining the contamination of azelaic acid using HPLC-ELSD. During our analytical tests, we identified a previously unknown impurity of a liposomal preparation of azelaic acid that appeared in the liposomal formulation of azelaic acid during preliminary stability studies. The procedure led to the conclusion that the impurity was caused by the reaction of azelaic acid with one of the excipients that was applied in the product. The impurity was finally identified as an ethyl monoester of azelaic acid. The identification procedure of this compound was carried out in a series of experiments comparing the chromatograms that were obtained via the following chromatographic methods: HPLC-ELSD, GC-FID, and GC-MS. The final identification of the compound was carried out by GC with MS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Partitioning of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) into the aqueous phases of submicron dispersed systems such as submicron emulsions, aqueous lecithin dispersion (WLD), and suspension of nanospheres (NLC) was studied. The aqueous phases of the investigated systems were obtained by ultracentrifugation and subsequently were subjected to ultrafiltration, which procedure allowed distinguishing between the fractions of free benzalkonium chloride ( w ) and those incorporated in the liposomal and micellar region ( wlm ). The fractions present in the oily phase and in the interphase of submicron emulsions were calculated. Despite the various composition of the investigated formulations and the initial concentration of BAC, w values were very small at 0.2–8.0%. The wlm value in submicron emulsions was increased by increasing the total concentration of preservative from 29.0 to 42.0%. Using polysorbate 80 instead of lecithin resulted in a distribution of BAC to aqueous–liposomal–micellar phase that was twice as high. The very low concentration of antimicrobial active form of benzalkonium chloride was analyzed in the aqueous phase of emulsions stabilized with lecithin as well as in aqueous lecithin dispersion and nanospheres (below 3%). Replacement of lecithin with polysorbate 80 in emulsions with polysorbate significantly increase (up to 8%) the fraction of benzalkonium chloride in the aqueous phase where microbial growth occurs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, an attempt was made to produce Liqui-Tablets for the first time. This was carried out through the compaction of naproxen Liqui-Pellets. The incentive to convert the novel Liqui-Pellet into Liqui-Tablet was due to the array of inherent advantages of the popular and preferred tablet dosage form. The study showed that naproxen Liqui-Tablet could be successfully produced and the rapid drug release rate (100% drug release ~ 20 min) could be achieved under pH 1.2, where naproxen is insoluble. It was observed that the different pH of the dissolution medium affected the trend of drug release from formulations with varying amounts of liquid vehicle. The order of the fastest drug-releasing formulations was different depending on the pH used. The presence of Neusilin US2 showed considerable enhancement in the drug release rate as well as improving Liqui-Tablet robustness and hardness. Furthermore, images from X-ray micro-tomography displayed a uniform distribution of components in the Liqui-Tablet. The accelerated stability studies showed acceptable stability in terms of dissolution profile.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Medicine regulators require the melting points for crystalline drugs, as they are a test for chemical and physical quality. Many drugs, especially salt-forms, suffer concomitant degradation during melting; thus, it would be useful to know if the endotherm associated with melt degradation may be used for characterising the crystallinity of a powder blend. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether melt-degradation transitions can detect amorphous content in a blend of crystalline and amorphous salbutamol sulphate. Salbutamol sulphate was rendered amorphous by freeze and spray-drying and blended with crystalline drug, forming standards with a range of amorphous content. Crystalline salbutamol sulphate was observed to have a melt-degradation onset of 198.2±0.2°C, while anhydrous amorphous salbutamol sulphate prepared by either method showed similar glass transition temperatures of 119.4±0.7°C combined. Without the energy barrier provided by the ordered crystal lattice, the degradation endotherm for amorphous salbutamol sulphate occurred 50°C below the melting point, with an onset of 143.6±0.2°C. The enthalpies for this degradation transition showed no significant difference between freeze- and spray-dried samples ( p &gt;0.05). Distinct from convention, partial integration of the crystalline melt-degradation endotherm was applied to the region 193–221°C which had no contribution from the degradation of amorphous salbutamol sulphate. The linear correlation of these partial areas with amorphous content, R 2 =0.994, yielded limits of detection and quantification of 0.13% and 0.44% respectively, independent of drying technique. Melt-degradation transitions may be re-purposed for the measurement of amorphous content in powder blends, and they have potential for evaluating disorder more generally.",

    "abstract": "This study elucidates the physical properties of sono-crystallised micro/nano-sized acetaminophen/paracetamol (PMOL) and monitors its possible transformation from polymorphic form I (monoclinic) to form II (orthorhombic). Hydrophilic Plasdone® S630 copovidone (S630), N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate copolymer, and methacrylate-based cationic copolymer, Eudragit® EPO (EPO), were used as polymeric carriers to prepare drug/polymer binary mixtures. Commercially available PMOL was crystallised under ultra sound sonication to produce micro/nano-sized (0.2–10 microns) crystals in monoclinic form. Homogeneous binary blends of drug-polymer mixtures at various drug concentrations were obtained via a thorough mixing. The analysis conducted via the single X-ray crystallography determined the detailed structure of the crystallised PMOL in its monoclinic form. The solid state and the morphology analyses of the PMOL in the binary blends evaluated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and hot stage microscopy (HSM) revealed the crystalline existence of the drug within the amorphous polymeric matrices. The application of temperature controlled X-ray diffraction (VTXRPD) to study the polymorphism of PMOL showed that the most stable form I (monoclinic) was altered to its less stable form II (orthorhombic) at high temperature (>112°C) in the binary blends regardless of the drug amount. Thus, VTXRD was used as a useful tool to monitor polymorphic transformations of crystalline drug (e.g. PMOL) to assess their thermal stability in terms of pharmaceutical product development and research.",

    "abstract": "The present study explored vacuum drum drying (VDD) as potential drying technique for the solidification of crystalline ritonavir nanosuspensions prepared by wet-ball milling. In detail, the impact of drying protectants (mannitol, lactose, trehalose) added to the ritonavir nanosuspension was assessed in dependence of the drum temperature with respect to processibility via VDD, resulting intermediate powder properties, remaining nanoparticulate redispersibility and crystallinity. A clear impact of the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the drying protectant on the redispersibility/crystallinity of the VDD intermediate was observed. Increased Tg of the drying protectant was associated with improved redispersibility/crystallinity at a defined drum temperature. Consequently, the high Tg-substance trehalose and lactose showed a better performance than mannitol at higher drum temperatures. However, the processability and related powder properties were not in accordance with this observation. Mannitol containing formulations showed superior processibility to those containing trehalose/lactose. Moreover, the impact of the tableting and encapsulation process on the redispersibility of the VDD intermediate was studied for a selected formulation. Neither process demonstrated a negative impact on redispersibility. In conclusion, vacuum drum drying is a promising drying technique for the solidification of nanosuspensions to result in dried powder still containing ritonavir nanoparticles while demonstrating acceptable to good downstream processibility to tablets/capsules.",

    "abstract": "The present study evaluated the effect of different configuration setups of the Flow-Through Cell (USP IV) dissolution tester in developing in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC). A Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class I Diltiazem (DTZ), formulated in extended-release (ER) gel-matrix system, was employed for this purpose. The study also assessed the validity and predictability of IVIVC employing both deconvolution- and convolution-based approaches. In vitro release was conducted in USP IV as open- or closed-loop setups, while the pharmacokinetic (PK) data were obtained from a previous fasted-state cross-over study conducted on 8 healthy male volunteers, after oral administration of ER matrix tablets against market product (Tildiem Retard® 90 mg). PK parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞) were predicted, and compared with actual data to establish the strength of correlation models. Results showed that DTZ release from ER products was influenced by operating the FTC in different configuration-setups, where ≥ 75% of labeled DTZ was released after 6 h and 12 h using the open- and closed-loop settings, respectively. Correlation between fraction-dissolved versus fraction-absorbed for both ER products displayed linear relation upon employing FTC open-loop setup. Convolution-based approach was more discriminative in predicting DTZ in vivo PK parameters with a minimal prediction error, compared to deconvolution-based approach. A successful trial to predict DTZ PKs from individual in vitro data performed in USP IV dissolution model was established, employing convolution technique. Basic principle of the convolution approach provides a simple and practical method for developing IVIVC, hence could be utilized for other BCS Class I extended-release drug products.",

    "abstract": "Poor water dissolution of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) limits the rate of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Increasing the pH of a solid form microenvironment can enhance the dissolution of weakly acidic drugs, but data on this phenomenon in a physiologically relevant bicarbonate media are lacking. In this paper, we examined the effect of a microenvironmental pH modulator (Na2HPO4) on the dissolution of a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class II free weak acid (ibuprofen) at biorelevant conditions, including an automatic bicarbonate buffering system, as well as in compendial (50 mM) and low-concentration (10 mM) phosphate buffers with no external pH control. The tablets of 200 mg ibuprofen with either Na2HPO4 (phosphate formulation, PF) or NaCl (reference formulation, RF) were manufactured using a compression method. In a pH 2 simulated gastric fluid, only PF produced a transient supersaturation of ibuprofen, dissolving a fourfold higher drug amount than RF. In a bicarbonate-buffered simulated intestinal fluid with a dynamically controlled pH (5.7, 7.2, and 5.8 to 7.7 gradient), PF dissolved more drug within 30 min than RF (p ≤ 0.019). Of note, the use of a 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2 provided opposite results-RF dissolved the API much faster than PF. Moreover, 10 mM phosphate buffers of pH 5.6 and 7.2 could neither maintain a constant pH nor mimic the bicarbonate buffer performance. In conclusion, the use of a bicarbonate-buffered intestinal fluid, instead of phosphate buffers, may be essential in dissolution tests of BCS class II drugs combined with pH modulators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pulmonary delivery systems should administer a high dose of the required formulation with the designated dry powder inhaler (DPI) to achieve therapeutic success. While the effects of device geometry and individual components used on powder dispersion are described in literature, potential effects of DPI surface properties on powder retention within the device and deagglomeration have not been adequately studied, but could impact inhalation therapy by modifying the available dose. For this, inner parts of a model DPI were modified by plasma treatment using various processes. Since both the hydrophilic-hydrophobic and structural properties of the surface were altered, conclusions can be drawn for future optimization of devices. The results show that surface topography has a greater influence on powder deposition and deagglomeration than hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface modification. The most important modification was observed with an increased rough surface texture in the mouth piece, resulting in lower powder deposition in this part (from 5 to 1% quantified amount of powder), without any change in powder deagglomeration compared to an untreated device. In summary, increasing the surface roughness of DPI components in the size range of a few nanometers could be an approach for future optimization of DPIs to increase the delivered dose.

    "abstract": "Visible protein-like particle standards may improve visual inspection and/or appearance testing practices used in the biotechnology industry. They may improve assay performance resulting in better alignment and more standardized training among different companies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has conducted an interlaboratory study to test whether the standards under development mimic typical proteinaceous particles found in biotherapeutics and if they can be implemented during the visual inspection process. Fourteen organizations from industry and government have participated. A total of 20 labs from these 14 organizations participated with analysts from 6 formulation, 7 analytical, 4 quality control, and 3 manufacturing labs. The circulated samples consisted of abraded ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) particles or photolithographic particles. The results consist of qualitative ratings, which varied substantially among organizations and within labs. Polydisperse ETFE particle suspensions, containing particles enriched in greater than 150 µm in size, were rated more favorably than the photolithographic particles by formulation and analytical scientists. The largest monodisperse photolithographic particles (approximately 300 µm in size) were favored equally compared to ETFE by all scientists. Solution modifications to decrease the settling rate or to alter optical properties of the ETFE solutions yielded lower ratings by the analysts. Both particle types received mixed ratings for their usability and for their application for visual inspection and for training purposes. Industry feedback will assist NIST in developing reference material(s) for visible protein-like particles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The performance of a pharmaceutical formulation, such as the drug (API) release rate, is significantly influenced by the properties of the materials used, the composition of the final product and the tablet compression process parameters. However, in some cases, the knowledge of these input parameters does not necessarily provide a reliable description or prediction of tablet performance. Therefore, the knowledge of tablet microstructure is desirable to understand such formulations. Commonly used analytical techniques, such as X-ray tomography and intrusion mercury porosimetry, are not widely used in pharmaceutical companies due to their price and/or toxicity, and therefore, efforts are made to develop a tool for fast and easy microstructure description. In this work, we have developed an image-based method for microstructure description and applied it to a model system consisting of ibuprofen and CaHPO 4 ∙2H 2 O (API and excipient with different deformability). The obtained parameter, the quadratic mean of the equivalent diameter of the non-deformable, brittle excipient CaHPO 4 ∙2H 2 O, was correlated with tablet composition, compression pressure and API release rate. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility of describing the tablet dissolution performance in the presented model system based on the microstructural parameter, providing a possible model system for compressed solid dosage forms in which a plastic component is present and specific API release is required.

TCA appeared to be concentrated in propylene glycol (PG) which in turn is dispersed in a lanolin-petrolatum mixture. Two predominant degradation products were identified: a 21-aldehyde and a 17-carboxylic acid. The 21-aldehyde is formed after TCA is oxidized by O2, a reaction that is catalyzed by trace metals. Logically, the content of trace metals has a profound effect on the degradation rate. It was shown that trace metals are extracted from lanolin and petrolatum by PG, increasing the concentration in PG. In accordance with these findings, TCA degrades faster in PG that is present in the ointment formulation than in regular PG. The 21-aldehyde was confirmed to be a primary degradation product, while the 17-carboxylic acid was identified as a secondary degradation product. Based on the mechanism of degradation, the ointment can be stabilized by the addition of sodium metabisulfite which was shown to reside also in the PG phase within the ointment.",

    "abstract": "Effective and compound-sparing methods to evaluate promising drug delivery systems are a prerequisite for successful selection of formulations in early development stages. The aim of the study was to develop a small-scale in situ method to determine drug release and supersaturation in highly concentrated suspensions of enabling formulations. Mesoporous magnesium carbonate (MMC), which delivers the drug in an amorphous form, was selected as a drug carrier. Five model compounds were loaded into the MMC at a 1:10 ratio using a solvent evaporation technique. The μDiss Profiler was used to study the drug release from MMC in fasted-state simulated intestinal fluid. To avoid extensive light scattering previously seen in particle-rich suspensions in the μDiss Profiler, an in-house-designed protective nylon filter was placed on the in situ UV probes. Three types of release experiments were conducted for each compound: micronized crystalline drug with MMC present, drug-loaded MMC, and drug-loaded MMC with 0.01% w/w hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. The nylon filters effectively diminished interference with the UV absorption; however, the release profiles obtained were heavily compound dependent. For one of the compounds, changes in the UV spectra were detected during the release from the MMC, and these were consistent with degradation of the compound. To conclude, the addition of protective nylon filters to the probes of the μDiss Profiler is a useful contribution to the method, making evaluations of particle-rich suspensions feasible. The method is a valuable addition to the current ones, allowing for fast and effective evaluation of advanced drug delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to examine the influence of non-freezing water (NFW) contents bound to hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) binary mixtures using acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as a model moisture-sensitive ingredient. Polysaccharides with significantly different physicochemical properties were mixed with acetylsalicylic acid at a ratio 1:1 (w/w). The measurements of NFW contents of hydrated samples were carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the method used, the dry mass normalized dependency of melting enthalpy (ΔH) and respective contents of water was found to be linear. NFW values were calculated after extrapolation ΔH to 0. For stability studies, HPC/ASA and HPMC/ASA mixtures were stored at 40°C and 75% RH for 5 weeks in the climatic chamber. The ASA hydrolysis was investigated using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The amounts of NFW calculated for raw HPMC 3 cP and 100,000 cP were 0.49 and 0.42 g g-1, while for polymer and ASA mixtures, prepared from HPC type LF (126 cP) and MF (6300 cP) as well as from HPMC 3 cP and 100,000 cP were 0.23, 0.28 g g-1, 0.21 g g-1, and 0.33 g g-1 respectively. The measured NFW values were connected with appropriate concentrations of unhydrolyzed ASA.",

PLGA nanoparticles were prepared using a double emulsification spray-drying method. Emulsions were prepared using a focused ultrasound transducer equipped with a flow cell. Either poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) or poloxamer 407 (P-407) was used as a stabilizer. Aliquots of the emulsions were blended with different matrix excipients and spray dried, and the yield and size of the resuspended nanoparticles was determined and compared against solvent displacement. Nanoparticle sizes of spray-dried PLGA/PVA emulsions were independent of the matrix excipient and comparable with sizes from the solvent displacement method. The yield of the resuspended nanoparticles was highest for emulsions containing trehalose and leucine (79%). Spray drying of PLGA/P-407 emulsions led to agglomerated nanoparticles independent of the matrix excipient. PLGA/P-407 nanoparticles pre-formed by solvent displacement could be spray dried with limited agglomeration when PVA was added as an additional stabilizer. A comparably high and economically interesting nanoparticle yield could be achieved with a process suitable for continuous manufacturing. Further studies are needed to understand the robustness of a continuous process at commercial scale.",

    "abstract": "Transferring processes between different scales and types of mixers is a common operation in industry. Challenges within this operation include the existence of considerable differences in blending conditions between mixer scales and types. Obtaining the correct blending conditions is crucial for the ability to break up agglomerates in order to achieve the desired blend uniformity. Agglomerate break up is often an abrasion process. In this study, the abrasion rate potential of agglomerates is described by the Stokes abrasion (StAbr) number of the system. The StAbr number equals the ratio between the kinetic energy density of the moving powder bed and the work of fracture of the agglomerate. In this study, the StAbr approach demonstrates to be a useful tool to predict the abrasion of agglomerates during blending when technology is transferred between mixer scales/types. Applying the StAbr approach revealed a transition point between parameters that determined agglomerate abrasion. This study gave evidence that (1) below this transition point, agglomerate abrasion is determined by a combination of impeller effects and by the kinetic energy density of the powder blend, whereas (2) above this transition point, agglomerate abrasion is mainly determined by the kinetic energy density of the powder blend.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The manufacturing of biopharmaceutical drug solutions can involve close contact with various polymeric components, including common filter membranes. Potential leachable substances from filters may interact with the protein and thereby increase the structural damage and aggregation. The main aim of the study deals with the assessment of extractable and leachable (E/L) from different filters and the potential effect of E/Ls on protein (human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rh-GCSF) stability. The present study examines the E/L profile of five different polymeric filter membranes using various chromatographic techniques including LC–MS and GC–MS. In order to investigate their effect on protein stability, G-CSF (human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) formulations were spiked with filter leachable stock solutions at two different pH levels. The spiked formulations were further analyzed with respect to their aggregation behavior. The results demonstrated a higher E/L content in the case of polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), and polyethersulfone (PES) filters as compared to the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and regenerative cellulose (RC) filter materials. The E/L from RC and PES was found surface-active, whereas E/L from PA and RC significantly altered the particle size/structure resulting in the aggregation of proteins. Furthermore, bisphenol A was found to be one of the E/L substances from PC filters and can impose significant health problems when administered along with pharmaceutical products. The present study reports a qualitative rank ordering of the filter membranes in terms of their propensity to generate E/Ls and thus can be helpful in selecting a suitable membrane filter.",

    "abstract": "Progesterone (PRG) and testosterone (TST) were impregnated on mesoporous silica (ExP) particles via supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) processing at various pressures (10-18 MPa), temperatures (308.2-328.2 K), and time (30-360 min). The impact of a co-solvent on the impregnation was also studied at the best determined pressure and temperature. The properties of the drug embedded in silica particles were analysed via gas chromatography (GC), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and nitrogen adsorption. An impregnation of 1 to 82 mg/g for PRG and 0.1 to 16 mg/g for TST was obtained depending on the processing parameters. There was a significant effect of pressure, time, and co-solvent on the impregnation efficiency. Generally, an increase in time and pressure plus the use of co-solvent led to an improvement in drug adsorption. Conversely, a rise in temperature resulted in lower impregnation of both TST and PRG on ExP. There was a substantial increase in the dissolution rate (> 90% drug release within the first 2 min) of both TST and PRG impregnated in silica particles when compared to the unprocessed drugs. This dissolution enhancement was attributed to the amorphisation of both drugs due to their adsorption on mesoporous silica.",

The trial concentrations of HPMC E50, HPMC K4M, and Carbopol 940 were used as factors, and floating lag time, total floating time, and % drug release at 12 h were used as responses. The formulation underwent evaluation for different parameters: aspirin-induced ulcers in rats assessed the antiulcer activity, and X-ray studies in rabbits evaluated the gastroretentive nature. The optimized formulation has shown a floating lag time of 32 s and floated in the gastric medium for more than 9 h with a maximum drug release of 93% at the end of 12 h by following the Korsmeyer-Peppas drug release mechanism. The optimized formulation has good flow properties. The FT-IR, DSC, and XRD studies show ADB and excipients didn't show any incompatibility. The formulation has shown significant antiulcer activity against aspirin-induced ulcers in rats, with an ulcer index of 3.38 ± 0.24 and inhibition of 76.67 ± 0.56%. The in vivo X-ray imaging proved the gastric retention of the formulations for more than 8 h. The results of the formulations demonstrate the floating ability and sustained drug release of the tablet responsible for treating peptic ulcers to show a localized effect in the gastric region and to maintain the ROS levels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hypericum perforatum (HP) contains valuable and beneficial bioactive compounds that have been used to treat or prevent several illnesses. Encapsulation technology offers protection of the active compounds and facilitates to expose of the biologically active compounds in a controlled mechanism. Microcapsulation of the hydroalcoholic gum arabic and maltodextrin have hot been used as wall materials in the encapsulation of HP extract. Therefore, the optimum microencapsulation parameters of Hypericum perforatum (HP) hydroalcoholic extract were determined using response surface methodology (RSM) for the evaluation of HP extract. Three levels of three independent variables were screened using the one-way ANOVA. Five responses were monitored, including total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), carr index (CI), hausner ratio (HR), and solubility. Optimum drying conditions for Hypericum perforatum microcapsules (HPMs) were determined: 180 °C for inlet air temperature, 1.04/1 for ratio of maltodextrin to gum arabic (w/w), and 1.98/1 for coating to core material ratio (w/w). TPC, antioxidant activity, CI, HR, and solubility values were specified as 316.531 (mg/g GAE), 81.912%, 6.074, 1.066, and 35.017%, respectively, under the optimized conditions. The major compounds of Hypericum perforatum (hypericin and pseudohypericin) extract were determined as 4.19 μg/g microcapsule and 15.09 μg/g microcapsule, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that the mean particle diameter of the HPMs was 20.36 µm. Based on these results, microencapsulation of HPMs by spray drying is a viable technique which protects the bioactive compounds of HP leaves, facilitating its application in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries.

    "abstract": "Abstract Only few excipients are known to be suitable as pelletization aids. In this study, the potential use of croscarmellose sodium (CCS) as pelletization aid was investigated. Furthermore, the impact of cations on extrusion-spheronization (ES) of CCS was studied and different grades of CCS were tested. The influence of different cations on the swelling of CCS was investigated by laser diffraction. Mixtures of CCS with lactose monohydrate as filler with or without the inclusion of different cations were produced. The mixtures were investigated by mixer torque rheometry and consequently extruded and spheronized. Resulting pellets were analyzed by dynamic image analysis. In addition, mixtures of different CCS grades with dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous (DP) and a mixture with praziquantel (PZQ) as filler were investigated. Calcium and magnesium cations caused a decrease of the swelling of CCS and influenced the use of CCS as pelletization aid since they needed to be included for successful ES. Aluminum, however, led to an aggregation of the CCS particles and to failure of extrusion. The inclusion of cations decreased the uptake of water by the mixtures which also reduced the liquid-to-solid-ratio (L/S) for successful ES. This was shown to be dependent on the amount of divalent cations in the mixture. With DP or PZQ as filler, no addition of cations was necessary for a successful production of pellets, however the optimal L/S for ES was dependent on the CCS grade used. In conclusion, CCS can be used as a pelletization aid. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mesoporous silica offers an easy way to transform liquids into solids, due to their high loading capacity for liquid or dissolved active ingredients and the resulting enhanced dissolution properties. However, the compression of both unloaded and loaded mesoporous silica bulk material into tablets is challenging, due to poor/non-existing binding capacity. This becomes critical when high drug loads are to be achieved and the fraction of additional excipients in the final tablet formulation needs to be kept at a minimum. Our study aimed to investigate the mechanism of compression and tabletability dependent on the Liquid Load Level of the silica and type of filler/binder in binary tabletting mixtures. To this end, Vivapur® 101, FlowLac® 90, Pearlitol® 200 SD and tricalcium citrate tetrahydrate were selected and mixed with Syloid® XDP 3050 at various Liquid Load Levels. Compaction characteristics were analysed using the StylOne® Classic 105 ML compaction simulator. Additionally, the Overall Liquid Load (OLL) was defined as a new critical quality attribute for liquisolid tablets. The Overall Liquid Load allows straightforward, formulation-relevant comparisons between various fillers/binders, liquid components, and silica types. Results indicate strong binding capacity and high plasticity of the fillers/binders as key components for successful high liquid load silica tablet formulation. A volumetric combination of 30% Vivapur® 101 and 70% 0.75 mL/g loaded Syloid® XDP 3050 proved to be the most effective mixture, achieving an Overall Liquid Load of 36–41% [ v / v ] and maintaining a tensile strength of 1.5 N/mm 2 with various liquid vehicles.

    "abstract": "Abstract The hot-melt extrusion process is currently considered a prominent manufacturing technique in the pharmaceutical industry. The present study is intended to develop amlodipine besylate (AMB)-loaded subcutaneous implants to reduce the frequency of administration, thus improving patient compliance during hypertension management. AMB subcutaneous implants were prepared using continuous hot-melt extrusion technology using poly(caprolactone) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) with dimensions of 3.70 cm (length) by 2.00 mm (diameter). The implants were characterized for thermal characteristics, drug-excipient incompatibilities, surface morphology, fracturability, in vitro drug release, and stability studies. Differential scanning calorimetry study confirmed the drug's crystalline state within the fabricated implants, while textural analysis demonstrated good fracturability in the lead formulation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the smooth surface morphology of the lead subcutaneous implant. The lead formulation showed an extended drug release profile over 30 days (~ 2.25 mg per day) and followed zero-order release kinetics (R 2 value to 0.9999) with a mean dissolution time of 14.96 days. The lead formulation remained stable for 30 days at accelerated stability conditions of 40°C and 75% relative humidity. In conclusion, developing hot-melt extruded implants could be an alternative to the conventional amlodipine besylate (AMB) formulation. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, lidocaine topical systems utilizing nonaqueous matrices have been developed and provide efficient lidocaine delivery through the skin, such that lower concentrations of drug provide equivalent or greater drug delivery than drug-in-matrix hydrogel lidocaine patches. This study characterizes drug delivery from a nonaqueous lidocaine topical system with increasing drug load both in vitro and in vivo . Topical systems formulated with either 1.8% or 5.4% lidocaine were applied to healthy volunteers’ backs ( n = 15) for 12 h in a single-center, open-label, four-treatment, four-period crossover pharmacokinetic study. Subjects were dosed with either three 1.8% systems or one, two, or three 5.4% systems in each period. Blood was collected for up to 48 h, and plasma lidocaine levels were measured with a validated HPLC method. In parallel, human and mouse skin models characterized the in vitro skin permeation profile. The pharmacokinetic profile was linear between one, two, and three lidocaine 5.4% applications. Application of three lidocaine 1.8% systems (108 mg lidocaine) was bioequivalent to one lidocaine 5.4% system (108 mg lidocaine). Both topical systems remained well adhered to the skin and irritation was mild. The 5.4% system had approximately threefold higher skin permeability than the 1.8% system in the mouse and human skin models. The results indicate increasing the drug load by three times results in triple the drug delivery both in vivo and in vitro . The relationship between the in vitro permeation and in vivo absorption correlates and is nonlinear.",

    "abstract": "Batch-to-batch pharmacokinetic (PK) variability of orally inhaled drug products has been documented and can render single-batch PK bioequivalence (BE) studies unreliable; results from one batch may not be consistent with a repeated study using a different batch, yet the goal of PK BE is to deliver a product comparison that is interpretable beyond the specific batches used in the study. We characterized four multiple-batch PK BE approaches to improve outcome reliability without increasing the number of clinical study participants. Three approaches include multiple batches directly in the PK BE study with batch identity either excluded from the statistical model (\"Superbatch\") or included as a fixed or random effect (\"Fixed Batch Effect,\" \"Random Batch Effect\"). A fourth approach uses a bio-predictive in vitro test to screen candidate batches, bringing the median batch of each product into the PK BE study (\"Targeted Batch\"). Three of these approaches (Fixed Batch Effect, Superbatch, Targeted Batch) continue the single-batch PK BE convention in which uncertainty in the Test/Reference ratio estimate due to batch sampling is omitted from the Test/Reference confidence interval. All three of these approaches provided higher power to correctly identify true bioequivalence than the standard single-batch approach with no increase in clinical burden. False equivalence (type I) error was inflated above the expected 5% level, but multiple batches controlled type I error better than a single batch. The Random Batch Effect approach restored 5% type I error, but had low power for small (e.g., <8) batch sample sizes using standard [0.8000, 1.2500] bioequivalence limits.",

The GSDFs were prepared by melting nifedipine together with octaacetyl sucrose. Dissolution profiles, measured under standard and biorelevant conditions, were compared to those obtained from commercially available formulations containing nifedipine such as modified release (MR) tablets and osmotic release oral system (OROS). The results indicate that the dissolution profiles of the GSDFs with nifedipine are neither affected by the pH of the dissolution media, type and concentration of surfactants, nor by simulated mechanical stress of biorelevant intensity. Furthermore, it was found that the dissolution profiles of the novel dosage forms were similar to the profiles obtained from the nifedipine OROS. The formulation of GSDFs is relatively simple, and the dosage forms were found to have favorable dissolution characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tribo-charging is often a root cause of mass flow deviations and powder adhesion during continuous feeding. Thus, it may critically impact product quality. In this study, we characterized the volumetric (split- and pre-blend) feeding behavior and process-induced charge of two direct compression grades of polyols, galenIQ™ 721 (G721) for isomalt and PEARLITOL ® 200SD (P200SD) for mannitol, under different processing conditions. The feeding mass flow range and variability, hopper end fill level, and powder adhesion were profiled. The feeding-induced tribo-charging was measured using a Faraday cup. Both materials were comprehensively characterized for relevant powder properties, and their tribo-charging was investigated for its dependence on particle size and relative humidity. During split-feeding experiments, G721 showed a comparable feeding performance to P200SD with lower tribo-charging and adhesion to the screw outlet of the feeder. Depending on the processing condition, the charge density of G721 ranged from -0.01 up to -0.39 nC/g, and for P200SD from -3.19 up to -5.99 nC/g. Rather than differences in the particle size distribution of the two materials, their distinct surface and structural characteristics were found as the main factors affecting their tribo-charging. The good feeding performance of both polyol grades was also maintained during pre-blend feeding, where reduced tribo-charging and adhesion propensity was observed for P200SD (decreasing from -5.27 to -0.17 nC/g under the same feeding settings). Here, it is proposed that the mitigation of tribo-charging occurs due to a particle size-driven mechanism. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The focus of the current work is to study and demonstrate the impact of the design, the scale, and settings of fluid-bed coating equipment on the differences in pellet coating thickness, which in case of prolonged-release pellets dictates the drug release. In the first set of coating experiments, the pellet cores were coated with the Tartrazine dye with the aim of estimating the coating equipment performance in terms of coating thickness distribution, assessed through color hue. In the second set, drug-layered pellets were film-coated with prolonged-release coating and dissolution profile tests were performed to estimate the thickness and uniformity of the coating thickness among differently sized pellets. In both study parts, film coating was performed at the laboratory and the pilot scale and essentially two types of distribution plate and different height adjustments of the draft tube were compared. The dye coating study proved to be extremely useful, as the results enable process correction and the optimal use of the process equipment in combination with the appropriate process parameters. Preferential film coating of larger drug-containing pellets was confirmed on the laboratory scale, while on the pilot scale, it was possible to achieve preferential coating of smaller pellets using rational alternatives of settings, which is desirable in terms of particle size-independent drug release profile of such prolonged-release dosage forms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mucoadhesion-based drug delivery systems have recently gained interest because of their bio-adhesion capability, which results in enhanced residence time leading to prolonged duration of action with the mucosal surface, potentially improving compliance and convenience. Mucoadhesion testing of these formulations is widely reported; however, this is technically challenging due to the absence of any standard methods and difficulty in conducting mucoadhesion, formulation-mucosal surface interaction, mucosal surface topography and drug release in a single experiment. As these measurements are currently conducted separately, on replicate formulations, results can often be subjective and difficult to correlate. Hence, the aim of the present study was to develop a new AFM-based single-entity ex vivo muco-dissolution (MUCO-DIS) technique to simultaneously evaluate mucoadhesion force, 3D surface topography, polymer dissolution and drug release characteristics. To demonstrate the potential of the current technique, the interactions between model pectin microparticles containing metformin HCl and a range of gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces (gastric, small intestine, large intestine and buccal) were studied. This novel system has not only successfully determined the mucoadhesion force, polymer dissolution and drug release information but has also highlighted the difference in microparticle performance with different mucosal targets. The current work has highlighted the potential of this newly developed MUCO-DIS system and we believe this will be a valuable tool for characterising these popular pharmaceutical formulations. This technique could also provide an opportunity to other scientific fields to evaluate materials, substrate behaviour and their interactions in their hydrated state at nanoscale with real-time chemical and surface mapping.",

    "abstract": "Polymer-drug conjugates have gained significant attention as pro-drugs releasing an active substance as a result of enzymatic hydrolysis in physiological environment. In this study, a conjugate of 3-hydroxybutyric acid oligomers with a carboxylic acid group-bearing model drug (ibuprofen) was evaluated in vivo as a potential pro-drug for parenteral administration. Two different formulations, an oily solution and an o/w emulsion were prepared and administered intramuscularly (IM) to rabbits in a dose corresponding to 40 mg of ibuprofen/kilogramme. The concentration of ibuprofen in blood plasma was analysed by HPLC, following solid-phase extraction and using indometacin as internal standard (detection limit, 0.05 microg/ml). No significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters (C (max), T (max), AUC) were observed between the two tested formulations of the 3-hydroxybutyric acid conjugate. In comparison to the non-conjugated drug in oily solution, the relative bioavailability of ibuprofen conjugates from oily solution, and o/w emulsion was reduced to 17% and 10%, respectively. The 3-hydroxybutyric acid formulations released the active substance over a significantly extended period of time with ibuprofen still being detectable 24 h post-injection, whereas the free compound was almost completely eliminated as early as 6 h after administration. The conjugates remained in a muscle tissue for a prolonged time and can hence be considered as sustained release systems for carboxylic acid derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The acceptability and palatability of a dosage form are extremely important to improve patient compliance. Mixing oral solid dosage forms with food carriers is often necessary to ease swallowing and provide the taste-masking effect. The present research investigated how a liquid or semisolid carrier influences the disintegration time and drug dissolution rate of pellets and minitablets with diazepam. The disintegration of pellets and minitablets in liquid carriers (water, milk and apple juice) was determined using a texture analyser. Dissolution tests were performed for the dosage forms dispersed in gel vehicles (2% carmellose and 0.5% carbomer gels) or applesauce. The disintegration of minitablets in water and apple juice was fast (1 min), but it slowed to 3 and 5 min in milk and gel vehicles, respectively. The pellets disintegrated in liquid carriers within 3 min. The drug dissolution rate in 0.1 M HCl depended on the gel viscosity in this medium. The preserved high viscosity of a carmellose gel inhibited the dissolution of diazepam. On the other hand, the viscosity of the carbomer gel decreased rapidly, and in effect, the dissolution rate of diazepam from the incorporated pellets or minitablets was comparable to the dissolution from loose pellets or minitablets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Current trends in the pharmaceutical industry led to a demand for more flexible manufacturing processes with smaller batch sizes. Prepackaged nested vials that can be processed as a unit were introduced into the market to fulfill this need. However, vial nests provide a different thermal environment for the vials compared to a hexagonal packaging array and could therefore influence product temperature profiles, primary drying times, and product quality attributes. Polymer caps with the possibility of vial closure inside the freeze-drying chamber were developed to remove the risks and need of a crimping process. A general concern with the use of such caps is the possibility of an increase in resistance to water vapor flow out of the vial. This case study investigated the effect of the LyoSeal ® and PLASCAP ® polymer caps and EZ-fill ® nests on the freeze-drying process. Amorphous and partially crystalline model formulations were freeze-dried. Process data and product quality attributes were compared for regularly stoppered vials and vials with polymer caps as well as vials in a hexagonal packaging array and nested vials. The results indicated no increased resistance or impeded water vapor flow by the polymer caps. Differences in the macro- and microscopic appearances of products and a trend towards lower product temperatures were observed for the investigated nest type compared to a regular hexagonal packaging array. Consequently, the polymer caps could be used as an alternative to regular stoppers without affecting freeze-drying process data or product quality attributes, while the different thermal environment of nested vials should be considered.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a feed rate control strategy for a novel volumetric micro-feeder, which can accomplish low-dose feeding of pharmaceutical raw materials with significantly different powder properties. The developed feed-forward control strategy enables a constant feed rate with a minimum deviation from the set-point, even for materials that are typically difficult to accurately feed (e.g., due to high cohesion or low density) using conventional continuous feeders. Density variations observed during the feeding process were characterized via a displacement feed factor profile for each powder. The characterized effective displacement density profile was applied in the micro-feeder system to proactively control the feed rate by manipulating the powder displacement rate (i.e., computing the feed rate from the powder displacement rate). Based on the displacement feed factor profile, the feed rate can be predicted during the feeding process and at any feed rate set-point. Three pharmaceutically relevant materials were used for the micro-feeder evaluation: di-calcium phosphate (large-particle system, high density), croscarmellose sodium (small-particle system, medium density), and barium sulfate (very small-particle <10 μm, high density). A significant improvement in the feeding performance was achieved for all investigated materials. The feed rate deviation from the set-point and its relative standard deviation were minimal compared to operations without the control strategy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study is to evaluate the cooperative interactions between formulation variables of ropinirole transdermal patches and characterize the effects of drug loading and crystallinity, degree of ionization and drug-polymer solubilization, functionalization of acrylate polymeric basis, and the addition of permeation enhancers over the release profiles. Several series of transdermal films based on carboxylic or hydroxylic acrylates (DuroTak®) and containing 1 to 10% ropinirole hydrochloride were laminated by mold-casting and evaporation. Formulations were characterized for crystallinity, drug particle size, drug assay, and residual solvents. Release profiles were obtained at different drug ionization state using paddle over disk apparatus. Mechanisms were elucidated with nonlinear data fitting of relevant release equations. Fickian and erosion processes were evaluated with the Peppas–Sahlin equation, and burst release risks were estimated as an independent term added to Higuchi kinetics. X-ray diffraction and microscopy evidenced differences in drug-polymer solubilization and density of drug crystals. Concerning drug release, area under the curve of dissolved quantities and release percentage were discriminant variables in mutual influence. Peppas–Shalin equation was the majority descriptor of release suggesting a combination of Fickian and erosion processes, revealing a decrease in the Fickian component as drug loading increased. Major burst release risks were evidenced mostly with Higuchi kinetics with vinylacetate acrylates. The carboxylic polymer without vinylacetate provided the best release extent, being more highly efficient as lower the drug loading was. Permeation enhancers with carboxylic or aliphatic radicals have, additionally, modified the release properties of ropinirole. Chemical interactions between the drug and acrylic polymers have been demonstrated. Only the effect with carboxylic polymer is pH dependent. The vinyl acetate comonomer reduces the drug release rate most effectively in formulations with low drug loads. The acrylic polymers without vinylacetate achieved the highest drug solubilization and thus the highest degree of release, providing a release of approximately 15% of the drug load.",

    "abstract": "The human operator is acknowledged as the greatest potential source of contamination in aseptic processing. To avoid contamination, barrier systems have progressively reduced the amount of human intervention in the critical zone. This study extends the trajectory of enhanced patient safety through the elimination of human intervention in aseptic filling. Eight companies that are users of closed robotic workcells have aggregated their usage data from 2018 to 2021. The study analyzes the critical design elements and performance of the Cytiva SA25 Aseptic Filling Workcell. The SA25 is a standardized, fully closed robotic system for aseptic filling of vials, syringes, and cartridges that eliminates operator intervention in the critical zone. The standardized design means that the system is not modified to suit a particular application and the same environmental monitoring strategy can be used across different installations. The SA25 provides significantly increased sterility assurance when producing sterile injectables. Users have observed non-viable particle levels well within ISO 5/Grade A air requirements, with extremely low probabilities of entering a dosage container. There have been zero cases of microbial growth in more than 250 media fills and good manufacturing practice (GMP) batches. Across all dosage formats and sizes, the aseptic process is repeatable, with more than 99.3% of units meeting acceptance criteria. These data demonstrate that eliminating risk through design is successful in the SA25, with an improved aseptic process in comparison to filling systems using Restricted Access Barrier Systems (RABS) or isolators with glove ports. One of the contributing companies to this article achieved an industry first. The U.S. FDA-approved commercial production of their biologic drugs without the requirement for routine viable environmental monitoring (EM), requiring viable EM only during process simulations. Based on the data presented and planned future research, new regulatory consideration should be made for closed robotic workcells to ensure that regulations meant for previous technologies with different risk profiles are not inappropriately applied.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The continuous manufacturing (CM) of solid oral dosage forms has received increased attention in recent years and has become a leading technology in the pharmaceutical industry. A model has been developed based on process data from two design of experiments (DoEs), where the impact of the mixer process parameters, throughput (THR), hold up mass (HUM), impeller speed (IMP), and the input raw material bulk density (BD i ), on the continuous process and the resulting drug product has been investigated. These statistical models revealed equations, describing process parameter interactions for optimization purposes. For the exit valve opening width (EV) at the bottom of the continuous mixer (CMT), the combination of high throughput (30 kg/h) and low impeller speed (300 rpm) resulted in optimal process conditions. Apparent bulk density of the blend (BD) within the process, fill depth (FD), and tensile strength (TS) were mainly impacted by input bulk density (BD i ) of the tableting mixture, emphasizing the role of material attributes on the continuous manufacturing process. The apparent bulk density itself was, other than from the input bulk density, equally dependent from THR and IMP in opposite deflections. However, process parameters (THR and IMP) revealed a minor impact on the apparent BD compared to the input bulk density. FD was impacted mainly by THR ahead of IMP and the TS by IMP and THR to a similar extend, in opposite deflections. A simplified linear model to estimate the input bulk density revealed satisfactory prediction quality when included in the derived statistical model equations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Subcutaneous injections of phosphatidylcholine (PC), sodium deoxycholate (NADC), and a mixture of them were found to be an effective option for treating cellulite. However, it is noteworthy that the injection of NADC may result in inflammation as well as necrosis in the injection area. The preparation of a sustained release formulation based on lipid-liquid crystal that controls the release of NADC could be a potential solution to address the issue of inflammation and necrosis at the site of injection. To present a practical and validated approach for accurately determining the concentration of NADC in LLC formulations, spectrofluorimetry was used based on the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) Q2 guidelines. Based on the validation results, the fluorometric technique has been confirmed as a reliable, efficient, and economical analytical method for quantifying NADC concentrations. The method demonstrated favorable attributes of linearity, precision, and accuracy, with an r 2 value of 0.999. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent interday and intraday repeatability, with RSD values below 4%. The recovery percentages ranged from 97 to 100%, indicating the method’s ability to accurately measure NADC concentrations. The subcutaneous injection of the LLC-NADC demonstrated a reduction in inflammation and tissue necrosis in skin tissue, along with an increase in fat lysis within 30 days, when compared to the administration of only NADC solution. Moreover, the histopathological assessment confirmed that the use of the LLC formulation did not result in any detrimental side effects for kidney or heart tissue.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study investigates the impact of the solid-state disorder of vortioxetine hydrobromide (HBr) on oxidative degradation under accelerated conditions. A range of solid-state disorders was generated via cryogenic ball milling. The solid-state properties were evaluated by calorimetry, infrared-, and Raman spectroscopies. While salt disproportionation occurred upon milling, no chemical degradation occurred by milling. The amorphous fraction remained physically intact under ambient storage conditions. Subsequently, samples with representative disordered fractions were mixed with a solid oxidative stressor (PVP-H 2 O 2 complex) and were compressed to compacts. The compacts were exposed to 40°C/75% RH for up to 6 h. The sample was periodically withdrawn and analyzed for the physical transformations and degradation. Two oxidative degradation products (DPs) were found to be formed, for which dissimilar relations to the degree of disorder and kinetics of formation were observed. The degradation rate of the major DP formation obtained by fitting the exponential model to the experimental data was found to increase up to a certain degree of disorder and decrease with a further increase in the disordered fraction. In contrast, the minor DP formation kinetics was found to increase monotonically with the increase in the disorder content. For the similar crystallinity level, the degradation trend (rate and extent) differed between the single-phase disorder generated by milling and physically mixed two-phase systems. Overall, the study demonstrates the importance of evaluating the physical and chemical (in)stabilities of the disordered solid state of a salt form of a drug substance, generated through mechano-activation.

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of apex vessels may solve coning problems associated with dissolution testing. However, excessive dissolution acceleration can reduce the discriminatory power. This study aimed to clarify how different apex vessel sizes affect the dissolution behavior of cone-forming formulations. Five apex vessels with different heights, centralities, and compendial vessels were used. The paddle rotation speed at which the coning phenomenon resolved was measured using standard particles of different densities. Three model formulations—USP prednisone tablets, atorvastatin calcium hydrate tablets, and levofloxacin fine granules—were selected, and dissolution tests were conducted at 30–100 revolutions per minute (rpm). Compared to the compendial vessels, the disappearance of standard particles at the apex base at lower paddle speeds in apex vessels was observed. Standard particles tended to remain in the center of the apex vessels and disappear at rotational speeds comparable to those of the compendial vessels. Dissolution increased in an apex height-dependent manner in the model formulations, except for the atorvastatin calcium hydrate tablets at 50 rpm. For levofloxacin fine granules, dissolution was also improved by reducing the paddle agitation speed to 30 rpm in the compendial vessels. Differences in apex centrality by 3 mm did not affect the dissolution rate. Our results indicate that apex vessels with low apex heights have a mount-resolving effect, but the degree of dissolution improvement by avoiding the coning phenomenon depends on the formulation characteristics used in the dissolution tests.

    "abstract": "Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, resulting in the highest mortality rates among both men and women with respect to all other types of cancer. Difficulties in treating lung cancer arise from late-stage diagnoses and tumor heterogeneity and current treatment involves a combination of chemotherapeutics, surgery, and radiation. Chemotherapeutics administered systemically can lead to undesirable side effects and severe off-site toxicity. For example, chronic administration of the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) leads to cardiotoxicity, thereby limiting its long-term use. Systemic administration of the highly lipophilic molecule paclitaxel (PTX) is hindered by its water solubility, necessitating the use of solubilizing agents, which can induce side effects. Thus, in this investigation, formulations consisting of spray-dried microparticles (MP) containing DOX and PTX were produced to be administered as dry powder aerosols directly to the lungs. Acetalated dextran (Ac-Dex) was used as the polymer in these formulations, as it is a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer that exhibits pH-responsive degradation. Solid-state characterization revealed that DOX and PTX remained in solubility favoring amorphous states in the MP formulations and that both drugs remained thermally stable throughout the spray drying process. In vitro release studies demonstrated the pH sensitivity of the formulations due to the use of Ac-Dex, as well as the release of both therapeutics over the course of at least 48 h. In vitro aerosol dispersion studies demonstrated that both formulations exhibited suitable aerosol dispersion properties for deep lung delivery. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Aqueous suspensions containing crystalline drug in the sub-micron range is a favorable platform for long-acting injectables where particle size can be used to obtain a desired plasma-concentration profile. Stabilizers are added to the suspensions and screened extensively to define the optimal formulation composition. In the initial formulation screening the amount of drug compound can be limited, necessitating milling methods for small-volume screening predictable for scale-up. Hence, adaptive focused ultrasound was investigated as a potential milling method for rapid small-volume suspensions by identifying the critical process parameters during preparation. Suspensions containing drug compounds with different mechanical properties and thereby grindability, i.e., cinnarizine, haloperidol, and indomethacin with brittle, elastic, and plastic properties, respectively, were investigated to gain an understanding of the manufacturing with adaptive focused acoustics as well as comparison to already established milling techniques. Using a DoE-design, peak incident power was identified as the most crucial process parameter impacting the milling process for all three compounds. It was possible to decrease the sizes of drug particles to micron range after one minute of focused ultrasound exposure which was superior compared to other milling techniques (e.g., non-focused ultrasound exposure). The addition of milling beads decreased the drug particle sizes even further, thus to a lower degree than other already established milling techniques such as milling by dual centrifugation. This study thereby demonstrated that adaptive focused ultrasonication was a promising method for rapid homogenization and particle size reduction to micron range for different compounds varying in grindability without altering the crystalline structure.

Release studies of Trental ® SR 400 mg (Sanofi, Egypt), were carried-out in the FTC under different conditions, including: different volumes / compositions of release media, variable FTC flow patterns as well as applying open / closed loop configuration setups. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data, obtained from literature, were converted to in-vivo fraction-absorbed [F A ] using Wagner-Nelson (WN) method. A 1:1 IVIVC was investigated by comparing PTX fraction-dissolved [F D ] under different FTC release designs versus calculated [F A ]. Predicted PK parameters were evaluated, and compared with actual data, with estimation of prediction-error (PE%). The suggested FTC design; a closed-loop setup, with turbulent-flow pattern of the dissolution medium; provided the most acceptable PTX release according to USP labeled limits (USP 27). Also, results showed that PTX release was pronouncedly increased in a finite-volume of gradient-buffer system rather than water, which guarantee complete resemblance to GIT environment. This release design presented the most predictive IVIVC model with PTX in-vivo performance under fasting / fed states, with acceptable PE% values in terms of C max and AUCs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nasal medications hold significant importance and are widely utilized due to their numerous advantageous properties, offering a compelling route for both local and systemic therapeutic effects. Nowadays, the development of nasal particles under 1 micrometer is in the focus of much scientific research. In our experiments, the use of innovative nanotechnology to increase the effectiveness of the active substance was of paramount importance. Our aim was to create solid nanoparticles that enable targeted and effective delivery of the active ingredient into the body. The innovation of this experimental series lies not only in highlighting the importance of amphiphilic compounds in enhancing penetration, but also in the fact that while most nasally administered formulations are in liquid form, our formulation is solid. Liquid formulations frequently suffer from the disadvantage of possible leakage during administration, which can reduce the bioavailability of the active ingredient. In our experiments we created novel drug delivery systems of finely divided powders, which, thanks to the penetration enhancers, can be successfully administered. These enhancers facilitate the swift disintegration and penetration of the particles through the membrane. This represents a new direction in nasal drug delivery methods. The results of our trials are promising in the development of innovative pharmaceutical products and outline the role of amphiphilic compounds in more efficient utilization and targeted application of active substances. According to our results it can be concluded that this innovative approach not only addresses the common issues associated with liquid nasal formulations but also paves the way for more stable and effective delivery methods. The use of finely divided powders for nasal delivery, enabled by penetration enhancers, represents a major breakthrough in the field, providing a dependable alternative to conventional liquid formulations and ensuring improved therapeutic results.

    "abstract": "Abstract Norepinephrine is a potent α-sympathomimetic drug which plays an important role in the acute treatment of hypotension and shock. Commercially available norepinephrine solutions contain sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) as an antioxidant. However, prefilled cyclic olefin polymer syringes are not compatible with sodium metabisulfite. The aim of this study was to develop a new formulation of 0.1-mg/mL norepinephrine solution without sodium metabisulfite which is chemically stable and sterile and can be stored in prefilled polymer syringes. Formulation studies were performed with 0.1-mg/mL norepinephrine solution with 0, 0.05, or 0.1% ascorbic acid added as antioxidant. The syringes were filled under nitrogen gassing, stored at 20 ± 5°C, and protected from daylight. Based on the formulation test results, the final formulation was defined and stability testing at 20 ± 5°C was performed measuring norepinephrine concentration, pH, clarity, color of the solution, subvisible particles, and sterility at time intervals up to 12 months. The norepinephrine concentrations at t = 22 weeks were 100.4%, 95.4%, and 92.2% for the formulations with no ascorbic acid and with 0.05% and 0.10% ascorbic acid, respectively. Three batches for the stability study were produced containing norepinephrine, sodium edetate, sodium chloride, and water for injections filled under nitrogen gassing and stored at 20 ± 5°C. Norepinephrine concentrations were respectively 98.8%, 98.6%, and 99.3% for batches 1, 2, and 3 at t = 12 months. It can be concluded that norepinephrine (0.1 mg/mL) solution without metabisulfite is stable for at least 12 months at room temperature when protected from daylight.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this research was to assess the applicability of manometric temperature measurement (MTM) and SMART™ for cycle development and monitoring of critical product and process parameters in a mini-freeze dryer using a small set of seven vials. Freeze drying cycles were developed using SMART™ which automatically defines and adapts process parameters based on input data and MTM feedback information. The freeze drying behavior and product characteristics of an amorphous model system were studied at varying wall temperature control settings of the cylindrical wall surrounding the shelf in the mini-freeze dryer. Calculated product temperature profiles were similar for all different wall temperature settings during the MTM-SMART™ runs and in good agreement with the temperatures measured by thermocouples. Product resistance profiles showed uniformity in all of the runs conducted in the mini-freeze dryer, but absolute values were slightly lower compared to values determined by MTM in a LyoStar™ pilot-scale freeze dryer. The resulting cakes exhibited comparable residual moisture content and optical appearance to the products obtained in the larger freeze dryer. An increase in intra-vial heterogeneity was found for the pore morphology in the cycle with deactivated wall temperature control in the mini-freeze dryer. SMART™ cycle design and product attributes were reproducible and a minimum load of seven 10R vials was identified for more accurate MTM values. MTM-SMART™ runs suggested, that in case of the wall temperature following the product temperature of the center vial, product temperatures differ only slightly from those in the LyoStar™ freeze dryer.",

    "abstract": "Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic drug used for parasitic infections. In addition, due to its mechanism of action, it has been studied as an anticancer agent. However, poor and highly variable bioavailability are limiting factors for its use in systemic illnesses. The present study aimed to develop two parenteral formulations of albendazole and to compare its pharmacokinetic profile with the conventional oral administration. Parenteral formulations were developed using two different approaches: a phosphonooxymethylated prodrug and cosolvents. For the albendazole prodrug, once synthetized, its solubility and hydrolysis with alkaline phosphatase were evaluated. A factorial design of experiments was used for the cosolvent formulation. Stability and hemolytic activity were assessed. A pharmacokinetic study was performed on New Zealand rabbits. Both formulations were administered intravenously, and the prodrug was also administered intramuscularly. Results were compared with those obtained after the oral administration of albendazole. A 20,000-fold and 6000-fold increase in albendazole solubility was found with the prodrug and cosolvent formulations, respectively. Both parenteral formulations displayed higher albendazole plasma concentrations for the first 2 h compared with oral administration, even when the oral dose was doubled. The absolute bioavailability of oral albendazole was 15.5% while for the intramuscular administration of the prodrug was 102.6%. Both parenteral formulations showed a significant decrease in the formation of albendazole sulfoxide (ANOVA p<0.05) and allowed greater exposure to albendazole. Albendazole cosolvent parenteral formulation could be a promising option in systemic illnesses considering its ease of preparation and superb pharmacokinetic performance.",

    "abstract": "Starting point of the presented study were abrasion effects occurring during a twin screw wet granulation (TSG) process of a new chemical entity (NCE) formulation, resulting in gray spots on the final tablets. Several actions and systematic changes of equipment and process parameter settings of TSG process were conducted which reduced the visual defect rate of the tablets, i.e., gray spots on the surface, below the specification limit. To understand the rationale and mechanism behind these improvements, correlations of defect rates and wall friction measurements using a Schulze ring shear tester were evaluated. To check the suitability of the method, a broad range of wall materials as well as powder formulations at various moisture levels were investigated with regard to their wall friction angle. As differences in wall friction angle could be detected, further experiments were conducted using wall material samples made out of different screw materials for TSG. Evaluation of these screw wall material samples gave first hints, which screw materials should be preferred in regard of friction for TSG process. In the finally presented case study, wall friction measurements were performed using the above mentioned NCE formulation with known abrasion issues at TSG processing. The results confirmed that changes which led to a reduced visual defect rate of tablets correlated with a decreased wall friction angle. The results suggest wall friction measurements as a potent tool for equipment selection and establishment of a suitable process window prior to conducting TSG experiments.",
