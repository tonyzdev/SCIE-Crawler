    "abstract": "Aloe vera gel is popular as a beauty product, laxative, and herbal medicine, including antipsoriatic and therapeutic properties with antimicrobial activities. Aloe vera gel has been detected for the antipsoriatic potentials, some physical parameters, phytochemical, and biological activities against multiple microbial pathogens. HaCaT cells treated with 100 µg/ml demonstrated the most inhibition 71.55 % followed by 50 µg/ml treatment which reported 69.05 % against the psoriatic cells. Color index was recorded (33.52, 7.88, and 35.78) for L*, a*, and b*, respectively. The results indicated that only mannose and glucose were the main sugar components (85.98 % and 13.55 %). Results showed that the most abundant flavonoid was kaempefrol (6770 mg/kg) followed by myricetin (12.10 mg/kg) and quercetin (4.22 mg/kg). Aloe vera gel extract at a concentration of 500 µg/mL showed the maximum scavenging ability 90.83 %, followed by 84.19 % and 84.01 % for the other concentrations 20 µg/mL and 1000 µg/mL, respectively, Using Aleo vera gel detected higher values than the commercial inulin oligofructan which recorded (2.44, 2.58, and 2.99 fold increase) and (0.88, 0.78, and 0.77 fold increase) for L. plantarum, L. fermentum, and L. casei, respectively. The Aloe vera gel at the concentration of 100 μg/ml reported a 20.25 mm diameter zone of inhibition against Escherichia coli, followed by 22.47 and 23.58 mm zone of inhibition against Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus. More researches are needed to fully understand the adaptability of Aloe vera extracts, which hold promise for pharmacological and nutrition-related applications.",

We identified 2273 publications, and 26 sources described studies that met the minimum criteria for a cancer patient who was treated with ivermectin. The limited data available suggest that parasite-infected ivermectin cancer patients are safe. However, we still need data from carefully designed clinical trials to provide further assurance.",

    "abstract": "Data from the World Health Organization show that cancer is a primary cause of death worldwide. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most common head and neck carcinomas (HNC). The rising incidence of cancer over the last few decades requires treatment with a lack of side effects. Among compounds of natural origin, a lot of attention has focused on flavonoids with high pharmacological potential. We used cytotoxic tests and a DNA biosynthesis assay to estimate the anticancer potential of 30 structurally diverse flavonoids in SCC-25 cells and fibroblasts. In both cytotoxicity assays (MTT and NRU tests) the most active flavonoids were apigenin (1), luteolin (5) and genistein (30). The DNA biosynthesis assay showed that a decrease in cancer cell viability may be associated with a reduced cell proliferation rate. Compounds 5 (IC50 = 35.7 ± 1.5 μM) and 1 (IC50 = 43.3 ± 2.0 μM) evoked DNA biosynthesis-inhibitory activity in an oral squamous carcinoma cell line after 48 h of incubation. Our results provide information about the importance of the flavonoid core substituted with free hydroxyl groups when searching for potential drugs to use in tongue squamous cell carcinoma treatment. However, further in vivo studies are needed to assess their anticancer activity.",

Fate and behavior of pharmaceuticals in waterThe amounts of medicine residues in the environment depends primarily on quantity of the pharmaceuticals produced and discharged into the environment, their degradation, partial decomposition, as well as dissolution processes decreasing concentrations of these chemical substances in a given environmental medium (water, sediment, soil) (6).The processes described above bring about everincreasing amounts of the discussed chemicals in the environment, even though their durability is by and large relatively low.In most cases, the processes leading to the reduction of pharmaceutical amounts in the environment include biodegradation, hydrolysis and direct or indirect photodegradation of these substances.For example, due to poor ability to hydrolyze, pharmaceutical compounds are abiotically transformed in the surface waters mainly through photolysis.This process takes place both in natural waters and wastewaters (2, 6).Some of medicines discharged into the environment are resistant to photolysis (diclofenac, carbamazepine).",

These compounds are known for their analgesic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. γ-Terpinene is recognized for its potent antioxidant propeties and is a constituent of oils from plants such as cumin and thyme. p-cymene, found in over 100 plant species, is noted for its antiviral and antibacterial properties and is considered safe by IFRA standards. p-Cymenene, with its distinct aroma, is detected in parsley and turmeric oils and is known for its antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The antimicrobial properties of γ-terpinene and p-cymene are highlighted, demonstrating their effectiveness in treating various skin conditions and reducing airborne microbes. Their selective antimicrobial activity preserves the integrity of the microbiome, offering a balanced approach to infection control. The anti-inflammatory properties of γ-terpinene are emphasized, with studies indicating its role in modulating cytokine production, underscoring its potential in the treatment of inflammation. Additionally, its antinociceptive effects suggest that it is a safe analgesic. In cancer treatment, the antiproliferative effects of γ-terpinene and p-cymene are being explored, highlighting their potential for targeted cancer therapy. This review aims to consolidate knowledge about these monoterpenes and promote a deeper understanding of their medical applications and safety. The knowledge gained is expected to stimulate further research, potentially leading to innovative applications in pharmaceutical and medical fields and harnessing the potential of -terpinene, p-cymene, and p-cymenene.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to develop and evaluate reconstitutable suspensions of ibuprofen-loaded microspheres prepared with an acrylic polymer (Eudragit RS-PM). The microspheres were prepared by the quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion technique. To prepare reconstitutable suspension formulation, the microspheres used had a mean particle size of 316.6 microm and 99.8% loading efficiency. Xanthan gum was chosen as the suspending agent for the suspension formulations. D-sorbitol was used to impart palatability of suspensions. The amount of D-sorbitol affected sedimentation volume and redispersibility properties of suspensions. The highest improving effect was shown with 20.0% and 25.0% of D-sorbitol concentrations. It was observed that dispersion media of suspensions showed non-Newtonian flow characteristics. To ensure minimum drug leakage from the microspheres into the suspension, the pH was buffered at 3.60 using citrate buffer. The ibuprofen content calculated from the suspended microspheres was consistent with that from microspheres alone. This result indicated that no leakage of drug occurred from the microspheres in the suspension on storage. Moreover, the same release rate of ibuprofen from the microspheres suspension and microspheres alone indicated that the suspension medium studied did not affect the property of drug release. This study suggested that stable suspensions of ibuprofen-loaded microspheres could be formulated with 0.6% w/v xanthan gum by the addition of 20% w/v D-sorbitol.",

The validated consumption frequency questionnaire of the examples of goitrogenic foods in four groups of people (n=365) on afore-mentioned diets, was performed in Poland in 2022. The statistical correspondence analysis model (CAM) was used to quantify and reveal potential relations between dietary habits and thyroid dysfunction, family history of thyroid disease, use of thyroid drugs (L-thyroxine, propylthiouracil, thiamazole), or iodine dietary supplements/drugs. Statistical analyses revealed an increased odds ratio more than 3, 8, and 6 times higher for tofu; plant-based meat; and soy beverages, respectively, by vegetarian’s vs traditional diet. Respondents with diagnosed hypothyroidism consumed soy, flax products, but avoided iodine-rich products. All respondents on traditional diet used iodine-rich products while 22% vegetarian and 23% vegan excluded them. CAM analysis did not show any relation between brassica vegetables and thyroid dysfunction. Despite the results obtained using food questionnaire were not combined with biochemicals data, some tendencies in food behavior among Polish vegans, vegetarians, and pescovegetarians appeared. Apart from some interesting correlations and tendencies, revealed in our study, further in-depth research, combined with biochemical analysis, will allow to better understand, and explain these observations. Still, the effort should be made in the future in equalizing the proportions of female and male participants of such studies, what should bring some additional data on the gender influence.",

On the basis of the structural analogy between platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes, a variety of studies on palladium(II) compounds as potential anticancer drugs have been carried out (1, 2). The cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Abilities of trans-palladium(II) complex containing diethyl (pyridin-2-ylmethyl)phosphates as non-leaving ligands (trans-[PdCl2(2-pmOpe 2)]) to induce apoptosis and necrosis in normal lymphocytes, A549 cells and HT29 cell lines were performed by use of fluorochrome staining. The obtained results revealed, that the new trans-palladium(II) complex was more cytotoxic against A549 and HT29 tumor cells than on the normal lymphocytes in vitro. The novel complex induces apoptosis in all tested cells, but in lymphocytes to a lesser degree. The compound tested also induced significant amounts of necrotic cells, which exceeded the level of apoptotic cell fractions. The results demonstrate that the trans-Pd(II) complex showed substantial cytotoxic activity against A549 and HT29 tumor cells and indicate that the new trans-palladium(II) complex effectively inhibited cancer cells growth.",

    "abstract": "The most dangerous environmental factor for our skin condition is ultraviolet light radiation. Chronic exposition to ultraviolet light can induce epidermal atrophy, keratosis, depigmentation and dysplasia. In the dermis, UV light causes dramatic up-regulation of extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are engaged in collagen, elastin and other extracellular matrix components degradation. In addition, to increase level of destructive enzymes, UV light has been shown to decrease collagen production. As a consequence of UV impact on skin, it shows signs of aging including loss of tone and elasticity, increased skin fragility, blood vessels weakness and wrinkles. The most dangerous effect of UV on skin is an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Retinoids are well known antiaging agents. For many years this vitamin has been used for the prevention and treatment of photoaging. Retinoids abolish cellular atypia, increase compacting of the stratum corneum and reduce skin hyperpigmentation caused by sun light. Recent evidence suggests that retinoids also play a role in the prevention of aging, because of its inhibitory effects on metalloproteinases expression. The aim of this study was to examine if all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) effects MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-14 gene expression in fibroblasts cultured in vitro.",

Each mouse from B(a)P and B(a)P + A. indica groups received intragastric instillations of B(a)P at a dose of 40 mg/kg b. w. in 0.2 mL olive oil twice a week, starting from 3rd week to the end of 6th week of the experiment. Mice of control and A. indica groups received 0.2 mL olive oil in the same schedule as for B(a)P and B(a)P + A indica groups. Mice of A. indica and B(a)P + A. indica groups received oral doses of 100 mg/kg b. w. aqueous A. indica leaf extract (AAILE) on alternate days throughout the experiment. Two weeks after the last B(a)P instillation, mice were sacrificed and spleens were processed for micronucleus (MN) assay, while liver tissues were analyzed for lipid peroxidation (LPO), as well as antioxidant defense enzymes, namely: catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The incidence of MN formation increased in spleen cells of mice that received only B(a)P instillations. In hepatic tissues, the extent of oxidative stress increased upon B(a)P instillations as was evidenced from enhanced LPO levels with concomitant decrease in antioxidant defense enzyme activities in mice that received only B(a)P instillations. Interestingly, A. indica treatment significantly reversed these effects as observed in mice receiving AAILE along with B(a)P when compared to only B(a)P receiving mice. Moreover, in only AAILE receiving mice, enhanced antioxidant defense with slightly decreased levels of LPO as well as MN incidences were observed. Observations of the present study suggest that A. indica exert anticlastogenic effects against B(a)P by modulating oxidative stress and antioxidant defense.",

Combination effects between isothiocyanates and 5-fluorouracil were estimated in the way described by Chou and Talalay. The cycle progression and the living cells number were determined with flow cytometry. The type of cell death was detected with a confocal micro- scope. There was observed an antagonistic effect which was mainly dependent on the cell cycle distribution e.g., sulforaphane increased the cell number in the G2/M phase, whereas 5-fluorouracil and combination of these two compounds increased the cell number in the S phase. If each compound blocked the S phase of the cell cycle, their combination increased the cell number in the S phase, but the increase was not statistically sig- nificant when compared with single substance treatments. The highest antagonistic effect in normal cells was obtained for co-administrated 5-fluorouracil and 2-oxoheptyl isothiocyanate at the fraction affected at 0.5 and 0.75.

The PT compound was synthesized with excellent yield and purity using a straightforward nucleophillic synthetic approach via reacting procaine with di-substituted 1,3,5-triazine derivative. Arthritis was induced using CFA, and the PT derivative was administered at varying doses (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg.body weight). Throughout the study, multiple physical and biochemical parameters were assessed to determine the therapeutic impact. PT treatment significantly reduced paw swelling and improved body weight in a dose-dependent manner. Biochemical analysis revealed a marked decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17) along with an upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4), indicating a potent anti-inflammatory response. Additionally, PT restored oxidative stress markers—such as malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH)—to levels close to those in healthy controls. In summary, these findings demonstrate that the procaine-1,3,5-triazine derivative offers significant pharmacological benefits by alleviating CFA-induced rheumatoid arthritis through anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant actions.",

Among the drugs screened for new biological activities that could be used in therapeutic applications are metformin and melatonin. The aim of the study was to perform the predictive in silico study of potential outcomes of melatonin and metformin co-treatment and to evaluate the impact of melatonin and metformin individually and in combination on the growth of melanoma and breast cancer cells. Computer-based analysis identified diseases, proteins, and pathways that are susceptible to modulation by these two drugs simultaneously. Among proteins with the highest probability of interaction with both drugs are molecules relates to intracellular signaling pathways and apoptosis such as AKT kinase, MAPK8 kinase, mTOR, FOXO3, p53, and caspases. The results obtained revealed that the simultaneous use of melatonin and metformin exerted an additive or synergistic inhibitory impact on the growth of breast cancer cells, although this effect was not observed against melanoma cells. The synergistic effect of both compounds used together is caused by reducing cell proliferation and/or increasing apoptosis of breast cancer cell. In conclusion, the results presented indicate that the combination of melatonin and metformin may have a potential anticancer effect on breast cancer cells. However, additional studies are needed to evaluate the mechanism of action of the combined treatment of melatonin and metformin on cancer cells.",

(C.Cassia) bark contains high amounts of antioxidant phenolic compounds and flavonoids Data on various biological properties of different extracts still appear to be insufficient in the literature. In this study, we prepared three extracts from C. cassia bark using hexane, chloroform, and methanol as solvents with different polarities. The study aimed to obtain a comparative analysis of the main components and antioxidant properties of these extracts. For the evaluation of antioxidant properties, total phenolic/flavonoid contents, and DPPH radical scavenging activity were determined. We investigated possible protective effects of the extracts against H2O2-induced oxidative damage and applied WST-1 test for the evaluation of cytotoxicity. Active ingredients were analyzed by HPLC method. Extraction yield and free radical scavenging activity were found to be highest in methanol extract. In HPLC analysis of the extracts, the highest levels of cinnamaldehyde and polyphenols were found in the methanol extract. In Comet assay, all extracts provided protection against H2O2-induced DNA damage in the range of 26% to 110%. However, methanol extract was the most effective extract on lymphocytes under oxidative stress(p&lt;0,05). In this study, high cinnamaldehyde levels were detected in the methanol extract, and it was found to be more effective than other extracts.",

To investigate the constituents and cytotoxicity of fatty oils extracted from different parts of Scutellaria barbata D. Don, namely seeds, stems, leaves, roots, and flowers, the oils were derived and analyzed using GC-MS. The anti-hepatoma activities of these fatty oils against the SMMC-7721 cell line were evaluated through cell viability assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, and V-FITC/PI staining assay. Western blot analysis quantified apoptosis-related proteins in SMMC-7721 cells treated with SBO. The results demonstrated that SBO exhibited significant anti-hepatoma activities. Fluorescent microscope analysis revealed nucleus shrinkage or fragmentation in cells incubated with SBO, while flow cytometry confirmed pro-apoptotic effects. Protein analysis indicated that SBO induced apoptosis by down-regulating Bcl-2 and p-STAT3, up-regulating Bax, as well as activating caspase 9, caspase 8, and caspase 3 cleavage. The potential mechanisms of SBO-induced apoptosis involved the caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway, the Bcl-2/bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway, and the IL-6/STAT3 pathway.",

    "abstract": "The Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA) is a comprehensive and explicit instrument for assessing ageism, developed in Canada. However, the effectiveness of its translation into Serbian has not been previously tested. Our aim was to translate the FSA into Serbian, conduct transcultural adaptation, and evaluate its psychometric properties for assessing ageism among community pharmacists. The study adhered to the Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines for the translation and transcultural adaptation of questionnaires. The translation was tested on a sample of 436 community pharmacists in Serbia. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, and exploratory factor analysis was conducted using the generalized least squares method with varimax rotation. The final adapted Serbian translation of the FSA consists of 23 questions and demonstrates good reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.821. Factor analysis identified seven dimensions of ageism, categorized into cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects. Factors 1, 4, and 6 (Social Separation of the Elderly, Discrimination Against the Elderly, and Avoidance of Socializing with the Elderly) pertain to the behavioral aspect of ageism. Factors 2 and 3 (Avoidance of Communication with the Elderly and Avoidance of Living with the Elderly) relate to the affective aspect, while Factors 5 and 7 address the cognitive aspect of ageism. The translated and modified FSA scale is a reliable tool for detecting and quantifying ageism among community pharmacists in Serbia.",

IMPPAT and SwissADME were used to screen phytochemicals for druglikeness and bioavailability. MOLSOFT measured druglikeness, whereas ProTox 3.0 assessed toxicity. SwissTarget Prediction and GeneCards identified biological and lung cancer targets, respectively. Venn plots showed overlapping targets. Cytoscape used Cytohubba-plugin to display string database PPI and identify hub-genes. ShinyGo analysed BP, CC, MF, and KEGG pathways for enriched hub-genes. Hub genes were verified using DockThor, iMODS, and CABS-flex for docking, dynamics, and modelling. The in vitro validation of the cytotoxicity of W. somnifera was validated by MTT assay against A549 and BEAS-2B cell lines. SwissTarget Prediction found 216 target genes, which Cytoscape and the CytoHubba plugin analysed to find high-interacting phytochemicals Somniferine, Withanolide-J, and Withanolide-P. Venn diagram showed 109 common genes, therefore String-database and Cytoscape were used to create a PPI network using CASP3, JUN, and PTGS2 as hub genes. ShinyGo identified 15 enriched pathways from gene ontology and KEGG pathway studies. Molecular docking investigations using DockThor showed strong CASP3, JUN, and PTGS2 binding affinities for Somniferine, Withanolide-J, and Withanolide-P. Molecular dynamics simulations with iMODS and CABS-Flex showed that Somniferine stabilised target proteins and sustained binding. In a dose-dependent manner, the MTT results validated safety of the plant extract in normal cells while inducing selective cytotoxicity to A549 cancer cells. The findings imply that W. somnifera ingredients, notably Somniferine, may modulate lung cancer target proteins, making them viable natural therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species participate in many physiological processes of the body, but their excess disturbs the metabolic balance and leads to an unfavorable phenomenon called oxidative stress. Several mechanisms account for ROS elimination. One of the antioxidants may be phenothiazine derivatives because of the basic chemical structure – the phenothiazine ring. The study aimed to assess the antioxidant activity of prochlorperazine dimaleate, a phenothiazine derivative, and compare it with reference antioxidants (Trolox and ascorbic acid). Thus, we investigated ABTS, DPPH, CUPRAC, FRAP, and scavenging superoxide anion radical (O2•) assays. It was shown that prochlorperazine dimaleate does not reduce ABTS radicals; meanwhile, Trolox significantly decreased these radicals dose-dependently. Moreover, prochlorperazine dimaleate scavenges DPPH radicals, but it is much less efficient than ascorbic acid. Noteworthy, we noticed that the analyzed drug significantly reduces Fe3+ and Cu2+ ions, as well as scavenges O2• radicals. Based on the obtained IC50 values, the antioxidant activity of prochlorperazine dimaleate could be as follows: CUPRAC &gt; FRAP &gt; O2• &gt; DPPH &gt; ABTS. Of course, to present a full view of the potential antioxidant activity of phenothiazine derivatives, further experiments must be performed using other derivatives.",

Berberine (BBR) is the main effective component of Coptis chinensis against bacteria. To explore the potential mechanism by which BBR inhibits the progression of AD caused by S. aureus. S. aureus was cultured with a BBR-added medium to verify the bacteriostatic effect of BBR. Effects of BBR on the expressions of TTC39A-AS1, hsa-miR-3936, and RNASE3 were detected by qPCR, and the dual luciferase assay and overexpression assay were used to demonstrate the regulation among them. The roles of them in S. aureus-induced injury of human primary epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) were evaluated by their exogenous expressions. The growth, inflammation, and tight junction were evaluated by CCK-8 assay, detection of inflammatory factors, and measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value, to evaluate the impairment of HEKs. BBR significantly inhibited the reproduction of S. aureus and improved the damage to HEKs function caused by it. The stimulation of S. aureus significantly inhibited the growth and tight junction function of HEKs and induced the inflammatory response. These changes were exacerbated by overexpression of TTC39A-AS1 or RNASE3, and reversed by upregulation of hsa-miR-3936. TTC39A-AS1 promoted RNASE3 expression by targeting hsa-miR-3936. Moreover, BBR visibly inhibited the expressions of TTC39A-AS1 and RNASE3 and up-regulated hsa-miR-3936. In conclusion, BBR has the potential to alleviate AD by modulating the TTC39A-AS1/hsa-miR-3936/RNASE3 axis.",

The levels of P-PI3K and P-AKT were markedly declined after SalB administration, revealing that SalB administration depleted PI3K/AKT activity. Conclusion: SalB was observed to exert a repressive effect on Hela cell growth, invasiveness, migrating capacity and glycolysis, while simultaneously promoting apoptosis. It is postulated that these functional mechanisms may be linked to the inactivation of PI3K/AKT signalling.",

This study was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of calcium carbonate and calcium carbonate combined with sevelamer carbonate in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Pediatric patients diagnosed with CKD combined with hyperphosphatemia from March 2018 to June 2023 were included in this study. Patients in the sevelamer group received a combination of calcium carbonate and sevelamer carbonate to decrease serum phosphorus levels, while patients in the calcium carbonate group or the control group received only calcium carbonate. The therapeutic effect index included serum phosphorus, serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, human albumin, lipoprotein, and alkaline phosphatase levels. A total of 118 children diagnosed with CKD complicated with hyperphosphatemia were included in this study. After 12 weeks of treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the children in the sevelamer group significantly reduced along with significant changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol levels (P &lt; 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in other indicators. Adverse reactions mainly included the adverse reactions of the digestive system, which occurred in 12 and 9 cases in the control and sevelamer groups, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate combined with calcium carbonate can reduce serum phosphorus levels more efficiently and without serious adverse reactions in children.",

Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone in cancer treatment; however, its limited efficacy and off-target toxicity significantly constrain its overall success. For over 50 years, natural products have been recognized as highly effective in combating various diseases, including cancer, due to their potential as sources of bioactive compounds. The high toxicity, adverse side effects, and increasing drug resistance associated with many conventional chemotherapy agents have amplified the demand for natural alternatives. Furthermore, integrating natural compounds with biological carriers can revolutionize oncology by enabling targeted delivery to cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. This review highlights recent studies on the properties of select plants with promising applications in cancer therapy and explores the potential of combining these natural compounds with biological delivery systems.

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemic disorders represent a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular complications, particularly among middle-aged and elderly individuals. Nevertheless, genetic predisposition and physiological alterations can accelerate the onset of hyperlipidaemia and hypertriglyceridemia in young individuals, particularly during pregnancy. Currently, the primary hypolipidemic medications are statins; however, the potential use of these drugs during pregnancy in women remains a topic of debate. The aim of this review was to analyse the literature data regarding the potential risks to the foetus associated with the use of statins during pregnancy. Both the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs were considered. Key factors such as lipophilicity, degree of binding to serum proteins, time to maximum blood concentration, half-life, degree of bioavailability, metabolic pathways and excretion are discussed in detail. The results of retrospective and prospective clinical studies in pregnant women and the results of preclinical studies are reviewed. This article provides information on the classification of modern statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin) based on the teratogenicity risk classifications proposed by Briggs et al. (2022) and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC). Analysis of the literature data indicates that statins are unlikely to significantly increase the risk of congenital malformations in humans. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that statins may offer potential benefits in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and dyslipidaemia in pregnancy. However, it should be noted that there is an increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to analyze the dynamics of changes in expenditures on opioid drugs, the structure of these expenditures, and the level of patients' share in the costs of treatment through payments from their pocket. This retrospective study includes data about the sale of prescription pain medications reimbursed in Poland in general pharmacies in 2017-2022. The drugs included in this analysis were simple analgesic opioids containing the following active substances: dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, tapentadol, methadone, morphine, and oxycodone, available through the Polish reimbursement program in pharmacies. Based on secondary data available from the payer of healthcare services in Poland, an Excel database was created to analyze. The share of reimbursement of the analyzed opioid drugs from public funds of the National Health Fund (NFZ) systematically increased from 83.1% in 2019 to 91.2% in 2022. In 2022, the structure of expenditure on opioid drugs was as follows: fentanyl (82.69%), oxycodone (7.83%), morphine (6.30%), tapentadol (1.7%), methadone (0.91%), and dihydrocodeine (0.57%). The lowest dynamics of change in expenditure year to year was observed in the case of fentanyl (+12.8% in 2018 vs. 2017, and -14% in 2021 vs. 2020). The largest year-on-year change in spending was observed for methadone (-20.2% in 2018 vs. 2017, and +131% in 2021 vs. 2020). We observed that patients' participation in co-payments for the analyzed analgesics was small. Monitoring the sale of opioids in public pharmacies is an important way to observe the situation of opioid use among Polish patients.",

    "abstract": "The current study aims to examine the pharmacological capabilities of different isomers of Synephrine in treating arthritis. At first, the several forms of Synephrine (ortho, meta, and para) were examined for their ability to inhibit the COX enzyme (COX-1 and COX-2). The results indicate that all isomers of synephrine showed significant inhibition of COX-2 in comparison to COX-1. Among them, p-synephrine exhibited the most powerful inhibitory action, with an IC50 value of 8.32 µM. During a docking investigation with COX-2, it was observed that p-Synephrine was located in the active site of COX-2, which is surrounded by specific amino acid residues including Ala199, Leu390, Trp387, Thr206, His207, Phe210, Asn382, His386, Gln203, and His388. These residues play a crucial role in the binding of p-Synephrine to COX-2. The anti-inflammatory properties of p-Synephrine were assessed by many bioassays, including protein denaturation, lipoxygenase, and anti-proteinase activity. The results demonstrated that p-Synephrine effectively inhibited these parameters in a concentration-dependent way. Our study conclusively showed that p-Synephrine has a strong anti-inflammatory impact, which could potentially be beneficial in treating Arthritis. This effect is achieved by specifically inhibiting COX-2.",

Recently, the Multi-phase Multi-layer Mechanistic Dermal Absorption (MPML MechDermA) model for simulating topical application was published and subsequently repurposed for simulating in vitro permeation tests using pig ear skin. In previous studies, the model validation process was conducted with caffeine. The current work describes literature experimental data–based development and verification of PBPK model of testosterone permeation through human and pig ear skin under in vitro conditions using the Simcyp® simulator version 23 (Certara UK, Sheffield, UK). Additionally, the usefulness of the pig ear skin model in improving the accuracy of human skin-based permeability predictions was evaluated. A total of 2 pig skin and 5 human skin experiments found in the scientific literature were used for model evaluation. The optimisation process, based on data derived from pig skin experiments, enabled predictions of cumulative amount in receptor solution for the human model when the vehicle composition remained consistent. The analysis revealed the critical impact of accurate formulation characterisation on model performance.",

    "abstract": "In EDDA (ethylenediamino-N,N'-diacetic acid), two main impurities, 2-oxopiperazine-1-ylacetic acid (OPPAA) and N-(2-aminoethylglycine) (AEG), were identified by LC-MS analysis. OPPAA is not commercially available. It was therefore synthesised and its structure was confirmed by elemental, 1H NMR, FT-IR and MS analysis, and an HPLC method with UV detection was developed to test its purity. It turned out that UV detection was inadequate for the analysis of EDDA purity - the results were not consistent with those obtained by titration and 1H NMR. Therefore, a method based on refractometric detection (RID) was developed. Validation of the method was performed, assessing system suitability (SST), limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ), linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness. For both contaminants (AEG and OPPAA), a detection limit of 0.02% was achieved. A linear relationship between the signal of both contaminants was observed in the range of LOQ to 0.5 % vs EDDA. The method has satisfactory linearity and accuracy for both impurities and acceptable precision. The results obtained by three analysts were compared using statistical tests. Using refractometric detection, the results of OPPAA determination based on HPLC purity (as a percentage of the OPPAA peak area relative to the area of all signals) and relative to the standard are very similar.",

The study aimed to investigate the role of Chinese medicine Dihydromyricetin (DHM) in IR in HepG2 cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats and its possible mechanism under the participation of ERS. HepG2 cells were treated with 5×10−6 mol/L insulin to establish an IR cell model. T2DM rats were established through the combination of low-dose streptozocin (STZ) and a high-fat diet. T2DM rats were given low doses (DHM-L) or high doses (DHM-H) of DHM. OGTT was performed for the glucose tolerance evaluation. Western blot was done for the protein detection. DHM improved the insulin sensitivity, lipid levels, and inflammatory response in HepG2 cells induced by IR. DHM decreased the body weight, FBG, FINS, and HOMA-IR of T2DM rats. OGTT test demonstrated the increase of blood glucose and area under the curve (AUC) in T2DM rats, which was reduced by DHM treatment in a dosed manner. The increased TC, TG, LDL, and reduced HDL in T2DM rats were reversed by DHM, which is related to the improvement of lipid metabolism. For mechanism, DHM inhibited the ERS signaling and inflammatory response. DHM attenuates IR and lipid metabolism in a dose-dependent manner in T2DM rats, and the mechanism might be related to improving liver ERS and inhibiting inflammation.",

The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a serious global health threat, making it increasingly difficult to treat common infections. Discovering novel antibacterial agents can help combat these resistant strains and ensure effective treatment options remain available. In this study, eighteen novel fluorobenzhydrazide derivatives, including linear thiosemicarbazides and cyclic 1,2,4-triazoles, were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains. Among the synthesized compounds, thiosemicarbazide 6, which contains a diethylaminophenyl substituent, exhibited moderate antibacterial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria. This thiosemicarbazide successfully inhibited the growth of all Staphyloccocus aureus strains with an MIC of 64 µg/mL. To explore the potential antibacterial mechanism, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to assess the interaction of these compounds with Ddl ligase and DNA gyrase. Notably, 4-(4-N,N-diethylaminophenyl)-1-(3-fluorobenzoyl)thiosemicarbazide demonstrated a binding mode comparable to that of a known inhibitor, highlighting its potential as a lead compound and suggesting possible directions for further structural modifications.",

Methods: Thirty SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: control (A, n=10), model (B, n=10), and experimental (C, n=10). IBS was induced in groups B and C using a water avoidance stress test. After successful modeling, group C received 10 mg/kg of tanshinone II A, while group B received saline. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect CRF expression in the terminal ileum. High-throughput sequencing analyzed microbial abundance and diversity. The expression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23 (via PCR), and STAT3/p-STAT3 (via Western blot) in the ileum were also assessed. Results: CRF expression in the submucosa and muscle layer was higher in group B compared to A, but reduced in group C compared to B. Lactobacillus and Enterobacteriaceae levels were increased in group B compared to A, but decreased in group C compared to B. STAT3 and p-STAT3 levels, along with IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 mRNA, were elevated in group B, while IL-10 mRNA was reduced. In group C, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 levels decreased, and IL-10 increased. Conclusion: Tanshinone II A has a therapeutic effect on IBS in rats by regulating intestinal flora, reducing CRF expression, improving immune function, and inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway.",

The aim of study was to evaluate relative bioavailability of ticagrelor from two oral pharmaceutical forms hard capsules (Tikozek, test product) vs. film-coated tablets (Brilique®, reference product) after a single 90 mg dose administration. A randomized, 2-period, crossover, open-label, and laboratory-blinded study was conducted in healthy Caucasian male and female volunteers in Poland. Ticagrelor in human plasma was quantified by a validated LC-MS/MS method using isotope labelled internal standard. Two pharmaceutical forms were considered bioequivalent when 90% confidence intervals (CI) of the log-transformed geometric mean ratios (hard capsules over film-coated tablets) for both AUC(0-t) and Cmax were within 80.00-125.00%. Adverse events, values of laboratory parameters, and vital signs were recorded during the study. Among 40 volunteers enrolled, 37 completed the study. Geometric mean ratios for the primary pharmacokinetic parameter were 100.51% (90% CI 95.00-106.34%) for AUC(0-t), and 92.43% (90% CI 84.11-101.58%) for Cmax. Ticagrelor administered in both pharmaceutical forms was well tolerated. No serious adverse events were recorded. Results of the clinical trial indicate that hard capsules (Tikozek) are bioequivalent to the film-coated tablets (Brilique®).",

Infection is currently a common complication in patients with SLE and is the leading cause of death in patients with SLE. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam in treating infections in SLE patients. Methods: This study included 48 patients diagnosed with SLE from January 2020 to June 2022. A retrospective review was conducted on SLE patients with infections treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. General demographic information, clinical signs, indicators from lab tests, and medication use were gathered. Then we compared the data from before and after the piperacillin/tazobactam treatment. Results: Among 48 SLE patients enrolled (44 with pulmonary infections), the anti-infective treatment success rate was 72.9%, with no serious adverse reactions reported. After treatment, levels of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, complement3 (C3), C4, creatinine, urea, and creatinine and creatinine clearance (CCr) showed no significant changes, indicating no worsening of lupus disease activity or renal function. In contrast, serum uric acid levels decreased significantly after treatment (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Piperacillin/tazobactam is effective and safe for SLE patients with infections. During this process, skin tests should be done in advance, the patient's response should be closely monitored, and the doctor should be closely communicated to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.",

The research investigated the impact of liquid properties and applicator design on spray characteristics. Six atomizer types (lateral, horizontal long/short tip, and vertical) were tested with five solvents. The study assessed droplet size distribution, dose consistency, priming activations required, actuation force, residual volume, and suitability for suspensions. Results showed that for water, the average droplet size is in the range of approximately 83 to 124 µm. The viscosity has a significant impact on spray performance. In the case of high-viscosity solution of Celugel, some of the liquid does not atomize and is not detected, with only smaller droplets reaching the detector in reduced quantities (from about 33 to 67% compared to the number of water droplets generated). Concurrently, the droplet size ranges, depending on the atomizer type, from approximately 60% to approximately 120% of the water droplet size. Depending on the type of applicator and the fluid being dispensed, the force required to activate the pump mechanism was similar and ranged from 16 to 27 N, enabling comfortable application. Dose consistency was within 25% of manufacturer specifications, though significant differences were noted between vertical nasal applicators. All atomizers required multiple activations, ranging from 4 to 10 presses, depending on the solvent and the type of sprayer. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate applicator and considering formulation properties, especially viscosity, for consistent dosing and effective drug delivery in compounded medications.",

ELISA analyzed IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. Western blot detected connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and fibronectin (FN) protein levels. RT-qPCR detected lncRNA RMRP levels. Results: HP or lncRNA RMRP silencing decreased IL-6 and TNF-α levels, ET-1, FN and CTGF protein contents, and increased IL-10 levels (P&lt;0.05). HP treatment down-regulated HG-evoked increase of lncRNA RMRP (P&lt;0.05), and lncRNA RMRP up-regulation reversed the inhibition of HP on inflammatory response and fibrosis in GMCSs (P&lt;0.05). HG+HP-H treatment group is the most effective. Conclusion: HP inhibits GMC inflammation and fibrosis induced by HG through down-regulating lncRNA RMRP, providing new insight to the current investigation on therapeutic strategies for DN.",

    "abstract": "Camptothecin (CPT) is a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor with promising anticancer potential. However, its poor solubility and stability present major obstacles in pharmaceutical formulations. Rutin, a plant-derived quercetin glycoside, also exhibits anticancer activity but suffers from limited solubility. This study explores a novel combination of CPT and Rutin in a liposomal drug delivery system. To enhance CPT solubility and encapsulation, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) complexation was employed. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection was used for analysis. The CPT-HPβCD complex was prepared via different methods and characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Liposomes loaded with Rutin and CPT-HPβCD were formulated and evaluated for size, charge, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release. Results showed that the solubility of CPT was significantly increased from 1.09µM to a range of (1.68-8.5) µM using different concentrations of HPβCD. Characterization proved the formation of the complex and the kneading method of preparation was found to be superior to other methods like solvent evaporation with an encapsulation efficiency of 64.6 ± 2.5%. The prepared Liposomes showed particle size around 20 nm with negative charge and 60 % cumulative release of rutin from the liposomes was achieved and CPT up to 60% compared to 10 % from the formula 1 (without complexation) with controlled release pattern.",

This study investigates the potential for improving the solubility of itraconazole (ITR) through solid dispersion formulations using two different carriers (Polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 and Eudragit E 100) at two API : polymer weight ratios (1:2 and 1:5). Two different solvent-based methods for preparing solid dispersions – supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) and electrospinning (Esp) – were introduced. The results confirmed improvement in ITR solubility and dissolution, as well as changes in particle shape and size for both weight ratio formulations. After processing, a decrease in ITR crystallinity was observed. The results indicated that an increased amount of carriers led to better results. Consequently, these formulations were selected for stability studies. The samples were packed into aluminum sachets and stored in climate chambers under long-term (25°C, 60%RH) and accelerated (40°C, 75%RH) conditions for one month. We demonstrated the scCO2 samples were resistant to storage; neither the temperature nor humidity affected the properties of solid dispersions. In contrast, samples obtained via electrospinning were more sensitive to storage conditions.",

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a nitrophenylthiazole acetamide, 6a, in a papain-induced OA rat model. OA was induced by intra-articular injection of papain, followed by oral administration of compound 6a at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg. Knee joint diameter and mechanical allodynia were assessed using caliper measurements and the Von Frey pain threshold test, respectively. Oxidative stress markers (MDA, SOD, and GSH), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were also evaluated. Results demonstrated that compound 6a significantly reduced joint swelling and increased pain threshold in a dose-dependent manner. Biochemical analysis revealed a marked decrease in MDA levels, along with significant increases in SOD and GSH, indicating strong antioxidant activity. Furthermore, compound 6a suppressed the elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and downregulated the mRNA expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, suggesting inhibition of inflammasome-mediated inflammation. In conclusion, compound 6a exhibited notable anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic effects in the OA rat model, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic agent for osteoarthritis management.",

    "abstract": "The composition and functions of the gut microbiota can affect the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. Proteomics analysis has become important tool for characterizing the proteome and identifying serum biomarkers associated with specific conditions in different groups of patients. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the pathophysiological aspects of obesity and the relation between comorbidities and the gut microbiota by characterizing the protein profile in obese post-menopausal women before and after multi-species probiotic supplementation. MALDI-TOF MS analyses were performed in serum samples from the placebo group 24, from the low-dose probiotic group 24, and 23 from the high-dose probiotic group. Paired comparison analysis of protein–peptide patterns derived from patients at two time points (i.e., before and after treatment) revealed several peaks changing under treatment. Complement C3, Fibrinogen alpha chain, Coagulation factor XII, Tubulin beta-3 chain, Fibrinogen beta chain, Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4, and Apolipoprotein A-I were identified. Depending on the administered dose, slightly different alterations were observed. In summary, the obtained results do not allow us to draw a conclusion regarding the influence of probiotic supplementation on peptide profile in obese post-menopausal women. However some of identified proteins could take part in the complex mechanism involving obesity, dysbiosis, and inflammation. Registration number: NCT03100162",

This review summarizes data from different data bases over the past decade, focusing on herbs with traditional and emerging cardiovascular applications. The selection is supported by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) monographs. Key herbs include artichoke (Cynara cardunculus L. syn. Cynara scolymus L.) turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), Citrus bergamia (Citrus bergamia Risso &amp; Poit.), garlic (Allium sativum L.), ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.), danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), Terminalia arjuna (Terminalia arjuna (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn.), Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Meyer.), green tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze), ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca L), and others. These plants are rich in bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and organosulfur compounds, which exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering effects. Clinical evidence supports garlic’s impact on blood pressure and lipids, hawthorn’s benefits in heart failure, and ginseng and ginkgo’s role in vascular function. Curcumin and gingerols contribute to anti-inflammatory activity and improved metabolic profiles. Additional herbs like bergamot and hibiscus also show cholesterol- and blood pressure-lowering effects. While the overall safety profile is favourable, herb–drug interactions must be considered. Collectively, these herbal agents offer a natural, accessible, and cost-effective complement to conventional CVD therapies. However, further large-scale clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy, establish standardized dosing, and evaluate long-term safety in cardiovascular care.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cancer incidence is rising globally, yet early diagnosis remains challenging due to the lack of initial symptoms, highlighting the need for novel molecular targets. miR-204, a tumor-suppressive microRNA downregulated in various cancers, has unclear mechanisms in thyroid cancer. This study explored how miR-204 affects thyroid cancer cell behavior by targeting high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1). Tumor and adjacent tissues from 40 thyroid cancer patients (Feb 2019–June 2021) and multiple thyroid cancer cell lines (TPC-1, NPA87, FTC133) were analyzed. miR-204 was significantly downregulated in cancer tissues and cells (P &lt; 0.05), with the lowest expression in FTC133 cells. These cells were transfected and divided into experimental groups (e.g., miR-204 mimics, inhibitors, si-HMGB1). Overexpression of miR-204 suppressed proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis in FTC133 cells, while its inhibition had the opposite effect (P &lt; 0.05). Luciferase assays confirmed HMGB1 as a direct target of miR-204. HMGB1 knockdown reduced proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis, effects reversed by miR-204 inhibition (P &lt; 0.05). In summary, miR-204 inhibits thyroid cancer cell progression and promotes apoptosis, likely by directly targeting HMGB1, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.",

This study explored the effects of Melissa officinalis extract and its main phenolic acids on the motility of the swine jejunum and colon, with the aim of verifying its usefulness as a health-promoting feed additive. The trials were performed on isolated jejunum and colon preparations and verified the effects of Melissa officinalis extract and 3 phenolic acids (rosmarinic, chlorogenic, and lithospermic) on spontaneous and acetylcholine (ACh)-induced smooth muscle activity under isometric conditions. Results: The study revealed the antispasmodic effect of Melissa extract. The preparation reduced by about 50% the control contraction when used at the highest tested dose (0.1 mg/ml). The results suggest that rosmarinic acid contributes the most to the eventual effect on the plant. In contrast, chlorogenic acid was a potent myocontractile agent under all the studied conditions and models. Conclusions: The major outcome of the study is the confirmation of the utility of a standardized extract of lemon balm as an antispasmodic agent in jejunum and colon specimens challenged with ACh, i.e., the most important stimulatory neurotransmitter in the enteric nervous system. Owing to the lack of data revealing the effects of lemon balm extract and individual phenolic acids on spontaneous contractility, it is impossible to conclude indisputably about their contributions to the final effects on the plant. Nevertheless, this study highlights the potential of Melissa officinalis to modulate intestinal motility in pigs experiencing hypermotility disorders, mainly microbial infections.",

Community pharmacies play a key role in this shift, expanding beyond medication dispensing to offer a broader range of healthcare services. This study compares community pharmacy services in Poland and Portugal to assess whether Poland is behind, aligned with, or different in its approach. A narrative review examined community pharmacy services in Poland and Portugal, using Portugal as a reference due to its well-established pharmaceutical care system. The literature was searched in databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar from January to March 2025 along with legal regulations and government public announcements, to provide a thorough understanding of the subject. While Portuguese pharmacists have long been involved in immunization, diagnosis, and prevention, these services are still in the early stages of development in Poland. Polish pharmacists, in turn, have broader author-ity to issue prescriptions in health or life-threatening situations. In Poland, expanding pharmacists' services, particularly in diagnosis and prevention could improve healthcare accessibility and support physicians in man-aging patient care. In Portugal, on the other hand, granting pharmacists broader prescribing authority could enhance patient access to essential medicines in emergency situations and ease the burden on the health care system, enabling it to respond more quickly to patients' needs.",

The aim of this study is to assess the safety profile of nifuroxazide and to evaluate the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A retrospective descriptive analysis of ADR reports related to nifuroxazide use was conducted. Data sources included databases: the European EudraVigilance (2001–May 2025) and the global VigiAccess (1980–May 2025). The analysis focused on patient demographics, symptomatology, and the frequency of adverse events. The VigiAccess database documented 846 cases of ADRs up to 2025, approximately 60% of which were reported in the last decade. The highest incidence of ADRs was observed in individuals aged 18 to 64 years with predominant reactions concerning skin and subcutaneous tissue (rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema). Most frequent systemic symptoms were facial edema, shivers, and malaise. The EudraVigilance database (2001–2025) reported 439 cases of ADRs, predominantly in individuals aged 18 to 64 years. The most frequently observed adverse effects included dermatological reactions, facial edema, malaise and gastrointestinal disturbances. The analysis of ADR reports from VigiAccess and EudraVigilance supports a favorable safety profile of nifuroxazide, reinforcing its efficacy in bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract. Nifuroxazide is recommended as a first-line treatment for mild cases of infectious diarrhea, serving as an alternative to systemic antibiotics reserved for more severe infections. Enhancing awareness among healthcare professionals and patients regarding ADR monitoring is crucial for optimizing pharmacovigilance and ensuring the safe use of nifuroxazide in clinical practice.",

The study outlines a green method to produce Zinc oxide nanoparticles, with aqueous tannic acid functioning dual roles: as a capping agent and a structural director. The resulting ZnO NPs underwent detailed characterization through a variety of microscopic and spectroscopic methods, followed by investigations into their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects, all aiming to evaluate their potential future role in wound healing. scanning transmission electron microscope images revealed that prepared ZnO NPs are about 8±2 nm in size without any aggregation. Comparative studies of the anti-inflammatory abilities of ZnO NPs and a standard drug revealed the nanoparticles to exhibit significant anti-inflammatory activity at elevated concentrations (100 mL-1), with a 73% inhibition rate when compared with the diclofenac sodium drug. This led to the conclusion that ZnO is compatible with diclofenac sodium. Furthermore, the manufactured ZnO NPs showcased effective antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Enhanced antibacterial activity was attributed to the surface tannic acid, which possibly influence the release of Zn2+ ions and the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species. Additional examination with 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability analysis on fibroblast cells confirmed an improvement in biocompatibility showing that more than 90% of cell viability, as evidenced by the growth of the fibroblast cells.

The quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) analysis of presented topological indices shows a good correlation of studied descriptors with certain physicochemical properties of examined drugs. The obtained linear regression models can be helpful to predict these physicochemical properties of new derivatives of tested compounds and thus are significant in pharmaceutical product design.

    "abstract": "Peptic ulcer disease continues to pose a significant health burden in the area of gastrointestinal diseases, while ethanol-induced gastric damage is a well-established experimental model for developing and testing mucosal protective agents. In this investigation, we evaluated the gastroprotective efficacy of the ethyl acetate leaf extract of Hyssopus officinalis (EALE) in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats, and tried to assess the phytochemical constituents of EALE using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Our findings indicate that pretreatment with EALE at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg protected against gastric lesions induced by ethanol, with the 500 mg/kg dose completely preventing gastric ulceration (100% inhibition) and more efficaciously than the clinically-utilized omeprazole treatment (86% inhibition, 80 mg/kg). Histopathological analysis showed only intact mucosa indicating no evidence of damage to the tissue in the 500 mg/kg group. Using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS, we characterized a rich phytochemical profile that included 20 metabolites from the EALE, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, quinones, and vitamins. The major compounds (quercetin 24.09%, esculin acid 24.37%, hesperetin acid 20.46%, and naringenin 8.63%) likely contributed to the cytoprotective implications of EALE.

Methods TPC1 cells were challenged with diverse doses of GLA. MTT method, colony-formation test, scratch study and Transwell test were respectively used to exploit TPC1 cell behaviors. qRT-PCR method was adopted for the detection of of circ_0030018 and miR-145 expression. Dual-luciferase reporter experiment was adopted to verify the binding between circ_0030018 and miR-145. Western blotting was applied for the detection of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Results After GLA treatment, the cell proliferative inhibition rate was considerably reinforced, while the amount of cell clone formation, the number of invasive cells, the cell scratch healing rate and the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were considerably lessened. GLA treatment weakened circ_0030018 expression but strengthened miR-145 expression. Circ_0030018 could target and regulate the expression of miR-145. The si-circ_0030018 transfection repressed TPC1 cell proliferation, reduced the number of cell clone formation and the number of invaded cells, and weakened the scar healing rate and the abundance of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Circ_0030018 upregulation could overturn the effects of GLA on TPC1 cell behaviors.

Fifty SD rats were divided into five groups: CON, MOD, L-CAR (15 mg/kg), H-CAR (60 mg/kg), and H-CAR+BRU (60 mg/kg + 2 mg/kg). ELISA was used to measure serum inflammatory and oxidative stress factors. Micro-CT assessed alveolar bone absorption, and HE staining evaluated periodontal tissue. TRAP staining was performed for osteoclast counting, and Western blot measured protein expression of OPG, RANKL, Nrf2, HO-1, and NLRP3. Results showed that, compared to the CON group, rats in the MOD group exhibited gingival erosion, widened periodontal ligament space, and increased inflammatory infiltration, along with reduced alveolar bone parameters (Tb.N, Tb.Th) and lower serum antioxidant levels (SOD, GSH-Px). In contrast, the L-CAR and H-CAR groups showed improved tissue morphology, increased alveolar bone parameters, and enhanced antioxidant levels. These groups also exhibited upregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 and downregulation of NLRP3, RANKL, and osteoclast count. However, the H-CAR+BRU group showed exacerbated periodontal damage and further imbalance in inflammatory and bone resorption markers. In conclusion, cardamonin exerts therapeutic effects on periodontitis by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibiting NLRP3-mediated inflammation and bone resorption.",

These models provide critical insights into drug safety, allowing for early clinical warnings of potential adverse reactions. However, challenges remain, such as the need for more accurate physiological data and improved model validation methods.

This study aims to explore the role and mechanism of morroniside in DN progression. Methods: Human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were cultured with high glucose (HG) and treated with morroniside. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by cell counting kit 8 method and flow cytometry. Western blot was used to detect the protein levels of apoptosis marker Bax and anti-apoptosis marker Bcl-2. Malonaldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were examined to evaluate cell oxidative stress, and miR-25 expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Results: After treated with HG, cell viability, Bcl-2 level, SOD activity and miR-25 expression were decreased, whereas apoptosis rate, Bax level and MDA content were increased. Morroniside enhanced cell viability, Bcl-2 level, SOD activity and miR-25 expression, while reduced apoptosis rate, Bax level and MDA content in HG-induced HK2 cells. Overexpression of miR-25 promoted cell viability, repressed HG-induced HK2 cell apoptosis and oxidative stress. Knockdown of miR-25 reversed the effects of morroniside on the viability, apoptosis and oxidative stress in HG-induced HK2 cells. Conclusion: Morroniside could inhibit HG-induced HK2 cell injury via increasing miR-25 expression, confirming that morroniside might alleviate DN process.",

The absorption–distribution–metabolism–excretion–toxicity (ADMET) analysis was performed using the pkCSM platform online. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted on SW-982 synovial cells using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium-bromide (MTT) assays, and reactive-oxygen-species (ROS) production was measured to understand the mechanisms of oxidative stress. Anti-inflammatory effects were determined by Bovine-serum-albumin (BSA) protein denaturation assays, while antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was tested by minimum-inhibitory-concentration (MIC) and minimum-microbial-concentration (MMC) assays. Molecular-docking analyzed interactions of psoralen with Tumour-Necrosis-Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Cellular Communication Network Factor-1 and -2 (CCN1, and CCN2), and quantification of their expression was achieved by Western blotting. ADMET analysis showed that psoralen had high intestinal absorption, was non-hepatotoxic, and was devoid of mutagenic and cardiovascular risks, though it had poor Central-Nervous-System (CNS) permeability. MTT assays demonstrated dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity with IC₅₀ values of ~40 µg/mL at 24 hours and ~35 µg/mL at 48 hours, which correlated with increased ROS production. Psoralen inhibited protein denaturation following concentration-dependent manner, competing with aspirin at higher doses. It showed antimicrobial activity with MIC values of 1.5–2.5 µg/mL and MMC/MIC ratios of 1.6–2.0. The molecular-docking demonstrated strong binding with TNF-α (-8.6), CCN1 (-7.5), and CCN2 (-6.5). Significant downregulation of these mediators was further confirmed by western blot analysis. Based on these outcomes, Psoralen has potential therapeutic applications in RA thus suggesting further research studies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Esophageal cancer (EC) maintains a visible disease burden in China, constituting a major public health challenge among gastrointestinal malignancies, with limitations in the efficacy of existing single-treatment modalities. Andrographolide, a natural active component, has yet to have its radiosensitizing mechanisms fully elucidated. Objectives: This article was designed to elucidate Andrographolide’s synergistic inhibition with radiotherapy and its molecular basis on human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (EC9706) cells. Methods: Using EC9706, cell proliferation was detected by the CCK-8 assay (at 24/48/72 h), migration ability was assessed by the scratch assay (at 12/24/48 h), radiosensitivity was analyzed by the colony formation (CF) assay (at 0-6 Gy), and the level of associated proteins was subjected to detection by Western blot (WB). Results: The combination group (DG) suggested the strongest proliferation inhibition at all time points [vs. control group (AG)], with the most visible distinction at 72 h. The scratch healing rate was the lowest (at 48 h vs. AG) (P &lt; 0.01). As the radiation dose increased, the CF rate (CFR) declined markedly (6 Gy vs. AG, P &lt; 0.001). Molecular detection revealed that the DG had the highest expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 and Bax, and the lowest expression of Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Andrographolide enhances the radiosensitivity of EC cells by activating apoptosis pathways and inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, providing experimental evidence for clinical combined treatment.",

HUVEC were incubated for 0,5 h with 100 mM tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) for oxidative stress formation. The influence of EGCG, TFs, and BTE on oxidative stress and antioxidant system parameters was investigated by the pre-incubation for 2 h with 50 mg/mL of each compound. Half hour exposure to t-BHP caused statistically significant decrease in GSH-Px activity and in the content of GSH, vitamin A, vitamin E as well as tryptophan. Moreover, pretreatment of cells with t-BHP caused statistically significant increase in activities of Cu,Zn-SOD, GSSG-R and in the level of MDA and dityrosine. Pretreated with t-BHP endothelial cells, subjected to EGCG, TFs and black tea extract, are partially protected against oxidative activity of t-BHP causing statistically significant increase in GSH-Px activity, GSH and tryptophan level and decrease in MDA and dityrosine level in comparison with HUVEC pretreated with t-BHP group. These results indicate the beneficial effect of tea polyphenolic compounds on HUVEC antioxidant abilities and, in consequence, their protective effect in cell components.",

Nevertheless, the high recombination rate of photo-generated carriers and limited photocatalytic efficiency of a single g-C3N4 material limit its wide application. Therefore, constructing g-C3N4 based composite materials has become an efficient way to improve their photocatalytic effect. Here, we review the approaches for augmenting the photocatalytic performance of these composites, encompassing the rational architecture of their composite structures, the refinement of modification protocols, and an intensive examination of the underlying mechanisms that facilitate the photocatalytic efficacy improvement of g-C3N4. Furthermore, we discuss the advancements made in harnessing these composites for the efficient remediation of environmental pollutants.

    "abstract": "The dissolution characteristics of melt granulations of paracetamol in capsule and tablet dosage form were compared to determine whether the dissolution characteristics of the granules can be actualized by formulating them as rapidly disintegrating tablets. The term melt granulation refers here to the wax-matrix granules that were formed by triturating the drug powder (paracetamol) with a melted carnauba wax. The matrix granules were admixed with diluents (lactose, alpha-cellulose or microcrystalline cellulose) also in granular form to prevent size separation during encapsulation or tableting. The granules were filled into hard gelatin capsules (mean content weight, 500 +/- 6.2 mg) or tableted (mean weight 500 +/- 5.1 mg, and tensile strength 1.36 +/- 0.2 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 MN/m2). The capsules and tablets were subjected to disintegration and in vitro dissolution tests. The dissolution data were analyzed on the basis of zero, first order rate kinetics and Higuchi square root of time relationship. The results showed that the dissolution profiles were generally consistent with a first order rate kinetics (r = 0.95). The first order dissolution rate constants of capsules and tablets of the matrix granules only (without diluents) were 0.31 +/- 0.02 min(-1) and 0.20 +/- 0.03 min(-1), respectively, indicating faster dissolution from the capsules. Therefore, the dissolution characteristics of the matrix particles were not intact after tableting. Addition of diluents to the capsule formulations had no effect on dissolution rates, whereas in the tablets, dissolution rates increased. For instance, inclusion of a diluent up to 50% w/w in the tablets increased the dissolution rate constants to 0.34 +/- 0.04 min(-1) (lactose), 0.42 +/- 0.02 min(-1) (alpha-cellulose), and 0.46 +/- 0.03 min(-1) (microcrystalline cellulose). Thus, alpha-cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose produced greater enhancer effect on the tablet dissolution rates compared to lactose. Both the capsules and the tablets disintegrated rapidly within 2 to 3 minutes. The dissolution enhancer effect of the diluents in the tablets only, relates to the aqueous swelling of the disintegrated particles.",

The antioxidative property of leaf green tea, leaf and granulate of black tea and white tea at levels 1, 2, 4 g/150 mL of water were evaluated. The correlation was observed between reducing power of tea extract and formation of malondialdehyde--MDA (an indicator of lipid peroxidation) in oxidative damage of RBC. All tea extracts at level of 4 g/150 mL of water significantly decreased concentration of MDA. The extract of green tea in comparison to black and white tea extracts at the same levels seems to be a better protective agent against oxidative stress. The antioxidant synergism between components extracted from leaves of green tea and endogenous alpha tocopherol in the oxidative damage of red blood cells was observed. The consumption of alpha tocopherol in oxidative damage of RBC was the lowest after treatment with the highest dose of green tea extract. All tea extracts did not protect against decrease of gamma tocopherol in human erythrocytes treated with cumOOH.",

The ex vivo skin permeation study was performed using Keshary-Chien glass diffusion cell and mouse epidermis with intact stratum corneum as membrane. The phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 was used as receptor solution at 37 degrees C. TZN patch was applied to the inner pinna skin of the rabbit. TZN transdermal absorption from patch was compared to that from peroral TZN solution in rabbit. A steady-state skin permeation rate of 134.09 +/- 2.49 microg/cm2/h was achieved from the matrix patch across mouse epidermis after an initial lag time of approximately 3.5 h. The steady-state transdermal TZN concentration of 2.3 microg/mL was achieved in rabbit from the matrix patch after an initial lag time of approximately 2 h. The Cmax of peroral TZN solution was calculated to be 5.84 microg/mL at a Tmax of 2 h indicating its rapid absorption compared to the transdermal administration with a Tmax of 5 h. The ex vivo and in vivo biopharmaceutical parameters were in good agreement with respect to steady-state plasma TZN concentration and lag time. The plasma level of TZN following transdermal application could be maintained for 24 h. The transdermal dose achieved a much higher steady-state blood concentration in rabbit compared with the effective blood concentration in human. The observed steady-state blood concentration may appear to be within the expected therapeutic range in human with a higher clearance value compared to that in rabbit.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin (ARMN) is a potent antimalarial drug, which is effective against multidrug resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum and produces rapid recovery even in patients with cerebral malaria. Being poorly soluble in water, artemisinin is incompletely absorbed after oral intake due to poor dissolution charac- teristics in the intestinal fluids. To enhance these properties, solid dispersions of artemisinin with succinic acid (SUC) were prepared using drug-carrier ratios 1 : 1, 1 : 4, 1 : 6, 1 : 8 and 1 : 10 by solvent evaporation and freeze drying methods. These solid dispersions were characterized by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), x-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), phase solubility and disso- lution kinetics evaluated by applying zero order, first order, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. Physical mixtures produced significantly higher aqueous solubility and rate of dissolution as compared to artemisinin alone. The dissolution profiles of all formulations followed Higuchi model and exhibited diffusion-controlled release of drug. Solvent evaporation method (SLVPs) exhibited improved solubility and freeze dried solid dis- persions (FDSDs) produced highest solubility but stability constant was opposite. ARMN and SUC both were found completely crystalline as shown by their XRD patterns. Physical mixtures (PMs) showed reduced inten- sity in their XRD patterns while solid dispersions by SLVPs exhibited twice reduced intensity and much dis- placed angles, whereas FDSDs showed synergistic effects in some of ARMN and SUC peaks. DSC thermo- grams of FDSDs at drug-carrier ratios 1 : 1n1 : 4 showed lower melting temperature and enthalpy change (∆H) values than respective SLVPs, whereas at higher ratios, a reverse was true. SLVPs showed displaced methyl stretching bands at lower drug-carrier ratios and exhibited O-H stretching characteristic bands of SUC at high- er drug-carrier ratios. In addition, carbonyl group and C-O stretching vibrations characteristic of SUC (1307 cm -1 ) appeared prominently compared to PMs, whereas C-O stretching characteristic bands of ARMN disap- peared at higher ratios. FDSDs exhibited distinct nature of bonding compared to respective SLVPs and PMs.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are phytochemicals, which exhibit antioxidant potential due to their ability to donate a hydrogen atom and/or a single electron, and to interact with other antioxidants.The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant potential of two subclasses of pure flavonoids: flavonols (quercetin, rhamnetin, isorhamnetin) and flavones (luteolin, apigenin) in vitro.Particularly, using spectrophotometric methods, we determined the ability of these flavonoids to scavenge hydroxyl radical, reduce ferric ions (Fe (III)) and chelate ferrous ions (Fe (II)).Obtained results showed that tested flavonoids are good scavengers of hydroxyl radical and reductants (Fe (III) → Fe (II)) but relatively poor chelators of ferrous ions.Quercetin, which belongs to the group of flavonols was the most efficient antioxidant among tested flavonoids, while luteolin from the flavone group was the second one.We found that the number of hydroxyl groups and the presence of hydroxyl group at the C3 position of ring C corresponds with better hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and reduces the power of flavonoids.Catechol structure in the B ring was important for higher reducing power and chelating activity of flavonoids, but surprisingly it did not influence the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of tested compounds.In contrary, the presence of the methoxy group in the structure of rhamnetin and isorhamnetin decreases their reducing power and chelating activity.Interestingly, the hydroxyl group at the C5 position of ring A was more important for the chelating activity of flavonoids than the hydroxyl group at the C3 position of ring C. Our research may enrich knowledge about the therapeutic potential of flavonoids as antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "TMZ has an advantage over other traditional alkylating agents (carmustine, lomustine, procarbazine), which are highly toxic and have poor patient survival. TMZ circumvents these problems because cytochrome P450 enzymes and the kidneys are not involved in its metabolism, it has predictable side effects (nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), which are usually reversible and only mild to moderate, have been widely described. About half of patients treated with TMZ have high drug resistance induced by activity of O6-methylguanine methyltransferase. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are found among the neoplastic cell population, have also been shown to be responsible for resistance to TMZ. Additionally, acquired immunity, induced by TMZ’s epigenetic and genetic alterations, may develop. Currently, there are new therapeutic strategies for GBM based on nanotechnology, which are aimed at improving TMZ treatment (e.g. the use of apolipoprotein), or other techniques (siRNA, which increases the oxygen level in the tumour). Thus, although TMZ was discovered more than three decades ago, this drug will be used to treat not only GBM, but also a large number of neoplastic pathologies. Further research focused on understanding the mechanisms of action and resistance to TMZ is required to improve its clinical application today and in the future.

Betulin was obtained from birch bark using standard methodology. The AD model was induced by administering aluminum chloride AlCl3 (200 mg/kg/day) to animals for 120 days. All animals were divided into 4 groups: the control group (sham operation), the second - the AD model (Alz) without prevention with betulin, the third - the Alz+Bet receiving betulin (100 mg/kg/day, i.g., during the last 50% of the experimental days), and the Alz+Bet Complex receiving betulin in complex with cyclodextrin (100 mg/kg/day, i.g., during the last 50% of the experimental days). We showed that betulin in complex with cyclodextrin improve the spatial memory and lowered levels of the TNF-α, APLP2 and β-amyloid in rats with AlCl3-induced AD. We conclude that betulin has neuroprotective properties which may form the basis for the development of a new pharmaceutical that is effective in both the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Nevertheless, more human clinical trials with large sample sizes are urgently needed to implement cannabinoids, including CBD, into standard GBM treatment.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the scientific world has become more interested in genistein. It has been the subject of extensive research for its potential in treating various diseases and as a functional food. The medical benefits of genistein are well documented in the literature. Several studies have been performed to better understand the mechanisms of its beneficiary effects on health and to improve its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. It has been approved for relieving menopausal symptoms and has received attention for its use in the treatment of inflammatory and age-related disorders, cancer, metabolic illnesses, genetic disorders, and skin care. Genistein shows considerable similarity to endogenous estradiol. It is classified in the group known as phytoestrogens which exhibit properties corresponding to estrogen in the human body. The estrogenic activity resulting from the aforementioned similarity in the appearance of genistein and estradiol molecules makes it possible for genistein to act as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist, depending on the number of endogenous hormones present in the environment in which it is found and the type of tissue. The similarity of the chemical structure of genistein and estradiol and interactions occurring between estradiol and genistein and the amino acid binding site of the estrogen receptors were analyzed. Further controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of genistein. Future research will focus on enhancing its bioavailability through structural modification and innovative delivery methods and conducting human trials to confirm its biological and pharmacological effects.",

Limited data concerning the compatibility of intravenous IBF and other parenteral medications makes it inconvenient to use in polypharmacy-required patients. The simultaneous administration of two incompatible drugs is a health- or even life-threatening medical error. This study was performed to evaluate the physical compatibility of two intravenous IBF doses (600 mg/100 mL, 400 mg/100 mL) during Y-site administration with common parenteral medications. Eight infusion fluids, seven ready-to-use solutions for infusion, and thirty concentrates or powders for solutions for infusion were examined. All these drugs, if relevant, were reconstituted and diluted following the manufacturer's instructions to achieve concentrations found most commonly in clinical practice. Samples were prepared by mixing IBFs and selected drug product solutions at the 1:1 volume ratio. All samples underwent visual inspection and determination of pH and turbidity before combining with IBF and in time points (0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes) after simulated Y-site administration with IBF. In the case of propofol, which is an emulsion for infusion, lipid droplet size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index were also determined. The incompatibilities were observed for IBF combinations with amiodarone, ciprofloxacin, clemastine, gentamicin, vinpocetine, and calcium chloride.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is the basis of the pathogenesis of diabetes, obesity and their complications. Under its influence, free radicals that have not been neutralized or removed from the cell environment lead to damage to cellular macromolecules - carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Honokiol and magnolol are neolignans derived from magnolia bark, which may be promising candidates in the fight against oxidative stress-related diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant potential of structural isomers - honokiol and magnolol - in vitro, taking into account their effect on radicals and the potential possibility of protecting biomolecules against oxidative damage, as well as to analyze their capability to inhibit the activity of enzymes associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The abilities of neolignans to neutralize ABTS and DPPH radicals and also to prevent the formation of markers of oxidative damage - advanced oxidation protein products and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were tested. The inhibitory properties of the compounds against the activity of enzymes (α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase) were also examined. The conducted analyzes indicate that in vitro honokiol possesses much better antioxidant properties and inhibits enzymes related to carbohydrate metabolism than magnolol. It neutralized model radicals and prevented oxidative damages almost as effectively as the reference compounds, with even better ability to inhibit enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. None of the neolignans significantlly affected the reduction of lipase activity. The effectiveness of honokiol and magnolol as free radical scavengers and α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitors requires further confirmation in in vivo models.",

    "abstract": "Satureja montana L. is widely used in traditional medicine and culinary. New varieties of this species are created and grown with different purposes. The essential oil (EsO) samples were obtained from the fresh flowering shoots of four new Ukrainian cultivars of S. montana: 'Krymski smaragd', 'Lunata', '697-1', and 'N3-18'. The EsO of cultivars ''Lunata' and 'Krymski smaragd' were studied in two following harvest years (2019 and 2020). The EsO samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). More than 60 components were identified in the studied EsO. Carvacrol was the principal component of all the samples (58.3-87.0% (as GC-MS relative abundances). p-Cymene was the second predominant component (5.0–8.8%) in the EsO of all the cultivars collected in the 2020 year, while cultivars ''Lunata' and 'Krymski smaragd' gathered in 2019 contained it in much fewer amounts (1.7% and 0.5%, respectively). γ-Terpinene was the third main component of EsO of the most studied varieties (0.9% to 6.6%). Only cultivar 'N697-1' contained carvacrol methyl ether at a significant level (11.7%). All the tested samples met the requirements of International Standard Organization (ISO) 79284:1991(E), supposing that the qualitative composition of the S. montana EsO should comprise the following main constituents: γ-terpinene, p-cymene, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, and carvacrol. It can be concluded that we dealt with the carvacrol chemotypes of S. montana. It was also revealed that growth year influenced the EsO composition of 'Krymski smaragd' and 'Lunata' cultivars. Our results afforded to compare the EsO of the S. montana new cultivars",

The tablets were prepared by a wet granulation technique and then exposed to relative humidities (RH) 1%, 78% and 100% at an ambient temperature of 28 to 30 degrees C for various time intervals up to 2 weeks. They were evaluated for disintegration time, hardness and moisture uptake. Tablets stored under RH% and 78% disintegrated within 15 minutes while those containing alpha-cellulose stored at RH 100% for a period > or = 24 h failed to disintegrate within 60 minutes. The time taken for this conversion from disintegrating to non-disintegrating tablets varied with disintegrant concentrations and its mode of incorporation. Tablets containing maize starch did not display this moisture effect. The observation is thought to relate to the gelling of the alpha-cellulose particles upon moisture sorption. Thus, high relative humidities impair the disintegrant property of alpha-cellulose, which underlines the need to prevent such tablets from moisture.",

It is important to determine the kind of death induced by the DTIC and the effect of a specific concentration. The evaluation of apoptosis and necrosis in these two mouse melanoma cell lines in vitro was performed. Induction of apoptosis was estimated in annexin V binding assay by flow cytometry. DNA content and cell cycle phases were determined by propidium iodide staining. DTIC induced morphological changes typical for apoptosis and necrosis in both cell lines. DTIC caused cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M phase of both cell lines which showed hypertetraploidy. The highest induction of apoptosis was observed in DTIC concentration of 200 microg/mL for B16 cells (11%) and 100 microg/mL for apoptosis Cloudman S91 cells (22.2%). Higher doses of DTIC caused intensification of necrotic process. The B16 melanoma cells are more sensitive to DTIC than the Cloudman S91 cells, however more intensive apoptotic process was detected in Cloudman S91 cells already at lower concentration of DTIC.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a simple stability-indicating HPLC-DAD method for the assay of Tildipirosin (TPS), which is a 16-member ring semi-synthetic macrolide, in an injectable solution.TPS is commonly used in the USA for the treatment of animalís respiratory infection.The isocratic elution was set up using the Inertsil-ODS column with the flow rate set at 0.9 mL/min and the detection wavelength of 285 nm.The column temperature was ambient and the overall runtime was 5 min.Additionally, the mobile phase was water: acetonitrile: trifluoroacetic acid (53.45 : 46.45 : 0.10, by volume).The HPLC-forced degradation stability method for TPS in Egydipiro Injectable Solution was performed in different stress conditions, i.e. light/UV, heat, acid, base, and oxidation.The results showed the linearity range was 36.00 to 108.00 µg/mL for TPS.The correlation coefficient was higher than 0.999 and the accuracy was 98.78%.The degradation percentages were presented ranging from 31.54% in the photodegradation condition to 50.10% in the base degradation.The Ecoscale score was about 82 points indicating an excellent green chromatographic technique.Therefore, the novel stability method was unique in terms of simplicity and environment-friendly aspects.The new HPLCñDAD method was the first, green, stability-indicating chromatographic method for a TPS analysis with its degradation products.However, the major drawbacks of the new chromatographic method are the incomplete identification of degradation products and the inability to propose an appropriate mechanism for drug degradation.Overall, the method can be employed to evaluate TPS stability under various storage conditions.",

The activities of A4H showed a significant increase in the liver at both dose levels of extract treatment. The hydroalcoholic extract of Urtica dioica induced the activities of A4H that had been increased by treatment of metal ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) and the mixture of cofactors (NADH and NADPH). At saturated concentration of cofactor, microsomal A4H exhibited significantly even higher activities in the presence of the mixture of cofactors than NADPH and NADH. Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions acted as stimulants in vitro. The present results suggest that the hydroalcoholic extract of Urtica dioica may have modalatory effect on aniline hydroxylase at least in part and enhance the activity of A4H adding metals ions and cofactors.",

Thiomersal and phenylmercuric borate were used to preserve the drops. The viscosity of the eye drops was increased using the solution of polyvinyl alcohol. The drops were stored in tightly closed glass infusion bottles, protected from light. For the stability of analysis a long-term assay was used under controlled conditions following the requirements of ICH, i.e., the time of storage was 24 months at the constant temperature of 25 +/- 2 degrees C and constant humidity of 60% +/- 2% RH. The eye drops containing metronidazole were significantly physically and chemically stable: after 24 months of storage the metronidazole concentration in the drops was close to 100% of the initial concentration. The drops were colorless and transparent. Physical and chemical properties such as pH, osmotic pressure and viscosity underwent insignificant changes during the storage. The preservation test showed that the degree of reduction of the pharmacopeal strains of micro-organisms in freshly prepared drops and in those stored for 24 months at the temperature of 25 +/- 20 degrees C was in agreement with the requirements of Ph.

It will also improve patient compliance and bioavailability. Controlled input of TZN would attenuate fluctuating plasma level of TZN resulting from oral therapy. The aim of the current investigation was to evaluate its flux and the effects of various penetration enhancers, viz., isopropyl myristate (IPM), isopropyl palmitate (IPP), butanol and octanol on transdermal permeation from matrix-based formulations through the skin. The enhancing effect on the permeation of TZN was determined using the mouse and human cadaver epidermis. In vitro permeation data were collected at 37 degrees C using Keshary-Chien diffusion cells. The skin permeation was then evaluated by measuring the steady state permeation flux of TZN, enhancement ratio and the diffusion parameter. The highest enhancing effect was obtained with IPM followed by butanol, octanol and IPP. In general, higher fluxes were observed through mouse epidermis as compared with the human cadaver epidermis. The skin retention of TZN for both the species in the presence of different enhancers was nearly 3 times higher than for the control formulation. Based on the observed results, a transdermal patch of about 70 cm2 consisting of 10 % IPM should be able to attain and maintain therapeutic plasma concentration of TZN at 0.75 mg/mL over a period of 24 h.",

    "abstract": "Melanin formation in pigmented melanoma cells is considered as a target for the tumor therapy. The evaluation of potential correlation between melanin structure and the tumor type could be also of diagnostic and prognostic importance. One of the major problems in structural investigations of natural melanins is the lack of appropriate methods, which allow isolation of pure intact pigment. In this study the thermochemolysis technique was used to assess the purification grade of melanin isolated from the human melanoma malignum cells by two different enzymatic methods. Melanin samples were thermally degraded in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide and the thermochemolysis products were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Compounds of lipid origin, especially fatty acid methyl esters and aliphatic and cyclic hydrocarbons, were predominant among pyrolysis products of melanin isolated from the tumor cells by method I. In contrast, during thermochemolysis of the pigment sample isolated by the method II, mainly eumelanin markers (pyrrole and its methyl derivatives, toluene, styrene, phenol, benzyl nitrile and indole) were formed. The comparison of pyrolysis profiles of the analyzed samples indicate that method II is more efficient for melanoma pigment purification.",

MNRC-5 exerted an inhibitory effect on S. mansoni cercarial serine protease at serial concentrations of the specific chromogenic substrate Boc-Val-Leu-Gly-Arg-PNA for such enzyme family and the inhibitory coefficient (Ki) value was deduced. Moreover, topical treatment of mice tails with the most potent inhibitory concentration of MNRC-5 formulated in jojoba oil successfully blocked cercarial penetration as demonstrated by a significant reduction (75%; p < 0.05) in the recovered S. mansoni worms from treated mice in comparison to control ones whose tails were painted with jojoba oil base containing no MNRC-5. In addition, the IgM and IgG reactivities to crude S. mansoni cercarial, worm and egg antigens were generally lower in sera from treated infected mice than untreated infected mice. In conclusion, we report on a new serine protease inhibitor capable for blocking penetration of host skin by S. mansoni cercariae as measured by lowering worm burden and decrease in the levels of both IgM and IgG towards different bilharzial antigens upon topical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of skin penetration of topically applied drugs is an important problem in the development of dermal creams and ointments.To evaluate this in humans in vivo, several models have been developed including suction blister fluid, tape-stripping and cutaneous microdialysis (1).However, such methods are somewhat invasive, so in vitro techniques based on the application of substances to human or animal skin have been developed.As human skin is not easily available, the use of artifi-cial membranes, both lipophilic and/or hydrophilic, seems to be a possible alternative.The penetration of active substances through the skin is dependent on a number of factors including a structure, molecular size and molecular weight as well as on other physical and chemical properties, especially its water and lipid solubility.After topical application, the first important barrier encountered is the stratum corneum, which protects the skin against harmful external factors, decreasing the pen-BIOPHARMACY",

    "abstract": "The salivary aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH3A1) oxidizes mainly aromatic and long chain aliphatic aldehydes. This enzyme protects organisms from aldehydes originating from food and air pollution, and can also be an important factor in chemical carcinogenesis prevention. In the majority of saliva samples the ALDH3A1 is more than in 60% inactive due to sulfhydryl groups oxidation in the active site. Our previous studies showed that the ALDH3A1 activity (the total activity and the inactivation degree) is strongly variable during a day and within the healthy population. The aim of the present study was to describe the influence of drugs intake on ALDH3A1 activity. Hierarchical clustering grouped two dimensional data (the total ALDH activity, the inactivation degree) derived from a group of 124 subjects into four clusters. Clusters were analyzed by a correspondence analysis. The total ALDH3A1 activity and an inactivation degree vary in healthy subjects depending on many factors including cigarette smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption and age. This work demonstrates that treated hypertension and acute pain/infection as well as hormonal contraceptive drugs intake also significantly affect the salivary ALDH activity. The result is significant for food safety and nutrition research.",

Emollient preparations demonstrate a moisturizing effect, they soften and smoothen the skin, keep water in the epidermis, supplement lipids of skin upper layers and protect from external harmful agents. The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize emollients containing natural emulsifier Olivem 1000 as topical delivery systems for urea or sodium hialuronate. Physicochemical and mechanical properties of designed formulations were evaluated. Moreover, ex vivo adhesion study on the hairless mice skin as a model of adhesive layer was carried out and in vivo preliminary assessment of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was performed. Prepared emollient formulations were characterized by smooth consistency, they were easily spreadable on the skin surface and showed no phase separation. Formulations containing xanthan gum as a thickening agent were characterized by higher viscosity, hardness, cohesiveness and adhesiveness values. Prepared emollients showed thixotropic properties and they were classified as non-Newtonian shear thinning systems. All prepared emollients demonstrated bioadhesive properties. The analysis of TEWL showed that the greatest decrease in the TEWL value was noted in the case of emollient containing sodium hyaluronate which was applied to the person with the skin described as “the skin in a very poor condition”. The results of the conducted research indicate that developed emollients containing natural emulsifier Olivem 1000 seem to be a promising form of care preparations for topical use in case of chronic dryness of the skin.",

    "abstract": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an endogenous, lipophilic quinone compound that functions as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and plays a pivotal role in cell metabolism. Despite its numerous important physiological functions, the practical application of CoQ10 is limited due to its high molecular weight, poor water solubility, photolability, chemical instability, and low bioavailability. To overcome these challenges, we developed a solid dispersion formulation of protamine loaded CoQ10 (CoQ10/Pr) using an efficient mechanochemical technology without solvents. Protamine was used as carrier and poloxamer 188 as solubilizer, while butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and micro powder silica gel were utilized as stabilizers and lubricants. The optimal ball milling condition to prepare CoQ10/Pr was at 100 r/min for 4 hours. The treated CoQ10/Pr has exhibited rapid-release properties, with significantly enhanced water solubility by 392,000 times, and bioavailability by 0.68 times. Furthermore, the treated CoQ10/Pr became resistant to moisture, high temperature and strong light, which makes it suitable for long-term storage. The molecular docking suggested that the solubilization mechanism of CoQ10 was closely associated with the encapsulation and complexation of protamine, as well as the formation of an intermolecular complex through hydrogen bond between CoQ10 and arginine residues on protamine. In summary, the CoQ10 solid dispersion formulation enjoys advantages such as excellent water solubility, stability, bioavailability, and low cost. This formulation also meets the stringent quality requirements of products in the food, cosmetic, and health industries. It offers dual benefits in both theoretical research and industrial development.",

We aimed to determine the content of chosen polyphenolic compounds in fruit extracts from four cultivars of elderberry (Alleso, Korsor, Sampo, Samyl) and their relation to antibacterial and antifungal activity. The content of polyphenols was determined with the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), while antimicrobial activity, including minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal (MBC) or fungicidal (MFC) concentration, was studied with the use of microbroth dilution method. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of concentrations of cyanidin glycosides, caffeic and quercetin derivatives depending on the plant cultivar. The extracts exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC = 0.313 – 0.625 mg/mL) and Helicobacter pylori (MIC = 0.313 – 1.25 mg/mL) and antifungal against Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis (MIC = 0.313 – 2.5 mg/mL). Results showed that the concentration of cyanidin glycosides, caffeic and quercetin derivatives depended on the analyzed S. nigra L. cultivar and pointed towards a correlation between their high content and antimicrobial activity. These results support the idea that elderberry fruits contain bioactive compounds providing them significant antimicrobial potential.",

    "abstract": "Considerable evidence suggests that glucocorticoids (GCs) play an important role in neurodegeneration. Chronic elevated levels of GCs can result in neuronal degeneration of the hippocampal piramidal neurons, which are paralleled by cognitive deficits. Moreover, GCs potentiate stress or ischemia-induced accumulation of excitatory amino acids (EAA) in the extracellular space of hippocampus. ACEA 1021 (licostinel), a selective antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, has been reported to prevent the excitotoxic action of high extracellular glutamate levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ACEA 1021 on neurotoxic effect of dexamethasone (DEX - a synthetic GCs receptor agonist). The experiments were carried out on Albino Swiss mice (25-30 g). ACEA 1021, at the doses: 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day, ip, was administered 15 min before DEX (16 mg/kg/day, ip). The long-term memory acquisition (passive avoidance test) and the motor performance (“chimney” test) were evaluated 14 days after the drugs administration. The prolongation of climbing time in the “chimney” test and decrease of the retention time in the memory task of mice treated with DEX for 14 days. In mice treated with DEX for 14 days, ACEA 1021 at the both doses reduced the climbing time in the “chimney” test, at the dose of 1.25 mg/kg improved memory acquisition. The above findings suggest that ACEA 1021 could prevent the neurotoxic effects induced by DEX, but further study needs to be carried out to explain this effect.",

Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely utilized chemotherapy drug, but its efficacy is limited due to dose-dependent toxicity. Here, we aim to explore the effect of indole-3-carboxylic acid on DOX-induced senescence of CRC. Methods: Healthy adult rats and aged rats were compared in terms of their metabolites and functions through non-targeted metabolomics. LS180 cells were treated with DOX to induce senescence, followed by indole-3-carboxylic acid. The effects of this combination were evaluated in xenograft tumor mice. Cell viability, proliferation, and cell cycle were assessed with the Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation assays, and flow cytometry. The levels of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) were detected by immunofluorescence. Senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) expression was assessed by SA-β-gal staining and immunohistochemistry. Western blot was used to detect the expression of p21 and p53. Results: Compared to healthy adult rats, the serum metabolome in aging rats was altered, and the abundance of indole metabolites, including indoxyl sulfate, indole-3-carboxylic acid, and indole-5-carboxylic acid, was decreased significantly. In LS180 cells, indole-3-carboxylic acid amplified DOX-induced cell senescence, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell cycle arrest. It also boosted DOX-triggered upregulation of SA-β-gal, SAHF, and p21. In nude mice, indole-3-carboxylic acid increased the inhibitory effect of DOX on xenograft tumors. Conclusion: Indole-3-carboxylic acid enhances the cellular senescence and growth arrest induced by DOX, suppressing mouse tumor growth. These findings suggest that a combined treatment of indole-3-carboxylic acid and DOX could be an effective strategy for CRC treatment.",

The animals from which the raw material was collected were kept in a traditional system. i.e. in an alcove-pasture system (farm A) and in an alcove system with the use of food delivered by a mixer feeder wagon (farm B). The study material consisted of collected milk, which was tested in 12 replications at each farm during the winter as summer season in 2019. The FA content showed variability for cows grazed on a pasture farm in the summer compared to little changes in the FA obtained from cows fed on the TMR feeding system. The FA content showed variability for cows grazed on a pasture farm in the summer compared to little changes in the FA obtained from cows fed on the TMR feeding system. In general, the study showed that the choice of feed and the season in which the animals are fed are important, as these factors affect milk fat (fatty acid) and, more specifically, have an impact on the overall quality of the milk.",

The aim of this work is to analyze the functioning and implemen-tation costs of unit-dose and multi-dose automatic drug distribution systems in comparison with the classical mode of so-called ward medicine cabinets. The study was conducted from January 2020 to October 2021. It included quantitative study, conducted to verify the functioning of hospital phar-macies based on an original questionnaire, which was completed by 26 masters of pharmacy em-ployed in pharmacies hospitals, of which 92.4% were pharmacy head, and in-depth face-to-face interviews conducted in 4 facilities with unit-dose systems and one center that uses the multi-dose system. The work presents the functioning of hospital pharmacies, and the advantages and disadvantages of classical distri-bution model. Opinions on the operation of unit-dose and multi-dose systems as well as experiences related to their implementation in the hospital, including the necessary changes in the structure and organization of the hospital, were also presented. In conclusion, despite high purchase costs, auto-mated drug distribution systems bring many benefits in the field of hospital functioning, mainly in relation to patient care, improving the effectiveness, safety and individualization of pharmacothera-py. The main barriers to implementation of these systems are high costs, lack of IT infrastructure adaptation, the need to change the organization of staff work and the lack of factory-prepared col-lective packaging. In the opinion of pharmacists, changes in the distribution of drugs are necessary and beneficial from proper pharmacotherapy perspective.",

An interesting alternative to conventional methods of monitoring the quality of medicinal products is the measurement of reflectance and emissivity. The study aimed to assess the change in emissivity and reflectance for different types of effervescent tablets containing paracetamol and vitamin C. In the study, three types of effervescent tablets of the same product were analysed i.e., unexpired, expired, and stressed tablets. The accelerated aging test was performed for 7 days in a Solarbox 1500 chamber (Italy), in which the tablets were irradiated with simulated sunlight and a temperature of 26⁰C. The reflectance had similar values for both unexpired and expired tablets, but these were higher than for the stressed tablets. The emissivity analyses showed that tablets exposed to UV radiation for 7 days had the highest emissivity value of all types in the spectral range of 1.5-21.0 µm. Using a hyperspectral camera, the differences between the maximum and minimum reflectance values were assessed, as this may reflect the homogeneity of the sample. Homogeneity was similar for unexpired tablets, expired tablets, and tablets stressed for 3 days, they showed better homogeneity than tablets stressed for 7 days. It can be speculated that UV radiation increases the reflectance of the tablets and decreases the homogeneity of the tablets tested.",

    "abstract": "Chemometric analysis is often used in many fields of science. One of the most popular are cluster analysis and principal component analysis. The presented work considers those methods to evaluate the lipophilicity of groups of pentacyclic triterpene derivatives. They are newly synthesized compounds with biological activity, so they can be used in the future as drugs and lipophilicity is an essential parameter. The experimental values of lipophilicity were determined using thin-layer chromatography. The plates were precoated with silica gel, and a mixture of 1,4-dioxane and acetate buffer was applied as the mobile phase. The experimental values of lipophilicity for investigated compounds were correlated with lipophilicity taken from freely available databases (ALOGPs, KowWin, XLOGP2, XLOGP3, miLogP, AClogP, ALOGP, MLOGP, iLOGP, WLOGP and SILICOS-IT). Those experimental values were also correlated with physicochemical properties such as molecular weight, the topological polar surface of the molecule, the number of rotatable bonds, and the number of donor and acceptor sites for hydrogen bonds. Some correlation equations could be formed for the correlation obtained. The cluster and principal component analysis were done based on the data obtained. All the experimental lipophilicity data correlate well with those theoretically calculated based on the structural formula. Almost all dependencies can be described by the correlation equation, with a high correlation coefficient. Thus, it is possible to infer the lipophilicity values of triterpene derivatives without any laboratory work. The physicochemical properties turned out to be less valuable and, apart from the compounds' molar mass, not helpful.",

    "abstract": "The frequent occurrence of bacterial skin infections makes it necessary to search new solutions. Due to the limited effectiveness of traditional antibacterial agents, novel treatment alternatives are investigated. The use of plant origin compounds seems to be beneficial, because they are usually well tolerated and do not cause as many side effects as synthetic substances. Tea tree oil (TTO) is noted for well-established antimicrobial activity, so it can be used in the treatment of various skin diseases. It is effective against Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria. The aim of this work was to develop the composition and preparation technology of emulsion with TTO using natural emulsifier Olivem 1000 - combination of cetearyl olivate and sorbitan olivate. The designed formulations were evaluated by testing pH, stability and droplets size of the dispersed phase in the prepared emulsions. The type of emulsions was determined by selective phase staining method. In addition, rheological, mechanical, ex vivo bioadhesive properties of the prepared emulsions were studied and their antibacterial activity against selected strains was estimated. Obtained formulations were non-Newtonian systems, showing a shear-thinning behaviour and thixotropic properties, with proper textural features and beneficial bioadhesive properties. It was also demonstrated that formulations with lower viscosity showed higher antimicrobial efficacy against tested microorganisms and larger zones of inhibition were observed in case of Escherichia coli strains. The results of the study showed that the prepared emulsions appear to be a suitable form of topical administration of TTO.",

    "abstract": "Aging of the skin is a complex and multifactorial biological process, affected by different intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Exogenous factors affecting the process of skin aging, together with nutrition, are topics which currently draw considerable attention. Although it is difficult to accurately define what presents a healthy diet for maintenance of youthful skin, considering the evident lack of clinical data and studies in humans, there are numerous evidence suggesting that the food we eat affects our skin aging and its’ appearance. Well-documented is a fact that the modern diet is a large source of advanced glycation end products and reactive oxygen species – compounds formed during certain food preparation methods which accumulation is associated with different disease and recently, skin aging as well. This review gives the current state of knowledge related to the role which advanced glycation end products and reactive oxygen species, formed during the certain food preparation methods, have in the mechanisms of the premature/extrinsic skin aging. Additionally, it summarizes available information, in the form of recommendations for both the public and nutritional professionals who have an interest in this field, regarding food preparation methods and practices which prevent formation of aforementioned compounds in food and consequently could reduce the food contribution to premature skin aging.",

    "abstract": "Antiarrhythmic drugs are used more and more often, which is related to the aging of the population and the growing number of arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF). One of the drugs used in AF is propafenone, considered a relatively safe drug in people without heart disease. Nevertheless, it can cause severe damage to the liver if one ignores the subtle symptoms that indicate an incipient problem. We present the case of an 82-year-old woman diagnosed with paroxysmal AF who developed acute liver injury during treatment with propafenone. On the fifth day of her hospitalization, we observed nausea and vomiting after introducing regular treatment with propafenone. Similar symptoms occurred before hospitalization when propafenone was taken ad hoc in the event of an AF attack. They were treated as dyspeptics in a patient who underwent cholecystectomy. Laboratory tests showed high serum alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, C-reactive protein, total bilirubin, and a slight increase in aspartate transaminase. Infection with hepatic viruses, alcohol abuse, other drugs toxicity, and intrahepatic cholangitis due to cholelithiasis were excluded as a cause of liver damage. With the discontinuation of propafenone, the patient's clinical condition and laboratory test results improved. Similar cases published in the literature are discussed in the paper. It also draws attention to the need to report adverse drug reactions to the appropriate authorities and discusses the reasons for under-reporting in Poland.",

Methods: Diclofenac sodium was incorporated into oil-in-water (o/w) and water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions consisting of a 2:1 ratio of Cremophor RH 40: Span 80 as surfactant phase, ethylhexyl palmitate as oil phase, and a 2:1 ratio of water: isopropanol as aqueous phase. Franz diffusion cell was used to determine the in vitro skin permeation. Morphology of microemulsions were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The depth of penetration distribution was visualized by fluorescently labelling, and observing using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Results: The o/w type provided an enhanced permeation flux, with more than a 3- fold increase in permeability coefficient across skin as compared with w/o type. The morphology characterization indicated that both o/w and w/o type were nano-sized and spherical in shape. It was observed by CLSM that o/w type significantly facilitated the penetration of sulforhodamine B (SRB) to the deeper layers of the skin (220 μm) than w/o type (150 μm). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that diclofenac sodium microemulsion can be transdermal, and the skin penetration depends on the microstructure and composition of microemulsion.",

    "abstract": "Quetiapine (QT) belongs to the second generation of antipsychotics. It is mostly used to treat depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. During biotransformation via myeloperoxidase (MPO) QT is oxidized to quinoneimine and a reactive radical, which may contribute to the development of oxidative stress during intoxication. The coexisting inflammation may also significantly contribute to the disturbances in the course of QT poisoning. In this study, twenty-one patients poisoned with quetiapine were examined. The study aimed to assess the correlation between blood QT concentration and selected oxidative stress as well as inflammation biomarkers, such as MPO and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the serum of poisoned patients. The obtained results were related to the values of the control group consisting of 21 healthy people, untreated and not poisoned with the drug. In patients with a toxic QT concentration in the blood (3.15 ± 2.11 μg/mL), the activity of MPO and CRP serum level were significantly higher in comparison to the control group. The mean level of CRP in the study group was 76.74 mg/L, while in the control group only 1.86 mg/L. The increase in MPO activity and CRP blood level in patients after QT overdose may confirm the hypothesis of oxidative disorders arising during its biotransformation and concomitant inflammation. Statistically significant relationships between selected biomarkers and blood QT concentration, the patient's clinical condition and the type of therapy were demonstrated.",

The process involves exposing the products to ionizing radiation, which destroys microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, rendering the products sterile. The most commonly used ionizing radiation sterilization methods are highly penetrating with low dose rate gamma-irradiation from isotopic sources and less penetrating but with high dose rate e-beam from accelerators. This review provides an overview of the principles and applications of radiation sterilization, including the types of radiation sources used, the differences between them that may affect the efficacy of the process, and the regulatory requirements for radiation sterilization of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug dosage forms. This review focuses on the analytical methods used to evaluate the effect of irradiation on drug substances. Finally, it discusses studies on radiation sterilization of various groups of drugs, including anthracyclines, β-lactam antibiotics, chloramphenicol and its derivatives, sulphonamides, antifungal drugs, β-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and others, and drug dosage forms.",

Hangovers are not solely caused by ethanol, but mainly by its toxic metabolites, such as acetaldehyde and acetic acid. Most of the negative symptoms occur when the concentration of alcohol in the blood decreases after drinking. Given that a large percentage of people consume alcohol and experience negative effects from its consumption, potential supplementation to help eliminate these adverse effects has been proposed. One promising ingredient is ginseng, which has been used in Eastern culture and traditional Chinese medicine for over 2,000 years. The aim of this study was to present the potential of Panax ginseng C.A. Mey. as an aid for the adverse effects of alcohol consumption and its protective effect on liver function. The literature analysis was based on data indexed in medical databases PubMed, Scopus, and Medline since 2010, using keywords such as \"Panax ginseng,\" \"hangover,\" \"alcohol consumption,\" and \"metabolism,\" connected by the logical conjuction “and.” The analysis confirmed the effectiveness of P. ginseng in the treatment and prevention of hangovers. Preparations containing P. ginseng can support ethanol metabolism by inducing enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and the cytochrome P450 isoform 2E1 system. An additional advantage of using P. ginseng may be its hepatoprotective effect.",

Currently, available medicines for UC remain unsatisfactory. Diacerein (DIAC) has exhibited anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in wide inflammatory disorders. However, the limited understanding of DIAC's role in bowel inflammation has necessitated the investigation of its efficacy in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in Balb/c mice in this study. Fifty mice were equally divided into five groups. Except for the control, all groups were given DSS for seven days to induce the colitis model. The model was treated with 25 and 50mg/kg/day of DIAC and 00mg/kg/day of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) for ten days. Several clinical, molecular and biochemical parameters were evaluated. Following the exposure to DSS, there was a significant upregulation in the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-α) and oxidative stress index (MDA). Meanwhile, the concentration of anti-oxidative stress indices (SOD, GPx and CAT) and the levels of IL-10, mucin-1 and 2 and tight junction proteins (TJs) ZO-1 and occludin were markedly suppressed. The colon length and body weight were reduced while DAI and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were elevated. Conversely, DIAC 50mg and 5-ASA significantly reversed the altered pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and MPO. Moreover, they significantly restored body weight, colon length, DAI, TJs, mucin-1 and 2 and IL-10. No significant results were found with DIAC 25mg. In conclusion, DIAC exhibited therapeutic effectiveness against colitis. This research may provide hope for testing its effectiveness against UC in humans",

Total antioxidative status (TAS) of the kidney and the main indices of the enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione and thioredoxin) antioxidative barrier were assessed. The total oxidative status (TOS) and concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, xanthine oxidase, myeloperoxidase, and oxidized glutathione were measured as markers of oxidative status. The oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated (TOS/TAS) to estimate the intensity of oxidative stress in the kidney. The exposure to Cd, dose- and duration-dependently, weakened the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative potential of the kidney leading to a decrease in its TAS, as well as enhanced oxidative status of this organ resulting in the development of oxidative stress. The administration of AM during the low-level and moderate intoxication with Cd significantly protected from this xenobiotic-induced disruption of the oxidative/antioxidative balance and development of oxidative stress in the kidney. In summary, even low-level long-term exposure to Cd may result in the occurrence of oxidative stress in the kidney, whereas supplementation with chokeberry products may improve the oxidative/antioxidative balance preventing oxidative stress in this organ.",

The main effective drug in the treatment of type 1 diabetes is insulin injections. In the case of type 2 diabetes, it is an adjuvant therapy. To purpose of this study was to show hypoglycemic action of betulin in a model of experimentally induced diabetes in rats. For the induction of diabetes, alloxan at a dose of 170 mg/kg, i.p. was used. The hypoglycemic effect of betulin was evaluated using doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day for 30 days. The activity of glucose metabolism enzymes: liver glycogen phosphorylase, hexokinase and liver and skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase in rats, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (DG-6-P) of the liver was also evaluated. Betulin in a dose-dependent manner normalized of glycemia, increased the basal insulin concentration in the blood serum, increased the activity of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes and on the gene expression profile of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Betulin also significant improved the morphology of the pancreas. In particular, there was an increase in the area of the islands, their diameter, an increase in the number of β cells in the composition of the islands. We conclude that betulin has hypoglycemic properties, improving glycemia and carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes and pancreatic morphology.",

    "abstract": "Statins are one of the most commonly used lipid-lowering drugs reducing the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. They are well tolerated and have relatively few side effects which mainly affect skeletal muscle. The impact of statins on skeletal muscle functions depends on the composition of the muscle fibers type. One of the mechanisms of statin-induced myopathy is imbalance between muscle protein synthesis and breakdown.Transcription factor FoxO3a is a key factor regulating muscle protein breakdown. The activity of FoxO3a is regulated namely by phosphorylation via PI3K/Akt pathway. Active, phosphorylated Akt catalyzes the phosphorylation and thus inactivation of FoxO3a. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on FoxO3a and Akt in different skeletal muscles in rats with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Atorvastatin (20 mg/kg b.w./day) or the vehicle was administered orally 21 days. FoxO3a, Akt and their phosphorylated protein levels were assayed by Western blot in gastrocnemius and soleus muscle. Additionally, muscle total protein level and serum CK activity were measured. In the gastrocnemius muscle atorvastatin decreased total FoxO3a and P-FoxO3a levels with no changes in Akt and P-Akt level. In contrast, in soleus muscle atorvastatin did not change the level of P-FoxO3a. However, total FoxO3a and the P-Akt level decreased. Serum CK activity did not change in both muscle under atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, the results of our study indicate that atorvastatin affects FoxO3a and Akt in a muscle type-dependent manner.",

Modifications in these genes also influence the accumulation of different bioactive compounds depending on species and/or variety.In antiquity, cyclamen plants were recognized for their therapeutic qualities and later gained importance due to their content in saponins, which have been reported to exhibit anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, and also to alleviate symptoms in acute rhinosinusitis patients.Furthermore, the extracts and isolated compounds are used as treatments in a wide range of diseases.In this review, we describe the transcription factors and their role in the development and ABCDE model formation of organs which led to the development of double-petal and fragrant varieties.Additionally, we describe the potential mechanisms of action underlying the therapeutic effects of saponin extracts against cancers and inflammatory disorders and their potential as a pharmacological agent in clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "In general, drugs can selectively accumulate in tissue.Incorporation of NMR-detectable nuclei into drugs can improve monitoring of the therapeutic efficiency.In vitro Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) are relatively novel methods as applied to pharmacology.The possibility of parallel application of both techniques on one sample makes its study easier and this approach is therefore commonly used (1).However, most applications of MRI and MRS in pharmacology involve in in vitro samples.To date, in vivo MRI or MRS has been successfully used in oncology, neurology, dermatology, gynecology, gastroenterology, urology, and many different areas of clinical medicine (2-5).The fast development of MRI and MRS techniques and the widespread availability of high-field magnets in the last decade has allowed for in vitro studies of tissues and cell cultures at higher magnetic field strength (6).This achievement is promising for in vitro drug testing.The most common parameter studied in MRI/MRS is NMR relaxation time.Two NMR relaxation times can be measured: (1) spin-lattice (T 1 ) and (2) spin-spin (T 2 ).Both, T 1 and T 2 magnetic relaxation times of water protons have been shown to be elevated for many types of tumors compared to normal tissues (7,8).MRI methods used to study anticancer drug efficacy are also becoming one of the most important aspects of individual treatment protocols.Thus, noninvasive, repetitive measurements of efficacy parameters are attractive in the pre-and clinical context.MRI is an important non-surgical tool in medical and biomedical analysis.Although the most often used nucleus that produces an NMR signal is hydrogen ( 1 H MRI), there is also the possibility of imaging other nuclei such as fluorine 19 F, carbon 13 C, phosphorus 31 P, 15 N, oxygen 17",

    "abstract": "Phytochemical investigation was carried out on the leaves of Lecaniodiscus cupanoides Planch (Sapindaceae). The diameter of the zones of inhibition of the 90% ethanol and aqueous extracts of the leaves were compared in order to determine the relative activity of the extracts against the tested microorganisms and also to verify its claimed ethnomedicinal use in the treatment of microbial infections. Phytochemical tests were carried out employing standard procedures. The antimicrobial activity of the extract was tested against standard strains and clinical isolates of some aerobic bacteria using the agar well diffusion method. Commercial antibiotics were used as positive reference standards to determine the sensitivity of the strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were also determined using the agar well diffusion method. Preliminary phytochemical studies revealed the presence of flavonoids, tannins, saponins and cardiac glycosides as the chemical classes of compounds present in the crude extract. The extracts showed inhibitory activity against clinical isolates of Bacillus subtilis. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus and a standard strain of Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 10788). The ethanol extract was more active than the aqueous extract against all the microorganisms tested, except against the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC values ranged from 2.5 to 6.25 mg/mL for all the organisms tested. The results showed that the ethanol extract was more potent than the aqueous extract. The broad spectrum of activity displayed by the extracts would appear to provide the scientific basis for the use of the leaves of Lecaniodicus cupanoides for dressing of boils, burns and cuts in ethnomedicine.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying vasorelaxation induced by amodiaquine (AMQ) in rat superior mesenteric arteries. In normotensive, conscious rats, AMQ at 1-20 mg/kg i.v. produced hypotension and dose-dependent bradycardia. In mesenteric rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine (PHE) (10(-5) M), AMQ caused concentration-dependent relaxation [IC50 = (1.34 +/- 0.04) x 10(-5) M, Emax = 67.5 +/- 0.8%]. Vasorelaxation induced by AMQ was unaffected after removal of the endothelium (Emax = 66.9 +/- 0.3%, p > 0.05), and in the presence of ouabain (10(-4) M) (Emax = 65.4 +/- 1.9%, p > 0.05). In contrast, vasorelaxation evoked by AMQ was significantly inhibited after pre-treatments with 4-aminopyridine (10(-3) M), tetraethylammonium (10(-3) M) and glibenclamide (10(-5) M), blockers of voltage-dependent K+ (Kv), large and intermediate conductance Ca2+ -activated K+ (BK(Ca)) and K(ATP), channels, respectively. Additionally, AMQ reduced CaCl2-induced contractions in Ca2+ -free solution containing KCl, probably due to its non-selective opening of K+ channels or may be acting as Ca2+ -antagonist. Furthermore, AMQ did not interfere with Ca2+ release from intracellular stores mediated by either phenylephrine (10(-5) M) or caffeine (0.02 M). Collectively, these results provide functional evidence that AMQ-induced hypotensive and bradycardic effects may involve the opening of K+ channels sensitive to 4-aminopyridine, tetraethylammonium and glibenclamide or the blockade of extracellular Ca2+ influx.",

    "abstract": "Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina platensis) has been used as a food by the Aztecs since the 16 th century in Mexico when it was fished from Lake Texaco and then dried and sold in the form of biscuits as described by Spanish soldiers.A. platensis is currently cultivated and is used in many countries as a dietary supplement because of its substantial nutritional value (1-3).Arthrospira maxima and Arthrospira platensis are the species classified as Spirulina, and most commonly these species are used in dietary supplements.The protein content in A. platensis is approximately 65ñ79% and is a complete source of protein and amino acids.About 7% of the weight of A. platensis contains lipids, mainly comprising γ-linolenic acid, α-linolenic acid, stearic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and arachidonic acid.A. platensis also contains significant amounts of γ-linolenic acid (4, 5). A. platensis is a good source of water-soluble vitamins such as C, PP (niacin) from group B (B 1 , B 2 , B 5 , B 6 , and B 12 ); fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D, E, and K; and eicosapentaenoic acid.It is also a good source of macro and microelements, such as P, Ca, K, Na, Mg, Fe and also contains inositol and dyes (phycocyanins, carotenoids, and chlorophyll b) (6,7,8).Phycocyanin, belonging to the water-soluble pigments phycobilins (1% of A. platensis mass), is mainly responsible for its ability to neutralize free radicals.This blue dye gives A. platensis its characteristic, dark-turquoise color.It also contains carotenoids such as β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin as well as chlorophyll a and b. A. platensis is used in the prevention and treatment of various diseases such as obesity, anemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, some cancers, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerís disease, and so on (9ñ13).Due to the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and immunostimulatory properties",

    "abstract": "The term ìfunctional foodî refers to modified food products that claim to provide an additional function besides basic nutrition needs.The consumption of functional food is known to exert a positive impact on health and to prevent the occurrence of pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer, and obesity.Functional food products should resemble conventional food in terms of appearance and taste.The goal is usually achieved by adding active ingredients to the traditional food products (e.g., phytosterols/stanols are added to margarine, dairy, and cereal products), removing or limiting the concentration of potentially harmful agents, or by agricultural and genetic modifications of already existing edible plants and animals (e.g., feeding hens on algae or fish in order to obtain n-3 PUFAs-enriched eggs, and inducing genetic and/or nutritional changes during animal production to obtain meat with lower cholesterol levels).Welldesigned intervention trials are scarce in this field, and more effort should be directed toward conclusively proving the role of functional food in disease prevention and health improvement among the population.These associated benefits and the advances in the food processing industry should stimulate the development of products that would match the requirements of a healthy diet, simultaneously reducing the risk of chronic diseases.The aim of the present review was to present the examples of functional foods that are essential for the prevention of obesity and cardiovascular disease, and thereby report on their putative mechanisms of action, health-promoting effects, and limitations by conducting various intervention studies.",

    "abstract": "Bromhexine hydrochloride (BRX) is widely applied as an active pharmaceutical ingredient of oral solutions and tablets for the treatment of the infections of the respiratory tract. However, fulfillment of the present regulations, required for the registration process of BRX, might constitute a challenge, due to the occurrence of (3RS)-6,8-dibromo-3-cyclohexyl-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin-3-ium, specified as impurity E by European Pharmacopeia. To overcome this issue, a novel BRX orodispersible tablets (ODT) with improved chemical stability were developed that contain low level of impurity E. Herein the analytical methods, elaborated for the determination of BRX and the related impurities in this product are presented. Stability of the product was tested at accelerated (ACC), intermediate (INT) and long-term (LT) conditions for ICH zones II and III. The degradant E was the most common impurity detected. In the samples stored in INT and LT conditions only a slight increase in the impurities and a slight drop in the assay of the BRX was observed, however the results did not exceed the pre-established acceptance criteria. In the samples stored at ACC conditions, an increase of the known impurities, including degradant E, degradant B and N-oxide, was noted. Noteworthily, even after three years of the product’s shelf-life, the level of the degradant E is still below 0.2 % which corresponds to the ICH identification threshold for the BRX related impurities.",

    "abstract": "One of the important features of prebiotics is their beneficial effect on the health of the host, which consists in the inhibition of the growth of harmful bacteria, including strains causing caries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cariogenic potential of a hydrolyzate of (1→3)-α-D-glucan (GOS) isolated from fruiting bodies of Laetiporus sulphureus, consisting of (1→3)-α-D-glucooligosaccharides (85.6%) and glucose (14.4%). The study was conducted in cultures of cariogenic bacteria belonging to the genus Streptococcus (S. mutans CAPM 6067, S. sobrinus DSMZ 20381, S. sobrinus/downei CCUG 21020, and S. sanguis ATCC 10556). The investigation of the cariogenicity of GOS included examination of the influence of the preparation on the growth of the above mentioned bacteria, their ability to synthesize mutan, and the formation of a sucrose-dependent biofilm. GOS significantly inhibited the growth of the investigated streptococci, and the observed beneficial effect was stronger than the changes induced by a commercial prebiotic preparation containing a mixture of fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Furthermore, GOS inhibited the mutan synthesis by the above mentioned bacteria but did not exert an impact on the formation of artificial dental plaque. In conclusion, the studies conducted showed low cariogenicity of GOS and confirmed the safety of its use as a dietary supplement.",

However, no research implied the amelioration of CGA on diabetes-associated muscular atrophy. In this study, diabetic model was established by streptozotocin (STZ) to appraise roles of CGA (30 mg/kg/d for 8 weeks) on diabetes-associated muscular atrophy. Our researches demonstrated that CGA enhanced representative myocyte cross-sections, gastrocnemius weight and grip strength. In serum, CGA restricted CK, LDH, MDA, TNF-a and IL-6 levels, while elevated T-ACO, SOD and CAT levels against diabetic-evoked muscle damage. In skeletal muscle, CGA increased BCL-2 expression, while reduced FBXO-32, MURF-1, DDIT-3, GRP-87 and BAX expressions to improve diabetic muscular atrophy. In conclusion, CGA protected from diabetic-associated muscular atrophy through its bioactivities on the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, and could be a powerful remedy approach in the ameliorations of diabetic muscle atrophy.",

The study aimed to assess the awareness and knowledge of drug-food interactions among Polish third-age university listeners before and after training on that topic. A total of 143 participants, with a mean age of 71.5 ± 5.5 years, took part in the study. 123 participants (86%) completed the pre- and post-training questionnaires. 91% of respondents had heard that food can affect the effectiveness of drugs and a similar number stated that they are aware of what time to take their medications. Information about drug-food interactions was most frequently obtained from the physician (34%), the drug leaflet (30%), or the internet article (23%). The mean percentage of correct answers to questions testing knowledge of drug-food interactions before and after training was 32% and 57%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). To determine the structure of relationships between parameters (or categories of parameters), the results were examined using correspondence analysis (CA). The categories of parameters with the highest quality of representation in the CA model were indicated and the parameters characterized by the highest strength of coexistence were determined. The majority of study participants were aware of drug-food interactions, but their knowledge of the topic was poor, and often incorrect. The training significantly increased knowledge of drug-food interactions. The study indicates the need to educate geriatric patients on the correct use of drugs with food and on the importance of drug-food interactions.",

    "abstract": "The prognosis for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) varies depending on genetic factors. The presence of mutations in the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene is found in approximately 30% of AML patients. Midostaurin, a first-generation multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the first FLT3 inhibitor approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients with the FLT3 mutation in combination with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy. However, as numerous clinical trials have shown, the list of indications for this drug is likely to be extended. Midostaurin can be administered orally, which improves the patient’s comfort during treatment. In general, it has a favourable safety profile, but interactions with other drugs, such as strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, which are often used in the concomitant therapy of AML patients, may lead to changes in midostaurin plasma concentrations. In consequence, such interactions may increase the toxicity of the treatment or reduce its therapeutic effect. The aim of this review is to summarise the current knowledge on midostaurin, i.e. its mechanisms of actions, dosage, adverse effects, mechanisms of resistance and limitations to its use. Due to the growing importance of the management of drug-drug interactions mediated via cytochrome CYP3A4, the main focus of this study is the pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and the variability of its plasma concentrations. The Authors emphasise therapeutic drug monitoring with midostaurin as a potential method of managing AML patients with FLT3 mutation.",

It was shown that in protein-restricted rats simvastatin stimulated liver BCKDH, whereas it exerted no effect on BCKDH in rats fed a standard diet. We hypothesized that combination of simvastatin and low-protein diet could have an impact on renal 2-OGDH. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of combination of simvastatin and low-protein diet on renal 2-OGDH in rats. Simvastatin (80 mg/kg b.wt/day) or the vehicle (0.3% methylcellulose) were administered orally (for 14 days) to rats fed low-protein (8% protein) or standard (23% protein) diet. 2-OGDH activity, protein levels and mRNA levels for E1 and E2 subunits were determined. In addition, serum creatinine level was measured. Results: The combination of simvastatin and low-protein diet elicited the increase of renal 2-OGDH activity that corresponded to the increase of E1 protein, but not of E1 mRNA level. In contrast, simvastatin treatment did not affect 2-OGDH activity, nor protein and mRNA levels of E1 in rats fed standard diet. Serum creatinine levels were not changed upon simvastatin administration in any group. In conclusion, the results of present study indicate that combination of simvastatin and low-protein diet induces stimulation of renal 2-OGDH complex probably at post-transcriptional level.",

    "abstract": "Chronic hyperglycemia is one of the most important causes of the formation of oxygen free radicals in diabetes, which damage various organs. Damage to proteins and lipids in the heart can lead to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which in turn may cause cardiovascular failure. In order to counteract oxidative stress, the innate antioxidant mechanisms of the system should be supported by supplementation with exogenous antioxidants, for instance of plant origin. In this experiment, the role of silymarin, a plant-derived flavonolignan on the oxidative stress parameters and oxidative damage markers in the hearts was determined in an experimental model of diabetes. Male Wistar rats were injected with streptozotocin at a dose of 60 mg/kg (ip). Then, silymarin was administered at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg for four weeks via a gastric tube. In diabetic animals an increase in malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, as well as increased activity of antioxidant enzymes in heart tissues was noted. Administration of silymarin inhibited oxidative stress by increasing the total antioxidant response, decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde and advanced oxidation protein products and a slight increase in the level of glutathione. It can be concluded that the redox state in the examined tissue improved. Based on the results in can be concluded that silymarin demonstrates a potential in preventing the development of oxidative damage in the heart tissue in the course of experimental diabetes.",

Hence, the objects of the study were to examine its effects on liposomes made of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) with the use of 1H NMR, four-electrode BLM and EPR techniques, and determine its activity on lipids and proteins of human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cells. In addition its protective efficacy against H2O2- induced oxidative shock was investigated. FTIR spectroscopy was applied to study molecular interactions with membrane lipids and proteins of HeLa cells. Microscopic techniques (SEM, light, and fluorescence), flow cytometer analysis, and NR assays were employed to reveal apigenin involvement in apoptosis in different cell conditions. Apigenin affected mainly the region of choline head groups and the hydrophobic core below this area. Simultaneously, the ordering effect was shown. The fingerprint region of lipids in the HeLa cells was found as a target for apigenin. Furthermore, in the amide I and amide II regions, a decrease in β-sheets and an increase in turns, loops, and unordered structures were noted. Apigenin reduced viability of cells and induced apoptosis. SEM observations revealed characteristic changes in morphology of the examined cells. Pretreatment of HeLa cells with apigenin protected them against H2O2-induced oxidative stress by the increase in glutathione content as well as superoxide dismutase and catalase levels. The consequences of molecular changes related to membranes and cancer cells make apigenin a unique and very interesting bio-compound with great significance for medical and biological applications.",

Synthesis of amino-thiopephen derivatives (1a-1b) was performed through reaction of 3β-hydroxypregn-5-ene-20-one with ethyl cyanoacetate or malononitrile and sulphur. 3β-Hydroxypregn-5-ene-20-one was reacted with ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of hydrazine, urea or thiourea to obtain aminopyrazole (3), aminopyrimidine (4a-4b) derivatives, respectively. The amino-thiophene derivatives (1a-1b) further reacted with either phenylisothiocyanate or benzoylisothiocyanate to form fused thienopyrimidine derivatives (5a-5d). The products 1a and 1b were also treated with ethyl cyanoacetate to afford cyanoacetamidothiophene derivatives (6a-6b) which were converted to fused thienopyridone derivatives (7a-7b) through cyclization reaction. The compounds 6a and 6b were allowed to react with different carbonyl compounds including salicyaldehyde, cyclopentanone-sulphur mixture, acetylacetone and malonaldehyde to prepare coumarin (8a-8b), cyclopentylthiophene (9a-9b) and 2-pyridinone (10a-10d) derivatives respectively. Furthermore, the reactions of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and benzoylacetonitrile with the compounds 6a-6b separately afforded new aminoisoxazole (12a-12b) and phenylpyridone (14a-14b) derivatives, respectively. The structures of new products were established through IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analysis. The synthesized compounds (1a-1b to 14a-14b) displayed in-vitro antitumor activity against human cell-lines, including MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), SF-268 (CNS cancer) and NCI-H460 (non-small lung cancer cell). The results suggested that all the screened products exhibited cell growth inhibitory activity in a dose-dependents manner.

    "abstract": "Two novel fluorocurcumin adducts with a difluoroboryl group exhibited activity in vitro against two bladder cancer cell lines, namely 5637 and SCaBER. The stability was evaluated under physiologically relevant conditions to mimic both the digestive tract and the bladder environment. Therefore, experiments were performed in hydrochloric acid at pH 1.2, and in buffer solutions with pH from 4.5 to 6.8 at 37°C. A validated HPLC method, allowing the monitoring of changes in substrates and products concentrations over time, was applied. Notably, the main decomposition product was the fluorocurcumin derivative without the difluoroboryl group. The decomposition of the fluorocurcumin adducts to the major products undergoes the pseudo-first-order kinetics reaction.",

    "abstract": "Furosemide and torasemide (loop diuretics) are used to treat hypertension or pulmonary edema. They are often administered in the parenteral route. In critically ill patients, there is a problem of a limited number of venous accesses, which complicates the polytherapy. Drugs of unknown compatibility must be administered separately, and the problem increases in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Lipid emulsions have been introduced into clinical practice as a high-calorie, non-glucose source of energy for parenteral administration, but they can also be used as lipophilic drug carriers. In this paper, the parenteral nutrition admixture (PNA) Nutriflex Lipid special was used as a drug carrier for furosemide and torasemide. For this purpose, drug stability tests (HPLC method) were carried out in various light and temperature conditions, imitating clinical conditions, and the parameters of the lipid emulsion (pH, zeta potential, the size of the emulsion droplets and polpolydispersity) were tested. Furosemide and torasemide added to Nutriflex Lipid special did not cause significant changes in the physicochemical properties of PNA. Changes in pH and MDD were within acceptable limits. Both drugs when added to Nutriflex Lipid special were degraded, dependent on the storage conditions and the chemical structure.",

Early and improved classification of the type of diabetes, whether autoimmune (type 1 diabetes mellitus, T1DM, and latent autoimmune diabetes, LADA) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is essential to determine appropriate therapy. We aimed to present the biochemical and immunological characteristics of adult patients with newly diagnosed diabetes without prior drug treatment. This pilot, a cross-sectional study assessed major phenotypic characteristics and antibody titers, including islet cell antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), tyrosine phosphatase antibodies (IA-2A), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA), zinc antibodies (ZnT8A), but also selected sphingolipids belongs to ceramides (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM). A total of 59 participants were included: 21 with T1DM, 15 with T2DM, and 23 with LADA. Saturated fatty acids chain Cer such as Cer-C22:0 and Cer-C24:0 positively correlates with total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), particularly in autoimmune diabetes (LADA, T1DM) while in T2DM group we found a higher frequency of positive correlation only between Cer-C24:0 and TC. In LADA patients, SM-C18:1 and -C:20:4 values rise with increasing fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-peptide values. The prevalence of GADA in patients diagnosed with T1DM is higher in younger patients versus older ones. While patients with LADA were more likely to test positive for multiple (&gt;4) antibodies. In this relatively small cross-sectional study adult patients with newly diagnosed diabetes have fluctuating clinical and metabolic features with variable severity of immune dysfunction, making it easier to diagnose patients.",

For this purpose, forty-two rats were randomly divided into two groups: normal control (n = 6) and diabetic (n = 36) groups, which were submitted to the following treatments: A: normal rats; B: diabetic rats; C: diabetic rats with sitagliptin (1 mg/kg); D: diabetic rats with metformin (10 mg/kg); E: diabetic rats with alpha lipoic acid (10 mg/kg); F: diabetic rats with a combination of alpha lipoic acid and sitagliptin; G: diabetic rats with a combination of alpha lipoic acid and metformin. The glycemia of these animals was monitored weekly; the use of alpha lipoic acid resulted in a significant decrease in glycemic levels. Combining alpha lipoic acid with either metformin or sitagliptin is most effective for reducing blood glucose levels in animals with acute and chronic hyperglycemia, even at different treatment times. Thus, associated with either metformin or sitagliptin, alpha lipoic acid improved their anti-diabetic effects.",

Next generation impactor (NGI) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detector were applied to determine two compounds and fine particle dose (FPD) of each active ingredients in DPI. The most satisfying chromatographic separation was obtained on Poroshell SB C18 (100 mm × 4.6 mm, 2.7 µm) column applying gradient elution by phosphonate buffer and acetonitrile. VT and FF were detected on a UV detector at wavelength of 210 nm and 245 nm, respectively.

Although various physicochemical properties of VT and FF, the analytical procedure allows simultaneously determine two compounds at different wavelengths. Limit of quantitative (LOQ) of vilanterol and fluticasone furoate were determined as 0.049 µg/ml and 0.032 µg/ml, respectively, what is desirable to determine of FPD of active ingredients in microdoses in DPI. The analytical procedure was determined as linear and accurate in the range of LOQ – 2.5 µg/ml and LOQ – 10.0 µg/ml of VT and FF, respectively.

    "abstract": "Controlling blood glucose is the primary therapeutic strategy for T2DM. Both saxagliptin and andrographolide possess hypoglycemic effects, which makes the combination easy. This study aimed to evaluate the co-administration of saxagliptin and andrographolide in rats and revealed their combined impact on type 2 diabetes (T2DM). T2DM rat models were established by high-fat diet and the injection of nicotinamide and streptozotocin. The blood glucose and insulin resistance index were monitored after modeling. The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin was assessed by orally administrating 10 mg/kg saxagliptin. The co-administration was performed with the pre-treatment of 30 or 100 mg/kg andrographolide. In vitro, the metabolic stability of saxagliptin was assessed in rat liver microsomes. The co-administration of saxagliptin with andrographolide induced significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin, behaving as the increasing AUC(0-t), Cmax, t1/2, and the decreasing clearance rate. The effect of andrographolide was enhanced with the growing concentration. Combination with andrographolide enhanced the hypoglycemic effect and alleviated insulin resistance of saxagliptin in T2DM rats. Co-administration of saxagliptin with 100 mg/kg andrographolide induced hypoglycemia. In vitro, andrographolide significantly improved the metabolic stability of saxagliptin and showed a significant inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP3A4. Combining saxagliptin with andrographolide could increase the systemic exposure of saxagliptin via inhibiting CYP3A4 and improve the hypoglycemic effect, but the high concentration of andrographolide is the risk of inducing hypoglycemia.",

That is why it was decided to investigate the mechanism of DOX and PUFAs toxicity on SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The influence of DOX on the PUFAs oxidation and effect of DOX and EPA or DHA on cellular metabolic activity, viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis and oxidative DNA damage in these cells were measured. DOX induced oxidation of the EPA and DHA. Toxicity of DOX and PUFAs towards breast cancer cells was associated with oxidative damage. These PUFAs reduced growth of the tested cells and caused their death. EPA and DHA potentiated DOX toxic effects through induction of oxidative DNA damage. The antitumor effect of PUFAs alone and combined with DOX strongly depended on induction of the oxidative stress that facilitated cell death. The observed changes of DOX toxicity induced by PUFAs suggest the possibility of their application in developing therapeutic anticancer strategies.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma, which is one of the principal causes of irreversible blindness in the world (1), represents a serious public health problem.The global number of glaucoma patients was 44 million people in 2013, and this number is predicted to increase to 53 million by 2020, which is associated with the general trend of population ageing (2).The global percentage of glaucoma patients in the population is 1-2%, and in the group of persons above 70 years of age, it is up to 5% (2), three-fourths of which (74%) are cases of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) (3).Glaucoma is a type of degenerative neuropathy characterised by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with subsequent visual field defects (1).Although high intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor of the diseaseís development, it is not necessary for the occurrence of glaucomatous neuropathy (2).The benefits of lowering IOP with respect to inhibition of primary open-angle glaucoma progression have been definitively proven.Nevertheless, the estimated risk of monocular visual defect in patients with POAG at a level of 27% was higher than previously expected (3).Therefore, IOP reduction may not be sufficient to limit the disease in a certain group of patients with diagnosed glaucoma.Alternative treatment methods, as well as neuroprotection, are considered in such cases. Neuroprotection to counteract neurodegenerationNeuroprotection means measures aimed to protect nerve cells from damage and elimination (4).In the context of glaucomatous neuropathy, the objective of neuroprotective treatment is to reduce risk factors that lead to early activation of the cascade of processes whose ultimate outcome is death of retinal ganglion cells (5).In glaucoma, ganglion and glial cells die mainly due to the process called apoptosis, i.e. ìprogrammed cell deathî.Under normal conditions, a cell constantly receives information about how it should function from its environment.This is important from the perspective of tissue homeostasis.On one hand, the cell may receive a signal to divide into two and multiply, and on the other hand, if the cell is damaged, it may receive a signal to undergo apoptosis in order to eliminate the pathologically changed tissue.In such a case, the cell produces enzymes with which it may ìdigestî itself, leaving only small apoptotic bodies that subsequently undergo phagocytosis (6).The death of ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve is caused by neuronal damage as a",

    "abstract": "In a developed country, about 25% of people suffer from allergic diseases including food allergy, atopic dermatitis, anaphylaxis, sinusitis, pruritus, and asthma (1).As the effector of allergic inflammation, mast cells play an important role in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases (2).On the surface of mast cells, there are Fc receptors (FcεRI), which can bind immunoglobulin E (IgE) with high-affinity.After exposed to allergens, crosslinking of IgE bound to FcεRI will be induced and result in the activation of mast cells through degranulation, which will lead to the extracellular release of preformed mediators including histamine stored in the cellsí cytoplasmic granules (3).These events will cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability with edema, and acute functional changes in affected organs (1).In addition to the acute allergic response, prolonged or repetitive exposure to allergens will give rise to edema, pain, warmth, and erythema due to the synthesis and secretion of chemokines and cytokines following activation of mast cells, which presents the chronic inflammatory response (4).Nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells factor (NF-κB) is a crucial transcription factor regulating the expression of target genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6 (5).In most cells, NF-κB resides predominantly in cytoplasm in the form of an inactive complex with the inhibitory IκBα, which is the substrate of IKK (IκB kinase) (6).After exposure to stimuli, IKK is activated and phosphorylates downstream IκBα, which results in the degradation of IκBα through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the release of NF-κB from the complex (7).Then the released NF-κB translocates to nucleus and regulates the expression of target genes (8).Therefore, inhibition of NF-κB can attenuate chronic allergic inflammation.

Included sample consisted of Polish-speaking physicians whose main specialization was gynaecology, gastroenterology, dermatology, family medicine, internal medicine, otorhinolaryngology, paediatric otorhinolaryngology, paediatrics. Answers were gathered using computer-assisted telephone interview. The majority of surveyed physicians believed that every Polish patient receives treatment tailored to their personal needs (68,7%) and agreed that compounded medicines are a way to facilitate individualization of pharmacotherapy (79,3%). Frequency of prescribing of magistral formulations, as well as views on quality of compounded medicines, ease of prescribing, and filling a prescription vary between specializations and places of practice. The problem that negatively affects the practice of the largest group of respondents was complicated and frequently changing legal regulations (63.3%), while the least frequently indicated problems were concerns about the quality of preparation (16.7%). Based on opinion of surveyed physicians, a simplification of the regulations for prescribing and liberalization of reimbursement rules are main changes to consider in order to improve clinical practice in the areas where it relates to the prescription of compounded medicines.",

    "abstract": "This experiment used mice as the experimental subjects to study the alleviating effect of Lactobacillus pentosus CQZC01 (LPCQZC01) on antibiotic-induced diarrhea in mice. After adaptive feeding for seven days, Kunming (KM) mice were randomly divided into the following groups: positive control group, model group, normal group, high concentration group of LPCQZC01 (H-LPCQZC01, 1×109 CFU/mL), and low concentration group of LPCQZC01 (L-LPCQZC01, 1×108 CFU/mL). Except for the normal group, mice were orally administered with lincomycin hydrochloride (120 mg/day) for 7 consecutive days. Changes in body weight, food intake, water consumption, and fecal water content of mice were observed. A histological examination of mouse colon and small intestine sections was done to find out if Lactobacillus pentosus CQZC01 may help mice with antibiotic-induced diarrhea. The findings demonstrated that, in comparison to the model group, mice in the H-LPCQZC01 and L-LPCQZC01 groups had considerably lower blood levels of nterleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17A (IL-17A), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and malondialdehyde (MDA), and other variables. In comparison to the model group, the fecal water content in the H-LPCQZC01 and L-LPCQZC01 groups was considerably lower. The H-LPCQZC01 and L-LPCQZC01 groups consumed more food and liquids than the model group did. The H-LPCQZC01 and L-LPCQZC01 groups had more intact colon walls and more compact, regular, and organized intestinal villi. H-LPCQZC01 and L-LPCQZC01 groups had the lower CFTR, EGFR expression and stronger NHE1, NHE2 expression than model group. This study reveals that Lactobacillus pentosus CQZC01 may treat inflammatory lesions in the mouse intestines and successfully treat antibiotic-induced diarrhea in mice.",

    "abstract": "Dry skin is the common problem affecting people which triggers many unpleasant symptoms such as roughness, peeling, burning, itching and greater sensitivity to injury and external conditions. One method to assess the water loss of skin is transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement. Various active substances, for instance allantoin and D-panthenol, can be used to overcome the symptoms of the dry skin. In this study, emulsions containing allantoin and D-panthenol as moisturizing agents and various oils (liquid paraffin, Cannabis sativa, Baobab and Coconut oil) were developed. The prepared emulsions were characterized by: visual and microscopic appearance and pH values. Stability analysis was conducted by centrifuge test and sensory test using sensory sensation was evaluated. Rheological experiments were performed using a rheometer, while mechanical and adhesion tests by texture analyzer. TEWL values were measured using a tewameter, after application of the emulsions to the responders skin. TEWL study noticed that regular permanent use of moisturizing emulsions with allantoin and D-panthenol limited the water loss. In conclusion, it can be stated that emulsions containing allantoin and D-panthenol as active agents and Coconut oil as oily ingredient are attractive formulations with moisturizing effect and good application features.",

In addition, flow cytometry and Annexin V-FITC/PI were applied to detect apoptosis of SW480 cells, and Transwell was to detect cell migration and invasion. β-catenin, c-myc, and Wnt1 genes were assessed by RT-qPCR, and E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin, c-myc, mTOR, p-mTOR, and Wnt1 proteins were detected by Western Blot. OSU-03013 had dose-dependent and time-dependent antitumor activity on SW480 cells, which can promote tumor cell apoptosis, up-regulate E-cadherin, and down-regulate β-catenin, c-myc, Wnt1, and N-cadherin. OSU-03013 has anti-tumor activity on CC cells. The anti-cancer mechanism of OSU-03013 is achieved by inhibiting the activation of Wnt pathway genes and inhibiting tumor invasion and metastasis.

Based on the solubility tests of alverine citrate, a hard capsule was prepared with the highest possible dose of the active substance. The release profiles of alverine citrate and its stability were also investigated. XRPD and ATR-FTIR analysis shows that all alverine citrate samples (despite differences in the synthesis process) are in the same polymorphic Form I. Scanning electron micrographs of alverine citrate from each manufacturer show differences in morphology (texture). The solubility studies confirmed the complete solubility of the highest dose of alverine citrate in media with a pH of 1.2-6.8. The release studies show that the release of the active substance, regardless of the manufacturer type, meets the immediate release requirement. Accelerated stability studies confirm the stability of the alverine citrate from selected manufacturers. As a result, the manufacturer of the final medicinal product may allow their inter-changeability during production without compromising the safety or efficacy of the medicinal product.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of protective vaccination against COVID-19 was a turning point in the fight against the pandemic. Expectations also concerned the effectiveness of vaccines in inducing a strong immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the length of post-vaccination immunity. This topic seems to be especially important in the case of immunocompromised people such as those living with HIV (PLWH). The aim of the study was to examine the concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the S1 subunit of the virus’spike protein as a marker of humoral response and the concentration of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as an indicator of cellular response in PLWH undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and uninfected people (control group) several months after the COVID-19 booster. Concentrations of selected enzymes from the group of sirtuins (SIRT1,-3,-6) that participate in the course of HIV infection were also examined. Concentrations of IgG and IFN-γ were statistically significantly lower in PLWH compared to the control group. Correlations between IgG and IFN-γ concentrations were found both in PLWH and in the control group. Only the concentration of SIRT-6 was significantly lower in PLWH compared to the control group. Vaccination for COVID-19 enabled good long-term humoral and cellular immunity in both HIV positive and uninfected people. The CD4/CD8 ratio and T CD8+ T lymphocytes count played a role in the long-term immune response to booster vaccination. The introduction of optimal cART stabilized the immune status of PLWH and had a positive effect on the humoral and cellular response against infection SARS-CoV- 2.",

While the cooperation of physicians, nurses, midwives, and paramedics is well documented, more and more attention is paid to the role of pharmacists in interdisciplinary care. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacist’s perception of the current state of community pharmacist-physician collaborative working as well as to identify barriers to the implementation of the community pharmacist-physician collaborative working model in Poland. This cross-sectional survey was carried out between October and December 2022 among community pharmacists in Poland. A total number of 1327 pharmacists from one of the largest franchise chain pharmacy networks in Poland were invited to take part in this study. The study questionnaire included 23 questions on the current state of pharmacist-physician collaborative working, the scope of cooperation, barriers to cooperation, and educational and organizational needs. Completed questionnaires were received from 635 pharmacists (response rate of 47.9%). Formal correction of the prescription (91.3%) was the most common cause of pharmacist-physician collaborative working. Moreover, 62.7% of pharmacists indicated that modification of ordered drugs was the reason for pharmacist-physician collaborative working. Only 3.3% of community pharmacists indicated that they collaborate with physicians during the drug review. Lack of IT systems enabling pharmacist-physician collaborative working (67.6%) and lack of recommendations on pharmacist-physician collaborative working (57.3%) were the most common barriers to collaboration with the physician. Pharmacists declare their readiness to cooperate with physicians, but there is a need to strengthen trust between both groups.",

Seseli species, known for their high coumarin content as well as terpenoids, flavonoids, essential oils, and more, have been extensively investigated and found to possess various pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, antitumor, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory, etc. Some Seseli species have also been used in treating central nervous system disorders such as anxiety. From 135 species 12 are distributed in Georgia (original name of the country is Sakhartvelo), from which 3 are endemics. Despite numerous studies on the chemical composition and pharmacological properties of various Seseli species, some remain unexplored, especially those found in Georgia, where data is limited and out of date. Therefore, further extensive research is necessary to improve understanding of the pharmacological activities, chemical constituents, and efficacy of plants from the Georgian Seseli species. The presented review draws attention to Seseli species distributed in Georgia, their phytochemistry, botanical characterisation and traditional use. However, as the information on biological activity of Georgian Seseli spp. is limited, we discussed potential pharmacological properties expected based on their chemical composition, also in relation with the same species from other countries or botanical gardens.",

It is used to prevent thrombotic events of atherosclerotic etiology and to prevent stroke and peripheral embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The aim of studies was to assess the bioequivalence of two orally administered products: test (Zarixa hard capsules) vs. reference (Xarelto® film-coated tablets). Two crossover, 2-period, randomized, open-label, laboratory-blinded studies were conducted in healthy White male and female volunteers. A single oral dose (Study 1: 10 mg fasting, Study 2: 20 mg fed) of the test or reference product was followed by a minimum 7-day washout. Blood was collected up to 48 h after administration. Plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were measured using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The bioequivalence criteria for 90% confidence intervals (CI) of the log-transformed geometric mean ratios (test/reference) for the two primary pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC(0-t) and Cmax) were set at 80.00-125.00%. Vital signs, laboratory parameters, and adverse events were monitored. 34 of 36 volunteers completed Study 1, and geometric mean ratios were 97.96% (90% CI 93.69-102.42%) for AUC(0-t), and 89.35% (90% CI 84.28-94.72%) for Cmax.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of lacidipine, amlodipine and benidipine on the analgesic activity and toxicity of tramadol. Rats (n=6/each group) were divided into five groups as control(CG), tramadol(TRD), lacidipine+tramadol(LTRD), amlodipine+tramadol(ATRD) and benidipine+tramadol(BTRD). Tramadol was administered once at a dose of 50 mg/kg and lacidipine, amlodipin, benidipin were administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg orally, once a day for 10 days. After the animals were sacrificed malondialdehyde(MDA) and total glutathione(tGSH) levels were measured in brain, heart, liver and kidney tissues. Troponin I(Tp I), alanine aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), blood urea nitrogen(BUN), and creatinine levels were determined in serum. Paw pain thresholds were measured 1 hour before and after drug administration. Analgesic effect of tramadol was increased the most by benidipine, while amlodipine and lacidipine increased it equally. Lacidipine failed to suppress MDA increase and tGSH decrease in brain tissue. Benidipine suppressed MDA increase and tGSH decrease in brain tissue better than amlodipine. All three drugs suppressed cardiac tissue oxidative stress and the release of TP I into the circulation. Lacidipine and amlodipine could not prevent tramadol-induced oxidative stress in liver and kidney tissues, whereas benidipine prevented excessive MDA increase and tGSH decrease. Benidipine significantly suppressed the increase of ALT, AST, BUN, and creatinine. Analgesic activity was 35.1% in TRD, 43.7% in LTRD 50.4% in ATRD and 67,5% in BTRD. Study results show that benidipine and tramadol co-treatment is better than co-treatment with lacidipine or amlodipine in achieving minimal toxic effects and maximum analgesia.",

Our calibration curve was found to be linear over the concentration ranges of 1.25–100 μg/mL, which covers the therapeutic range of meropenem in patients. From the calibration curve, the limits of detection and quantification were calculated to be 0.4 μg/mL and 1.2 μg/mL, respectively. Recovery ranged from 81.7 to 95.9 percent. Intra-day truennes ranged from −1.9 to 2.6% and inter-day trueness ranged from −4.7 to 3.8%. Intra-day precision was less than 4 percent, while inter-day precision was less than 7 percent.

    "abstract": "Protein kinase CK2 has become a target of experimental antiglioma therapies as laboratory data are almost uniformly favorable and the number of synthetized CK2 inhibitors is rapidly growing. The evidence of their use for other brain tumors is on the increase as well. Great expectations are entrusted in naturally occurring compounds capable of inhibiting CK2 kinase. These compounds are extracted and purified by means of biochemistry methods and are amenable for innovative drug delivery systems as well. CK2 kinase inhibitors have been proven suitable for combined therapies with other investigational antiglioma agents and treatment modalities. However a greater share of efforts should be undertaken towards inhibiting functions relatively specific for glial tumors including infiltrative growth and invasiveness or maintenance of glioma initiating cells. Many of these function appear to converge on mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways which are being meticulously studied in this respect. Protein kinase CK2 holds therapeutic promise especially when combined with other agents aimed at molecular signatures of gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Drug-related hospitalisations pose a significant burden to the health-care system. The aim was to investigate the prevalence of drug-related problems (DRPs) and their association with hospital admissions in five internal medicine wards. The study included patients admitted to the nephrology, cardiology, gastroenterology, endocrinology and geriatric ward. Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe classification V9.1 was used for identifying DRPs. In total 535 patients participated in the study. We identified 954 DRPs (range 1-7) in 80.7% of patients. Most DRPs were identified on the endocrinology, cardiology and geriatric ward, and they were associated with the efficacy of treatment (71.4%), adverse drug events (10.2%) and unnecessary drug treatment (18.4%). DRPs were associated with the cause of hospitalisation in 74.4% of patients on the nephrology ward, 60.1% and 60.6% of patients in the cardiology and endocrinology ward, respectively, whereas this number was lower in the geriatric and gastroenterology wards (26.9% and 8.9%, respectively). Suboptimal drug treatment due to medication omissions, was often associated with the potential cause of hospital admission. Focusing on patients with specific diseases and DRPs, rather than reducing the number of medications in primary care, may be potentially rational in the attempt to reduce drug-related hospitalisations.",

In this study, we explored the protective effect of 4-HBd on the neurovascular unit (NVU) after CIRI and its mechanism through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Establish rat of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reproduction (MCAO/R) model, transwell chamber was used to establish an in vitro primary cell co-culture model to simulate NVU, causing oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury, simulating the pathological of CIRI in vivo. Longa 5-point method was used to evaluate the neurological function of the rats, and transmission electron microscope was used to observe the ultrastructural changes of NVU. Western Blot was used to detect the expression of neuronal protein in rat brain. The mRNA expressions of ang-1/tie-2 signaling pathway and bdnf/trkb signaling pathway were detected by qPCR. In vivo results showed that 4-HBd reduced neurological function scores and improved the ultrastructure of NVU after MCAO/R rats. 4-HBd could up-regulate the expression of microtubule associated protein-2 (Map-2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and occludin. In vitro results showed that 4-HBd could activate ang-1/tie-2 signaling pathway, increased occludin mRNA expression and protect the blood brain barrier (BBB). 4-HBd can activate bdnf/trkb signaling pathway, up-regulate map-2 mRNA expression, and promote neuronal repair. In vitro and in vivo results indicated 4-HBd can affect the ang-1/tie-2 and bdnf/trkb signaling pathways, and BBB damage is alleviated and NVU homeostasis is maintained to improve CIRI.",

Momordin Ic (MMI) is a triterpenoid saponin that has anti-inflammatory effect and may play an effective role in the treatment of AD. To explore the molecular mechanism of MMI in relieving AD, and to provide some experimental data for the clinical application of MMI in AD. The mRNA levels of IL-33, IL-4 and NF-κB were detected by RT-qPCR. The protein expressions of Filaggrin, Claudin-1, MyD88 and NLRP3 were detected by western blotting. Transepithelial/transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) method was used to detect the tight-junction function of HaCaT cells. Molecular docking experiment was performed on CB-DOCK2 to predict the binding of MMI and NLRP3. MMI reversed the decrease of filaggrin protein expression and intercellular resistance in HaCaT cells induced by TNF-α and IFN-γ. In addition, MMI reversed the increase in IL-33 and IL-4 mRNA levels in HaCaT cells treated with TNF-α and IFN-γ. In addition, MMI promoted the expression of Claudin-1 and inhibited the expression of MyD88 and NLRP3. In addition, the molecular docking results showed that MMI and NLRP3 had interaction sites. MMI improved the inflammatory response of HaCaT cells by regulating the expression of Claudin-1/MyD88 and targeting NLRP3, which may act a positive role in relieving AD.",

The present study aimed to assess clozapine and olanzapine effects on the expression of mRNA insulin pathway genes (IRS-1, PTEN, PIK3CG and PIK3R1), microRNAs (miR-152-3p, miR-214-3p, miR-15b-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-126-3p) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs: XIST, H19, SNHG16, PVT1), in human visceral preadipocytes (HPAd). Expression was examined by real - time PCR. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The findings revealed that in HAPd, both clozapine and olanzapine (at doses of 5 µM and 25 µM) decreased IRS-1 gene expression after 24 hours. After 48 hours, IRS-1 expression was reduced by clozapine at both concentrations and olanzapine at 5 µM. In addition, olanzapine (at 25 µM) decreased the expression of PIK3CG, miR-152-3p, miR-214-3p, miR-15b-5p and miR-16-5p after 24 hours, while increasing the expression of miR-126-3p at 5 µM. Clozapine at 25 µM decreased miR-16-5p expression and increased SNHG16 lncRNA expression at 5 µM after 24 hours. After 48 hours, olanzapine (at 25 µM) increased PIK3R1 expression and decreased PIK3CG expression at 5 µM. Both drugs at 5 µM increased the expression of miR-152-3p, miR-214-3p, miR-15b-5p and miR-16-5p after 48 hours, with clozapine further increasing the expression of miR-126-3p at this concentration. The results suggest that clozapine and olanzapine may affect the expression of key genes and epigenetic molecules in the insulin pathway, which is one potential cause leading to insulin resistance in adipose tissue.",

It is important to scavenge oxygen free radicals in due course to reduce oxidative damage to human skeletal muscle cells (HSKMC) by some means. Apigenin, as an effective antioxidant, is likely to protect HSKMC against oxidative injury. In this study, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) was used to induce oxidative injured HSKMC. Then, we studied the protective effect of apigenin on cell viability, oxidative stress status, and the expression of antioxidation-related proteins and tried to understand the mechanisms driving these effects. Results show that the cellular viability of HSKMC could be obviously improved by apigenin treatment at the concentration of 80 μM. Pretreatment with celery resulted in the activity of related enzymes approaching normal levels, and decrease the release of malondialdehyde and the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species in HSKMC. The Nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) signaling pathway could also be activated by apigenin. Therefore, apigenin could attenuate t-BHP induced oxidative injury in HSKMC through enhancement of the activities of related antioxidant enzymes by activating the Nrf2 pathway.",

The most important flavonoid is apigenin, which is mostly found in the form of apigenin-7-O-glucoside. Apigenin-7-O-glucoside is assessed as a marker in Matricaria recutita L. extracts due to its anti-inflammatory effect. In this study, a new, cost-effective, and accurate HPLC-PDA method was developed and implemented for the quantification of apigenin-7-O-glucoside in liquid extracts of the flowers of Matricaria recutita L. grown in Türkiye (Bandırma/Balıkesir) and Türkiye (Arnavutköy/Istanbul) regions. The extraction solvent was ethanol 95.4% v/v (containing 0.12% sodium hydroxide, 0.22% sodium acetate). The apigenin-7-O-glucoside content of the extracts was detected. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts were analyzed. Since the extract prepared from the herb grown in Arnavutköy/Istanbul region has higher apigenin-7-O-glycoside, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, a topical cream containing this extract was formulated. An in vitro release test was performed for apigenin-7-O-glucoside to examine the pharmaceutical quality and performance of the cream compared to the reference cream. The test cream showed a faster release than the reference product. In addition, the physicochemical stability of the test product was monitored for 90 days. It is expected to be more effective than the reference product in in vivo studies due to the faster release of the test product.

Employing a multifaceted approach, the study explores emetine's impact on cell viability, clonogenic potential, and apoptotic pathways, unravelling its molecular mechanisms. Additionally, an in-vivo assessment is conducted to evaluate emetine's antitumor efficacy against PaCa3 xenografts. Under standard conditions, PaCa3 cells were treated with varying emetine concentrations and subjected to MTT, clonogenic, DAPI, AO/EB, Annexin V-FITC/PI, and Western blot assays. In-vivo experiments involved the administration of emetine to female nude mice with PaCa3 xenografts, with subsequent measurement of tumor weight and volume. Statistical analyses included Tukey-test and ANOVA. Emetine demonstrated a significant and dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect on PaCa3 cells, reducing viability from 98% to 8% (***p&lt;0.001). Clonogenic assay indicated a substantial inhibition of colony formation. DAPI staining revealed nuclear chromatin condensation, while AO/EB staining indicated heightened apoptosis. Annexin V-FITC/PI assay exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in normal cell viability and an increase in apoptotic events. Western blot analysis showcased concentration-dependent downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers. In-vivo experiments illustrated a dose-dependent reduction in tumor weight (5 g to 1.6 g) and volume (2400 mm³ to 844 mm³) with emetine treatment. In conclusion, emetine emerges as a potent anticancer agent against pancreatic ductal carcinoma, exhibiting cytotoxicity, clonogenic inhibition, and apoptotic induction in PaCa3 cells. The in-vivo study further highlights its promising therapeutic potential, laying the groundwork for future clinical studies in pancreatic cancer treatment.",

The mouse model of liver fibrosis was established by intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and olive oil. Subsequently, CAG was administrated orally at different doses(2.5 mg/kg/d, 5 mg/kg/d, 10mg/kg/d), and the degree of liver fibrosis was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin, Van Gieson, and Sirius Red staining. Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, hyaluronic acid, and hydroxyproline levels were detected using biochemical analyses. The mRNA and protein expression levels of α-SMA, LC3, P62, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR in the liver tissue were assessed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. The expression of fibrogenesis-related marker α-SMA in the liver tissue was assessed using immunofluorescence. As expected, CAG alleviated liver fibrosis and suppressed hepatic stellate cell activation. And then, CAG inhibited autophagy and activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Thus, CAG attenuated CCI4-induced liver fibrosis in mice by inhibiting autophagy and by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "There is an ongoing debate in the literature about the place of cannabinoid therapy in everyday clinical practice. The overview examined systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the use of medical marijuana (MM) in specific or diseases, such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, pain, nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, cachexia, and sleep disorders. We analyzed different cannabinoids like CBD, THC, dronabinol, nabilone, and THC:CBD combinations (Nabiximol) to understand their effects on various medical conditions, dose effectiveness, and side effects. CBD showed promise epilepsy, Nabilone showed a significant reduction in pain and insomnia, Nabiximol has been effective in reducing spasticity, pain, and sleep disturbance in multiple sclerosis patients. Nabilone and dronabinol improve nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, but the evidence is low. The results on the effectiveness of MM in the treatment of cachexia and cancer pain are inconclusive. Outcomes suggest that side effects typically were mild to moderate in severity. The type of cannabinoid (including CBD and THC content) and amount of dose, were found to potentially influence the results obtained in the trials, affecting both the effectiveness and the side effects experienced by patients. Young people, elderly, and children are particularly vulnerable and, despite ongoing research in these age groups, we still know too little about whether and in which clinical conditions the use of medical cannabis is justified. The analyzed studies faced limitations due to heterogeneity in methodology, dosages, and outcome measures and highlighting potential controversies in interpreting the results, so further research is needed.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to assess the leaf extracts of matoa (Pometia pinnata) and pulasan (Nephelium ramboutan-ake) for antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities, besides phytochemical content. Four extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and water) were obtained from each plant via sequential extraction. The antimicrobial activities were evaluated using colorimetric broth microdilution methods. The antioxidant activities were studied using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The cytotoxicity was examined using mouse fibroblasts NIH/3T3 while the phytochemical content was detected using various chemical tests. Among the extracts, only the water extract of matoa and ethyl acetate extract of pulasan exerted bactericidal effects on Bacillus cereus (minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC): 0.63 mg/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (MBC: 1.25 mg/mL), respectively. In contrast, all extracts, except hexane extract, of both plants exhibited fungicidal effects with minimum fungicidal concentrations of 0.31-1.25 mg/mL. All extracts of matoa leaves displayed higher DPPH radical scavenging activity and FRAP than the extracts of pulasan leaves. Notably, the water extract of matoa showed the lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 9.88 ± 1.70 µg/mL and the highest FRAP value of 6.11 ± 0.51 mmol Fe2+ equivalent/g extract (n=3). These antioxidant activities were significantly correlated (p&lt;0.01) with the amounts of phenolic compounds in the extracts. All extracts of both plants, except water extracts, showed significant toxicities (p&lt;0.05) towards NIH/3T3 cells. Alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, and glycosides were detected in the leaves of both plants. The matoa and pulasan leaves contained bioactive compounds with antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activities.",

This study combined glibenclamide with vitexin and performed in vivo and in vitro investigations, aiming to evaluate their synergistic effect on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Materials and methods: T2DM rat models were established by injecting streptozotocin, and the sham group was injected with a normal saline solution as the control. A single dosage was orally performed with 10 mg/kg glibenclamide, while the co-administrated was conducted by the pre-treatment of 20 mg/kg vitexin for 7 d to avoid potential chemical interactions. The pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide was evaluated in both sham and T2DM rats. The blood glucose of T2DM rats was detected in the presence of different administration strategies. The metabolic stability of glibenclamide was assessed in rat liver microsomes. Results: Glibenclamide showed a significant hypoglycemic effect on T2DM rats, which was enhanced by the co-administration of vitexin. Vitexin significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide in both sham and T2DM rats, where the AUC0-t, Cmax, and t1/2 of glibenclamide significantly increased, and the clearance rate decreased. Moreover, vitexin increased the in vitro half-life and decreased intrinsic clearance of glibenclamide in rat liver microsomes. The previously reported inhibitory effect of vitexin on CYP2C9 activity was hypothesized as the mechanism underlying the interaction. Conclusion: Co-administration of glibenclamide and vitexin would increase the systemic exposure and metabolic stability of glibenclamide and exert a synergistic effect on T2DM.",

Polysaccharides were prepared by cold and hot water extraction methods and chemically characterized. The monosaccharide analysis showed that all the preparations contained hexoses: mannose, glucose, galactose, and 3-O-methyl-hexose (identified as 3-O-methyl-galactose) as well as trace amounts of pentose identified as arabinose. Linkage analysis, on the other hand, revealed a wide variety of monosaccharide linking bonds in the polysaccharides studied, depending on the polymer source and the method of isolation. Both fungal polysaccharide preparations with increasing concentrations showed lower DPPH free radical reducing activity. The degree of reduction depended on the origin of the compounds and the method of their preparation. Stimulation of nitric oxide (NOx) production by the tested cells was observed after their incubation with the polysaccharides. The tested compounds at lower concentrations (up to 500 μg/mL) did not significantly influence the metabolic activity of the tumor and normal cells after 24 h of incubation. The viability of the tumor and normal cells was limited after the impact of the polysaccharides in the concentration range of 25 – 1000 μg/mL. The hot and cold water isolated polysaccharides did not induce changes in the normal and tumor cell cytoskeleton organization. The paper presents newly prepared and characterized hot and cold isolated water-soluble polysaccharides with promising pro-health potential against tumor and normal human colon epithelium cells.",

This study was to reveal the cardioprotective mechanism of KPF. Molecular docking was used to predict the target of KPF. STZ-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) rats was established. The model rats with successful modeling were randomly divided into DM group, KPF group (10 mg/kg), and metformin (Met) group (120 mg/kg). The CTL group and DM group were gavaged with equal amounts of CMC-Na, and all groups were intervened for eight weeks. The changes of blood glucose in different groups was detected. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE), and Masson staining were used to assess pathological changes. Creatine kinase (CK), and B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP) levels were examined. RT-qPCR was used to detect the mRNA expression levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1 (Caspase-1), and GSDMD-N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N), and Western blot was used to detect the expression of NLRP3, and GSDMD-N. KPF has a good binding affinity with TLR4. KPF could significantly improve the abnormal elevation of blood glucose, mitigate pathological changes, and reduce CK and BNP levels. Further mechanistic studies found that KPF reduced the mRNA expressions of TLR4, NLRP3, Caspase-1, and GSDMD-N, and decreased the protein expressions of NLRP3, and GSDMD-N. In conclusion, the mechanism of KPF protects against DCM is related to the inhibition of the NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway, providing a novel mechanism for KPF intervention in DCM.",

After treated with SAFI and DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), modified neurological severity score (mNSS), histopathology, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral infarction size and the brain water content of rats were measured. Meanwhile, superoxide dismutase (SOD), the interleukine 1-beta (IL-1β), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), malondialdehyde (MDA), 6-keto-PGF1α and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) of I/R tissue were measured by the ELISA kits. For the experiment in vitro, the cell viability, LC3II, beclin-1 and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR protein levels were confirmed by western blot. The results illustrated SAFI decreased the mNSS, cerebral infarct size, brain water content, IL-1β, TXB2, MDA, IL-6 and TNF-α levels of I/R rats obviously. SAFI also up-regulated the rCBF, 6-keto-PGF1α, BDNF and SOD levels of I/R rats. The in vitro experiments showed that SAFI could promote the PC12 cell proliferation. The down-regulated LC3II and beclin-1 expression in the SAFI treated cells showed that SAFI could proper regulate autophagy for the PC12 cells in OGD/R group. Finally, the autophagy inhibition caused by SAFI on OGD/R cells were reversed by LY294002 and rapamycin (RAPA). These results suggested the PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation played an essential role on the autophagy regulation caused by SAFI.",

    "abstract": "The main disadvantage of conventional chemotherapy is a nonspecific drug delivery and toxicity towards healthy cells.The development of drug delivery systems is one approach that is commonly used to avoid or lessen this disadvantage.Drug delivery systems have the potential to improve cancer cell targeting where precision of delivery is needed in the treatment.In oncological therapy, one major class of drugs used to target cancer are monoclonal antibodies.By definition, monoclonal antibodies are proteins secreted by specific white blood cells of the animal or human origin which have the ability to recognize specific targets called antigens.Therapeutic antibodies conjugated with fluorinated dendrimers could be used as alternatives to native antibodies for tumor targeting applications.Antibodies are engineered to track a specific tumor antigen and bind themselves to the surface of cancer cells.Thus far, limited clinical benefit has been observed with antibody-drug conjugates although the potential exists for the development of improved antibody-drug delivery systems.Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2) is one of the most promising targets in immunotherapy.Her-2, which is a member of the ErbB family of receptors, is overexpressed on the surface of tumors.The family of ErbB consists of EGFR (ErbB-1), Her-2 (ErbB-2), Her-3 (ErbB-3), and Her-4 (ErbB-4) (1, 2).Studies have shown that up to 30% of breast cancer patients and 20% of ovarian carcinomas overexpress the Her-2 receptor (3, 4).Her-2 overexpression in breast cancer confers increased tumor aggressiveness (3, 4) and is a key molecule in the regulation of apoptosis in breast cancer cells (5).The low density of Her-2 receptors on cancer cells limits targeting detection.Therefore, monitoring of Her-2 receptor treatment requires a highly sensitive technique.Her-2 overexpression protects breast cancer cells from apoptosis and is identified as a target for breast cancer therapy (6).The Trastuzumab-dendrimer-fluorine drug delivery system may offer the possibility of increasing antibody delivery to Her-2 receptors in Her-2 overexpressed breast cancer cell culture.The Trastuzumabdendrimer-fluorine drug delivery system (Fig. 1) molecular probe has been designed to improve Her-2 treatment as evaluated by a determination of treatment efficacy (1).The advantages of this application are that dendrimer-monoclonal antibody conjugates selectively target cancer cells avoiding delivery to PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY",

    "abstract": "Modern pharmacotherapy plays a key role in psychiatry, and various psychotropic drugs are available in clinical practice.Unfortunately, more than 50% of psychiatric patients are non-compliant.Clinical pharmacists can be involved in the improvement of patients' adherence.This study was performed with the aim to introduce a new tool to improve the adherence of psychiatric patients during hospitalization.This tool has been developed by a clinical pharmacist and it is based on the combination of a comprehensive medication review and patient education interview.Additionally, patients are provided with educational materials.Different drug-related problems were identified using this new tool (comprehensive medication review and patient education interview).There were suggested 1,136 drug-related pharmaceutical interventions in the psychiatric hospital during the 1-year period for hospitalized patients (educated and non-educated).The majority (84%) of these interventions were fully accepted by physicians, and it shows a high clinical relevance.The variety of adherence barriers was defined in a group of educated patients and possible interventions to overcome them were suggested as the outcome of this study.The combination of a comprehensive medication review and education interview might be an effective tool to increase the level of patients' adherence.It shows that patients' responsibility and personal motivation are strengthened by the education interview with clinical pharmacists.This method helps to identify different barriers to adherence, possible risk factors, and drug-related problems, which belong to the leading mechanisms for low patient adherence.",

Methods: Literature review of peer-reviewed studies in adults (i.e. 18 years or older) and of the period 2012-2021 were selected to collect information about smart medication dispensers and smart applications to monitor medication adherence. The PubMed and Scopus databases were used for review. Results: Digital solutions were found useful for elderly patients, who have multiple medications in their treatment schemes. Younger patients could benefit more from mobile apps, as these tend to be easy to use and operate. Conclusions: Different digital solutions can successfully be used in different age groups to enhance medication adherence. Target group must be set beforehand the development. Further improvements are needed to use the full potential of data produced by devices for monitoring and supporting patients´ medication use.",

The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on interleukin-1β (IL-1β) – dependent inhibition of collagen synthesis, prolidase activity, and β1-integrin signaling in cultured human skin fibroblasts. PRP was obtain using the SmartPReP®2 Autologous Platelet Concentrate+ System. Collagen biosynthesis and prolidase activity were measured in confluent human skin fibroblast cultures with IL-1β, PRP, hyaluronic acid (HA), and mixtures of IL-1β with PRP or HA. Immunofluorescence bioimaging analysis was employed to evaluate expression of β1 integrin receptor, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) protein. Incubation of fibroblasts with 2% PRP for 24 h contributed to about 500% increase in collagen biosynthesis and a significant increase in the expression of β1-integrin receptor and prolidase activity, compared to the control cells. In the cells treated with IL-1β, collagen biosynthesis, β1-integrin receptor expression, and prolidase activity were decreased while COX-2 and NF-κB expressions were significantly increased. All these processes were recovered to control values by PRP or HA; however, PRP was found to act more effectively than HA. It was found that PRP counteracted IL-1β -dependent inhibition of collagen synthesis through recovery of β1-integrin receptor expression and prolidase activity and down-regulation of COX-2 and NF-κB expressions in cultured fibroblasts. The data suggest that PRP evoke anti-inflammatory activity that is desirable in tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: The study evaluated the release of salicylic acid with new two multiphase ointment bases: Fitalite™ and Nourivan™ Antiox. Fitalite™ is a cream-gel base while Nourivan™ Antiox is a cream oil in water. Salicylic acid is a substance often used in the formulation of semi-solid dosage forms applied on the skin. The release rate of salicylic acid was examined depending on the base and the particle size of the active ingredient. For this purpose, formulations containing 5% salicylic acid were prepared and used for the study. Three different methods were used for the incorporation of salicylic acid into the bases: non-grinded, ground with the base for 15 minutes, and concentrate of salicylic acid with white soft paraffin (1:1). Measurements of the particles of the active substance in each of the preparations were also taken. Salicylic acid has been shown to be released to a greater extent from Fitalite ™ base. Qualitative analysis of the composition of the bases, in studies conducted by the Department staff, allows concluding that the amount and release rate of salicylic acid from the bases is influenced by its viscosity. This parameter has a significant impact on the level of trituration of salicylic acid. It was also found that the concentrate of salicylic acid with white soft paraffin (1:1) reduces the time of preparation of a suspension type ointment with salicylic acid, wherein the particle size accomplishes the requirements of pharmacopeia.",

This study aimed to explore the effect of pachymic acid on the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide in rats and to elucidate its mechanism. The effects of pachymic acid (5 and 10 mg/kg) on the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide (0.5 mg/kg) were investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6) with a single dose of repaglinide as a control. LC-MS/MS was used to determine the plasma concentration of repaglinide. Furthermore, the effect of pachymic acid on the metabolic stability of repaglinide and CYP3A4 activity was assessed in rat liver microsomes (RLMs). The co-administration of repaglinide and pachymic acid caused considerable changes in the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide, as shown by an increase in Cmax, t1/2, and AUC(0-t), and a decrease in CLz/F. The effect of pachymic acid was enhanced with increasing concentration. In vitro, pachymic acid showed a significant improvement of the metabolic stability of repaglinide in RLMs and inhibited the activity of CYP3A4. Co-administration of repaglinide with pachymic acid increased the systemic exposure of repaglinide and improved its metabolic stability in rats, which was mediated by CYP3A4. The results of animal studies cannot be directly applied to clinical practice, but concomitant administration of repaglinide and pachymic acid should be avoided or monitored until interaction studies are performed in humans.",

The objective of this study was to examine the potential anti-tumor effects of ATV in ovarian cancer (OC), as well as explore its underlying mechanism. Methods: The CCK-8 method was employed to assess the efficacy of ATV on both OC cells and normal ovarian epithelial cells. Furthermore, the anti-proliferative impact of ATV on OC cells was determined through CCK-8 and colony formation techniques. Additionally, flow cytometry was employed to detect apoptosis in SKOV3 cells, while Transwell assays were utilized to assess cell migration and invasion. Western Blot analysis was conducted to evaluate EMT-related proteins (E-cadherin, Vimentin, and N-cadherin), as well as VEGF, TGF-β1, cytochrome-c, and caspase-3.

Traditional treatment approaches target either the inflammatory or allergic components individually, leaving the accompanying itch inadequately addressed. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy using diphenhydramine and lidocaine for managing inflammatory and allergic skin conditions with coexisting itch. Diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, exhibits potent antiallergic properties by inhibiting histamine receptors (H1). Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, possesses analgesic effects and alleviates pruritus by blocking sensory neurons and reducing capillary permeability. The synergistic effects of diphenhydramine and lidocaine hold promise in providing a comprehensive treatment option for individuals with inflammatory and allergic skin conditions. In this study, the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with diphenhydramine and lidocaine will be evaluated through its effects on symptom relief, inflammatory markers and patient satisfaction. Furthermore, we will analyze dermatoses where the combination therapy used had the best results. The study will also focus on market analysis and formulation availability. This investigation into the diphenhydramine and lidocaine combination therapy represents an innovative approach in dermatology, offering a unique solution for addressing both the underlying inflammation and the troublesome itch associated with inflammatory and allergic skin conditions.",

The analyzed data were organized in a tabular format known as an information system. Objects were labeled as rows, and attributes as columns, with attribute-values serving as entries. Each formulation was described by its condition attributes (composition, manufacturing process, quality parameters), while the decision attribute indicated the quality of the formulation (expressed as pH after vaginal tablet or pessary application) and enabled classification as correct/incorrect or good/bad. The decision rules generated by the study provide insights into relationships between the condition attributes and the decision attribute. They highlight the importance of LA content and LA:polymer ratios in maintaining physiological pH. Additionally, the findings confirm the favorable impact of chitosan on pH regulation while indicating that the type of formulation (pessaries or tablets) does not significantly affect the classification of objects. Decision rules with high confirmation coefficients of condition attributes can help developing optimal formulations. These decision rules contain essential information that describes the cause-and-effect relationships and are free of redundant information.

The profiling of this aqueous extract was performed using Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) while High-Speed Countercurrent Chromatography (HSCCC) and a Sephadex LH-20 column were utilised to isolate and purify the extract in ethyl acetate obtained from the aqueous extract.

The aim of the study was the validation of UPLC-MS/MS method for TDM of olaparib in patients with ovarian cancer, with a particular attention to optimization of recovery. The validation of the method under analysis were accomplished by the ICH guidelines. The recovery of olaparib was optimized with the Central Composite Design (CCD). The TDM study was conducted on 10 patients with ovarian cancer treated with olaparib. The method validation was characterized by good precision (CV &lt;9.09%), accuracy (89.23-111.08%) and linearity (r=0.9993) within the range of 100-20,000 ng/mL, with limits of detection of 30 ng/mL. The ten-minute shaking time combined with 100% acetonitrile resulted in an estimated value of 98% for recovery and the observed value of 98%. The olaparib concentrations in the patients’ plasma were 1078.2-16773.8 ng/mL. A wide range of olaparib concentrations was observed in the patients reported adverse reactions included: anemia (grade 1, n=2), neutropenia (grade 1, n=1), and hyperkeratinemia (grade 1, n=1).

The fibrous root was connected to the tuberous root, but as a non-medicinal part, it has been discarded. However, due to the shortage of Ophiopogon japonicus resources and might be due to similarities in color and smell, fibrous roots tend to be used as tuberous roots to relieve the pressure of demand. So, Ophiopogon japonicus might suffer from quality inconsistencies. To address these challenges, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chemical quantitative fingerprinting was adopted to evaluate and discriminate the fibrous root and tuberous root from the whole chemical profile level. In this sample extraction procedure, chromatographic conditions were optimized to obtain a comprehensive and detailed metabolomic fingerprint. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), gray relational analysis (GRA), PCA (principal components analysis) and PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant analysis), were used to evaluate and distinguish the different parts of Ophiopogon japonicus from Leshan. The results showed that there were significant differences in the content of bioactive components between tuberous roots and fibrous roots. This research provides a new insight into quality control and comprehensive evaluation of different parts of Ophiopogon japonicus",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers' efforts have focused on developing vaccines to reduce the risk of further global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection. The research carried out allowed for the introduction, in an extremely short time, of preparations based on mRNA technology (Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna products), viral vector preparations (AstraZeneca AB and Janssen-Cilag International NV preparations), and protein-based preparations (Novavax CZ a.s. and Hipra Human Health, S.L.U. preparations). Clinical trials demonstrated the expected effectiveness of the vaccines, with a positive benefit-to-risk ratio allowing for their registration. However, as with other medicinal products, knowledge about the types and actual frequency of side effects is mostly acquired during the fourth, post-registration phase of drug monitoring, called pharmacovigilance, aimed at analysing the safety of commonly used medicinal products. It is now known that COVID-19 vaccines cause a number of non-specific (e.g. skin hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, muscle pain, fever after administration) and specific (e.g. \"COVID arm\", myocarditis and/or pericarditis, thrombocytopenic thrombosis) adverse reactions. It should be emphasised that the overall clinical evaluation of the vaccines remains positive, indicating their continued effectiveness (despite the still-present genetic variability of the virus) in protecting against severe course of the disease, hospitalisation, and death in high-risk patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while still maintaining an acceptable level of safety when used.

    "abstract": "Aim: This study aimed to determine the effects of propofol on myocardial injuries and its influence on the Sirt1/FoxO1 pathway in rats experiencing intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Methods: Rats were assigned to Sham, intestinal I/R, and three propofol groups (I/R + P1, I/R + P2, I/R + P3), receiving 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg/h propofol at reperfusion onset. The Sham and I/R groups received saline. Myocardial injury was assessed through left ventricular systolic blood pressure (LVSP), maximum increase and decrease rates of left ventricular pressure (+dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax), serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and myocardial tissue levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, SOD, and CAT. Protein levels were measured by Western blot. Results: I/R increased LVEDP, serum LDH, cTnI, CK-MB, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, Caspase-3, Bax, and Ac-FoxO1, while decreasing LVSP, +dP/dtmax, -dP/dtmax, SOD, CAT, and survivin, Bcl-2, Sirt1. Propofol, in a dose-dependent manner, reduced LVEDP, serum LDH, cTnI, CK-MB, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, Caspase-3, Bax, and Ac-FoxO1 levels while enhancing LVSP, +dP/dtmax, -dP/dtmax, SOD, CAT, survivin, Bcl-2, and Sirt1 in myocardial tissues. Conclusion: Propofol alleviates myocardial injuries caused by intestinal I/R in rats by modulating the Sirt1/FoxO1 pathway.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of energy drinks has surged in recent years, becoming a common alternative to coffee, tea, or soda. Designed to enhance physical performance, they promise a quick energy boost, improved mood, and increased focus. However, excessive consumption is linked to serious health risks. Overconsumption of energy drinks can lead to arrhythmia, seizures, tachycardia, and even death. Chronic consumption can result in elevated blood pressure, psycho-physical disorders, and addiction. Children, adolescents, and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable. A worrying trend is the mixing of energy drinks with alcohol, which amplifies the risk of adverse health effects. Marketing tactics promoting energy drinks at major events and featuring athletes and musicians have increased their appeal, especially among teenagers. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend, with younger individuals turning to these drinks to cope with stress and isolation. Addressing this issue requires educating adolescents and raising awareness about the consequences of excessive consumption. Establishing safe doses of energy drink ingredients and thoroughly documenting their side effects is crucial.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal tryptophan (Trp) metabolism disrupts the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system, contributing to clinical depression. However, the link between altered Trp metabolism and post-stroke depression remains unclear. This study investigates Trp metabolism in rats exhibiting depression-like behavior after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham operation (sham), MCAO, and MCAO + 1-methyltryptophan (1-MT) treatment groups. The MCAO + 1-MT group received daily subcutaneous injections of 1-MT (60 mg/Kg/day), an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor. Sucrose preference and marble burying tests assessed depression-like behavior. Brain tissue was analyzed for Trp, 5-HT, kynurenine (KYN), and other metabolites. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect 5-HT, IDO, and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. MCAO reduced sucrose preference and increased marble burying, indicating depression-like behavior. Treatment with 1-MT improved neurological scores and reversed these behavioral changes. The MCAO group showed elevated KYN levels and KYN/Trp ratios, which decreased with 1-MT treatment. No significant differences were observed in 5-HT levels or 5-HT/Trp ratios across groups. The sham group exhibited more 5-HT-positive cells in the hippocampus than the MCAO group, while IDO-positive cells were higher in the frontal cortex of the MCAO group compared to the MCAO + 1-MT group. These results concluded that subcutaneous 1-MT, an IDO inhibitor, enhances neurological function and reduces depression-like behaviour in rats after ischemic stroke. Clinical trials with bigger samples are required to further validate these findings.",

Mammalian cells are exposed to it at high levels, which has toxic and estrogenic consequences. Moreover, BPA exposure during prenatal and neonatal development results in defects in the male and female reproductive systems, abnormal meiotic development in fetal oocytes, and pregnancy complications. The principle of the current study was to study the adverse effects of the oral administration of BPA on the liver and testis toward adult male rats with the protective roles of herbal teas. A comparative study was conducted on 40 adult rats. Groups were coded as RT/BPA, GT/BPA, and BT/BPA, for red, green, and blue herbal teas, respectively. lowest values for AST (58.71 mU/mL), ALP (1.51 mU/mL), and GGT (21.12 U/L).

While rats in BT/BPA and GT/BPA groups showed similar values to the vehicle group (45.02 and 118.28 mg/dI) for HDL and TC quantities, respectively. The present research work established the protecting rolls of herbal teas due to the antioxidant properties especially green tea which preserved GPx value (88.22 nmol/mg), testosterone (1.80 ng/ml), and red tea which preserved CAT value (101.18 U/mg), while blue tea preserved MDA and SOD values (0.81 nmol/mg and 7.18 U/mg), respectively. The BPA oral administration with herbal teas reduced toxicity on the liver and testis due to free radical scavenging effects.",

There are also a piece of evidence of their possible role in the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Our earlier studies showed that naturally occurring phytochemicals and mainly their combinations can induce apoptosis and limit the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, HepG2. The aim of this study was to evaluate their effect on the expression of “orphan\" CYPs, 2S1, 2W1, and 2U1 in the hepatic cancer cell line. HepG2 cells were treated with xanthohumol (X), phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), resveratrol (RES), or indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and their combinations for 24 h. The expression of CYP genes was assessed by r-t PCR and Western blot. Generally, a moderate effect of the tested phytochemicals on the expression at the evaluated CYP protein level was found. More significant changes were detected at the mRNA level. X and RES were the most efficient reducers of CYP2S1 and CYP2W1 expression. This effect was confirmed by treatment with a mixture of these compounds as well. CYP2U1 expression was diminished as a result of treatment with X and PEITC and their combination. The above mentioned results indicate that tested phytochemicals, particularly X, may reduce the expression of “orphan\" CYPs and, in this way, diminish the activation of hepatocarcinogens and possibly limit the proliferation of HCC cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Colon cancer (CC) is a serious threat to human health. Cantharidin (CTD) has anti-cancer properties. This study aims to explore the mechanism of CTD in treating CC. We used CCK-8, Transwell, and Annexin V/PI double staining analyses to detect the effects of CTD on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of CC cells. The effect of CTD on tumor growth was investigated by constructing a CC mouse model. Wild-type or mutant WNK1 luciferase vectors were constructed to verify the interaction between miR-192-5p and WNK1 mRNA. In the CTD group: miR-192-5p level was elevated and the OD values at 450 nm were significantly decreased; the quantity of CC cells passing the Transwell chamber (without or with matrigel) was reduced; the number of apoptotic cells increased obviously; the volume and weight of tumor decreased significantly. These results were reversed by miR-192-5p inhibitor. In HT-29 cells transfected with the wild-type WNK1 vector, the luciferase activity decreased with the miR-192-5p mimic but increased with the miR-192-5p inhibitor. The inhibitor of miR-192-5p counteracted the suppression of CTD on WNK1 expression. In summary, we demonstrated that CTD inhibited CC development by up-regulating miR-192-5p targeting WNK1, which will provide a theoretical basis for the application of CTD in the CC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes, a pervasive lifestyle ailment with roots tracing back to ancient civilizations like India, Egypt, China, and Arabia, has captivated human understanding for centuries. Early attempts to grasp its complexities involved restrictive diets and herbal remedies, reflecting a lack of knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the disease. Remarkable milestones have marked the journey of diabetes treatment. A monumental shift occurred in 1921 when Frederick Banting and Charles Best's isolation of insulin heralded a new era in diabetes treatment, vastly enhancing patient longevity and comfort despite the initial discomfort of injections. From the groundbreaking synthesis of the insulin gene to the advent of insulin pens and analogues, each innovation has expanded therapeutic avenues for those affected. In the 21st century, medical engineering has evolved further, with technologies like continuous glucose monitoring systems and closed-loop pumps—called \"artificial pancreas\"—ushering in unprecedented glycemic control and quality of life for type 1 diabetes patients. For those with type 2 diabetes, the focus has shifted towards a comprehensive approach encompassing new and effective pharmacotherapy and lifestyle adjustments. Crucially, amidst the continuum of advancements, the cornerstone of diabetes management remains rooted in education and lifestyle adaptations. Regular meals, weight management, consumption of low-glycemic carbohydrates, exercises, and meticulous foot care are essential against debilitating complications. Despite historic and ongoing challenges, advances in diabetes treatment provide hope for increasingly modern therapies and outcomes, underscoring the importance of education and lifestyle changes in the fight against this chronic disease.",

    "abstract": "Thin-film drug delivery, also referred to as orodispersible film has emerged as an advanced alternative to the traditional tablets, capsules, and liquids.The present work investigates the improvement in solubility to have a rapid onset of action, and palatability of chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) by developing an orodispersible film (ODF) using the solvent casting method.CPZ indicated for the control of nausea and vomiting, and in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and children, has low bioavailability (30-50%) when taken orally as a tablet due to extensive first-pass metabolism.Moreover, it is very bitter and has an unpleasant after-taste.In this study, seven placebo formulations were prepared containing different concentrations of film-forming polymers (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose E5 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone K30) and plasticizers (propylene glycol and glycerin), and the most suitable polymer-plasticizer combination was screened to obtain required physical properties.CPZ loaded film was made using an optimized polymer-plasticizer combination employing sucralose and menthol as taste-masking agents.Drug-loaded films were transparent, smooth, and disintegrated in 14.67 ± 1.53 sec.Films showed a folding endurance of > 400, tensile strength of 1.54 ± 0.11 N/mm 2 and percentage elongation of 18.7% ± 0.50 suggesting good mechanical strength.More than 90% drug release was obtained within 3 min in dissolution media.FTIR analysis displayed no significant interactions between drug and polymer.The film was also found palatable with a sweet taste by human volunteers.Hence the taste-masked films of CPZ can be a potential alternative to conventional oral dosage forms and may also enhance patient compliance.",

There werefour photo-protectors considered in this work: 4-aminobenzoic acid, sodium benzoate, methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate and propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, whose UV absorption spectra characteristics match to some extent with the UV spectrum of papaverine. Approximately 20 mg/mL papaverine chloroform solutions with the above non-toxic additives in the concentrations 0.01; 0.05; 0.10% were exposed to the UV light of 254 nm. High performance capillary electrophoresis was used to determine the papaverine hydrochloride concentration loss as a function of time exposition to the light. It was found that papaverine hydrochloride photolysis proceeds according to the first-order kinetics. Methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate was found to be the best UV radiation-protective agent, and at the concentration 0.10%, the reaction rate constant decreases from 0.143 h(-1) to 0.028 h(-1). Both 4-hydroxybenzoate esters develop a more efficient UV radiation-protective activity than sodium benzoate, because the latter additive molar extinction coefficient is less significant. However, in spite of a high value of 4-aminobenzoic acid molar absorptivity coefficient, it is an unsuitable photo-protector for papaverine hydrochloride solutions, because its UV absorption spectrum does not match with that of papaverine.",

Some of the numerical scoring systems used in the intensive care unit for the assessment of critically ill patients such as APACHE II and MEWS score could be used for AP, beside the scoring systems specific to AP (Ranson score, Pancreas score, BISAP). Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the significance of inflammatory biomarkers and scoring systems in the evaluation of the severity of AP and outcomes. The study was conducted as a cohort prospective study, examining patients with AP, of both sexes. Laboratory analyses, as well as the scoring systems: Ranson, Pancreas score, Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) were collected on day zero and 48h after admission. The study included 50 patients of whom 8 died. The most reliable score for predicting AP severity was APACHE II0 and 48AUROC (0.753; 0.768) in relation to the inflammatory biomarkers. For initial prediction of the treatment outcome, APACHE II0, BISAP0, and CRP0 AUROC (0.813; 0.807; 0.753) had the highest discrimination rates and after 48h, APACHE II48, Ranson48, BISAP48, and Pancreas48 AUROC (0.917; 0.856; 0.789; 0.729). There was a statistically significant correlation between CRP0 and BISAP0 (p=0.006) and between PCT and all day-zero scores. All tested screening systems showed reliability in predicting AP severity and treatment outcomes. The best predictive power was demonstrated by the APACHE II score.",

In celiac disease and small intestine bacterial overgrowth making the diagnosis is not always straightforward, and the diagnosis often requires combining blood antibody tests, intestinal biopsies, and specific genetic testing. The study aimed to assess patients' protein/peptide profiles with celiac disease (n=31), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (n=28), and the control group (n=30). Attempts have also been made to identify potential new diagnostic markers. After appropriate preparation, a proteomic analysis of peptides was performed using the MALDI–TOF mass spectrometer. Identified proteins were fibrinogen alpha-chain, kininogen-1, mucin 3A, complement C3, complement C4A, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4. Performed analyses indicated some proteins that could be potentially involved in the presence of the disease in question and proved that proteomic profiling might serve as a powerful diagnostic tool. Due to the difficulties in celiac disease and small intestine bacterial overgrowth diagnosis, there is a clear need for further investigation of the biological role of proteins potentially involved in the course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Background: COPD is a chronic condition requiring care from a multidisciplinary team in which pharmacists play an important role. Aim: We aimed to evaluate the impact of structured pharmacist-patient counseling on patient’s knowledge, attitudes about medicines and the impact of COPD on patients’ health status. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in ten community pharmacies. Patients were counseled using detailed approach after completing validated questionnaires. The patients returned to a pharmacy for a follow-up after three months. Four validated questionnaires have been used to assess different aspects of patient’s knowledge about the disease, their attitudes about medicines and the impact of disease on patients’ health status: COPD Assessment Test (CAT), Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC), Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire (BCKQ), and The Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ). Results: Pharmacists recruited 83 COPD patients, from which 73 patients attended a follow-up visit. Before pharmacist intervention, the CAT median score was 20. After counseling, the CAT score decreased to 18 (p&lt;0.05). The highest improvement in patient’s knowledge was observed for inhaled bronchodilators (28.2%), vaccination (25.8%), oral steroids (24.4%), and smoking (24.2%). The median score for necessity increased, whereas the harm and concern median scores considerably decreased (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The results showed significant improvements in all aspects covered throughout pharmacist-patient counseling. Based on our results, proactive role of the pharmacist in the care of COPD patients may be beneficial to patients, to physicians and to healthcare: improving care, alleviating the strain on overloaded doctors with containing the costs.",

    "abstract": "Background/purpose: The incidence of facial fractures has a tendency to rise, which positively correlates with increasing total costs of treating this medical condition. The aim of this study was to identify the total costs of the hospital treatment of facial fractures and to analyze its main determinants. Materials and methods: This retrospective \"cost-of-illness\" study \"from bottom to the top\" approach was performed from the perspective of the Republic Health Insurance Fund. This study included 46 patients who were treated due to facial fractures at the Clinic for Maxillofacial Surgery at the Clinical Center Kragujevac in the period from the beginning of December 2017. to January 31, 2019. Results: The total costs of hospital treatment of all types of treated fractures amounted to 20,214.30€, and the average total cost per patient was estimated at 439.44±299.53€. The costs related to the length of hospitalization represented the largest part of the total direct costs, with a contribution of 31% and with a value of 6,329.30±80.18 €. Conclusions: Results of this pilot study pointed out that the total costs of treating facial fractures in the socio-economic sphere of Balkan countries are lower than in other health care systems, mostly due to differences in valuing medical services compared to countries within the European Union. Due to the rising incidence of injuries and obligatory hospital treatment of these conditions, this kind of pharmacoeconomic evaluation could contribute to the introduction of new therapeutic strategies for adequate allocation of resources within health systems.",

While numerous metabolic pathways are disrupted in diabetic neuropathy, oxidative stress has been indicated as a significant reason for this condition. In this study, the effect of carvacrol, which has antioxidant effects, on experimental diabetic neuropathy and neuropathic pain was investigated. Alloxan was used to induce diabetes in the experiment. Diabetes was created by administering 120mg/kg of alloxan intraperitoneally (i.p) once a day for 3 days. Rats with a blood glucose concentration above 250mg/kg in the blood taken from the tail veins at the end of three days were considered diabetic. Rats were categorized under healthy control (HG), alloxan-induced hyperglycemia (AG), and alloxan-induced hyperglycemia + carvacrol-treated (ACG) groups. Carvacrol was i.p injected at 50 mg/kg dose to the ACG (n=6) group of rats with hyperglycemia. The same volume of distilled water as the solvent was applied in the same way to AG (n=6) and HG (n=6) rat groups. This procedure was repeated once a day for three months.Carvacrol showed anti-hyperglycemic effect in diabetic rats, protective effect against lowering pain threshold and analgesic activity in rat paws in rats. Carvacrol prevented the oxidant/antioxidant balance from changing in favor of oxidants. The results supported that carvacrol is an agent against alloxan-induced peripheral diabetic neuropathic pain.",

The long process of generic formulation development can be accelerated by using an inhaler with suitable fluid dynamics features. This paper presents a study of a newly patented single-dose Memmatec Mora® inhaler in two versions: with grid openings 1.0 (A) and 0.5 mm (B), using Seebri Breezhaler® as a reference product. The studies were conducted with inhalation powders containing 44μg glycopyrronium bromide placed in a capsule. The manuscript presents studies during the selection of a generic inhaler within the course of inhalation powder development by a pharmaceutical company. The fluid dynamics features of the inhalers and the dose delivered were determined. The aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) and the inhalable dose were tested using a cascade impactor. The delivery dose for the Breezhaler, Mora A and Mora B inhalers for a volumetric flow of 100 L×min-1 was 38.5, 40.5 40.3μg, respectively. Fine particle fraction of the inhalers tested was 22.3, 24.6 25.5μg, respectively. Results of the study indicate that increase of the glycopyrronium bromide inhalation dose can be achieved not only by changes in the manufacturing technology of inhalation powder, hard capsule technology or addition of best quality raw materials, but also by the use of a properly selected inhaler with specific fluid dynamics features.",

We demonstrate that a simple Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship equation correlating the binding affinity with the partial charges of pharmacophoric oxygen atoms is significantly improved upon introducing quantitative chirality descriptors as additional variables. In such models, the charge descriptors account for the strength of the formed hydrogen bonds. However, the picture is completed by the chirality measures that indirectly contain information on the geometries of the hydrogen bond networks and subtle differences in the van der Waals contacts connected with different local or global shapes of the molecules. The model case studied here (11 simple and very similar steroids) proves that both global and local chirality is important in the androgen binding to their receptors.",

Suppositories were prepared in the Unquator® using Cacao butter, Witepsol H15 and PEG1500:PEG400 as a base. The physicochemical properties of the prepared suppositories were in accordance to the Pharmacopoeia’s requirements. In vitro dissolution profile of the formulations was evaluated using USP apparatus 1. It has been shown that most of the nimesulide was released from suppositories prepared on PEG base. Addition of 2% surfactant to lipophilic base suppositories, significantly increased the amount of nimesulide released from all the investigated formulae. Among the formulations containing surfactants, only Witepsol H15 with Span 80 released a nearly complete drug during 210 minutes. The results indicate that the First-Order model is the best fit with the nimesulide in-vitro release from lipophilic suppositories, while the Higuchi model - to the PEG suppositories. The drug release kinetics from suppositories showed that the Cacao butter bases adequately fit data for zero-order kinetics model, while the Higuchi model - for the PEG suppositories.",

Appropriate analytical procedures are necessary to monitor, detect and quantify CBZ in pharmaceutical formulations and biological samples. The search for new methods for drug determination is one of the most important challenges of modern scientific research. It is important to study the chromatographic conditions of CBZ analysis, which is necessary for the further development of efficient drug determination methods. In this work, retention, peak symmetry, and system efficiency of CBZ on Polar RP and Phenyl-Hexyl stationary phases were investigated. Various mobile phases containing methanol (MeOH) and/or acetonitrile (ACN) as organic modifiers, acetate buffer, and the addition of diethylamine (DEA) were applied. Different chromatographic systems were compared to obtain satisfying retention, peak shape, and system efficiency. The most optimal chromatographic system with Polar RP column was applied for the determination of CBZ in pharmaceutical formulations, human serum, and saliva by the high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) method. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) method was applied for sample preparation prior to chromatographic analysis. The proposed method was validated for linearity, selectivity, precision, and accuracy. Confirmation of the presence of CBZ and its main metabolites in biological samples obtained from patients was performed using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method.",

Sixty healthy women divided into control and experimental group who used regular shampoo and Urtica cannabina (U.cannabina) extract shampoo, respectively. Scalp skin was examined using an electronic skin analyzer, and trichometric analysis was performed with a Folliscope. The collected scalp hair samples were digested and measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The average copper (p=0.05), zinc (p=0.0002), and iodine (p=0.0004) levels increased notably, whereas the selenium content decreased slightly (p=0.337) in the experimental group. We found that the average iodine content in scalp hair of Mongolian females was three times lower than the global average. The average increase in trace elements may be considered to be due to the transfer of an element into the human scalp during shampooing. These results indicate that some trace elements in human scalp hair are not only associated with nutritional status and environmental factors, but cosmetic products can also affect the trace element composition. The hair growth, diameter, and density gradually increased and were higher in the experimental group than in the control group. Scalp skin moisture, sebum, and pH values increased in the experimental group, whereas the control group showed no notable difference. Herbal extracts may potentially support scalp hair growth and increase the hair density. This ability can be explained by the trace elements in the herbal extract, which may play a key role in inducing hair growth.",

The stability constants of the studied coordination entities were calculated potentiometrically.

Based on the species distribution curves as a function of CL/CM, the percentage of each coordination entity formed in aqueous solution was estimated (12 % [Ag-deoxy]+; 36 % [Ag-(deoxy)2]+; 16 % [Ag-ribo]+; 26 % [Ag-(ribo)2]+). It was found that the ligands form coordination entities with Ag(I) ions with stoichiometric ratios M : L = 1 : 1 and 1 : 2. Such coordination entities may show potential antiviral, antibacterial, and antitumor properties, which warrants further in vitro and in vivo studies.

    "abstract": "Old-age-associated pathologies usually coincide with altered sphingolipid metabolism. Changes in the level of sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide are largely determined by the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) during aging. nSMase is a key enzyme in sphingolipid turnover; it generates ceramide through the hydrolysis of SM. While N—acetylcysteine (NAC) is a powerful antioxidant which has anti-inflammatory properties and it is the precursor of glutathione (GSH). The aim of this study is to determine the impact of NAC on nSMase activity in the age-dependent changes of sphingolipid (SM and ceramide) levels and GSH content in blood serum, gastrocnemius muscle and kidney tissue of 24-month-old rats. It was found that the effect of NAC on the tissue of 24-month-old rats increased SM content; GSH content and decreased the ceramide content. The gastrocnemius muscle and kidney were the most sensitive to the effects of NAC. The results show that GSH inhibit the activity of nSMase. These results emphasize that nSMase. plays a key role in age-associated ceramide accumulation in rat tissues during aging. Furthermore, it was indicated that NAC is an effective modulator of nSMase and has pleiotropic effects that may alter sphingolipid metabolism. The nSMase inhibition enhances the benefits of NAC treatment.",

The novelty of the study was to present a possible method for obtaining pure diacylglycerols (DAG) from natural raw materials like fats (hemp seed oil and mutton tallow). We have determined the optimum water content for enzymatic interesterification to shift the reaction equilibrium towards hydrolysis and obtain the highest DAG formation yield. Then, DAG were separated and purified by column chromatography. Raw fats were characterized by fatty acids composition and their positional distribution using gas chromatography. Triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols and free fatty acid contents were determined using gel permeation chromatography. The main fatty acids found in sn-2 MAG of hemp seed oil was linoleic acid, which was followed by oleic acid. Saturated fatty acids in hemp seed oil’s TAG showed preference for the outer sn-1,3 positions. For mutton tallow, the majority of oleic acid were found at sn-2 position. The optimum water content applied during enzymatic interesterification for DAG formation was estimated to be 2.0 % w/w, using the following conditions: 5 % w/w of catalyst, 200 rpm, 60 °C, 6h. DAG yield was 27 %. Purification of the mutton tallow-based and hemp seed oil-based DAG yielded with 83 % w/w and 82 % w/w, respectively. High purity DAG could be applied as effective emulsifiers in food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical emulsions.",

All the experiment was done on HPLC Shimadzu Prominence 20A having stainless steel ACE5 C18 column with a particle size of 5µm and a dimension of 4.6 mm X 150 mm. The mobile phase was in gradient mode with mobile phase A (0.03M ammonium acetate buffer : acetonitrile : methanol (55:30:15 v/v) pH 3.8) and mobile phase B (water) . The flow rate was 1.2 mL/min and the wavelength 208 nm was selected for detection. This method was validated for linearity and range, accuracy, precision and robustness in accordance with ICH requirements. The retention time of fesoterodine was found as 11.0 min. The main degradation product 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine (5-HMT; active metabolite of FST) and the other process impurities; aldehyde, benzylated hydroxy, tolterodine ester, diester impurities were detected easily at the retention times 3.8, 13.5, 16.7, 21.5, 37.1 minutes, respectively. It was observed that the retention times of the main peak and its impurities were not affected and the selectivity of the method was proved under the applied stress conditions. With this developed method, FST and its impurities can easily be detected. It is also stable, simple, accurate, and completely validated RP-HPLC technique for the analysis of FST and related impurities that meets with ICH standards.",

This study aimed to develop and optimize the preparation process of intravenous lipid emulsions with reduced droplet size compared to commercially available formulations. The response surface methodology was applied to optimize the ultrasonic emulsification. The reduction of lipid droplet size was achieved by the use of a combination of 1.2% (w/w) soy phospholipids and various concentrations of Tween 80 (2, 3, and 4% (w/w)). The other variables were sonication amplitude and time of sonication. During the optimization process, fifteen soybeans oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions were developed. All formulations were characterized by the physicochemical properties appropriate for intravenous administration, i.e., MDD ranging from 119.1 ± 0.6 nm to 177.1 ± 2.1 nm, PdI below 0,219 ± 0,009. The pH and osmolarity ranged from 6.23 ± 0.01 to 6.58 ± 0 and from 328 ± 3 to 568 ± 8 mOsm/kg, respectively.

    "abstract": "Honeybee venom (HBV) is a product of natural origin with an extremely complex composition. It exhibits several beneficial pharmacological properties, for example anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, anti-arthritic, and anti-tumour activities. On the other hand, HBV contains highly allergenic components, including melittin, which makes up more than 50% of its dry weight. Despite many studies conducted, HBV's components and mechanism of action are not yet fully known and understood. Therefore, to enhance the safety of its therapeutical applications, it is essential to establish HBV's composition and biological properties. Many analytical techniques and methods have been reported as potentially useful for the determination of new HBV constituents. Studies focus mainly on the analyses of the HBV proteome and metabolome. Also, properties of its components when applied to the skin, as well as its allergenicity, are being studied. Currently, the most commonly used methods for HBV analysis include high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Choosing the correct and most applicable method for HBV analysis is of great importance in order to obtain in-depth results crucial for the understanding of its mechanism of biological action. The diversity of chemical compounds in HBV also entails an appropriate sample preparation at the pre-analytical stage. In order to summarise the latest knowledge on techniques for the analysis of complex natural products, on the example of HBV, this review paper discusses the modern analytical tools of HBV characterisation, focusing on metabolomic and proteomic studies, topical applications, investigation of venom allergies, and the prospects for future research.",

Thus, this study aimed to determine the pKa values of fluphenazine and its derivatives from the mobile phase pH dependence of the retention factor with the reverse phase liquid chromatographic method. Binary mixtures of phosphate buffer (pH 2.3-11.5) and acetonitrile (40-55%) in different percentages and the Gemini NX C18 column as the stationary phase were used in the tests. The pKa' values of fluphenazine derivatives at experimental concentrations of organic solvent were determined based on the obtained sigmoidal k curves as a function of pH. Then these values were extrapolated to 0% acetonitrile to obtain the actual pKa values.

It is assumed that oxidative stress and/or reactive products of drug biotransformation are responsible for its hepatotoxicity (2). The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis concerning the influence of valproic acid and its metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-en VPA) on the antioxidant status of patients treated with (VPA-T) and poisoned with valproic acid (VPA-P). The VPA-P group was divided into patients with (VPA-Ptox) and without (VPA-Pnon) toxic symptoms observed during the hospitalization. Oxidative stress was assessed using markers, such as antioxidant potential (FRAP) and reduced and oxidised glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio were measured in the plasma of the study patients. The obtained results showed statistically significant differences between the concentrations of the drug and its active metabolite levels in the VPA-T and VPA-P groups. In the VPA-P group, the increase of the level of 4-en VPA in the plasma correlated with the increase of the concentration of the drug. The influence of VPA on the antioxidant balance in both groups of patients was demonstrated. The plasma antioxidant potential of FRAP decreased with increasing valproic acid concentrations in the VPA-Ptox group. The lowest concentrations of GSH/GSSG ratio were found in the VPA-Pnon group, without symptoms of intoxication during hospitalization.",

It was found that patients with exogenous endophthalmitis, including after surgery or ocular trauma, intravitreal injection of amikacin in combination with vancomycin is recommended for empiric treatment. However, high-quality randomized controlled trials or cohort studies are needed to verify this.",

    "abstract": "One third of breast cancer patients also suffer from diabetes, which is associated with a 40% higher risk of mortality. Patients undergoing anti-cancer treatment are also exposed to xenoestrogens present in everyday life, which may affect the effectiveness of the therapies used. The purpose of our study was to analyzed the effect of metalloestrogens (Al, Cr[III]) on the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) under high glucose conditions prevailing in the cellular model. On two human breast cancer cell lines—MCF-7 and MCF-7/DOX—a cell viability assay, a flow cytometer analysis of apoptosis, and protein activity of BAX, Bcl-2, and VEGF-A by ELISA were carried out. Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed post hoc by Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests. High glucose conditions reduced the effectiveness of AIs in both cell lines (decreased cytotoxicity, inhibition of apoptosis, increase in Bcl-2/BAX ratio and angiogenesis), regardless of the combination with metalloestrogens. Hyperglycemia may affect the effectiveness of AIs to a greater extent than metalloestrogens alone - the activity of drugs in the presence of high glucose concentrations was significantly lower, regardless of the combination with metalloestrogens, which indicates the key role of hyperglycemia in attenuating their activity. Therefore controlling hyperglycemia and individualized treatment regimens in cancer patients with diabetes may have important therapeutic implications.",

Two recombinant human PON1 proteins were investigated: PON1-Fc, which has an Fc-tag on its C-terminal, and His-PON1-Fc, which has an Fc-tag on its C-terminal and histidine on its N-terminal. The influence of high and low-density lipoproteins, copper ions, iron ions, and thiolactone homocysteine, on arylesterase and lactonase activities of PON1 in human serum was examined. Two activities of PON1, arylesterase and lactonase, were measured using earlier elaborated kinetic spectrophotometric method with temperature control at 37°C using the water thermostated cuvette holder. It was demonstrated that the HEK293F expression platform is useful for obtaining recombinant human PON1 protein. Also, addition of high-density lipoprotein increased serum arylesterase and lactonase activity of PON1 to a greater extent than the addition of PON1-Fc or HisPON1-Fc recombinant proteins. In contrast, the addition of high-density lipoprotein to samples containing PON1-Fc or His-PON1-Fc did not increase PON1 activities, while low-density lipoprotein, copper ions, and iron ions, depressed PON1 arylesterase and lactonase activity. Obtained results indicated that it may be advantageous to stimulate PON1 activities rather than supplement with endogenous PON1 protein and HDL, which could be an interesting direction for further study. Furthermore, the work has highlighted some potential research directions for the use of PON1 as a therapeutic molecules. Nevertheless, the study had some limitations and should therefore be treated as a preliminary study.",

An anonymous online survey was conducted to study the dietary behavior and physical activity levels of COVID-19 sufferers between April and August 2022. The research tool comprised a specially devised and structured questionnaire and the FFQ-D10 food frequency questionnaire. A total of 159 people completed the questionnaire. Out of that number, 153 women over 18 years of age who were in home isolation due to COVID-19 were included in the study. The results show that 1.133 portions of cereal products were consumed daily, with unrefined groats and wholemeal or 'brown' bread with seeds being more common. Vegetable consumption stood at 2.225 portions per day, and fresh fruit at 1.774 portions per day. For sweets, consumption was 0.511 portions per day. Products that the study participants were least likely to consume were sweetened drinks, red meat, conventionally sweetened sweet fruit preserves, dried fruit and sweetened dairy drinks. Analysis of the anthropometric characteristics and dietary behaviour of women who participated in the study allowed for the preparation of dietary recommendations for COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Muscle atrophy is a common complication in diabetes mellitus. Gallic acid (GA) possesses multiple biologic effects in hyperglycemia and muscle functions. However, whether GA can ameliorate muscular dystrophy during diabetes is unknown. Our data demonstrated GA alleviated muscle dysfunction by promoting myocyte area and grip strength. In serum, GA enhanced T-AOC, SOD and CAT levels, and reduced MDA, TNF-α and IL-6 levels. In gastrocnemius, GA restrained protein degradation by mitigating F-box protein 32 (FBXO-32) and tripartite motif-containing 63 (TRIM-63) expressions. The mechanism of GA against diabetes-associated muscle atrophy is closely linked to its regulations on endoplasmic reticulum stress by attenuating DDIT-3 (DNA-damage inducible transcript 3) and heat shock protein 5 (HSPA-5) expressions. Moreover, GA improved mitochondria bioactivity by enhancing nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and PPARG coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) expressions. Lastly, GA suppressed apoptosis by increasing BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) expressions and decreasing BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL-2) expressions. In conclusion, GA prevented from diabetic myopathy via its regulations of endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondria function and apoptosis. These data suggested GA could be a newer strategy against diabetic muscle atrophy.",

The compounds turned out to have detectable but very low affinity for the receptor (IC50 &gt; 100 μM). The discrepancy between the docking scores and the experimental affinity provoked us to perform additional tests of AutoDock Vina scoring function performance against NK1R. The scoring function did not differentiate low MW-low affinity from low MW-high affinity binders, while it underestimated affinity of low MW-high affinity in comparison to high MW-high affinity compounds. The scoring function did not achieve satisfactory performance in discerning low MW-low affinity and low MW-high affinity binders from the sets of decoys.

The idea of pharmaceutical care originated in the United States in the 70s’ of the 20th century although the issue had already been discussed in the interwar period. The definition in force in Poland is contained in the Act on the Profession of Pharmacist (Act of September 10, 2020). The program includes pharmaceutical consultations, performing medications reviews, developing pharmaceutical care plans considering the patient’s drug-related problems, performing diagnostic tests and issuing prescriptions that are a continuation of a medical order(1). This paper reviews the current literature on the use of metformin in patients with multimorbidity. Special attention was given to the studies on probability of occurrence potential drug-related problems in the treatment of these diseases. The analysis shows that the most difficulties are caused by the lack of knowledge about the treatment used by patients. The result is often a reduction in the regularity of therapy or even resignation from it. The obtained observations related to the combined use of drugs from different therapeutic groups should help to systematize knowledge about the current needs and expectations of patients. Properly conducted pharmaceutical care, including the preparation of drug reviews and education, can significantly improve the effectiveness of treatment. The article emphasizes the importance of the cooperation of the patient, doctor and pharmacist in achieving and maintaining the proper quality of life of the patient.",

It is effective because it binds to the HER2 receptor and inhibits the signaling pathways for proliferation and metastasis. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance resulting from the various signaling pathways of heterogeneous breast cancer reduces its efficacy. To increase its efficacy, it is combined with different agents in the treatment. In this study, the synergistic effect of the combination of trastuzumab and gambogic acid on the breast cell line MDA-MB -453 was investigated in vitro. At the end of 12-, 24-, 48-, and 72-hour incubation, their antiproliferative effects were determined by XTT method. Combination Index (CI) values of the study were calculated using CompuSyn.exe software. The highest synergistic effect was obtained with 12.5 µg/mL trastuzumab + 1.25 µM gambogic acid (CI-4) at the 72nd hour. The activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT) was also measured for the applications. We observed that combination of trastuzumab and gambogic acid decreased CAT activity at 24, 48 and 72nd hours. It was concluded that gambogic acid may be a good candidate for combination with other agents in targeted drug design.",

While, disturbed glucose or insulin homeostasis, are at the forefront of AD research, not much is known about extra- and intracellular interplay between different forms of Aβ and microenviromental fluctuations of glucose or insulin concentrations in neuronal cells. Methods: We create conditions imitating the coexistence of T2DM with AD and compare the results with state where the neuropathological changes are yet not developed. We have investigated the effect of the physiological (Aβ40) and toxic amyloid form (Aβ25–35) and its co-incubation with glucose or insulin on neuronal proliferation, H2O2, Aβ42, S100B, S100A8 protein concentrations, mature neuronal protrusions and neurogenesis. Results: Aβ40 and Aβ25-35 with hyperglycaemia provoked stronger cytotoxic effect comparing to Aβ alone, while hyperinsulinemia dampen this effect. Opposite results were obtained in H2O2 measurement. Insulin stimulated Aβ42 generation when co-incubated with both Aβ forms. Aβ40 and Aβ25-35 caused similar pattern of extracellular S100B protein influx an concomitant cytosolic efflux. Neuronal protrusions and neurogenesis were initiated by co-incubation of Aβ40 with hyperglycaemia while reduced in Aβ25-35 and hyperglycemia or insulinemia. Significance: Our finding suggest that for understanding the biochemical origins of neuropathological amyloid β progression and potential involvement of metabolic disturbances in this process, it’s crucial to gasp preliminary interactions on cellular level. Our data can lead to hypothesis that S100B protein could be a potential modulator as well as indicator of prodromal neuropathological alterations.",

    "abstract": "There is a rising trend of overweight and obesity among individuals with type 1 diabetes. This is often associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, increased insulin dose requirements and poor glycemic control. Insulin resistance is a state of diminished effect of insulin on target tissues, despite normal or elevated serum insulin levels. Metformin as an adjunct to insulin in treating overweight or also not specific image of insulin resistance (without overweight or hormonal disorders) adults with type 1 diabetes is increasingly used. The main goal of this off-label type 1 diabetes treatment method is to improve insulin signaling leading to a subsequent increase in glucose uptake by skeletal myocytes, inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and, as a result, a reduction in the need for a daily dose of insulin. The use of metformin as an addition to insulin may increase the chance of achieving target glucose control and reduce the anabolic effect of this hormone. Metformin can improve insulin sensitivity, glycemia and modulate cardiovascular disease risk factors or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In the vast majority of clinical trials conducted with metformin in type 1 diabetes, the effect of the drug on daily insulin doses, improvement in lipid parameters, and decline in body fat was assessed without correlating pre-specified outcomes with drug plasma concentrations.",

This study aimed to assess the potential pharmacokinetic interaction of naproxen with curcumin in rats. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were orally administrated with naproxen (10 mg/kg body weight) and curcumin (10 or 20 mg/kg, body weight) synchronously or successively with a single administration of naproxen as the control group. The plasma concentration of naproxen was analyzed with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and the plasma concentration-time curve was established to obtain the pharmacokinetic parameters. In vitro, the metabolic stability of naproxen and the activity of CYP2C9 was assessed in rat liver microsome to reveal the potential mechanism. Both synchronous and successive co-administration of naproxen and curcumin induced increased maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC0-t), half-life (t1/2) and reduced clearance rate (CLF) of naproxen in rats, and the effect of curcumin was enhanced with its increasing concentration. In vitro, curcumin (10 and 20 mg/kg) was found to enhance the metabolic stability of naproxen (half-life from 29.7 ± 1.34 to 41.8 ± 5.07 and 46.9 ± 3.33 min) and significantly inhibited the activity of CYP2C9 with the IC50 of 16.36 μmol/L (P &lt; 0.05). A combination of naproxen and curcumin would induce pharmacokinetic interaction, which increased the systemic exposure of naproxen. The concentration-dependent inhibition of CYP2C9 by curcumin was the potential mechanism underlying the drug-herb interaction.",

    "abstract": "Dermocosmetics are products intended for sensitive and problematic skin. They are a good solution for additional care of skin affected by conditions such as atopic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, or for couperose skin. The compounds of particular importance in the care of atopic skin include ceramides, ectoine, hyaluronic acid, vitamins A and E, as well as natural vegetable oils. The aim of this work was to develop a qualitative and quantitative approach and to investigate the characteristics of formulations such as a face cream, a topical cream, a body lotion, and a cleansing foam, dedicated to patients with atopic dermatitis. The newly developed cosmetic formulations showed good physical and chemical characteristics, typical of this type of product. They were also structurally and microbiologically stable during storage at various temperatures. Dermatological tests did not reveal any irritating or allergenic properties. The best data were obtained for the face cream, namely improvement of skin hydration by 21.88%, reduction of transepidermal water loss by 15.86%, alleviation of erythema by 15.77%, and of skin sensitivity by 17.20%. This work resulted in the preparation of innovative dermocosmetics to be used for atopic skin. The cosmetics have a unique composition and delicate formula, show high biofunctionality, and meet all the requirements for cosmetic products intended for marketing.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the degradation kinetics and stability of rosuvastatin calcium (RSV) in acidic and alkaline solutions at two different doses, 5 mg and 10 mg. The degradation reaction was characterised by the activation energy (Ea), enthalpy change (ΔH≠a), and entropy change (ΔS≠a). The degradation of RSV in acidic solution followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, with observed rate constants (kobs) of 2.63×10-3 s-1 and 3.80×10-3 s-1 for the 5 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. The activation energy (Ea) was 102.1 kJ/mol and 101.8 kJ/mol for the 5 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively, indicating that the degradation process is moderately sensitive to temperature. The enthalpy change (ΔH≠a) for both doses was positive, with values of 92 kJ/mol and 102 kJ/mol for the 5 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively, indicating that the degradation reaction is endothermic, with the 5 mg dose requiring more significant heat input. The entropy change (ΔS≠a) for both doses was negative, with values of -0.219 kJ/(mol∙K) and -0.236 kJ/(mol∙K) for the 5 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively, indicating that the degradation process decreases the system's disorder, with the 5 mg dose having a more significant impact. The degradation of RSV in an alkaline medium was found to be a pseudo-first-order reaction, with observed rate constants ranging from 1.98×10-3 s-1 to 7.09×10-3 s-1, depending on the RSV concentration. The results suggest that higher RSV concentrations improve stability in alkaline conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the stability of RSV under different pH conditions.",

The diameter of these nanoparticles ranged from 194.5 ± 69.4 nm to 353.1 ± 103.9 nm, which were in the ideal range for application. The cellular uptake of MMPs-TAT-MNPs appeared similar to MNPs, but significantly increased in the presence of MMP-2 pretreatment. MMPs-TAT-MNPs had no significant cytotoxicity at the concentration of ≤25 μg/ml. MMPs-TAT-MNPs with MMP-2 substrate modified TAT peptide is successfully prepared, possess a low cytotoxicity loadable cargo and can be activated in an MMP-2 rich niche.",

As the results, BPIMA effectively inhibited adipocyte differentiation (64.3% at 40 μM) without exhibiting any cytotoxicity. Additionally, BPIMA decreased the protein levels of PPARγ, FAS, C/EBP, and SREBP in 3T3-L1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In C57BL/6J mice, a significant decrease in body weight, adipose tissue, and fatty liver was observed in the BPIMA-treated high-fat group compared to that observed in the vehicle-treated high-fat group; the serum levels of total cholesterol and glucose also significantly decreased in the BPIMA-treated high-fat group. Moreover, the weight and fat level of liver and serum AST, ALT activity in the BPIMA-treated high-fat group were similar to low fat diet-control group.

However, prescribers must blend database insights with clinical expertise for accurate choices. Clinical experience doesn't always align with drug Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs). While SPC guidelines ensure safety, they might not optimize efficacy. For instance, treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) often benefits from off-label therapies that are clinically and cost-effective. The study aimed to identify potential PCOS treatments beyond approved uses in Poland and globally. The methodology involved reviewing databases used by medical professionals. Out of 29, 11 databases were chosen based on off-label drug availability and relevance to PCOS. Results show that medical databases aid medical professionals in finding off-label PCOS treatments. These databases also assess a drug's potential efficacy and risks. However, their usefulness has limits, lacking comprehensive data on usage, mechanisms, and safety. When using literary databases, keyword selection significantly influences search results.",

Based on the current recommendations of the regulatory agencies (EMA, FDA) regarding the implementation of the Quality by Design concept at the drug product development stage, this article is focused on the application of the experimental design approach at the preformulation studies. The purpose of this work was the implementation of experimental design methodology in a compatibility study between ketoprofen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and selected solid dosage forms excipients. The fractional factorial design was used to generate a matrix of multi-component mixtures of ketoprofen and selected excipients. In order to accelerate any chemical incompatibilities, the received mixtures were exposed to elevated temperature and humidity (60°C/75% RH) in a climate chamber for 3 weeks. The ketoprofen-excipients compatibility was studied by means of the RP-HPLC method. It was confirmed that the type of disintegrant had a strong impact on ketoprofen degradation. The incompatibility in mixtures of ketoprofen with sodium starch glycolate was indicated. According to literature data, it may be the result of a decrease in crystallinity and thus a decrease in the stability of ketoprofen in the presence of sodium starch glycolate. The effects of the other types of excipients were statistically insignificant (p &gt; 0.05). The applied experimental design methodology allowed for a rational selection of optimal excipients and thus, this approach may support significantly decision-making in the pharmaceutical industry.",

    "abstract": "The novel Abemaciclib derivative WXJ-8 may be a promising anti-tumour drug; however, its mechanism of action and clinical value need to be further verified in research. Cell cycle regulating systems are critical in parthenogenesis and progression. Because of its involvement in regulating cell cycle checkpoints, the CDK4/6-CyclinD1-Rb-E2F1 signalling pathway has been proposed as a possible therapeutic target for breast cancer. As a result, WXJ-8, a new and highly specific CDK4/6 inhibitor, was developed and synthesized in this investigation. The activity of WXJ-8 against breast cancer cells in vitro was detected by MTT method. The main subjects were MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Plate cloning, wound healing, invasion and adhesion experiments revealed that WXJ-8 had strong anti-proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion effects on breast cancer cells. Protein blotting revealed significant down regulation of CDK4, CDK6, p-Rb, E2F1 and other cell cycle factors in the CDK4/6-CyclinD1-Rb-E2F1 pathway, as well as activation of Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Cleaved Caspase-3 apoptotic factor expression, resulting in MDA-MB-231 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Finally, our research implies that WXJ-8 might be a potential anti-triple-negative breast cancer medication candidate.",

Quality, productivity and manufacturing time is crucial for producers during their development and industrial operations. To ensure the best quality of the product, it is necessary to know all critical process steps and parameters. The use of QbD elements is to ensure the quality of the drug product throughout its \"life cycle\". Quality by design (QbD) and its elements are described by the International Council of Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and in their guideline - chapter ICH Q8 (Pharmaceutical Development). One of the first steps in pharmaceutical product development is to prepare Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and analyse Critical Material Attributes (CMAs) and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of excipients, active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and final product. During this research, we investigated the CQAs of the excipients used in vitamin D3 soft gelatin capsules containing high doses of cholecalciferol, from 10 000 to 200 000 IU per capsule. We considered the viscosity of the gelatin mass, the effect of the addition of dye on the viscosity, and the impact of the colour of the gelatin mass on the active substance content in the final capsules. It was also investigated oily carriers (medium chain triglycerides and safflower oil) and antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol acetate vs butylhydroxytoluene), and their effect on API concentration in the capsule.",

The current study aims to investigatethe patients’ perspective about medicines utilization by implementing the WHO’s \"followup\" indicators in the Bulgarian practice. A prospective, cross -sectional, online inquiry study was conducted among Bulgarian population. The population above 18 years of age is 5.8 million of people and 400 people sample was considered sufficient with 95% CI. The study methodology is based on a modified version of the WHO \"followup\" indicators. The total number of answers was 467. The majority of patients aged over 56 years responded that they did not receive enough information about the side effects and interactions of the prescribed medicines and the most often they used the leaflet as a source of information. Most of the patients responded they always check the expiry date (61%), while 23 % of patients check it sometimes. In the group of patients over 65 years, 24% responded that they never check the expiry date. The results of our study suggest that rational medicines utilization is a broader concept depending on patients' knowledge and pharmacists and patients relation. It suggests that there is a need to educate both parties, mainly to increase health literacy and promote general aspects of rational medicines utilization.",

In this study, the oxidative aging model of mice was established by D-galactose, and the changes of organ index, histopathological changes, and mRNA expression in serum and tissue of oxidative aging mice after aerobic swimming and aerobic swimming+salidroside were detected. The results showed that aerobic swimming and aerobic swimming+salidroside inhibited the decline of heart index, liver index, spleen index and kidney index caused by oxidative aging in mice. Aerobic swimming and aerobic swimming+salidroside increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione (GSH) in serum, liver and spleen of oxidative aging mice, and decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). The study also found that aerobic swimming and aerobic swimming+salidroside can reduce the damage of oxidative aging to liver and spleen tissues. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed that aerobic swimming and aerobic swimming+salidroside could up-regulate the mRNA expression of CAT, GSH, Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and GSH-PX in mouse liver tissue. The results showed that aerobic swimming could effectively inhibit the oxidative aging of mice induced by D-galactose, and the effect of aerobic swimming+salidroside was better than that of aerobic swimming alone. It can be seen that salidroside can enhance the improvement of aerobic swimming on oxidative aging and can be used as a sports supplement.",

This procedure is based on the assumption that one molecule of the catechol (or more precisely the corresponding 1,2-benzoquinone) reacts with one molecule of paroxetine to produce one molecule of paroxetine quinone adduct. In the presence of paroxetine excess, pseudo-first-order kinetics was used to study the formation of the unstable product. A detector response factor for the paroxetine quinone adduct was calculated as a function of the response factor for the paroxetine catechol derivative, after considering a mass balance of the reaction.

    "abstract": "The pathologies of diabetes complications are diverse, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in foods or the body have recently been pinpointed as a direct cause of such complications.When the body maintains high blood sugar levels due to diabetes, proteins bind to sugars, which directly lead to diabetes complications and indirectly leads to metabolic disorders via elevated insulin resistance.AGEs that accumulate in the body induce various diabetes complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic nephropathy (DN), as well as aging, arterial sclerosis, and Alzheimerís disease, by forming crosslinks with proteins or interacting with receptors for AGEs (RAGE), which stimulates inflammatory pathways and increases the release and apoptosis of cytokines (1).Recent studies of associations between AGEs and metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity, have sparked extensive research on the development of metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance and diabetes, caused by the distribution of food-derived AGEs in the body (2-4).AGEs cause renal tissue injury by binding to RAGE, which leads to excessive ROS formation in renal tissues or cells, and by the generation of ROS and the profibrotic factor TGF-β1 via nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (5-7).Therefore, the inhibition of AGEs-induced increases in TGF-β1 and the reduction of ROS formation may be important aspects in the treatment of DN (8).Nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates toxic substances and oxidants and is an important factor in the defense against ROS.The Nrf2-",

    "abstract": "Histamine plays a variety of physiological roles in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues through the four known G protein-coupled receptors H 1 , H 2 , H 3 , and H 4 .The histamine H 3 receptor (H 3 R), discovered in 1983 by Arrang and co-workers, is a presynaptic autoreceptor within the Class A of GPCR family, which also functions as a heteroreceptor modulating levels of others, beside histamine, neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA, and glutamate (1).This clearly justifies the great interest H 3 R represents in the possible treatment of various neurological dysfunctions and psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dementia, epilepsy, obesity, narcolepsy and pain (2-6).Early generations of H 3 receptor ligands were based on structures containing the imidazole moiety, as analogs of histamine, leading in many cases to the potential drugñdrug interactions through inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P 450 enzymes as well as low oral bioavailability or rapid metabolism and poor CNS penetration (7).In 1998 Ganellin et al. described active compounds with piperidine and pyrrolidine moiety as a good replacement for the imidazole ring (8).Now, this class of compounds is rapidly developing with unexpectedly large structural variations.As many H 3 R antagonists/inverse agonists have",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of nifedipine combined with labetalol on earlyonset preeclampsia, and its effects on serum leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), apelin, and oxidative stress indexes.A total of 98 patients with early-onset preeclampsia were randomly divided into nifedipine and nifedipine+labetalol groups, with 49 patients in each group.On the basis of magnesium sulfate treatment, the nifedipine group was orally given nifedipine, and the nifedipine+labetalol group was orally given nifedipine and labetalol.After one week of treatment, the total effective rate in the nifedipine+labetalol group was 89.80%, which was significantly higher than 73.47% in the nifedipine group (P < 0.05).Compared with the nifedipine group, in the nifedipine+labetalol group the blood pressure and 24-h urinary protein level were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), the serum LIF level was significantly increased (P < 0.05), the serum apelin level was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), the serum superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the serum malondialdehyde level was significantly decreased (P < 0.05).In conclusion, for the treatment of early-onset preeclampsia, nifedipine combined with labetalol can enhance the efficacy by further increasing the LIF level, decreasing the apelin level, and resisting the oxidative stress in the body.",

    "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO), despite its reputation as a deadly poison, is being recognized as a powerful physiological regulatory agent with potential anti-cancer properties. To harness the potential of CO towards a safe therapy, CO-Releasing Molecules (CO-RMs) have been developed. In the present study, the effects of tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer (CORM-2) on MCF-7 breast cancer cell cultures were evaluated, with particular regard to mechanisms affecting collagen biosynthesis. In our model, CORM-2 exerted dose-dependent cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects, i.e., attenuated cell viability, induced apoptosis and reduced autophagy. Collagen biosynthesis was significantly reduced, with signs of the involvement of nuclear factor kappa B, integrin β1, insulin-like growth factor 1 and proline metabolism as the probable underlying mechanism. No effects of CO-depleted CORM-2 were found, thereby demonstrating that CORM-2 activity is associated with carbon monoxide. Additionally, it was found that CORM-2 had no influence on control fibroblasts cultures. Our results confirm both the cytotoxic and collagen-related properties of CO-releasing molecule in a breast cancer cell culture, and therefore serve to encourage further research in a pre-clinical setting. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to attempt to relate the effects of CORM-2 on cell viability and collagen metabolism in a cancer cell culture.",

In this context, pharmacological treatment applied in compliance with the formal registration of a medicinal product does not raise any serious concerns. However, it is not always possible to administer a medicine in a way that corresponds to its official characteristics. Clinical practice shows that it is often necessary to administer a medicine outside the requirements specified in the summary of product characteristics.

The aim of the study is to analyse the entire legal environment of the doctors’ use of medicines outside the summary of product characteristics.

However, this may only take place if such a decision is based on current knowledge, the doctor’s individual experience and acting in the best interest of the patient, as well as proper diagnosis of his/her current therapeutic needs. The legal regulations in force in Poland are sufficient in that sphere to ensure the well-being of the patient and protect the interests of the doctor, although – it should be admitted – their wording is not unambiguous enough to prevent more or less serious doubts as to their interpretation. Hence the proposal for legal clarification of the situation related to the administration of a medicine off-label.",

Muscle mass reduction is a common side effect of human aging. The growth factor myostatin (MSTN) appears to play a key role in aging-related muscle function decreases. Targeting MSTN might help people live longer by preventing SM alterations associated with aging. Therefore, in the present study, FDA-approved drugs (from 2015 to 2020, total 273 drugs) were screened against MSTN to find the best drugs against MSTN for the management of aging disease. In this regards, Screening, docking, and molecular dynamics simulation was used. Based on structure-based virtual screening and free energy of bind, we select the top five drugs as mentioned in this article. Two drugs were analyzed in-depth namely, Sonidegib and Revefenacin showing free energy of binding -10.95 and -12.03 kcal/mol respectively with MSTN. Further, these complex was forwarded for molecular dynamics simulation to check the structural stability during 100ns, which was found to be more stable. As a concluding remark, Sonidegib and Revefenacin can be considered for further designing of new drugs against MSTN for the treatment aging related disorders.",

Monitoring the safety of therapy with these drugs is particularly important in the population of pregnant women, due to their high popularity and the different pharmacokinetics during pregnancy. The number of clinical studies on pregnant women is very limited, so it is important to raise awareness and knowledge of the adverse effects (ADR) on the developing foetus. The aim of this study was to analyse and evaluate the safety of non-opioid analgesics in a population of pregnant women based on the results of an anonymous validated survey. It will increase the awareness and enable women to make informed decisions and consider the potential risks associated with treating or not treating pain during pregnancy and breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "It was aimed to synthesize some novel piperidine derivatives and investigate their antidepressant-like activities, in this study. Targeted compounds were obtained by reacting 1-(4-(substitutedpiperidin-1-yl)phenyl)ethan-1-one and heterocyclic aldehydes in methanol. The structures of the synthesized compounds were determined using data from various spectroscopic methods (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and LCMSMS). The compounds (50 mg/kg) were tested for their antidepressant-like effects by tail suspension and modified forced swimming tests (MFST). In addition, possible alterations in locomotor activities of mice were evaluated by activity cage measurements. Obtained results showed that compounds 2c-2f reduced the immobility time of mice in both of the antidepressant activity-screening tests indicating that these derivatives have antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, in MFST, compounds 2c and 2e significantly increased the swimming times, while compounds 2d and 2f significantly prolonged the climbing durations. Antidepressant-like effects of the compounds 2c and 2e was reversed with p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (serotonin depleting agent) pre-treatments while the same effect caused by the compounds 2d and 2f was abolished by pretreatment with α-methyl-para-tyrosine methyl ester (catecholamine depleting agent) pre-administrations. Moreover, pre-treatment with naloxone reversed the antidepressant-like effects of these four derivatives. Obtained results indicated that monoaminergic and opioidergic systems mediated the antidepressant-like effects of our novel piperidine derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Valproic acid and its derivatives are drugs that have been used in many neurogenic diseases, but are mainly used in epileptic seizures. Due to the fact that valproic acid doesn’t have conjugated double bonds, it isn’t visible under UV light and its detection is difficult. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the suitability of individual visualizing reagents in the chemical qualitative and quantitative detection of valproic acid using the TLC technique. Solutions of various visualizing reagents were prepared, and then the reagents were applied on the previously prepared chromatographic plates with valproic acid by means of an immersion and spraying method in order to detect it. It was shown that all the visualizing reagents used, with the exception of helasol green, bromothymol blue, malachite green, bromocresol green in 2% sodium hydroxide solution and sulphate (VI) solutions of iron (II), nickel and cobalt, allowed for the qualitative detection of valproic acid. It is recommended to use a 1% solution of copper (II) sulphate (VI) for the detection of valproic acid for both qualitative and quantitative purposes, due to the largest areas of the chromatographic bands on most of the chromatographic plates used in the study. There is a potential possibility of examining the identity of valproic acid present in drugs on the basis of the RF value, the characteristic colour of the spot, and a comparative analysis of spectrodensitograms.",

    "abstract": "The marine environment is an abundant source of diverse biologically active compounds that demonstrate great potential applications in pharmaceutics and medicine.Although novel biologically active secondary metabolites can be potentially found in bryozoans, there have been a few studies on these organisms.Bryozoans are sessile colonial animals commonly found in great diversity in shallow waters.In this study, samples of the bryozoan Cryptosula zavjalovensis Kubanin were collected from Akkeshi, Japan, and were extracted using ethanol.The crude extract was separated using ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and water to obtain organic and aqueous fractions, respectively.In the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, the EtOAc fraction demonstrated cytotoxicity towards MCF7 breast cancer cells.The EtOAc extract was subsequently fractionated through solid-phase extraction using a gradient of methanol and water (E1 80:20 v/v and E2 100:0 v/v) and using methanol and chloroform (E3 50:50 v/v).Toxicity profiling revealed that the toxicity toward the human MCF7 breast cancer cells of the E2 and E3 fractions is comparable to that of cisplatin, indicating the excellent cytotoxic activity of the EtOAc fractions of C. zavjalovensis.Further studies are thus warranted to isolate the novel compounds in these fractions and determine their potential chemotherapeutic application.",
