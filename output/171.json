    "abstract": "The widespread use of artificial nestboxes has led to significant advances in our knowledge of the ecology, behaviour and physiology of cavity nesting birds, especially small passerines. Nestboxes have made it easier to perform routine monitoring and experimental manipulation of eggs or nestlings, and also repeatedly to capture, identify and manipulate the parents. However, when comparing results across study sites the use of nestboxes may also introduce a potentially significant confounding variable in the form of differences in nestbox design amongst studies, such as their physical dimensions, placement height, and the way in which they are constructed and maintained. However, the use of nestboxes may also introduce an unconsidered and potentially significant confounding variable due to differences in nestbox design amongst studies, such as their physical dimensions, placement height, and the way in which they are constructed and maintained. Here we review to what extent the characteristics of artificial nestboxes (e.g. size, shape, construction material, colour) are documented in the ‘methods’ sections of publications involving hole-nesting passerine birds using natural or excavated cavities or artificial nestboxes for reproduction and roosting. Despite explicit previous recommendations that authors describe in detail the characteristics of the nestboxes used, we found that the description of nestbox characteristics in most recent publications remains poor and insufficient. We therefore list the types of descriptive data that should be included in the methods sections of relevant manuscripts and justify this by discussing how variation in nestbox characteristics can affect or confound conclusions from nestbox studies. We also propose several recommendations to improve the reliability and usefulness of research based on long-term studies of any secondary hole-nesting species using artificial nestboxes for breeding or roosting.",

    "abstract": "Birds are commonly used as an example of the strongly declining farmland biodiversity in Europe. The populations of many species have been shown to suffer from intensification of management, reduction of landscape heterogeneity, and habitat loss and fragmentation. These conditions particularly dominate farmland in the economically well developed countries of Western Europe. Currently, the farmland environment in Central-Eastern Europe is generally more extensive than in Western Europe and a larger proportion of people still live in rural areas; thus generating different conditions for birds living in agricultural areas. Furthermore, the quasi-subsistence farming in much of Central-Eastern Europe has resulted in agricultural landscapes that are generally more complex than those in Western Europe. To protect declining bird populations living in farmland, detailed knowledge on both species and communities is necessary. However, due to scientific tradition and availability of funding, the majority of studies have been carried out in Western Europe. In consequence this provokes a question: are findings obtained in western conditions useful to identify the fate of farmland bird biodiversity in Central-Eastern Europe? Therefore, the major goal of this paper is to highlight some local and regional differences in biodiversity patterns within EU farmland by comparing intensive agricultural landscapes with more extensive ones. More specifically, we aim to outline differences in agricultural landscapes and land use history in the two regions, use farmland birds to provide examples of the differences in species dynamics and species-habitat interactions between the two regions, and discuss possible social and ecological drivers of the differences in the context of biodiversity conservation. Factors governing spatio-temporal dynamics of farmland bird populations may differ in intensive and extensive landscapes as illustrated here using the Grey Partridge Perdix perdix and the Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio as examples. The unevenness of farmland bird studies distribution across Europe was also presented. We call for more emphasis on pluralism in furthering both pan-European research on farmland bird ecology and conservation strategies. We also highlight some features specific to Central-Eastern Europe that merit consideration for the more efficient conservation of farmland birds and farmland biodiversity across Europe.",

    "abstract": "Road traffic affects the natural environment in numerous ways. The most striking of these is the death of wild animals and birds as a result of collisions with moving vehicles. In this paper the available data on bird mortality on roads are reviewed. Estimates of annual mortality for some European countries (350 000 to 27 million birds), the monthly distribution of casualties, their distribution among sex and age classes, as well as the methods used in the study of this problem are presented. The species composition of birds killed in this way is compared for several countries. In western Europe sparrows and Blackbirds are the species that most frequently die on the roads, but in Central and Eastern Europe not only sparrows but also corvids and Barn Swallows make up a high proportion of the victims. Analysis of the monthly distribution of casualties in 10 species shows this to differ between countries, probably because of the geographic variation of certain aspects of their biology (migration, breeding etc.). Several factors affecting the frequency of casualties are discussed, and some suggestions for the prevention of bird casualties are also given.",

This review contains a comprehensive comparison of results of these studies, describes the patterns in bird population trends in North America and Europe in last forty years and discusses potential drivers. I omitted other sources of bird population trend estimates to reduce methodological bias and because bird monitoring studies are rarely represented in other parts of the world. The most intensively studied driver is habitat alteration on breeding grounds represented by agricultural intensification in Western Europe and North American grasslands, forest expansion and land abandonment in Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe and parts of North America, and more localized urbanization and forest habitat fragmentation. Evidence for climate change impacts is robust and includes almost all European regions covered by the reviewed studies but the causal mechanisms of its influence on bird abundance are not sufficiently known. Population limitation by environmental changes in wintering quarters is well supported by the studies covering 1970s and 1980s, whereas the effects of migration strategy became less important from 1990s onwards. Support for other potential drivers, such as direct disturbance by humans, is rather limited and further studies are needed to confirm their effects.",

    "abstract": "We documented the composition and structure of the breeding bird assemblage in the primeval temperate forest of the Białowieża National Park (BNP), during 2010–2014, and used 40 years of data to assess patterns of its diversity. We applied an improved version of the mapping technique (a combined mapping method) for forest birds in seven plots located in three old-growth forest types: ash-alder riverine, oak-hornbeam, and mixed coniferous. The composition of the breeding avifauna and species richness remained basically unchanged. Jointly 67 (79% of 40-year total) breeding species were recorded in 2010–2014. Overall 49 (57%) of all species bred in the study plots in more than 35 years, they formed c. 97% of the pairs in the breeding assemblage. The composition of the group of dominants changed slightly; Phylloscopus sibilatrix became much less numerous in comparison to the earlier periods. Anthus trivialis ceased to breed — possibly due to disappearance of its habitat. The numbers of Sylvia atricapilla reached the highest ever level, and those of Columba palumbus and Dendrocopos medius equalled the maxima observed during 40 years. The overall breeding densities did not change significantly but they were substantially lower than in the peak year (2001). Crown insectivores, crown nesters and short-distance migrants remained the most numerous foraging, nesting and migratory groups, respectively. The earlier observed density gradient across habitats — highest in the riverine, lowest in the coniferous stands — was retained. Overall composition of the breeding avifauna did not change during 40 years, and no colonization of forest areas by a new species, nor extinction of a formerly widespread species, except A. trivialis, were observed. Some local changes of species richness occurred, however. Large-scale changes in coniferous habitats due to die-back of Picea abies and appearance of canopy gaps were followed by the increase in species richness there, while disappearance of former sharp forest edges reduced the number of species breeding in the \"edge\" plots. We suggest that the high constancy of species composition of the breeding bird assemblage in BNP results largely from the interplay of two factors: 1) long-term stability of the forest habitats, causing places suitable in one year to remain so over many seasons, and 2) cross-generational reproducibility of the selection criteria used by the birds in their settlement decisions.",

    "abstract": "Avian nests are crucial to reproduction as they are the site for incubation of the clutch of eggs and, in many cases, it is the location for the rearing of chicks hatched. Despite many years of reports of the characteristics of nests from many species our understanding of their functional properties has been very poor. Over the past few years, interest in the functional properties of nests has increased and this review brings together information regarding how materials used to construct the nest contribute to various functional properties. The review starts with a brief consideration of the various functions of nests but thereafter the focus is on the key roles that it plays during incubation. Details of the variety of materials used in nest construction emphasises the importance of quantitative data on the types and amounts of materials used in nests and how this information allows analysis that can improve our understanding of functional properties. Subsequent sections explore structural and thermal properties of nests in more detail. The roles that a nest can play in maintaining nest humidity and in weather-proofing the contents are also explored. The concept that the nest is an extended phenotype that has a role in niche creation is explored before the review concludes with a consideration of future directions for research.",

    "abstract": "DNA fingerprinting or microsatellite PCR studies have disclosed that extra-pair paternity (EPP) is a regular and relevant phenomenon in socially monogamous species. Corresponding genetic data are tabulated for 119 species. Within a species, the EPP can vary between populations and years; it obviously depends on several environmental, ecological and sociobiological constrains. While these explanations can account for variation within certain species or genera, they fail if we look at EPP within the class Aves. We found, that the probability that both mates of a monogamous pair breed together in consecutive years (termed annual pair survival) appears to be negatively correlated with the degree of extra-pair fertilizations (EPF), i.e. longlived species, in which mates have a real chance to raise young together over several seasons show significant lower EPP than species which only mate for a single summer (including many songbirds). Our analysis thus provides another possibility to speculate on the function and benefits of extra-pair copulations (EPC). Data are also given on the evolution of mating systems in New World Blackbirds Icteridae and reed warblers (genus Acrocephalus) based on molecular phylogenies of these groups, indicating a high degree of convergent evolution.",

    "abstract": "Hole nesting birds, due to the long lasting nature of cavities, use their nest sites for many years. Therefore, they may face the problem of the presence of nest material from previous breeding seasons. For a long time, the problem of old nest presence was not addressed in studies of this group of birds because nestboxes, a useful tool in studies of hole nesters, were cleaned by investigators, with old nests removed before each breeding season. In this review, the available results of experiments related to the effects of old nests on hole nesting birds are collected, recapitulated and discussed. The possible effects of old nests on nest site choice and breeding parameters, such as phenology, clutch size, fledging condition, as well as on ectoparasite numbers in a new nest, are presented. The findings show that studies on the problem of old nests started to be conducted mainly in the early 1990's, and to date more then thirty papers have been published related to this topic. The most frequent subjects of such studies in Europe were the Pied Flycather Ficedula hypoleuca, Blue and Great Tits Cyanistes caeruleus, Parus major, and European Starling Sturnus vulgaris, while in North America — the House Wren Troglodytes aedon and Eastern Bluebird Sialia sialis. The analysis of existing papers reveals that a majority of studies did not find any significant effect of old nest presence on nest site selection. In most papers, the presence of old nests did not influence birds' breeding parameters. Worse reproductive output in nestboxes containing old nests was found very rarely, and in particular seasons or study areas. Data on ectoparasite occurrence in relation to the presence of old nest material were presented only in a few papers. Fewer fleas were found in new nests built in artificially cleaned sites compared to sites containing old nests. The abundance of mites and blow fly larvae was not related to nestbox treatment. The results of this review suggest that there is no clear pattern of effects of old nest presence on hole nesters' breeding. It seems that the location of the study area, which influences the time available for birds' reproduction, is especially important for migratory species, and the impact of the ectoparasites dominating in a given study area may influence obtained results. This paper also suggests the direction of future work in this topic. Of most importance are studies carried out in natural tree holes, as the decomposition rate of old nest material could be much higher in such cavities than in nestboxes, and studies providing detailed descriptions of the costs and benefits of nest site cleaning behaviour of the birds themselves.",

Although more and more bird species worldwide are colonizing and adapting to urban environments, the ecological processes underlying the responses to urbanization and the relevant resource changes remain unclear. Here we examined the responses of the Chinese Bulbul Pycnonotus sinensis to urbanization by assess- ing nest composition and available nesting materials at five land-use categories (mountains, farmlands, riparians, urban parks, strips of street trees) of intensifying development in Hangzhou, China. In each land-use category, we classified used and available nesting materials as anthropogenic (e.g. plastics, paper pieces, cloth pieces, nylon particles, threads) or natural materials (e.g. plant culms, roots, leaves). We found that the proportion of anthropogenic nesting materials used by Chinese Bulbuls differed significantly across land-use categories, and it increased significantly with urbaniza- tion. Additionally, the increasing amount of anthropogenic nesting materials with urbanization can be attributed to an increase in the availability of anthropogenic nesting materials toward the urban core. Our results indicate that Chinese Bulbuls can adjust the composition of their nests in response to urbanization.",

The peak abundance of caterpillars was at least 3 times higher in the woodland than in the parkland habitat. There were also pronounced differences in caterpillar production between years, with every consecutive year during 2003–2005 being trophically worse than the previous one. The Blue Tits' timing of breeding coincided roughly with the timing of caterpillar abundance in particular years. Mean clutch size corresponded strictly to the inter-habitat and inter-year pattern of variation in caterpillar availability, suggesting adaptive responses in Blue Tit reproduction to food resources.",

    "abstract": "Birds' nests are special structures built with reproductive aims. Size and structure of the nest can arise from evolutionary trade-offs between benefits such as the insulation from unfavourable conditions, maintenance of eggs or chicks, or security against predation, and costs such as energy spent in construction of the nest and the risk of predation in more visible nests. Therefore, building a good nest is beneficial in terms of reproductive output but expensive in terms of time and energy, so probably only \"good\" parents would be able to build \"good\" nests. Our objective was to study possible relationships between the quality of the parents and the quality of the nest, and between the quality of the nest and breeding performance in a Great Tit Parus major population. We found positive relationships between different components of the nest quality and components of breeding performance. However, we did not find any significant relationship between quality of the parents and that of the nest. A weak, though significant positive correlation was found between female size and breeding success rate.",

We checked whether the bird community composition had remained stable over the 35 years and the extent to which the numerical trends in BNP followed the regional trends. The composition of breeding avifauna and species richness was basically unchanged, except for the strongly increasing Sylvia atricapilla, which became a regular dominant in all habitats. The density gradient across habitats — highest in the riverine, lowest in the coniferous stands — was retained. After a maximum in 2001, the numbers of birds declined slightly, but densities were still among the highest in 35 years. Numbers of 18 of the 26 commonest species were higher in 2005–2009 than in 1975–2009; only Anthus trivialis, Phylloscopus sibilatrix, Ficedula parva showed negative trends, and Ficedula hypoleuca almost went extinct recently. Some numerical changes were attributable to local habitat changes (increases in Phylloscopus collybita and Sylvia atricapilla, declines in spruce-dependent species). Numbers of only four of 22 species (Dendrocopos major, Erithacus rubecula, S. atricapilla, Parus major) changed concurrently in BNP and the rest of Poland. The apparent lack of a relationship between changes in bird numbers and the local and regional situation suggests that factors acting on a far larger scale could have been involved.

Do the data exist that show that the birds have switched to other food sources? We analyse data on nestling food of eleven European hole-nesting passerines (158 papers). The diet of some species is hardly known (< 100 broods observed), there are large gaps in geographical coverage (70% of data from five countries — Germany, Russia, Slovakia/Czech Republic, Poland and Great Britain) and most of studies do not meet the minimum requirement of representativeness (three seasons, ≥ 20 broods/season), which limits their external validity. The majority of investigations were done decades ago, in different conditions and most probably they cannot be treated as representative for the current situation. There is no study in which the past (before warming) and current nestling diet in the same local population have been compared, so, direct empirical support for the 'mismatch' idea is rather weak. Knowledge of nestling diet and its variation is far from adequate and new, properly designed, studies are needed.",

Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little empirical information on many aspects of the activity. We sought to characterise garden bird feeding in a large UK urban area in two ways. First, we conducted face-to-face questionnaires with a representative cross-section of residents. Just over half fed birds, the majority doing so year-round and at least weekly. Second, a 2-year, longitudinal study recorded all foodstuffs put out by households on every provisioning occasion. In this way, we obtained the first year-round quantitative records of the amounts and types of wild bird food provided in individual gardens. A median of 127 g, equivalent to 628 kcal, was given daily per household (typically consisting of several food types). We estimated the daily cost of this provisioning level to be UK£0.35 per household based on the relative proportions of each food type. Provisioning level was not significantly influenced by weather or season. Comparisons between the data sets revealed significantly less frequent feeding amongst the feeders in the longitudinal study (assumed to be ‘keen’ feeders owing to their participation in this longterm study and numbers of food types provided) than the face-to-face questionnaire respondents, suggesting that questionnaires relying upon participants' estimates rather than records of provisioning may overestimate actual provisioning frequency. Assuming 100% uptake, the median provisioning level equates to sufficient supplementary resources across the UK to fully support 196 million individuals of a hypothetical average garden-feeding bird species (based on 10 common UK garden-feeding birds' energy requirements). This compares with an estimated total of 71 million breeding individuals of these 10 species in the UK (non-breeding numbers unknown). Taking the lowest provisioning level recorded (101 kcal/day) as a conservative measure, 31 million of these average individuals could theoretically be supported.",

We present the first comparative allometric study of the relative OCL thickness (expressed as a fraction of the diaphyseal radius) in modern birds. Body size explains 79% of the OCL variation in thickness, which is inversely correlated with size, that is, shows negative allometry (slope -0.799). This may explain the apparent absence of OCL in the ratites. Since the OCL is deposited at the end of growth, we propose that its relative thickness probably correlates with the amount of slow, residual growth, which our results suggest to be on the average larger in small birds.",

    "abstract": "The 1995–1999 results of the mapping technique censuses carried out in permanent plots situated in three types of old-growth primeval BNP stands (ash-alder riverine, oak-hornbeam, mixed coniferous) are presented and contrasted with the data gathered in the same plots in the late 1970s. Most community parameters, such as composition of breeding avifauna, species richness, make-up and cumulative proportion of dominants, remained basically unchanged. Only the overall bird density has increased considerably, by 13–38% in different plots. This has been due to parallel increases in numbers of several species, widely differing in their nesting sites, food requirements and migratory habits. As numbers increased simultaneously in all the plots, the density differences across habitats remained the same, from highest densities in riverine stands at the forest edge (up to 124 p/10 ha), through oak-hornbeam stands, to lowest in the coniferous stands (48–50 p/10 ha). Despite this differentiation the breeding avifauna in individual plots was quite similar (density similarity index exceeding 50% ), indicating that their breeding assemblages constituted samples from a single bird community. In most cases the numerical increases could not be attributed to changes in local environmental factors, such as food resources, weather conditions or changes in habitat structure. Only in the coniferous stands, could habitat changes leading to diversification of their structure (gap formation, increasing number of deciduous trees) have been responsible for increasing species richness and abundance there. The apparent lack of a relationship between changes in bird numbers and the local situation suggests that the factors acting on a larger scale (outside the study area) could have been involved. Despite the directional changes in bird abundance observed in the Białowieża Forest, its breeding bird assemblage, when compared with amplitude of changes recorded over the same period in other areas and habitats, stands out as an example of remarkable stability.",

We prolonged nest construction effort in a population of Spanish Pied Flycatchers by removing nests from nest-boxes and forcing females to build a second nest. In comparison with control nests, the experimental females had to work for longer periods and accumulate more nest material, but nest construction rates (g of nest material per day of construction) were not affected. There was a positive association of clutch mass with nest construction rate. To measure physiological stress, we captured females shortly after laying to obtain blood samples for heat-shock protein quantification. Heat-shock proteins quantify stress at cell level. The level of HSP60 in peripheral blood was positively associated with total nest construction rate (including second nests for experimental females), but not with laying date, clutch mass or experimental treatment. A third of the variation in the HSP60 level was explained by the nest construction rate. Fast nest builders are physiologically stressed, suggesting that the nest construction rate may constitute an index of female physiological performance.",

Results indicated that vultures ranged extensively mainly in areas where traditional stock-raising practices and pasturing were still common, also including some vulture restaurants, which were visited occasionally. Eurasian Griffon Vultures concentrated their hourly and daily movements in the middle of the day, when the availability of thermal updrafts was higher, favouring foraging activities. The overall foraging range, calculated as Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) (7419 km2), or as 95% and 50% kernel contours (4078 km2 and 489 km2, respectively), was higher than those reported in previous studies. The precise knowledge of the ranging behaviour and spatial parameters is particularly important for the conservation of scavenger species inhabiting human-dominated areas where human activities may jeopardize vulture populations in the long term.",

In the present work, we reduced the effort needed to construct the nest in a cavity nester, the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, where females are the main builders. To this end, we placed stored complete nests in certain nest-boxes as soon as nest building was initiated, whereas stored complete nests were placed in the control nests-boxes as soon as nest building had ceased. Thus, no nest-box contained the original nest. Pairs collected more nest material and for longer periods in the control nests, although the experimental pairs still added some nest material after the manipulation. Nest-boxes were filmed for 1 to 3 h during incubation and on days 4 and 11 of the nestlings' life. Female attendance during incubation was negatively affected by nest mass, this parameter explaining almost half the variation in attendance, which suggests an effect of nest mass on incubation efficiency. The female provisioning effort on day 4 was significantly higher in the experimental nests, whereas other parental care variables were affected by date, weather conditions and brood size or brood mass. Mean tarsus length at fledging was significantly longer in the experimental nests. The savings by females in nest construction effort were expressed in higher provisioning at early nestling stages and in improved nestling growth.",

A higher percentage of occupation and more Barn Owl nestlings per breeding attempt were found in nest boxes located in the shade than in the sun, and in those facing east/north rather than other directions. The temperature in the nest boxes varied, being lowest in those located in the shade and in those facing east. Nest boxes located in crop fields fledged more young per breeding attempt than those located in date plantations.

EURING ring-recovery data were used to estimate directions and proportional usage of flyways. The timing of migration was compared along these routes and breeding origins of shot individuals were determined. Ring recoveries of Czech, Hungarian, British, German and French birds suggested three main flyways with westerly, central and easterly directions. The proportional usage was estimated by multinomial mark-recovery models. Major parts of French (62%), German (92%) and British (94%) Turtle Doves followed a western flyway. Czech birds used the central route (56%) and 55% of Hungarian birds followed the eastern flyway. Thus, a migratory divide between the Czech Republic and Germany could be suggested. The timing of migration showed a similar latitudinal pattern of migration along all flyways. Birds were at the breeding grounds in June and July and from September to April in their southernmost distribution ranges. Outward migration started in August. Return migration was still evident in May. The majority of reported hunted doves were from the 1960s and 1970s. High hunting numbers were present in September, April and May. France and Spain mainly shot birds from the UK and France. In Italy predominantly Italian birds were shot. Doves shot in Greece mostly came from the Czech Republic. Given the decreasing population numbers, large ringing numbers seem unlikely in the future. Thus, low recovery numbers in recent decades parallel both, the population decrease and a lower ringing activity.",

Declines may be related to factors on the breeding grounds, stopover sites and/or wintering grounds. We used multi-isotope (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N) measurements of winter-grown feathers of 314 individuals breeding in the Białowieża Forest (E Poland) to infer where they wintered in sub Saharan Africa over a 4-year period from 2009–2012. We used both aspatial and spatially specific assignment techniques involving a previously developed clustering algorithm related to long-term patterns of precipitation (δ2H) and theoretical plant-based isoscapes (δ13C, δ15N) for Africa. We determined that our breeding population was consistently assigned to the forested region of the Congo basin. Males were more depleted in 13C and 2H and more enriched in 15N than females suggesting potential sexual habitat segregation on the wintering grounds. We then similarly examined less extensive samples from Wood Warblers breeding in England, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Karelia (NW Russia), and found a similar assignment to the Congo basin. For all sites, males were isotopically distinct from females suggesting sex-specific habitat segregation on the wintering grounds. Our geospatial assignment model now provides a protocol for testing the hypothesis that declining populations winter more in heavily fragmented forests of west Africa compared to the Congo basin. We encourage this approach for the investigation of migratory connectivity in other sub Saharan Afrotropical migrants.",

We sampled the occupation of cavities and the abundance of hole-nesting birds. We also tested experimentally with tit nest boxes whether the lack of suitable nest-holes may limit the abundance of secondary cavity-nesters. We surveyed hole-nesting birds before and after nest box provision. Trunk and branch cavities (25.9%) were significantly more abundant in mature woods, and are correlated with the density of secondary occupants. Stump and root cavities (74.1%) were more abundant in coppice forests. Shortage of big diameter's (> 45 cm DBH) and good bearing trees explained the lack of cavities in managed forests. Only small proportion of available cavities was used by birds (5.5%). All occupied cavities were placed in trunk (5.5%) and presented smaller diameter entrances than the whole availability of cavities. Nest boxes occupation rate was higher in the plots where suitable nest holes were scarce (managed woods), and consequently it brought an increase on both Great Tit and Blue Tit populations. These two species populations were favoured from the next breeding season after the provision of nest boxes, but not in mature stands nor in control sites (with no nest boxes). Therefore, results show that suitability of cavities rather than availability determines secondary hole-nesting bird abundance in managed forests.",

Observations carried out during twelve seasons (1976–1979,1985–1988, 2002–2005) in deciduous and coniferous old-growth habitats spanned a 30-year period. The present paper examines whether the birds advanced their breeding dates during that time and whether any long-term shifts in fecundity or productivity were detectable. Though temperatures in the settlement period (the second half of April) rose, neither males nor females significantly advanced their dates of arrival. Wood Warblers bred earlier in 2002–2005 than in the two previous periods — the combined effect of earlier female arrival and shortening of post settlement breaks. Clutch size declined with season, was smaller in the coniferous habitat and in rodent outbreak years, but no long-term trend was perceptible. Apart from two exceptionally successful years (2003 and 2004) breeding losses remained high during the whole study. Predation was responsible for 80–95% of them and was concentrated on the nestling stage. Overall Wood Warbler phenology and breeding performance in BNP have changed relatively little during the last 30 years. These findings support the results of other studies demonstrating the remarkable resilience of this primeval forest biota to environmental change.",

Given the negative impact of ectoparasites on nestlings there will be selection on hosts to minimize ectoparasite loads through behavioural defenses. We have addressed the implications of ectoparasitism in three sympatric avian cavity-nesters, namely Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca, Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Nuthatches Sitta europaea, to explore if differences in prevalence and abundance of generalist ectoparasites (blowflies, fleas and mites) can be related to interspecific differences in their nest size, nest composition and cavity microclimate. Furthermore, we have aimed at detecting if interspecific variation in the incidence and intensity of anti-parasite behaviours is a consequence of the abundance of ectoparasites. Differences in nest composition among host species appear not to be the main factor explaining ectoparasite loads, while nest size, breeding phenology, brood size and nest-cavity micro-climate may affect them in different ways for each host-parasite association. Behavioural defenses against parasites are exhibited by all host species but are more intense in the host species with the highest infestation levels (Blue Tits). This study shows different sources of variation in associations between three sympatric avian cavity-nesters and their generalist ectoparasites.",

We censused Tawny Owls Strix aluco and Little Owls Athene noctua in 2005, 2007 and 2009 in a rural landscape in Southern Portugal in order to study the effects of roads and habitat characteristics on Tawny Owl density and Little Owl presence. The presence of both owl species in the 70 census locations was coherent among years. Our results showed that Tawny Owl density near major roads was lower, with the negative effects extending possibly up to 2 km. The probability of Little Owl presence was also negatively affected by the proximity to major roads. The negative effects of roads were significant even considering habitat preferences and spatial autocorrelation, which had the most marked effect on the density or presence of both owls. The reduced occupancy by Tawny Owls and Little Owls of habitats near major roads may be caused by several factors, including increased mortality, disturbance caused by high traffic density, and increased fragmentation. Traffic noise in particular may affect intra-specific communication and hunting efficiency. Consequently, habitat near roads may represent lower-quality territories for owls.",

    "abstract": "Parental investment is a key topic in avian ecology, and many authors have focused on nestling-feeding behaviour to analyse this issue. Surprisingly, most studies have based their results on feeding patterns recorded over periods of only one or two hours, possibly leading to over generalizations regarding temporal-dependent behavioural patterns. Irrespective of nestling age or brood size, if we use observations from such short periods as conclusive evidence we must assume that parents behave consistently across time and that the window of time selected is representative of parental effort. To test this assumption, we analysed the time consistency of nestling provisioning rates and prey composition of 32 breeding pairs of Mediterranean Great Tits Parus major, from dawn to midday (7 hours recording). Regardless of a parallel decrease in the intensity of work for both sexes, we found that hourly provisioning rates per nestling correlated strongly with the mean number of feedings per nestling and per hour recorded over the whole 7 hours of recording. Weather conditions and nestling age had no effect on hourly provisioning rates per nestling, although parents with older nestlings worked relatively less hard. We also observed that the peak of morning activity was higher in nests with small clutches. Prey proportions showed a high degree of temporal repeatability, but nestling diet composition should be studied with caution. Although prey composition was stable over time, we recorded a strong decrease in the number of prey items delivered by parents throughout the day, along with an increase in prey size. We thus recommend using a wider time window to obtain reliable results when studying prey composition. In any case, considering our results, one hour of recording may be sufficient to describe nestling-feeding behaviour of Great Tit parents.",

    "abstract": "Animal constructions represent an extension of the individual phenotype upon which selection may act to create discernable population level patterns. Here we explore global patterns in woodpecker cavity entrance orientation to infer underlying selective forces that shape cavity construction. We performed a comprehensive systematic meta-analysis of woodpecker cavity entrance orientation from 80 populations of 23 species of woodpeckers and other picids throughout the Northern Hemisphere. We show that woodpecker cavity entrance orientation is typically nonrandom, suggesting that selection acts on cavity entrance orientation. The proportion of studies in which significant results were found increased significantly with sample size, and we estimated that more than half of the studies with a sample size of at least 100 showed non-random cavity entrance orientation. Populations occurring at higher latitudes preferred a more southerly orientation, indicating that temperature or something related thereto may be driving cavity entrance orientation. Differences between Eurasia and North America in orientation are consistent with this hypothesis. Taxonomic relationships were not a significant predictor of the strength of orientation and thus unrelated woodpecker populations respond similarly to regional environmental drivers. Our results demonstrate latitudinal and continental patterns that strongly suggest regional climate as a selective force on cavity entrance orientation. Further work utilizing available long-term data sets throughout the world promises to uncover possible fitness consequences of cavity orientation on woodpeckers.",

Although Common Kestrels Falco tinnunculus are defined as partial migrants, their migratory strategies are still not well described. We investigated ringing and re-encounter data of Kestrels marked as nestlings between 1924 and 2011 in Germany. We defined four populations corresponding to the natural regions of Germany. Although both migratory and resident individuals were found independently of sex or age class at the time of recovery, in general, females and juveniles travelled larger distances than males and adults, respectively. We illustrated the initiation of migratory movements in contrast to dispersal by combining distances and directions in two levels (< 100 km and ≥ 100 km), showing that migration is initiated mostly in September/October, while in August movements seem to mostly reflect dispersal. The NAO Index as well as age class, region and re-encounter period (1950–1970, 1971–1990 or > 1990 as indicator of responses to climate change) of birds in autumn and winter were integrated into Generalized Linear Models. We found that in autumn and winter a tendency to migrate is primarily shown by juveniles and it was significantly higher in years before 1971 than in recent decades. In addition, a higher NAO Index in summer is linked with decreased proportion of birds re-encountered far (> 100 km) from their natal sites in winter, whereas a higher NAO Index in autumn is linked with increased proportion of high-distance re-encounters (> 100 km).",

These data supplement earlier observations in the BNP and extend the long-term set of data on the breeding bird numbers there to a 30-year uninterrupted series (1975–2004). Most community parameters, such as the composition of breeding avifauna, the species richness, and the make-up and cumulative share of dominants, have remained basically unchanged. The overall bird density has increased by 8–20% in different plots; in 2001 it reached the highest level within the 30-year study period. The increase was due to parallel increases in numbers of several species, widely differing in their nesting sites, food requirements and migratory habits — during this period 14 of the 26 most numerous species attained their highest numbers in the 30-year study period. Since numbers increased simultaneously in all the plots, the density differences across habitats remained the same, from the highest densities in riverine stands at the forest edge (up to 149 p/10 ha), through oak-hornbeam stands, to the lowest densities in the coniferous stands (54–56 p/10 ha). In most cases the numerical increases could not be attributed to changes in local environmental factors, such as food resources, or to detectable changes in habitat structure. The apparent lack of a relationship between the changes in bird numbers and the local situation suggests that factors acting on a larger scale (beyond the study area) could have been involved. Despite the directional changes in bird abundance observed in the Białowieża Forest, its breeding bird assemblage, when compared with the amplitude of changes recorded over the same period in other areas and habitats, stands out as an example of remarkable stability.",

The pellets were collected from 24 sites in habitats along an urbanization gradient ranging from the large, relatively undisturbed Kampinos Forest (1441 prey items), through small woodlots surrounding Warsaw (686) and into the city of Warsaw (2567). Diet varied due to urbanization: the p ro p o rtio n s of mammals and amphibians were lowest in the city center (respectively 11.3% and 0%), but the proportion of birds, largely I louse Sparrow Passer domestiais increased from 2.9% in the forest to 88.7% in the city. Niche breadth and seasonal variation declined with urbanization. Relationships between diet composition and habitat structure of owl's hunting range in the city, as well as on the seasonal diet variation from owls hunting in forests, let to conclude that the owls were able to exploit locally abundant prey from a variety of habitats. Although the highest densities of Field Mouse Apodeinus agrarius were noted in parks and cemeteries, our data suggest that Tawny Owls catch this species more effectively in small gardens and secondary growth areas. The predation on Field Mouse by a pair of owls breeding in an urban cemetery was low. Approximately 3.2% of the population were removed by the owl predation, considerably less than in a more rural population.",

The Blue Tit broods were heavily infested with Protocalliphora larvae. The abundance of caterpillars as a key food type for the tits was monitored. A random sample of 16 nests was experimentally subjected to an anti-parasite heat treatment, which resulted in a marked decline in the numbers of Protocalliphora larvae. Untreated nests, with high numbers of parasites, were regarded as control nests. Under the anti-parasite treatment, Blue Tit nestlings were fed less frequently than the control nestlings (8 v. 11 food items per hour per nestling). Significant changes in the diet composition occurred, with parasite-free nestlings being consistently fed with fewer caterpillars. An average parasitised nestling was supplied by its parents with 2.6 caterpillars more than an average parasite-free chick. This suggests that in the highly parasitised control nests, the parent tits made an effort to compensate for the detrimental effects caused by Protocalliphora larvae. Feeding rate and food composition were shown to influence chick condition and survival in the nest. In spite of these facts, the nestlings in parasitised nests developed less rapidly and had lower survival rates than in the anti-parasitically heat-treated nests. The parasitic Protocalliphora larvae have a double effect on their avian host: they adversely affect nestling performance, and they compel adult tits to work harder in order to at least partially compensate for that influence.",

Moreover, the \"differential allocation hypothesis\" predicts that an individual's investment in parental behaviours, such as nest building, will vary in relation to the partner's quality. These hypotheses were examined in the socially monogamous, hole-breeding Blue Tit, a species in which the female alone builds nests. Parental quality was quantified by recording body size, feather mite load and age. The weight of nests was found to correlate positively with female head-bill length and feather mite load, but not with any indicators of male quality. This result is in accordance with the \"sexual display\" hypothesis, and demonstrates that nest size could be a form of intra-specific communication that helps inform the non-building partner of the builder's reproductive quality.",

We suggested that non-lethal effects may also be very important for a complete understanding of prey-predator interactions. Among many influencing factors predation is important because it affects survival probability, especially in winter, which is a critical period for many passerines living in temperate zones. Apart from killing prey, predators may also have an indirect influence on the choice of nocturnal resting sites. Therefore, small passerines should detect and avoid places where a predator has operated previously. We tested this prediction using data on wintering small passerines, mainly on Great Tits. The study was performed during the winter season of 2005/2006 in western Poland. In the experiment, we put fur and mangled feathers in half of 100 randomly selected nest boxes. Boxes were checked every ten days, from January-March. The birds showed a significantly stronger preference towards \"clean\" nest boxes (without predator traces). It seems that non-lethal predator influence modifies winter dispersion of birds and wintering passerines may detect, by visual signals left behind, nest boxes where predation has previously occurred.",

    "abstract": "Predation is considered an important factor affecting the life histories and breeding strategies of hole nesting birds. Breeding losses in this group of birds are related to such nest site characteristics as entrance size, nest site depth and danger distance - the distance between the outer edge of the entrance to the centre of the nest's bottom, which determines how far a predator unable to enter the hole would have to reach to obtain its contents. It is suggested that birds assess predation risk and adjust their breeding investments accordingly. We tested the hypothesis that in shallow nest sites, birds build smaller nests to maintain the largest danger distance possible. During the experiment, two types of nestboxes were available to birds: those typical for small passerines (with a depth of 21 cm), and shallower ones (with a 16 cm depth). Breeding parameters were obtained by controlling nestboxes, the distances between eggs and entrances were measured, and nests were weighed just after the young fledged. Breeding phenology and clutch size did not differ between the types of nestboxes. Nest site depth influenced nest mass, and according to our assumptions, nests were significantly lighter in shallow nestboxes. A clear, negative relationship was found between nest mass and the danger distance — eggs in larger (heavier) nests were closer to the entrance. Breeding success (number of fledglings per eggs laid) was lower for shallow nestboxes compared to normal ones, and nest mass negatively influenced the number of fledglings and breeding success. The results of this study suggest that Great Tits perceive nest site depth and adjust nest building according to predation risks. Nest size (mass) in shallow sites may be limited by the danger distance, but it is also possible that the number of trips with nest material, which could lead to the detection of the site, is also important. However, both explanations are not mutually exclusive, and both are related to avoiding predator pressure.",

However, decision to leave brings advantages for maintaining own body condition, but also disadvantages for further reproduction. We studied individual variability in fidelity to roost sites during two winters. The kestrel males in České Budějovice (Southern Bohemia) roost near their breeding sites for most of the winter. Individuals occupy the same roost site continuously, unless they temporarily leave the city. We collected pellets at the males' roost sites from November to April in 1996/1997 and 1997/1998. We analysed the factors that affect males' presence (proportion of days with snow cover — PSC, snow depth and mean temperature). There were fewer absences, overall, in 1997/1998 than in 1996/1997, probably due to milder weather conditions, and better prey availability. Individuals responded differently to periods of snow cover; some males left the city but others remained. Males that remained had a higher proportion of non-vole prey (birds, insectivors and insects) in their diet compared to those that left. Moreover, the proportion of birds in diet was positively correlated with PSC in males that stayed at roost sites during the period with snow cover. We suggest that males able to feed on birds during snow cover could remain in the city in harsh winters, and this would give them an advantage during competition for breeding sites in the following spring.",

We tested the dynamic risk assessment hypothesis, that is, whether Blackbirds adjust their nest defense to the distance of a predator, Black-billed Magpie Pica pica, from their nest. Responses to a magpie dummy and a Rock Pigeon Columba livia dummy were investigated during the breeding period in an urban environment. The dummies were presented at two different distances, near (1.5 m) and far (6–7 m) from the nest. We also tested the relationship between the sex of a parent and the intensity of mobbing in nest defense. The intensity of mobbing reaction in either parent was highest for the magpie dummy near the nest, although the males showed higher overall intensity than females. When the magpie dummy was far from the nest, the birds preferred hiding in vegetation to mobbing. The highest intensity of vocalization was induced by the magpie dummy near the nest and the lowest by the pigeon dummy. Both parents used \"chink\" calls more frequently with the magpie dummy near the nest compared to the dummy far from the nest. The \"seee\" calls were used mostly in response to a distant magpie dummy. The reaction to a pigeon dummy was generally weak, which shows that the birds clearly discriminated between the dummies of the predatory magpie and the harmless pigeon.",

    "abstract": "Species distribution patterns are determined not only by habitat preferences but also by biotic factors. Particularly, the presence of conspecifics may yield different types of benefits and costs for the individuals involved. This study analyses the spatial distribution of Little Bustard families during the breeding season in relation to the distribution of male core areas in three Spanish populations of the species. A compositional analysis is used to evaluate habitat selection and the habitat types most preferred by females with offspring. Spatial analyses were performed to evaluate the proximity of Little Bustard families to male core areas and male displaying sites. The habitat selection pattern was similar between regions, with semi-permanent vegetation and stubbles as most preferred habitats while others, such as ploughed land, were avoided. Families were located closer to male core areas than expected by chance and were spatially associated to male displaying sites. Little Bustard females may obtain different benefits from this spatial association such as access to more food resources and chances for second matings after a clutch loss. Also in stubbles, the capture of prey by chicks would be easier and semi-permanent habitats would serve as shelter. These results highlight the importance of intraspecific interactions in the definition of the habitat selection pattern of females and families. This study shows how spatial point pattern analysis may be a useful tool for integrating landscape and behavioural ecology.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria may colonize avian nests with unknown repercussions on nestling growth and health, although bacteria on nest materials may easily colonize nestling skin and growing feathers. Cavity nesters may have to build their nests on top of used nest materials, given restrictions on cavity availability. Nest reuse may favour bacterial colonization of nest materials and nestling skin and thereby affect nestling feather growth. To test these possibilities, we conducted a study of Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca breeding in nest-boxes in central Spain. We left a sample of nest-boxes without removing old nest materials in 2010 and compared bacterial loads of nest materials, control inert objects and nestling belly skin in reused nests with those in new nests in 2011. Nestlings raised in reused nests had higher bacterial loads on their belly skin than those in new nests, while no difference between nest types for nest materials and control inert objects were found. There was a marginally significant tendency for wing length before fledging to be lower in reused nests, but no trend for mass or tarsus length. The bacterial loads of nests showed a negative association with feather growth of nestlings as expressed through wing length but not with tarsus length or mass growth. These results indicate an association between nest reuse and bacterial growth on nestling skin not hitherto detected. They also suggest a possible impairment of flight capacity at fledging mediated by nest bacterial communities which are in direct contact with nestling skin and growing feathers.",

    "abstract": "Populations of House and Tree Sparrows have rapidly declined in various breeding habitats throughout their European distribution range; however, the strongest decline was recorded within urban environments. In our study we investigated fine-scale distribution, population densities and habitat selection of both sparrow species within a 200 × 200 m squares in a medium sized city (České Budějovice, Czech Republic) during the breeding season. The total population density of House and Tree Sparrow was 11.7 and 2.8 individuals/10 ha; however the densities of both sparrow species markedly differed among various urban units. The highest density of House Sparrow was recorded in residential areas (33.3 ind./10 ha) and Tree Sparrows were mostly found in garden colonies (10.3 ind./10 ha). After removing spatial effects, we found that numbers of both sparrows were negatively correlated with area of artificial surfaces (e.g. pavements, streets, railway networks or parking spaces) and positively correlated with area of city green. Built-up area did not affect numbers of House Sparrow, but there was a slight negative relationship with Tree Sparrow numbers. However, maximum numbers per square for both species were found in the areas where city green represented ca 50 % of all habitats. This suggests that mix of built-up areas and city green is more important for sparrow numbers than each habitat per se. Comparison of use/availability for studied habitat reveals that both sparrow species clearly avoided artificial surfaces. House Sparrow showed preference for built-up areas and Tree Sparrow showed similar preference for built-up areas and city green. Different habitat selection can be explained by a combination of different requirements for nest sites together with the nutritional needs of sparrows during the breeding season. The majority of nest sites were located in artificial structures such as roof tiles (80% for House Sparrow and 50% for Tree Sparrow), followed by nests located in crevices and holes on buildings. Both sparrows nested in older buildings: 92% of House Sparrow and 85% of Tree Sparrow nests were situated in buildings older than 30 years, i.e. built before the 1980s.",

This study used a novel technique to investigate the role of air-gaps between component materials of the nest wall on the insulatory properties of the whole nest. Nests of four passerine species were investigated by measuring the rate of warming of a temperature logger within the wall materials before and after vacuum-packing, which removed the air and compressed the nest. After vaccum-packing nest volume was estimated to have decreased by 90% and the measured insulatory values decreased by an average of 20% irrespective of the nest materials. Nest maintenance behaviors that may serve to ensure that air-gaps are maintained within the nest wall, which perhaps maximises its insulatory properties, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Permanent changes in the surrounding environment cause long-term stress in birds, which, when lasting days or weeks, affects the activity of the immune system and increases susceptibility to diseases, leading to changes in the levels of haematological parameters. The heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (H:L-ratio) is generally considered an independent and robust indicator of stress level in birds. This parameter allows in a simple way to evaluate activity of the immune system and individual health state of adult and nestling birds. It also enables assessing a body response to short- and long-term stress induced by, among others, the surrounding environment, social stress, blood parasites or a greater energy expenditure of females during breeding. Under conditions of field work the determination of the H:L-ratio is not difficult because what is only needed to conduct a blood smear test is a drop of blood that can be easily obtained even from birds of a small body mass. Moreover, an increase in the H:L-ratio is observed after about an hour from the moment of catching a bird contrary to other measurements like the determination of a baseline level of corticosterone.In this article available literature that discusses the impact of various factors on the H:L-ratio in the Great Tit as a species of 'fast-paced' life is reviewed. In adult and nestling birds the H:L-ratio is influenced by various factors — ecological and ecophysiological ones. In some cases the same factor, e.g. brood size manipulation or a type of habitat, can significantly influence the level of the discussed stress indicator as well as it may not show any impact at all. While interpreting the H:L-ratio one must take into account an impact of various ecological and ecophysiological factors on health state, such as habitat, phase of the annual cycle, differences between brood attempts, sex, age as well as on relations with other indicators of condition e.g. body mass or total blood haemoglobin concentration.",

The riparian mixed forest had the greatest number of species and individuals of hole-nesting birds, while the spruce-fir forest had the lowest numbers. Excavating bird species preferred larger, deciduous trees, and snags. Non-excavators did not select holes according to tree species or size, but preferred holes in living trees and branch holes. In view of the low occupancy of holes among the four habitats, we suggest that the density of secondary hole-nesting birds is not limited by availability of holes in the study area.",

Broods with three nestlings made up the highest proportion, c. 41.7–44.6 % of all the nests occupied by pairs. The average number of nestlings in nests with fledged young was lowest in 1997 (2.53); in 1994–1996 it had been significantly higher (2.84–3.06). Pairs with nests sited up to 100 m from the nearest wet meadows in the river valley have a higher average breeding success in comparison with the pairs whose nests are sited farther away. The White Stork population tended to inhabit the area near the edge of the river valley. In the nesting territories (an area of 1 km radius around the nest site) cereal crops, meadows, green crops, pastures and wet meadows constituted the greatest proportion of the habitat structure. The proportions of these habitat types varied significantly between the nests. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of nestlings raised and the proportion of wet meadows, peat bogs and water bodies in the nesting territories.",

In wild Bearded Vultures, first-time-paired and territorial individuals were recorded when they were 6.5 years old, on average. The mean age of first breeding was 8.1 years, whereas the mean age of first successful breeding was 11.4. Paired females were recorded at the age of 6.5 years and breeding at 6, whereas the youngest recorded paired males were 6.4 years old and breeding at 7. 39.5% of the marked birds alive over 6 years were recorded as not yet territorial, suggesting the existence of a substantial fraction of adult floaters without breeding territories. Pyrenean Bearded Vultures are characterized by delayed reproduction, with the first breeding attempt taking place well after the acquisition of full adult plumage. We discuss whether deferred breeding in this increasing population could be explained by the increase in density and/or mortality rate in the younger age groups, which could affect the age of maturity.",

    "abstract": "The hunting ranges of 34 male urban Kestrels were studied in a small city (40 km2) in S Bohemia (Czech Republic). It was assumed that males from the city center and periphery hunt for voles mainly on the city's outskirts. The “city-center” males are unable to defend their hunting ranges on the periphery because of aggression on the part of the “periphery” Kestrels. To counter this, they may either 1) invade the hunting ranges of periphery males or 2) establish their own exclusive hunting ranges. Our data supported the first suggestion. Hunting range size varied greatly, from 0.8 to 25.0 km2 (7.2 ± 6.9 km2), with large overlaps of between 0.3% and 51.4% (12.5 ± 11.6%). The ranges of city-center males were several times larger than those of the periphery males, and greatly overlapped the ranges of other city center and periphery males. Overlapping of the hunting ranges of periphery males was less extensive. The higher energy costs in terms of flying to distant suitable hunting areas and frequent changes of hunting grounds should decrease the preference for nesting in the city center. Therefore, we suggest that Kestrels derive other advantages from living in the city center (e.g., the high quality of nest sites). Cohabitation, whereby city center males invade the hunting grounds of periphery males, appears to be a more effective strategy than partitioning.",

Three different colonies of White Storks were studied in northern Algeria over a three-year period (2002–2004) that was characterised by considerable variation in both food availability and precipitation. This study demonstrated that an extra food supply during the pre-laying period had a positive effect on clutch size — nests with extra food had larger clutches. There was also an advance in laying date and a greater hatching success in nests with access to extra food. In addition to food supply, clutch size was independently affected by the year, which could have been due to differences in rainfall. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that extra food during the incubation period could help the parent birds resolve the conflict between incubation behaviour and minimizing the time off the nest, i.e. increasing nest attentiveness in nests with extra food and enhancing hatching success.",

Shrikes captured smaller lizards than kestrels during all seasons (mean snout - vent length (SVL): 7.4 ±1.9 vs. 9.4 ± 2.1 cm respectively), presenting a sequential use of lizard sizes and avoiding potential competition. On the other hand, shrikes and kestrels showed the same seasonal variation pattern, capturing the largest lizards during their breeding periods (spring). Considering lizard availability, shrikes displayed less selective predation than kestrels in all seasons. Shrikes positively selected the medium lizard size (SVL: 5–10 cm) during the nestling period, but negatively selected the small lizard size (SVL: < 5 cm) in autumn and winter, probably due to an explosion of juvenile lizards. Lastly, kestrels appeared to be more selective, negatively choosing the small lizard size but positively selecting the largest ones all the year round (SVL: > 10 cm).",

This research found that the two study areas, representing two habitat types — a mature deciduous forest and a human-disturbed parkland — are inhabited by different snail assemblages: both species richness and density are much higher in the parkland than in the forest. This means that less calcium is available to female tits in the forest than in the parkland, which could result in calcium limitation in the former habitat. Egg size traits, i.e. volume, length and breadth, in the Blue Tit show a consistent long-term pattern of variation that reflects the pattern of calcium availability: egg trait values are higher in the parkland than in the woodland. No habitat-related variation in egg size traits was found in the Great Tits. We suggest that the lack of a relation between Great Tit egg characteristics and snail availability results from the higher ecological plasticity of this species in comparison with the Blue Tit, including its ability to exploit alternative sources of calcium.",

We investigated these effects on the nocturnal bird species occurring in the study area (Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, Red-necked Nightjar Caprimulgus ruflcollis, Barn Owl Tyto alba, Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops, Little Owl Athene noctua, Tawny Owl Strix aluco, Long-eared Owl Asio otus, Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus and Eagle Owl Bubo bubo) across an agricultural-natural habitat mosaic in Central Spain for three consecutive years. Shares of vineyards, scrubland, herbaceous cropland, water bodies, and roads significantly affected the composition of the nocturnal bird community. Herbaceous cropland and olive groves, which covered 50% of the study area, proved to be neutral for all species. Remnant patches of natural and semi-natural scrubland (around 10% of the study area) and water bodies (only 1.5% of the study area) showed a positive effect on Eagle Owls, Eurasian Scops Owls, Long-eared Owls, and Red-necked Nightjars. Vineyard (35% of the study area) had a negative influence on Eagle Owls, Long-eared Owls, and Eurasian Scops Owls. Our results indicate, first, that the relative extent of land use types was apparently not related with the presence of nocturnal bird species and, second, that natural scrublands and water bodies are key habitats for assuring the persistence of nocturnal birds in agricultural Mediterranean landscapes. Current land planning focused toward land use intensification will likely increase the areas of habitats that are neutral or have adverse effects on nocturnal birds.",

    "abstract": "Amount of food supplied to nestlings by their parents is considered to affect the development of nestling physiological condition. In this study we supplied parental Great Tits Parus major with extra food, larvae of Tenebrio molitor, put into feeders close to nest-boxes, assuming that this should facilitate parental care and, as a consequence, nestling nutrition. The following nestling characteristics measured 13 days after hatching were analysed: body mass, haematocrit, blood concentrations of haemoglobin, glucose and triglycerides, heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (H/L), and patagium swelling after PHA injection. Nestlings from extra food broods were significantly heavier than control ones. They also had lower H/L, which indicated lower stress. No other variable was significantly affected by the experiment. Possibly, the rainy weather and non-restrictive natural trophic conditions during the experiment caused weakening of the net benefits from extra food.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization is the most dynamic phenomenon worldwide and many species colonize urban environment. Some of these species became so abundant in towns and cities that they are regarded pests, are human health hazard, causes damage to buildings and affect other urban species. Therefore, it is important to understand how such successful colonizers utilize urban environment and which factors affects their population densities. One of such species is the most common urban pest bird in the world, the Feral Pigeon Columba livia var. domestica. The aim of this study was to investigate how local food resources and the composition of the urban landscape affects densities of Feral Pigeon in the city of Poznań (Western Poland). Three counts were made in summer 2010 in 60 0.5 km × 0.5 km plots (25 ha) distributed randomly across residential areas in the city. The density of pigeons showed significant spatial autocorrelation, both positive and negative one. The density of pigeons was highest in plots with more tall buildings (over four floors), a large number of human-related food resources, schools, and a high proportion of green space. The density of pigeons was lower in plots with a higher density of streets and located further from the city centre. The solution to the pigeon problem appears to be to plan residential areas with low-rise buildings. To control the number of pigeons in urban areas, we suggest preventing access to local food resources by using litter-bins that are inaccessible to animals. The public should also be educated to behave appropriately towards pigeons and refrain from feeding them intentionally.",

I used 18-year data from Estonia, north-eastern Europe, in order to analyse the comparative effects of these factors on the breeding performance and nestling sex ratio in the Lesser Spotted Eagle. All studied reproductive parameters showed strong inter-annual fluctuations but no significant trends. Breeding frequency (proportion of pairs laying) was positively influenced by a warm pre-laying period (temperature in April) and a wet preceding season. These factors are probably associated with the higher occurrence and activity of amphibians that constituted important prey of the Lesser Spotted Eagle in spring. Breeding success (proportion of successful breeders) was determined mostly by the abundance of voles. Productivity (number of fledglings per nest) depended additively both on the spring temperature and abundance of voles in the breeding season; fledging of two nestlings was recorded regularly, mostly in years with high vole abundance. The total offspring sex ratio was slightly, though non-significantly, female-biased. Annual proportion of female nestlings was positively correlated with reproductive parameters and associated with rain in the preceding season, suggesting determination of fledgling sex ratio prior egg-laying. The results help to explain fluctuations in the reproductive performance of the Lesser Spotted Eagle and should be taken into account when monitoring and managing for conservation of this species.",

Over the years 2006–2011, we investigated the breeding ecology of three coexisting thrush species Turdus spp. in the urban habitats of the town of Bardejov (NE Slovakia). We studied nest distribution, nest predation in relation to nest placement and the breeding success of the Common Blackbird T. merula, Fieldfare T. pilaris and Song Thrush T. philomelos. The study species differed significantly in terms of microhabitat characteristics and vertical spatial distribution, expressed as the nest location height (Blackbird < Song Thrush < Fieldfare), the distance from the town centre (Fieldfare < Song Thrush < Blackbird), the distance from the nest tree to human paths and buildings (Blackbird < Song Thrush < Fieldfare) and the average distance between breeding conspecific pairs (Fieldfare < Blackbird < Song Thrush). We also found significant differences in nesting microhabitats (conifers, deciduous trees and shrubs) usage (breeding in conifers: Song Thrush < Blackbird < Fieldfare). On the other hand, no significant differences were found in breeding success and predation between species. A major factor affecting the predation rate was the distance between nests and the distance to human paths and buildings, and with Fieldfares and Common Blackbirds also the height of trees and the distance to the town centre. Our results suggest that ecological segregation among closely related species can also be common in a changed, urban environment.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, agricultural intensification and landscape simplification have dramatically affected farmland biodiversity. To reduce this trend, agri-environmental schemes (AES) of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) were launched in the European Union in the early 1990s. Since then an effort has been made to asses the effectiveness of these measures, but, in the Mediterranean region, where olive groves are among the predominant crops, the effectiveness of AESs to maintain farmland biodiversity remains poorly evaluated. In conventional olive farming, the only AES now in practice are the implementation of herbaceous, non-crop vegetation within crops (i.e. ground covers) aimed at preventing soil erosion, and the maintenance of hedges. These practices, when applied separately, can increase structural complexity, likely benefitting farmland biodiversity at different spatial scales; however, little is known about the potential synergistic effects when these measures are applied in combination in Mediterranean agroecosystems. This study assessed the combined effects of herbaceous ground cover and hedges on passerine communities of olive groves over a 4-yr period. Hedges, and to a lesser extent ground covers, efficiently increased the abundance and richness of passerine communities of olive groves, particularly that of insectivorous birds, but the effects of both measures were independent of each other. Hedges were particularly relevant to the richness and abundance of passerine communities, especially at distances up to 50 m. Therefore, we suggest that management should promote the creation of a hedge network embedded in the olive grove matrix, for example by promoting or maintaining hedgerows located between properties. This study underscores the important role of increasing structural complexity in Mediterranean perennial agroecosystems through the implementation of ground covers and maintaining hedges, to preserve farmland passerine communities, and encourages the use of these agri-environmental measures as a tool in landscape planning and conservation.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal distance and burial mode of acorns are two of the most important characteristics in renewal processes of oaks that result from the food hoarding ecology of the Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius. To obtain the dispersal distance and to locate precisely the caches with scattered acorns we used radio-tracked transmitters with flexible 13 cm long sticking out antennae injected into drilled acorns. From mid-September to mid-October acorns of Pedunculate Oak Quercus robur with transmitters were mixed with untagged acorns and exhibited on five feeders distributed from each other at a distance of at least 1.3 km (max. 3.8). We obtained information on 121 tagged acorns scattered by Jays in two consecutive years (2014 — 42 records, 2015 — 79 records). For both seasons, mean dispersal distance was 115.7 metres (SE = 9.2). The maximum detected distance was 456 m, the minimum was 3 m. Most of the acorns (52.6%) were deposited by Jays up to 100 m from the source. Dispersal distance differed significantly between the two years of research and between feeders. Mean dispersal distance was much higher in 2014 (166 m, N = 42) than in 2015 (86 m, N = 72) and differed between seasons while the seed crop was similar and low. Only four acorns (3.5%) were found on the litter with no signs of hiding, which suggests accidental loss during transport (dyszoochory). Most of the cached acorns (44.6%) were deposited in the Scots Pine Pinus silvestris litter or moss cushions no deeper than 0.5 cm. The additional covering of caches with pieces of bark or leaves were noted accidentally in nine cases (9.8%).",

Heated chicks were lighter than control and cooled chicks. Estimated survival of heated fledglings was lower than that of controls. Additionally, survival of control fledglings increased with size, but this relationship was reversed for heated fledglings. Our results suggest that high temperatures experienced in the nest could have negative consequences on immediate post-fledging survival, and that smaller nestlings may deal more effectively with temperatures surpassing their optimal thermal range.",

We present recent (2015–2019) data on abundance of birds for the seven study plots and pool them with the time series collected since 1975. The numbers of individual bird species strongly fluctuated, with most of the species showing alternating phases (the initial periods of population growth followed by the periods of population decline or stability). The numbers of 19 species increased; maximum growths by c. 3–5% per year included Columba palumbus, Dendrocopos major, Sylvia atricapilla and Regulus ignicapilla. Among a few declining species, Ficedula hypoleuca, Phylloscopus sibilatrix and F. parva experienced the strongest declines, respectively by 4.0%, 2.7% and 2.2% per year. Mostly the same species bred in the plots in the 1970s and in recent years, indicating a stable species pool. The total abundance peaked around 2005, declining thereafter in deciduous stands, but increasing further (along with the species richness) in the coniferous stands. The similarity index between the study plots (beta-diversity) changed little over 45 years; ash-alder and lime-hornbeam stands remained most similar, while coniferous forests stood more apart. The changes found in the old-growth stands of BNP (mostly coniferous fragments) could be partly explained by natural modification of the habitat structure and the processes acting in the large geographical scales, within or outside of the breeding grounds. The long-term studies such as the one in the BNP reported here, provide a basis for the rates of natural turnover in the bird communities in pristine habitats, directly unaffected by human impact.",

    "abstract": "Bycatch, the unintended capture of animals other than target fish, is one of the most important anthropogenic threats to seabirds worldwide. This problem has been relatively little studied, however. The southern Baltic Sea is one of the three areas worldwide with the highest gillnet bycatch. Forty-eight publications from the years 1982–2021 addressing the problem of seabird bycatch in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone (PEEZ) of the Baltic Sea were analysed for the purposes of this paper. Twenty-eight bird species were identified in bycatch, 13 of which have threatened or near-threatened status on the European Red Bird List. The magnitude of the annual bycatch was estimated for three periods: 1970s — 47,000 birds, 1980s and 1990s — 39,800 and 2010s — 21,300 birds. The most frequently bycaught species in the 2010s were Long-tailed Duck Clangula hyemalis (9,000 ind. yearly), Greater Scaup Aythya marila (3,500) and Velvet Scoter Melanitta fusca (2,000). Acceptable mortality thresholds calculated using both the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) and the BirdLife International (BLT) methods were found to have been exceeded: for Long-tailed Duck by 175% (PBR) and by 1,061% (BLT); for Greater Scaup by 542% (PBR) and by 3,400% (BLT); for Velvet Scoter by 35% (PBR) and by 495% (BLT). All three species are listed as Vulnerable in Europe. Six distinct bycatch areas have been identified in the PEEZ. Bycatch mitigation is exceedingly difficult to implement: the only effective method currently employed to protect seabirds from bycatch in gillnets involves the temporary closure of bird hotspots to gillnet fishing.",

    "abstract": "Shorebirds show large interspecific variation in the relative size of the stomach, and especially of the muscular part, the gizzard. Much of this variation can be explained by their diet. Species feeding mainly on hard-shelled prey such as bivalves and gastropods have large stomachs; those feeding on soft-bodied prey such as worms have small stomachs. Within a species, diet- and migration-induced changes in stomach size can occur. Our studies on this intraspecific variation have focused on two mollusc-specialists, the Red Knot Calidris canutus and the Great Knot C. tenuirostris. Both are renowned for long-range flights between their arctic or sub-arctic alpine breeding grounds and a variety of coastal wetlands. Feeding mainly on shellfish ingested whole, both knot species have large stomachs, but changing diets easily lead to apparently adaptive modifications. In addition, the demands imposed by flights of many thousand kilometres may induce reductions in stomach size. Using ultrasonography we have begun to experimentally disentangle the causal relationships between diet, season and stomach size in Red Knots. A soft diet can induce stomach reductions of 50% within a week, and such changes are reversible. Studies on radiomarked birds in the Wadden Sea emphasize that variations in stomach size are correlated with prey and patch choice in the field.",

The secondary-cavity-nester Collared Flycatcher constitutes migratory single-brooded population breeding in high density in the primeval oak-lime-hornbeam (Querco/TillioCarpinetum) stands. Nest predation was the main reason of the breeding losses (240 nests) accounting for 91% (82%–100%) of them. Local production of fledglings was affected by nest predation caused by rodents, mustelids and Great Spotted Woodpecker. In this study a link between forest rodent cycles and the Collared Flycatcher fluctuations in number was documented. Number of produced fledglings depended on both, positively the number of the Collared Flycatcher breeding pairs in year N and negatively on the Yellow-necked Mouse density in year N. Rate of nest destruction is related to the density of the Yellow-necked Mouse recorded in BNP, while independent on the Collared Flycatcher density (nest predation limiting but not regulating). The predation pressure in some years keeps the Collared Flycatcher density at a level well below that of the potential the habitat resources (nest-sites, food). Local breeding density was shaped by fledglings productivity (breeding success) of the previous year. Earlier hypotheses concerning the Collared Flycatcher and other birds population limitation were also discussed.",

Great Spotted Woodpeckers preferred oaks as nest sites, but Middle Spotted Woodpeckers selected dead trees as well as live ashes and oaks. It was found that the degree of silviculture did not affect the preference for tree species between long-term protected and managed areas in either Dendrocopos species. However, the share of ashes as nesting trees for Middle Spotted Woodpeckers was distinctly smaller in managed stands. In primeval Quercus-Fraxinus-Ulmus riverine forests ashes are thought to have played an important role as a nest-site for this species. In unmanaged forests both woodpeckers nested in trees of a larger diameter, at a nearly twofold higher rate than in managed stands. Nest-height was influenced by tree diameter. However, these relationships varied between the two woodpecker species, in relation both to the type of management and to the tree species, and were the most pronounced in Middle Spotted Woodpeckers nesting in ashes in near-natural stands. The type of management did not affect the placements of nest-holes in relation to tree condition, state of tree stump and condition of the wood in either species. However, in comparison to the near-natural forests, both species excavated holes more frequently than expected in tree-trunks in the managed stands. The results of the present work suggest a convergence of some nest-site characteristics in managed forests.",

The study was carried out in the years 1995–2001 in the Tarnów region (1400 km2, S Poland). All bird species were classified according to broadly defined breeding habitat type. Four main, easily distinguishable habitat types were specified: forests (18% of the area), open areas (70%), wetlands (1%) and anthropogenic areas (11%). Birds were classified as habitat specialists if they bred in only one habitat type, or as habitat generalists, if they bred in two or more habitat types. Altogether, 151 species nested in the study area, and a total of 87 species were habitat specialists. There were statistically more endangered species (so called \"losers\") among the habitat specialists than in the habitat generalists' group. Habitat specialists were also statistically less abundant than habitat generalists. The following numbers of species were recorded in the specific habitats: forests — 70, open areas — 75, wetlands — 61, anthropogenic areas — 46. Among these, the percentages of habitat specialists were the following: forests — 41.4%, open areas — 18.7%, wetlands — 52.5%, anthropogenic areas — 26.1%. It was found that the numbers of species inhabiting the various habitat types differed from the number to be expected on the basis of their area. This was especially apparent in the case of wetlands, which constituted only a small part of the total area, but as many as 32 species (21.1% of all) occurred only there. For conservation purposes, wetlands appear to play the most important role in shaping species richness in the landscape studied here. However, each habitat type contained some species that were not noted in other habitats.",

Data were collected during the breeding seasons 1999–2001. In the end of April 2000, the whole BNP was systematically searched; playbacks of drumming were used to enhance detection of birds. Presence/absence of Three-toed Woodpeckers and of dead wood (standing and downed Norway spruces and snags of other trees) were recorded within each forest sub-compartments (ca. 28 ha). Data from censuses done in smaller plots in 1975–1999 showed that in the primeval forest the woodpeckers bred twice more frequently in swampy and coniferous forests than in the oak-hornbeam habitat. These preferred habitat types covered larger areas in the logged fragment than in the primeval part (66% vs. 41%). Yet despite this, Three-toed Woodpeckers were recorded there over twice less frequently (14% of 176 sub-compartments) than in the primeval (36% of 164 sub-compartments) part. These differences followed sharp contrasts in the dead wood availability; all but one sub-compartments in the primeval fragment contained some form of dead wood, whereas dead spruces were missing in almost 30% of sub-compartments in the logged part. This was the effect of continuous “sanitary” logging, purposeful removal of dying and dead spruces from the Forest. To restore Three-toed Woodpecker habitats it is necessary to ban removal of dead spruces in the managed part of BNP. However, the BNP area is too small, to assure the long-term survival of the Białowieża Forest population. To achieve this, it is necessary to resign from removal of dying and dead spruces in the whole Polish part of the Białowieża Forest (600 km2). This would create breeding habitat for a maximum 260–320 pairs.",

From among 1526 Buzzards, 1293 were recorded in winter months (November—February) and 233 in March. Birds were non-randomly distributed on nine vegetation types met along the transect route. Permanent papilionaceous crops, along with cereal stubbles, margin habitats, meadows and maize stubbles were preferentially used, whereas bare tillage and winter cereals were avoided. In general, Buzzards preferred habitats of the least amount in the studied area and avoided those which dominated. These data support the idea of high importance of small landscape structures for the biodiversity protection in intensively used farmland. During winter months, most Buzzards (59.5%) were perched when first sighted, most often on trees and in the middle part of their height. The percent of birds sitting on the ground amounted to 34.7%. The smallest amount of individuals (5.8% ) was observed flying (flap-sailing, hovering and soaring), however this activity significantly increased in March (up to 17.1%). The significance of various hunting methods for wintering Buzzards is discussed. Even though it is a typical perch hunting raptor, the method of hunting from the ground seems to be particularly suitable for the conditions of winter farmland: common scarcity of perches, poor and low vegetation, local and temporary prey concentrations.",

The accuracy of the measurements of these blood parameters was also assessed. Measurement error reflected essentially sample and time of storage rather than assay effects. Hematocrit and haemoglobin had low repeatabilities within Spring, ranging from 0.26 to 0.31; Heterophil/Lymphocyte ratio (H/L), white blood cell count (WBC), total plasma cholinesterase and red blood cell glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities had moderate to high repeatabilities over periods of 45 days (repeatabilities ranged from 0.47 to 0.81 for GSH-Px and H/L, respectively), but also during longer periods such as during Spring (total plasma cholinesterase activity) and Autumn/Winter (WBC, H/L and GSH-Px). Of the blood parameters measured, total plasma cholinesterase, glutathione peroxidase and the haematological parameters WBC and H/L seem relatively constant and therefore reliable indicators of Great Tit's physiological condition within, at least, a 45 days time frame.",

    "abstract": "The accession of Hungary to the European Union is likely to result in the intensification of arable crop cultivation. As a result of market forces and rural development measures, small parcels of land will be consolidated into larger fields. It is also likely that the area of maize and oilseed rape, and to a lesser extent that of sunflower, will increase at the expense of cereals. Abandoned land, ineligible for area payments will probably not return to cultivation. To identify the potential impact of these changes on the populations of common farmland birds, we analysed the data from 680 homogeneous sample plots of the Hungarian Common Bird Monitoring Scheme (MMM) from 2003. We used pair-wise comparisons with the Mann-Whitney test to identify the difference in the index of abundance of 34 species amongst the following categories of crops: abandoned versus cultivated arable land, small parcels versus large fields, cereals versus maize, sunflower and oilseed rape, fallow land versus small or large fields. Our results suggest that land consolidation will have the most serious negative impact on common farmland bird populations because small-scale farming systems hold significantly larger numbers of seven common farmland bird species, — White Stork Ciconia ciconia, Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, Wood Pigeon Columba palumbus, Whinchat Saxicola rubetra, Stonechat Saxicola torquatus, Tree Sparrow Passer montanus, Greenfinch Carduelis chloris, — than large-scale farms. On the other hand, the compulsory setaside might present some opportunities for the compensation of these negative effects if biodiversity considerations are integrated into the national rules, because fallow land held significantly higher densities of nine species, — Linnet Carduelis cannabina, White Stork, Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, Grasshopper Warbler Locustella naevia, Woodlark Lullula arborea, Whinchat, Stonechat, Whitethroat Sylvia communis and Blackbird Turdus merula, — than large crop fields. Comparison of large-scale cereal fields with large-scale maize, sunflower or oilseed rape fields, respectively, revealed significant differences only in the case of a few species, for example, the greater abundance of Skylarks Alauda arvensis in cereal than in maize, of Lapwings in sunflower and of Whinchat in oilseed rape than in cereal fields.",

Oxidative stress and antioxidant defences may be expressed through melanin-based plumage traits. Male Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca exhibit eumelanic dorsal plumage and white feather patches on forehead and wing feathers. Although these traits have been related to sexual selection in some populations, no physiological correlate of variation in these characters has been previously shown. Here we test if these plumage traits are related to plasma oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity. We captured males while feeding nestlings in a population breeding at high altitude (1200–1400 m) in central Spain and collected blood samples from brachial veins. Percentage black on dorsal plumage and extension of white on folded wing and forehead were obtained from digital photographs. Plasma samples were analysed in the laboratory to obtain lipid peroxidation as a measure of oxidative damage by quantifying malondialdehydes (MDA), and antioxidant capacity. When controlling for male mass, breeding date and brood size, only forehead patch size was negatively associated with plasma lipid peroxidation levels and positively related to antioxidant capacity. There was no association among different plumage traits. Thus forehead patch size in montane Iberian populations may signal male phenotypic quality through plasma oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity possibly due to altitudinal effects on oxidative stress.",

Information on the foraging height, attack maneuvers, substrate and foliage density was collected independently for each foraging bird. Sallying was the most frequently used attack maneuver, and leaves were the most frequently used substrate. Statistical analyses showed that the variation in the foraging data was significantly influenced by foraging height, followed by attack maneuver, substrate, and lastly foliage density. The foraging height, the parameters of the attack maneuvers and substrate effectively divided the birds into three foraging guilds: (1) ‘High-sally insectivores’ — birds that foraged in higher strata using sallying tactics, namely Arctic Warbler Phylloscopus borealis, Black-naped Monarch Hypothymis azurea, Asian Paradise-flycatcher Terpsiphone paradisi and Asian Brown Flycatcher Muscicapa dauurica; (2) ‘High-foliage insectivores’ —birds that foraged in higher strata using glean-stretch-hang tactics, namely White-bellied Erpornis Erpornis zantholeuca, Green Iora Aegithina viridissima, and Pin-striped Tit-babbler Macronous gularis; and (3) ‘Understory insectivores’ —birds that foraged in lower strata, namely Abbott's Babbler Malacocincla abbotti, Chestnut-winged Babbler Stachyris erythroptera, and Rufescent Prinia Prinia rufescens. Except for Asian Paradiseflycatcher and Asian Brown Flycatcher, no other two species used similar foraging heights, substrates and attack maneuvers at the same time. However, the use of foliage density differed significantly between these two species. Therefore this parameter should also be taken into consideration in analysis of foraging niche in tropical birds.",

Here, we demonstrated changes in species habitat selection as a response to weather severity in twelve most abundant wintering waterbird species with prevailing increase in numbers during three investigated periods (1972–1978, 1987–1993 and 2003–2009). We used wintering waterbird counts from 93 sites throughout the Czech Republic from mid-January term as the coldest period of winter when the effect of thermoregulation on wintering waterbirds distribution is most apparent. We recorded no significant changes in weather severity in three investigated periods in our study area, and hence we considered the effect of preference of cold weather refuge sites, i.e. habitats which can reduce negative effect of cold weather (running waters, urban area and extensive water surface area). We found prevailing effect of weather severity in the first period what may show thermoregulatory effects being expressed by weather severity on species habitat selection in the next period in six of the twelve investigated species (Mute Swan Cygnus olor, Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula, Little Grebe Tachybaptus ruficollis, Common Moorhen Gallinula chloropus and Common Coot Fulica atra). In the face of recent climate change and in spite of the increasing importance of wetlands in the Czech Republic for wintering waterbirds, the suitability of these sites for wintering is likely temperature-dependent. Thus, the preference of cold weather refuges reducing the effect of winter harshness becomes important in individual species.",

    "abstract": "Birds have specific habitat requirements during the breeding period. The Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus is a species evolutionarily associated with forest areas that prefers deciduous and mixed forests, whilst its breeding in urban areas is a relatively recent phenomenon. Long-term data (2002–2015) on reproductive performance (number of hatchlings, hatching success, number of fledglings and fledging success (fledging success as the number of fledglings in relation to the number of hatchlings)) were quantified for two Blue Tit populations in two, floristically and structurally contrasting areas (a mature deciduous forest and an urban parkland) in central Poland. The principal aim of this study is to see whether the habitat type, year or the food availability affect the breeding success of Blue Tits. Forest Blue Tits produced significantly more hatchlings (9.82 ± 2.64 (SD) in the forest vs.9.17 ± 2.16 in the parkland) and fledglings (9.18 ± 2.84 in the forest vs. 8.14 ± 2.68 in the parkland) than urban Blue Tits. The number of fledglings was positively correlated with the number of hatchlings in both study areas. Both forest and urban Blue Tits shared a similar hatching success (85.9 % in the parkland and 85.5 % in the forest), while the fledging success was significantly higher in the forest (83.4 % in the parkland and 86.1 % in the forest). The amount of caterpillar frassfall was also studied (caterpillars are the optimal food for nestlings) at both study areas and it suggested that caterpillars were more abundant in the forest than in the parkland (the maximum amount of frassfall, averaged 0.21 ± 0.11 g frass/m2/day in the urban parkland and 0.59 ± 0.50 g frass/m2/day in the forest in 2003–2015). In the forest area, the mean number of fledglings tended to be related to the amount of frassfall but in the parkland, this relation was non-significant. The long-term dynamics of fledging success in our study sites seems to be mutually independent. Thus low fledging success in the forest site does not mean similarly low fledging success in the urban parkland site and vice versa. We suggest that food availability is one of key drivers of differences in the tits breeding success between both studied habitats.",

    "abstract": "Of the many negative effects roads have on wildlife, vehicle-caused mortality is important, killing several hundred million birds on an annual basis worldwide. Mortality is often the result of sitting on the road and failing to avoid an approaching vehicle, or being hit by a car while flying across the road at too low height. Therefore, one would expect that in areas with very high traffic density, birds would stay away from the road and roadside, and that birds flying over the road would do so at an elevation that minimizes the risk of collision. To test these hypotheses, I observed bird numbers along the roads at approximately 1000 car trips of at least 5 km in Iceland, Norway and the United States, and about 1800 flight heights of birds crossing a road before and after it was opened for car traffic. The bird abundance on roads was significantly lower at higher traffic densities. After start of traffic in a new road situation, birds crossed that road at significantly higher elevations than before. As an example, nearly 40% of Hooded Crows Corvus cornix and 70% of Western Jackdaws Corvus monedula were observed in the high-risk collision zone 0–5 m height before the road was opened; this was reduced to about 20% and 5% respectively for the two species after the road was opened. Heavy bird species flew higher than small birds. The behavioural adaptations shown here together with other publications provide the foundation of a hypothesis that the relationship between traffic density and the number of bird roadkills is non-linear, with a maximum number of roadkills occurring at a certain traffic density. This implies that fewer roads with high traffic density could reduce the number of roadkilled birds compared to many less trafficked roads.",

The potentially onerous energetic costs of incubation have meant that previous studies have focussed on thermal insulation but nests are often exposed to a variety of environmental factors, including rainfall. Those few studies that have investigated the effects of water on nests have saturated the walls by soaking but this may not reflect what a nest would typically encounter in situ during rainfall. Here, nests of four species of songbird (Common Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, Common Linnets Linaria cannabina, Meadow Pipits Anthus pratensis, and Whinchats Saxicola rubetra) were investigated using temperature loggers to determine the effect of simulated rainfall on nest wall insulation. Simulated rainfall, produced by water dripping through a coffee percolator, significantly reduced the insulatory values of nests, and significantly increased the rate of cooling of temperature loggers inside the nest cup. No significant effect of species, or nest mass, was observed. Even when wet nest walls provided some insulation but whether this is attributable to the nest materials chosen by each species was not clear. The nest site chosen by the birds may also offer considerable protection from the weather. Further research is needed to better understand how rainfall affects the insulative properties of nests in situ.",

Between 1988 and 2013 the number of genuinely Red Listed woodpeckers (categories Near Threatened and up) increased from 20 to 28 species and the number of species in the categories Vulnerable and up from 8 to 12. As percentage of recognised woodpecker species in the different years, the increase in Red Listed woodpecker species was even sharper. The geographical distribution of Red Listed woodpeckers stayed constant between 1988 and 2013, with over half of the species in Latin America, about one quarter in Asia, and none in Europe. A taxonomic reappraisal adopted by IUCN in 2014 raised the total number of recognised woodpecker species to 254 and of Red Listed woodpecker species to 42, of which 40% occur in Asia. Nearly all Red Listed woodpecker species on the 2013 list are threatened by deforestation. Out of 28 species, 10 are also threatened by selective logging, and these 10 are in higher threat categories. Woodpecker conservation research should focus in particular on the species sensitive to selective logging, to assess their within-habitat requirements and thresholds. The output of research on Red Listed woodpeckers in the past 25 years was heavily skewed to three North American species: Red-headed Woodpecker Melanerpes erythrocephalus, Red-cockaded Woodpecker Picoides borealis and Ivory-billed Woodpecker Campephilus principalis.

    "abstract": "Studies investigating nest function in birds show that individual preferences and environmental temperature can affect the type and amount of materials used in their construction and, thus, how well insulated they are. Levels of insulation of bird nests may be important because this could impact on heat loss by adults and eggs during incubation, and by nestlings during rearing, which may in turn affect individual fitness. Here we used infrared (IR) thermography to measure the surface temperature of nests of Great Tits Parus major and Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus in situ during incubation to test the hypothesis that nest insulation predicts reproductive success. Previous studies of thermodynamics during incubation have focussed on factors, e.g. egg temperature, which do not directly measure the thermal conditions in the nest itself. Rarely applied to studies of avian incubation, IR thermography has yet to be used to quantify the thermal properties of nests with the incubating bird in situ. The rate of temperature change (°C/cm) of the nest material, as determined for the first 1.5 cm away from the edge of the bird, was significantly associated with fledging success in Blue Tits, although not Great Tits. This provides the first evidence that the insulatory properties of nests during incubation can correlate with offspring fitness, and so has important implications for the study of nest function in an ecological context. IR thermography provides a methodology that allows future research to investigate the factors that determine nest insulation.",

It showed that the incubating behaviour of our tit populations resembles that reported in previous studies, but with peculiarities related to living at lower latitudes, i.e. with a relatively low attentiveness and a shorter active day. Both tit species showed very different incubation strategies, with Blue Tits leaving more frequently the nest (Mean ± SE number of off-bouts, Blue Tit = 27.14 ± 0.63, Great Tit = 16.95 ± 0.58) but for shorter periods than Great Tits (off-bout duration, Blue Tit = 8.76 ± 0.22 min, Great Tit = 14.04 ± 0.56 min; on-bout duration, Blue Tit = 22.63 ± 0.60 min, Great Tit = 36.86 ± 0.86 min). Nonetheless, both species provided a similar nest attentiveness, percentage of time of the active day during which the females were actively incubating (Blue Tit = 70.87 ± 0.57%, Great Tit = 70.75 ± 0.83%). Presumably, differences in the cooling rate of clutches, estimated with the iButtons, could be behind the differences in incubation behaviour between species and the greater capacity of Great Tits to adjust their incubation behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Land use changes occurring in Europe in recent decades are generating important changes in the forest landscape characteristics and are having important effects on avian species richness and abundance. This is particularly important for some bird species of particular conservation concern that require heterogenous landscapes where breeding habitats are proximal to foraging habitats. Among these birds, the European Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur is particularly important because of its marked population decline. In southern Europe, forest landscapes have been considered important breeding areas for Turtle Doves. We assessed the influence of the foraging area characteristics — distance to cereal crops and wild seed species abundance — and water availability on Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability in a Mediterranean forest landscape in southern Spain. Forty-six point locations were surveyed during the spring of 2014 and 2015 on two nearby farms of a forest protected area. The average local abundance of Turtle Doves found at each point location was 1.25 ± 1.31 males, and it was significantly higher at the point locations closest to cereal crops, as well as at nesting sites where the wild seed species included in its local diet were abundant, especially Echium plantagineum. Distance to water in the studied range (average distance 475 m) did not show a significant effect on Turtle Dove local abundance, although the high availability of water in the study area could have a positive influence on the overall Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability. To benefit Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability, cultivated areas with cereals/legumes near those forest areas where Turtle Doves reproduce should be promoted. Likewise, the promotion of those herbaceous species that are locally important in the Turtle Dove diet, available, for example, through specific grazing management, should be taken into account when nesting habitat restoration is designed in forest areas, regardless of whether the distances to food resources are long.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the behaviour and survival of translocated individuals is vital for successful management of conservation programmes aimed at restoring species to their former distribution range. We examined movements and survival of 10 captive-bred Saker Falcons Falco cherrug fitted with satellite-received transmitters, which were released by wild-hacking in Bulgaria in 2012–2014. Chicks were parent-reared in captivity and transferred to hack cages when 25–35 days old in groups of 3–4 nestlings, where they were fed without direct human contact. After leaving the hack cages at 43–51 days old, fledglings were retained in the vicinity by food provisioning at the hack cage. Birds tracked by satellite remained in the vicinity of the hack cage for an average of 28 days (range 5–49 days) and post-dispersal survival was positively associated with the length of time spent in the hack vicinity. We found no significant difference in tracking period, as a proxy of survival, for translocated and wild-fledged Saker Falcons in Europe. The cause of transmission cessation was known for five birds; three were electrocuted by power distribution lines, one died after becoming trapped in a building and another was caught by falcon trappers in North Africa. Captive-bred birds exhibited similar movement and settlement behaviour as their wild congeners: dispersing at varied headings, establishing post-dispersal temporary settlement areas and migrating to discrete wintering ranges. Birds surviving to at least their second year showed some degree of natal philopatry, establishing summer ranges 45–160 km from their hack sites. Provisioning at feeding stations around the hack in 2015 and 2016 improved retention in the hack area to an average of 38 and 43 days, and apparent survival during the first 40-days after fledging was 97.7 and 98.9% respectively. A pair of Saker Falcons that bred in Bulgaria in 2018 and 2019 was from a trial cohort hacked in 2015, indicating that translocation of captive-bred birds can potentially be used to restore the species to this part of its former breeding distribution range.",

    "abstract": "The way an animal uses the home range and territory often vary in time according to its breeding state and habitat complexity. Adult dispersal can follow partner replacement, however little is known about seasonal/sex variation in partner replacement in tropical passerines. Here we tested if home range and territory size of the Rufous Hornero Furnarius rufus varies between the breeding and non-breeding seasons and if this variation is consistent across three distant populations in Brazil (UFJF, UnB, and MT). In addition, we described the frequency of partner replacements in relation to sex and breeding state in two of those populations (UFJF and UnB). We observed a decrease in 33% and 38% of home range size in the non-breeding season for two sites (UFJF and MT). Territory size decreased by 50% in the non-breeding season in UnB, but this could be due to a lower sampling effort during this season. Nevertheless, the home range expansion is consistent with a higher demand for resources during the breeding season. Home range sizes, but not sizes of territories, varied across sites. We also recorded 26 partner replacements, with no sign of sex or seasonal bias. Most replaced birds disappeared, suggesting that both sexes are under similar mortality risks, a usual main driver of partner replacement. Pair bonds lasted three or more years in 25% of the studied pairs. Altogether, these results provide insights for future studies on underlying mechanisms shaping home ranging, territoriality, and partner replacement in tropical birds that defend year-round territories.",

This was in contrast to nests situated among Juncus maritimus stems. For the most part, an incubating Water Rail on the nest at eye-level was hardly visible in any of the various stands. The vegetation height of nest sites in SM and BL was considerably less than in FM owed to the absence of Phragmites australis. The nest height in tussocks of Juncus maritimus was greater. The other nests characteristics (diameter, depth and weight) were not significantly different in FM and SM BL.

Nearly 88% of all road-kills were recorded in built-up areas and on road sections in their vicinity. The average number of road-kills per 1 km of roads was over twenty times higher in built-up areas than in open agricultural landscape (6.74 vs 0.33 road-kills/1 km). This paper investigates the influence of environmental factors (lines of trees along roads, number of livestock, volume of traffic, number of inhabitants) on the level of Barn Swallow mortality on the roads in question. During the breeding season the number of birds killed in built-up areas was related positively to the number of cattle reared, the overall number of livestock (including pigs) and the number of inhabitants. In the multiple regression model following stepwise forward selection, the number of cattle explained 41 % of the variance in the size of the whole-year road mortality of swallows in the built-up area. During the autumn migration period the length of tree-lined road sections in the built-up area had an significant influence on road-kill frequency, explaining 36% of the variance in mortality. Mortality was high on tree-lined sections of road in adverse weather conditions.",

We suggest that bird diversity was closely related to habitat size, especially in the category 1–10 ha, and recommend this area be used to establish new bird habitats in urban landscapes. The number of bird species was significantly correlated with the number of insect species in studied patches, but was not correlated with the size of green areas or the distance to roads.

To disentangle these effects, we performed a large-scale bird census using a small-scale field approach in the Czech Republic. Using canonical correspondence analysis, we found that the strongest scale-independent gradient in bird community composition goes from higher-altitude forest assemblages to lower-altitude farmland and human settlement assemblages. The other gradients were also scale-dependent, probably due to the different distributional patterns of particular habitats at the respective scales. Closer examination of bird occurrence in particular habitats revealed that water bodies host the most distinct bird assemblage compared to the assemblages of other habitats. Interestingly, although the census tracked the most important east-west biogeographical gradient within the Czech bird fauna, we did not find longitude to be a significant predictor of changes in bird community structure along the transect at any resolution. We suggest that the biogeographical gradient is actually related to the habitat-based distinction between the coniferous-forested higher-altitude West and the deciduous-forested lower-altitude agricultural East. Fine-scale bird-habitat associations are thus responsible for the patterns of community structure at all spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "Advancement of spring migration in response to recent global climate change is well documented for a variety of bird species, but the pattern for autumn migration is rather equivocal. During a 42-year period (1964–2005) the changes in timing of spring and autumn migration of eight wader species were studied at multiple inland sites in Central Europe (Czech Republic and Slovakia) using ringing data. While a clear pattern was found for the advancement of the spring passage, there were variable trends in the timing of the autumn passage. Three species significantly advanced (Wood Sandpiper, Common Sandpiper and Dunlin), three species delayed (Ruff, Snipe and Little Ringed Plover), and two species did not change the timing of the autumn passage (Little Stint and Green Sandpiper). Earlier studies had predicted that long-distance migrants wintering south of the Sahara would advance the timing of autumn migration, while short-distance migrants would postpone it. However, our findings do not fully conform to these predictions. Across species, the timing of both the spring and autumn passages was negatively associated with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, suggesting that even in long-distance migrants the timing of migration might be under direct environmental control. In conclusion, phenological responses of birds to recent changes in climate are quite coherent for the early phenological phases; however, the responses to later phases are not so straightforward, and the present study contributes to this diverse pattern.",

The annual mean range was 25 146 ha during the breeding season (BS) and 20 557 ha in the non-breeding season (NBS). The eagles were found up to 35.9 km away from their nest during BS and nearly 62 km away during NBS. The maximum total distance covered in one day was 113.6 km, with males flying longer distances than females during BS. There was less overlap between ranges during BS, and the mean home range varied from 3881 ha in BS to 2085 ha in NBS. The areas where territorial behaviour (display flights, defence and/or aggression) was observed contained the nest-tree, the most frequently used perches, and the feeding ground nearest to the nest. Breeding home ranges were negatively correlated with densities of Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus. Breeding eagles whose home range had low rabbit densities travelled 16.2–28.9 km from their nest to reach distant, undefended feeding grounds with much higher rabbit densities. Our results suggest that home ranges varied with prey density and a bird's reproductive status. Larger breeding ranges are probably related to an increase in energy requirements, while habitat quality is probably a regulatory mechanism of space use. In terms of home range analysis methodology, our observations of eagle behaviour favour Cluster Analysis over Kernel, particularly for defining distant feeding grounds.",

At first, for each bird species its conservation priority status was assessed by calculating its conservation priority index (CPI), using six protection attributes (e.g. extinction risk, taxonomic uniqueness, public appeal). Second, based on the birds' conservation status, prioritisation by alternative approaches was performed. A hotspot score, a heuristic and an optimisation approach were used. The territory of China was divided into 583 grid cells (1° ×1°). The efficiency of the current network of protected areas was tested by comparing it with data obtained from prioritization. Analyses indicated that 28 species should be classified as highest conservation priorities, 13 of them were recommended for inclusion to the national wildlife protection list. The optimisation method for area selection was shown to be superior to the heuristic and hotspot approaches, since it selected more currently unreserved high priority areas whilst keeping the total number of sites low. It is proposed that seven Important Bird Areas (IBA's) should be added to the current protected area network. The suggested avian conservation assessment procedure can identify previously overlooked endangered bird species and candidate priority areas for conservation throughout comparative approaches.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to determine the pattern of dispersion in Feral Pigeons, as well as the factors influencing the degree of dispersion. Aside from studying variation in dispersion among the bird colonies, the direction and distance of dispersion were also analysed. The results of the study point unequivocally to strong dispersion asymmetry in the population, which is mainly age-biased. There were great differences in dispersion between adult (reproducing) individuals and young individuals that had not yet joined the breeding population. Each year, young individuals which had permanently left their natal colonies accounted for 20–30% of the young birds that ultimately joined the breeding population. The insignificant degree of dispersion among adult birds (from 0 to 0.8% per year) was due to their strong philopatry towards their breeding sites. A lack of reproductive success did not have any effect on dispersion in the case of the breeding pairs studied. A factor conducive to a bird's departure from the natal colony was the high density of breeding pairs present in the colony. It was found that the direction of dispersion was from a colony with a higher density to a colony with a lower density of pigeons. The Feral Pigeons did not emigrate to join colonies of domestic pigeons kept on the outskirts of the city, nor did they emigrate to other towns in the neighbourhood of the study area (Słupsk, NW Poland). The time when young birds left the natal colony did not influence the degree of their dispersion. Young birds that left their natal colony experienced significantly higher breeding success in their new colony, compared to those young birds that remained in the natal colony, where the density of breeding pairs was high. Young females dispersed more often than young males, although this difference was not statistically significant. This article also discusses the dispersion mechanism in the case of young pigeons.",

The behaviour of female owls was monitored by a camera system from hatching to fledging at 12 nests in 2004 and 2006 in the Ore Mountains, Czech Republic. Food abundance and reproductive success (the latter measured at the end of female's attendance of the brood) were higher in 2004 than in 2006. Females remained for a significantly longer time with their nestlings at the nests in 2004 (24.8 ± 2.4 days) than in 2006 (22.2 ± 0.9 days). During the attendance period, they were leaving the nest for several short trips each night; the duration of these trips, the total time spent outside the nest per night, and the number of trips per night did not differ between years. However, these variables did increase with increasing age of the young (though the number of trips per night increased only during the last week of the females' stay on the nests). Two types of female parental strategies were recorded after the end of brood attendance period: in 2004 when food was abundant, most of the females left their broods, whereas in 2006 when food was scarce, most of the females continued parental care and took part in the feeding of nestlings. The reproductive success was correlated negatively with both the total number of prey items and the proportional contribution of the females to nestling feeding. These results support the hypothesis that if the ecological conditions are such that the offspring can be raised by a single parent, its mate may abandon the clutch or brood and increase its fitness by sequential polygamy (polyandry/polygyny) during a single breeding season.",

Notably, where there is a considerable aggregation of cavities, territory-holders may prevent the occupation of the nearest cavities by other birds, whereas a supply of diverse cavities may reduce interspecific competition. We used multivariate general linear models to explore whether, and how, variables describing the supply of small cavities are related to the density and diversity of hole-nesting passerine communities in 33 hemiboreal old forest stands. The total density of 12 species (1.3 ± 0.8 pairs/ha) increased with cavity density and diversity, but was not affected by cavity aggregation. As expected, cavity diversity also promoted bird diversity; indeed, the densities of different species were positively related to the densities of different cavity types. The results indicate that segregation in nest-cavity selection affects the co-occurrence of passerine species and, at the mean densities of small tree-cavities in the region (2.3/ha), cavity aggregation does not markedly reduce their availability. In conservation management, therefore, it is important to maintain a diverse supply of cavities in addition to their abundance, in order to sustain hole-nester communities.",

I studied the year-round foraging behaviour of the White-backed Woodpecker in broadleaved, primeval Bialowieza Forest (NE Poland), and investigated how foraging time was divided among various substrates and foraging techniques. Of the 13 tree species used for foraging, woodpeckers were most frequently recorded utilising the three most common tree species: hornbeam Carpinus betulus, lime Tilia cordata and spruce Picea abies (totalling 61–68% of observed time), and the proportional use of tree species did not change seasonally. Observations of birds foraging on snags increased and foraging on fallen trees decreased from spring to winter. Foraging was most frequently recorded on dead substrates (72–85%), usually those covered with bark. Mean time of foraging on an individual tree increased significantly from spring to winter.

    "abstract": "The estimation of fuel load and the potential flight ranges of migrant birds are crucial to understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of bird migration strategies. The movement of migrant birds between Iberia and the rest of Western Europe is thought to be shaped by the Pyrenees and nearby seas. Because of this area's unique geography, the routes of migrants that move to (autumn migration) or from (spring migration) Iberia tend to pass through the western and eastern edges of the Pyrenees. Fuel-load analyses and the assessment of potential flight ranges from these edges can provide insights about the extent of Iberia's use as a consistent stopover and fuelling area. Using data obtained over a period of six years (2004–2009), we calculated fuel load and potential flight ranges for ten common passerines (pre-Saharan, i.e. that overwinter mainly within the circum-Mediterranean region: Robin Erithacus rubecula, Bluethroat Luscinia svecica, Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla; sub-Saharan, i.e. that overwinter in tropical Africa: Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus, Melodious Warbler Hippolais polyglotta, Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, Garden Warbler Sylvia borin, Common Whitethroat Sylvia communis that stopover at Txingudi marshlands, at the western edge of the Pyrenees. The fuel load for the 25% heaviest fraction of caught birds ranged from 10.6% over lean body mass to 25.5% (mean: 18.3%) in spring and from 6.7% to 39.7% (mean: 25.2%) in autumn. Thus, potential flight ranges tended to be longer during autumn than during spring, particularly for the sub-Saharan species. All pre-Saharan species except one (Bluethroat) had sufficient fuel to arrive in southern Iberia or northern Africa, and three sub-Saharan species (Sedge Warbler, Garden Warbler, Common Whitethroat) had sufficient fuel to reach the north of the Sahara Desert but not its southern border. The potential flight ranges in spring were rather similar among species (ca. 1000 km from Txingudi).",

Here, we examined the influence of egg size differences between host and parasite eggs on egg rejection behaviour in a population of Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus parasitized by Common Cuckoos Cuculus canorus. To this end, we experimentally parasitized host clutches using real Chinese Quail Coturnix chinensis and conspecific eggs. Both egg types were painted immaculate blue. The Chinese Quail eggs differed from host eggs in both size and colour, while the conspecific eggs differed only in colour. There were no differences in the rate of rejection rate of the two types of experimental eggs. However, Chinese Quail eggs were rejected primarily by nest desertion, whereas conspecific eggs were mostly ejected. Moreover, clutches with Chinese Quail eggs were deserted significantly sooner in comparison with the ejection of conspecific eggs. Therefore, egg size differences apparently affect the mode and speed but not the rate of egg rejection in this host population.",

    "abstract": "Insectivorous birds have very diversified diet, but particular species usually show some specialisation, which leads to a varying level of dependence on special prey. Their reproductive cycles are dependent on the availability of appropriate arthropods; in the case of Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major reproduction is usually coordinated with the availability of caterpillars as the key food for nestlings. Therefore a picture of nestling diet, with some estimates of the actual frequency of caterpillars and alternative prey, is an important component of explanations of aspects of Tit life-histories. As in most cases a rough assessment of diet composition and relative proportions of prey items is satisfactory, we suggest that faecal analysis is a feasible method to get such a picture. Droppings may be collected to examine the diet of individual nestlings grouped in broods, at a particular age stage or at many stages reflecting development. The most time-consuming part of this method includes segregation and identification of prey remains in the laboratory. We draw attention to the procedures and the most diagnostically useful features of arthropod prey of Tits. Especially, we provide clues to identification of the remains of different arthropods. As an example, clypeus proved to be the most valuable structure to identify caterpillars, while chelicerae were the most diagnostically significant in Arachnids. Exemplary results on diet spectrum for the Blue Tit and Great Tit are also presented. Faecal analysis is fast and effortless at the sampling stage, with almost all effort being postponed to the stage of laboratory work.",

    "abstract": "The results of spatial modelling based on various climatic change scenarios predict shifts in the geographical ranges of species. Theoretically, a species can spread into new areas if the local habitat composition meets its ecological requirements. Therefore, habitat change in an unfavourable direction should inhibit climatically induced range shifts in some species. We tested this prediction using data on breeding bird distribution in the Czech Republic, a small central European country. We selected 28 species whose northern range limits are in central Europe and compared their distribution in the Czech Republic between 1985–1989 and 2001–2003. From these species, we identified 10 affected by habitat changes, such as a loss in environmental heterogeneity or agricultural intensification, using a local literature survey. As a group, the 28 species did not show any significant changes in their breeding distribution. However, those species affected by habitat change significantly restricted their distribution, whereas the remaining species not affected by habitat change increased their distribution. We suggest that the increasing occupancy of species not affected by habitat change could be caused by climate change. However, climate cannot overshadow the negative impacts of land-use changes on the distribution of species affected by habitat change. Therefore, such species could be seriously threatened: they might not be able to track their climatic optima if future climate change proceeds in tandem with the destruction of their habitats.",

These factors may differ depending on the spatial scale at which they act. Bonelli's Eagle distribution in Spain has been studied previously using local and large (nation-wide) study area sizes, and human activities seemed not to affect negatively the occupancy of breeding territories. To study the factors affecting the species at an intermediate spatial scale we modelled Bonelli's Eagle distribution in Málaga province (S Spain), where the breeding density is the highest known in Europe. We applied a favourability function based on generalized linear models using the presence/absence of breeding territories of the species, and the values of a set of variables related to climate, topography, interspecific competition with Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos and human activity. We obtained a parsimonious model that included cliff availability and distance to highways as predictors of Bonelli's Eagle distribution. As highways may be seen as surrogates of intensive human activity, we conclude that, contrary to what was previously found at local or at nation-wide scales, human actions negatively affect the distribution of breeding territories at an intermediate scale. The construction of new roads and highways in the Mediterranean area of mainland Spain, which is the most climatically favourable region for the species, could have negative consequences for the Spanish metapopulation of Bonelli's Eagle, particularly in peripheral populations or distant areas that depend on the arrival of immigrants to persist.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of bird plumage colouration may be explained by a wide range of selective pressures, including both defensive and advertising needs. However, the relationship between plumage colouration and body size has never been investigated in detail. Here we hypothesize that body size represents a constraint for the evolution of plumage colour heterogeneity because the relative number of body feathers was suggested to increase as body size decreases, and in the case of carotenoid-based colourations because the concentrations of circulating carotenoids decrease with increasing body size. Here we test these predictions on a dataset comprising measurements of male plumage colour heterogeneity using a model of avian visual perception in 111 species from 55 families of birds. A test of the correlation between number of feathers and body size in 92 species of birds showed a positive, instead of negative as previously suggested, association between these variables. As predicted, there was a negative relationship between plumage colour heterogeneity (measured as colour span, a measure of the contrast among colour patches) and body size after controlling for the effects of phylogeny, sexual dichromatism, colour vision type and habitat, and we suggest that the negative allometry shown by carotenoid levels may be the mechanism responsible for this negative relationship. Plumage colour heterogeneity was lower in species inhabiting open environments than in more vegetated habitats. Our results offer a general explanation for interspecific variation in bird colour heterogeneity through an association with body size.",

The sub-Himalayan sal Shorea robusta forests of northwest India have 17 woodpecker species, and a history of management-induced habitat modification. We studied how habitat parameters affect woodpeckers at a community level (viz. total abundance and species richness) as well as at individual species level. We assessed woodpecker abundance, species richness and described habitat features at 8 sites representing a gradient of structure and composition in a sal-dominated landscape. We surveyed each site in 2-km-long transects 20 times over breeding and non-breeding seasons and evaluated habitat characteristics in 10 circular and belt plots. We analysed woodpecker abundance, species richness, and abundance of individual species as functions of habitat variables and season. Woodpecker encounter rates and mean species richness, respectively, ranged from 1.5 to 10.0 birds/km and 1.7 to 6.9 species per survey at individual sites. Distance-based estimates of densities for the most frequently-observed species were also obtained. Basal area (large trees) and density of snags positively influenced total woodpecker abundance and species richness, with snags being more important during breeding season. Basal area was important for Greater Flameback Chrysocolaptes lucidus, Grey-faced Woodpecker Picus canus, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker Dendrocopos macei and Lesser Yellownape Picus chlorolophus. Snags, tree density, tree diameter and termitarium density appeared to affect Greycapped Pygmy Woodpecker Dendrocopos canicapillus, Black-rumped Flameback Dinopium benghalense, Himalayan Flameback Dinopium shorii and Streak-throated Woodpecker Picus xanthopygaeus. Hence, for the conservation of native woodpecker communities in sal forests, it is necessary to retain large trees and standing dead wood.",

Changing crop compositions and seasonal vegetation dynamics have been suggested to influence the breeding success of Skylarks in arable fields. We quantified the breeding performance of Skylarks by means of continuous video surveillance in maize fields (n = 83 nests) and in a pooled sample of other crops, mostly sugar beet, opium poppy and cereals (n = 89 nests), in the Czech Republic, from 2009 to 2011. Skylarks colonized the bare ground of maize fields immediately after sowing and continued to breed there until the end of the breeding season in late July. The vegetation height at the time of laying did not exceed 100 cm, but late broods left nests under maize reaching up to 210 cm. In spite of similar clutch sizes, a lower number of chicks fledged per successful nest in maize fields compared to other crops, as a consequence of the lower hatchability and higher partial nestling mortality. Nest success (based on daily survival rates) was very low ranging from 8% (raw estimate) to 12% (model estimate), while the difference between crops was less than 1%. The nest productivity was less than 0.4 chicks produced per nesting attempt in both crops. At least 84% (maize) and 65% (other crops) of primary nest losses were caused by predation. After controlling for vegetation height, there was little difference in nest survival between crops during the egg stage, but nest survival was marginally lower in maize during the nestling stage. Results of the study suggest that the recent increasing area of energy cropping fields represented mainly by maize provide an attractive, yet risky, nesting habitat for Skylarks, especially late in the season when autumn-sown crops are too dense. The main factor responsible for the low nesting success is the high rate of nest predation, regardless of vegetation height, as a consequence of shift from mainly avian to mammalian predation towards the end of breeding season.",

Hunting activity of Eleonora's Falcons near floodlights during the breeding season in western Morocco peaked 30–60 min after sunset, but continued into the early morning. Hunting activity and prey capture rates near floodlights were highest during nights with little moonlight or overcast conditions. Fifty-one percent of 73 group capture attempts were successful. Of the migratory prey species identified at the Moroccan study site (26 species), 73% belonged to species mainly migrating at night, whereas 57% of all migratory bird prey species of Eleonora's Falcon reported to date (122 species) migrate predominantly at night; suggesting that hunting near artificial light may increase the proportion of nocturnal migrant species in the diet of falcons. Sylvia and Acrocephalus were the most commonly recorded genera among prey caught after dark. Our direct observations and analysis of satellite transmitter data indicated that Eleonora's Falcons also hunted away from artificial light in Morocco, Italy, and frequently so in Madagascar. Flight activity was detected in 18% of 342 night-time locations of seven satellitetagged Eleonora's Falcons in Madagascar, at an average moon illumination of 60%. We conclude that nocturnal hunting by Eleonora's Falcons is more common than previously assumed and occurs preferably, but not exclusively, at above-average moon illumination on wintering grounds or near artificial lights during the breeding period.",

    "abstract": "The White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos is one the rarest and the most vulnerable woodpeckers in Europe. Intensive forest practices have caused a widespread decline of the species. In the Spanish Pyrenees, on the south-west limit of the species range, a population of the lilfordi subspecies (Lilford Woodpecker) is estimated at less than 200 individuals which are confined to a few relatively well-conserved beech forests. Despite being an endangered taxon, our knowledge about the size and shape of its home range is still incomplete. Conventional radio-tracking studies of the taxon have been limited due to the complex topography of forests, whereas miniaturized GPS devices have not been available for such a small bird (∼100 g bodyweight) until recently. Here, we evaluate for the first time the utility of modern lightweight GPS tags to characterize the home range of the White-backed Woodpecker. Using 3.4 g GPS-tags we tracked movements of 14 adult individuals during the breeding and post-breeding periods between years 2017–2019. On average, the failure rate (the percentage of failed fix attempts) was 30%, and 76% of successful fixes were accurate (error < 20 m). According to 95% kernel density estimator, the mean home range (∼300 ha) was several times larger than previously reported for the species, and it did not change over the post-breeding period. This finding challenges the utility of previous management recommendations for protecting small buffer areas around the nest or single forest stands. By modeling the home range size as a function of the number of fixes and errors, we found that males had significantly larger home ranges than females. Our results demonstrate that GPS telemetry is feasible in White-backed Woodpecker adults, and it can provide novel and accurate information about the home range of the species if potential sources of error are adequately addressed.",

Why other sympatric hosts are not used, or actively avoided, remains one of the main gaps in our understanding of parasite-host coevolution. Cavity nesting passerines always represented a text-book example of unsuitable hosts but recent evidence casts multiple doubts on this traditional view. In general, any species can become an unsuitable host for a parasite at laying, incubation, or nestling stages with the last one being much less studied than the others. Therefore we examined Cuckoo chick performance in five cavity nesting host species, including one regular Cuckoo host — the Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus and four non-hosts: the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata, Great Tit Parus major, and Coal Tit Periparus ater. Natural nests of non-hosts, as opposed to artificial nest boxes with small entrance holes, are often placed in cavities that show both entrance and inner cavity sizes large enough for female Cuckoos to lay and Cuckoo chicks to fledge. We did not find any evidence for chick discrimination in non-hosts, i.e., no chicks were rejected, attacked, or neglected. Cuckoo chicks grew similarly in nests of all four species of non-hosts, similarly to chicks in host Redstart nests, and generally better than in nests of the most numerous Cuckoo host, the Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus. Although Cuckoo chick fledging mass was highly host speciesspecific (i.e., showed high statistical repeatability across various host species), we did not find any evidence for the hypothesis that host body size (mass) positively affects parasite chick growth (fledging mass or age). These findings provide impetus to further study apparently unsuitable hosts and perhaps even reconsider traditional classifications of host suitability in the context of brood parasite-host coevolution.",

Breeding biology, habitat and nest site selection were studied in this species in southern Poland. Almost all birds nested on industrial water bodies (gravel pits, sedimentation basins), although fishponds and reservoirs were the most abundant habitat in the study area. Birds built their nests mainly on islets, man-made constructions and dry land on the shores of water bodies. The islets occupied by birds were smaller and were covered by lower vegetation than the unoccupied ones. When occupied islets on industrial water bodies were compared with a random sample of islets on fishponds, the latter were found to be larger, with taller and denser vegetation. This may explain why Common Gulls did not breed on fishponds in southern Poland. Shore-breeding birds nested in open areas with sparse vegetation, occupying sites with less vegetation cover and closer to shrubs or trees than randomly selected points. Breeding performance (mean date of clutch initiation, clutch size, clutch volume, hatching success and breeding success) did not differ among nests built on islets, man-made constructions or on the shores of the water bodies. Breeding success was more than twice as high as in large riverine colonies. Industrial water bodies may become important alternative breeding habitats for this species in Poland.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to provide optimal methodological criteria for the quantitative and qualitative estimates of bird communities inhabiting woodland areas using point counts. Results obtained from counts carried out once or twice during the same breeding season were compared and the optimal duration of each session was assessed. Data obtained in three different woodland areas, from a total of 46 point counts each lasting 20 min. and repeated twice in the breeding season were analyzed in 5-min. blocks. It was concluded that 10-min. sessions repeated twice in a breeding season can provide a good description of the passerine bird community. However, some rarer species of the breeding community under study, including some diurnal raptors, woodpeckers, and scarce passerines, could be underestimated with this duration.",

The results from observations in Warsaw have added to the knowledge of the feeding ecology of urban raptors. In 2000 and 2001 the same pair of Peregrines bred successfully in nest boxes situated on two different buildings in the city centre, rearing three and four chicks in the respective years. During the breeding seasons from hatching to fledging, the nests were monitored with a video camera. Only diurnal observations were used in the detailed analysis of feeding activity — 428 h in 2000 (33 days) and 384 h (24 days) in 2001. Two peaks of parental activity were noted: in the morning and in the afternoon. Additional data collected in 2000 showed that the falcons also fed their young at night. In 1998–2001 486 prey remains were collected on the buildings occupied by the Peregrines. In Warsaw these falcons preyed most often on Feral Pigeons (32%), and also on various thrush species (23.5%), Skylarks (8%) and Corncrakes (5.6%). Seasonal variations in prey composition were identified. During the spring and autumn migrations, the proportion of pigeons in the falcons' diet was 10–19%, while in summer and winter it was over 40%. The trend was reversed with regard to migrant species, which were prevalent in the diet in spring and autumn, but less numerous in summer and winter.",

The species richness indices of birds in the two types of forest did not display such a clear relationship. Foliage abundance was high up to a height of 30 m in the evergreen forests, whereas in moist deciduous forests, foliage was abundant only up to 20 m. A significant positive correlation was obtained between foliage abundance and species richness and also between the numbers of birds in both types of forests.

Among three excavators, the Great Spotted Woodpecker used more aspens, larger trees, and more living or intact dead trees than the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker or the Willow Tit. Among non-excavators, the Nuthatch used mainly old holes of the Great Spotted Woodpecker, and the Red-throated Flycatcher frequently used those of the Willow Tit. Thus, the nest site characters of these two species resembled those of the original excavators, and their nests were placed higher than those of other non-excavators. The Coal Tit and the Great Tit used mostly branch holes in living trees. With respect to nest site use, the Daurian Redstart behaved as a generalist while the Common Treecreeper specialized in long slits. The nest site selection of excavators might be governed by body size, territory size and their different abilities of excavation. The non-excavators were best differentiated by their preferred hole type, and their tree use and nest site characters were mainly a consequence of the location of such holes. Interspecific competition did not appear to be important in the nest site use of hole-nesting birds in the study area.",

    "abstract": "The biology of individually colour-ringed European Blackbirds inhabiting two city parks in Szczecin (NW Poland) was studied in 1997–2003. In each park one to three observers watched the behaviour of Blackbirds every other day from dawn till afternoon (6–8 h a day); in this way almost all of their nests were discovered. 35 cases were recorded where pairs re-used their own nests, as well as two cases where the nest of another Blackbird pair and one Fieldfare nest were re-used. In 33 out of 81 cases observed, the re-use occurred after the brood had been successfully reared, while in two cases out of 378, female Blackbirds initiated the second breeding attempt in the same nest after the loss of the first one. The re-used nests were better concealed (80 ± 19% and 69 ± 18%, respectively) and had been built at greater heights than those abandoned after breeding (9.0 ± 5.0 m and 6.5 ± 4.2 m, respectively). No shortening of the interval between successive clutches was noted in the case of nest re-use (re-used nests 36.8 ± 4.9 days, newly-built nests 37.7 ± 8.0). The more and more frequent re-use of nests where breeding had been successful, their better concealment and higher sites, and also the lack of any differences in the intervals between successive clutches of pairs occupying old nests and those building new ones before the next breeding attempt, suggest that in the investigated population the basic reason for nest re-use was the insufficient number of safe nesting sites.",

    "abstract": "The between-season divorce rate of the European Blackbird was studied in 1997–2003 in two city parks in northwest Poland. Within the population studied, 52 and 51% of pairs in each park were observed to divorce. Of the eight parameters included in the analysis, the divorce rate was found to depend on marriage training and the time of territory acquisition. Territory quality, breeding success, synchrony in territory acquisition, age and size of the partners were unimportant. 19.5% of pairs with marriage training were observed to divorce, whereas 65.5% of pairs without marriage training did so. Birds acquiring their territories earlier divorced their partners significantly less frequently than those acquiring a territory at a later date. During the first post-divorce breeding season, young males that stayed in the park started breeding earlier than in the preceding year; old males started breeding later, whereas the difference was not significant in young or old females. Regardless of their age, the divorced birds showed a reduced number of fledglings raised with a new partner. The reduced breeding success may be a result of poor adaptation to increased pressure from predators. Similar divorce rates in pairs with and without breeding success and the rarer divorces among pairs claiming their territories earlier strongly support the habitat-mediated hypothesis. However, the more frequent desertion of poor territories by females, as well as differences found between older males and females in the timing of the onset of breeding before and after divorce, indicate that an individual may choose divorce to maximize fitness.",

    "abstract": "Blue Tits exhibit extreme variation in clutch size and hatching asynchrony, which is the focus of this study. This paper reports an in-depth study of breeding Blue Tits showing that variation in Blue Tit hatching asynchrony can be explained by a number of phenological variables including particularly, date of bud burst in the local oak tree, which signals caterpillar emergence (34%), also date of first egg (14%) and female weight (8%). Hatching asynchrony explained 9% of the variation in brood mortality in this southern English population. Early incubation relative to clutch completion (incubation asynchrony) in Blue Tits explained 85% of the variation in hatching asynchrony, differs between years and advanced hatching in early and fledging in late laid eggs. Consequently, because fledging is usually synchronous, hatching asynchrony shortens the total time spent in the nest and explained 28% of the variation in nesting time from clutch completion to fledging. I present experimental evidence that brood reduction resulting from hatching asynchrony may be particularly adaptive towards the end of the breeding season, with 91% of the variation in the productivity of asynchronously-hatched broods being explained by, and increased with, date of hatching. About one fifth of birds delayed daytime incubation until after clutch completion, probably in wait for caterpillars to appear. Although the delay period was variable and extended total nesting time it always resulted in synchronous hatching. I propose that Blue Tits may have evolved plastic responses to environmental cues such as oak bud burst, which causes them to incubate at the optimum time to ensure maximum fledging success and chick fitness.",

Between 1983–1988 and 1992–1999,105 (39% ) colonies were abandoned, i.e., 16–20% of the population as recorded in earlier periods. The largest drop in numbers (34%) occurred in rural populations. The median for abandoned colonies was 16 nests, which was nearly six times lower than that for active rookeries (median = 99). General linear models (GLM) indicate that the abandonment of colonies depends on their location (village, small town, city), the size and number of nests, and the presence of other rookeries in the vicinity of those studied. The best-fit model describing rookery extinction invoked the number of nests and other colonies within a radius of < 10 km from the colony studied. In each of three analyzed radii (10, 20 and 30 km) the numbers of nests and other colonies were decidedly higher around extinct rookeries. Active Rook colonies were farther away from the nearest rookery, and also from large colonies consisting of 50, 100 and 150 nests. The probability that a rookery would be abandoned was strongly negatively correlated with its size.",

This decrease is usually quantified using data from several years, an approach that would mask any annual variation. We used 15 years of data from 295 nestboxes occupied by Blue Tit, Great Tit and Pied Flycatcher to determine whether the strength of the relationship between lay date and clutch size is consistent, or whether it varies annually. Both lay date and year were strong predictors of clutch size for all species. However, Generalised Linear Modelling revealed an interaction between lay date and year in the prediction of clutch size, indicating that the strength of the relationship between lay date and clutch size varied between years. Multilevel modelling was used to establish proximate factors that may be responsible for annual variability. Factors affecting the relationship between lay date and clutch size were species-specific. For Blue Tits, seasonal decline in clutch size was steepest when the density of all cavity-nesting species was high (47% variance explained). For Great Tits, decline was steepest in \"early\" seasons, particularly when density was high (32% variance explained), and for Pied Flycatchers, decline was steepest in warmer years (33% variance explained). Thus annually variable factors appear to influence not only breeding phenology and clutch size individually, but also the relationship between these variables.",

    "abstract": "Measurement error in morphological characters is an important issue for many ornithological studies (e.g. ecomorphology, quantitative studies of heritability, studies of systematic and geographic variation). The variation in external morphological characters, such as wing and tarsus length, is usually evaluated using multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA). These are often considered better than univariate statistical methods for explaining size and shape variation in bird populations because they reduce the 'dimensionality' of the data — the size of individual measures (wing etc.) are assumed to contain a component reflecting a general character 'size'. However, the effect of measurement error on principal components has not been formally assessed with respect to such data. Here we report three examples in order to assess the importance of measurement error for analyses within and between bird populations. The effect of measurement error on PCA is also discussed in relation to the importance of levels of error in shape components.Our results indicate that, in relation to size (PC1), principal component scores are affected less by measurement error if the covariance matrix is used rather than the correlation matrix. However, the effects of relative measurement error were substantially greater in subsequent axes, which represent shape variation rather than size, than they were in the size axis (PC1). Measurement error may, therefore, be a more important issue for shape axes than for the size axis and this problem may be exacerbated further if very few characters are used in the PCA. Our results also indicate that PCA is especially sensitive to issues relating to sample size. We recommend that if reducing the measurement error in size and shape measures is not possible, and the sample size is small (≤ 30), principal component scores should be derived using the covariance matrix, as these are more likely to give more robust results.",

    "abstract": "We tested a hypothesis on the influence of prey distribution on habitat selection by the Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina in north-eastern Poland during the breeding season. We analysed the habitat composition in schematic territories around the nests of 116 breeding pairs of eagles (in a radius of 3 km) and related them to randomly selected sites. Next, we compared the habitat requirements of potential prey species with the proportion of different prey categories found in the eagle's diet. We demonstrated that, in contrast to random sites, eagle nests were located closer to the forest edges. The habitat composition of schematic territories of eagles was different from the random sites owing to the lower proportion of forest and higher proportion of meadows and agricultural land. The feeding habits of Lesser Spotted Eagles were opportunistic, and the diet was composed mainly of rodents (voles), insectivorous mammals (hedgehogs and moles), small birds, and amphibians. Small prey species (body mass below 50 g) and species indicating preferences for open habitats dominated in the diet of eagles (69% and 74% of prey captured respectively). Prey species inhabiting grasslands were hunted more frequently than species preferring agricultural areas. Moreover, eagle pairs nesting deep in the forest interior captured relatively more larger-sized species, whereas the proportion of small prey in the eagle's diet increased as the distance of nest from forest edge decreased. We hypothesize that eagles have to breed closer to the forest edge to minimize energy expenditure and time associated with prey capture and delivery to the nest.",

This study presents the information on a Rock Sparrow population breeding in an alpine meadow at 3400 m altitude and compares the life history traits with their lower-altitude counterparts studied in Europe. The birds are resident all year round in this area. Nests of Rock Sparrows tended to cluster and were mainly located in abandoned burrows of the Ground Tit Parus humilis. Fairs were monogamous and territorial behaviors were absent, which differed from European populations, where Rock Sparrows show a series of mating systems and display strong territoriality around the nest site. Egg-laying took place between late May and late June, with every pair making a single nesting attempt. Clutch size averaged 5.1 ± 0.9, incubation undertaken by female only lasted 12.7 ± 0.8 days, and young in the nest were fed by both parents for 19.9 ± 0.7 days. Breeding success, measured as the proportion of nests with at least one fledgling, was 89%. Compared to their lower-altitude populations studied in Europe, the high-altitude Rock Sparrows start breeding later, experience a shorter breeding season, produce fewer but bigger eggs, and have a longer nestling period. Such a life history strategy that allows birds to allocate more energy into individual offspring should be adaptive to the harsh high-altitude conditions.",

It still remains unclear whether the species has the capacity to prey indistinctly on all types of fish, regardless of their position within the water column. The aim of our study was to test if kingfishers are able to select particular fish prey or if, by contrast, they feed on the most abundant and accessible fish. We identified the fish prey consumed by kingfishers at 14 nests in total, and also sampled, using electrofishing surveys, fish prey availability on the river stretches where the nests were located. We used Savage's index in order to check whether there was prey selection. Overall, kingfishers preyed upon eight fish species: Bermejuela Acondrostoma arcasii, Bleak Alburnus alburnus, Pyrenean Stone Loach Barbatula quignardi, Ebro Barbel Luciobarbus graellsii, Pyrenean Gudgeon Gobio lozanoi, Ebro Nase Parachondrostoma miegii, Pyrenean Minnow Phoxinus bigerri, and Brown Trout Salmo trutta. The most consumed prey were pelagic species (Pyrenean Minnow and Brown Trout). These results suggest that the Kingfisher preys on pelagic species because of their accessibility and avoids bottom-dwelling species, which may remain hidden from this predator, kingfishers preyed mostly on fish of 50 to 60 mm in length, but mean size values varied prey-specifically, possibly because of the vertical specific distribution in relation to the fish age and species and, finally, prey availability.",

    "abstract": "Relationships among cavity-nesting birds, trees, and wood decay fungi pose interesting management challenges and research questions in many systems. Ornithologists need to understand the relationships between cavitynesting birds and fungi in order to understand the habitat requirements of these birds. Typically, researchers rely on fruiting body surveys to identify the fungal players in these relationships. Fruiting body surveys enable nondestructive sampling, but vastly underestimate fungal presence and diversity and may miss species of critical importance to cavity- nesting birds; thus new methods for such analyses are necessary. Here we present a novel technique to nondestructively sample the wood inside tree cavities, which produces samples that can be processed using DNA-based methods to identify fungi. We tested our method on Red-cockaded Woodpecker Picoides borealis excavations, half of which were from trees with Porodaedalea pini fruiting bodies. Using our new approach, we detected P. pini in 90% of the excavations in trees with fruiting bodies, but also in 60% of the excavations in trees without fruiting bodies and identified nine additional taxa of wood decay fungi that did not have fruiting bodies present. Our approach offers improved detection of fungi through non-destructive sampling of excavated cavities and we developed an improved primer specific to the fungal phylum that contains most wood decay fungi (Basidiomycota), thus providing managers and researchers a critical tool to better determine which fungi are important to cavity-nesting birds.",

    "abstract": "Site quality may influence breeding performance especially in raptors showing strong territory fidelity as predicted by the site-dependent population regulation hypothesis. Thus, the occupancy of nest-sites is non-random, indicating a preference of certain territories, apparently of higher quality. During four breeding seasons (2003–2006), we recorded the occupancy rate and the number of young fledged from Lanner Falcon Falco biarmicus feldeggii nest-sites in eastern Sicily, Italy. Breeding sites with different occupancy rates showed significant differences in environmental attributes, mainly altitude. A generalised linear model revealed a significant effect of the slope of the nest-site on mean fledgling number per successful pair. In addition, the mean slope of the nest territory and the slope of the nest-site are the main predictors for differentiating the cliff selection by Lanners and by much more competitive Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrinus. Finally, our results suggest a crucial role of the high quality sites for the population viability. Occupancy rates were positively related to the mean number of young fledged per territorial pair and during the four years of the study period six high quality nest-sites raised 58% of young produced in the whole study area. We suggest that the annual production of young of the high quality territories should be preserved and that evaluation of the effective contribution of the low quality sites for the persistence of a viable population in Sicily should be performed.",

    "abstract": "Seed-eating birds may consume seeds in the tree (pre-dispersal predation) as well as on the ground (post-dispersal predation), usually at contrasting microhabitat conditions. We examined the foraging behaviour and contribution to seed predation of a whole assemblage of seed-eating birds (mostly Fringillidae) at both dispersal phases (pre- and post-dispersal) in a wind-dispersed tree, the European White Elm Ulmus laevis. We found that most seed predators were tree-feeding birds that prey upon seeds for longer periods in the tree and spend shorter periods in larger flocks foraging on the ground. We also obtained significant differences in predation speed among the seed predator species. The overall number of seeds consumed by birds, as well as the amount of time spent foraging in the tree, increased with increasing feeding heights. Seed availability increases with height, which seems to be the main reason why birds spend more time foraging on higher branches. Birds strongly differed in their perching coefficient (PC, ration of feeding height to distance from crown edge). Small finches such as Serins Serinus serinus and Goldfinches Carduelis carduelis had a very high value of PC in comparison to large finches such as Greenfinches Carduelis chloris, Chaffinches Fringilla coelebs, and Hawfinches Coccothraustes coccothraustes. In general, finches showed much higher values of PC than non-fringillid species, indicating a greater adaptation to perch and feed on more flexible stems. Birds increased their overall seed predation and the time allocated to foraging on the ground when they were in flocks. Small finches tended to follow larger finches and flock in multispecies groups when foraging on the ground. We suggest that this behaviour increases both feeding efficiency and safety. Further studies should take into account possible differences in behavior of seed-eating birds throughout the dispersal season since it may have important implications for their adaptive behavior to select new niches.",

Although these measures describe different aspects of population change, they are often used interchangeably when discussing the relationships between various predictors of bird population changes found in different studies. This hampers a meaningful comparison of results, because it is unclear which differences between studies are biologically relevant and which are just methodological artifacts, caused by the different nature of measures used to quantify population changes. We compared predictors of the three measures of population changes: (i) change in abundance, (ii) change in magnitude of population trend and (iii) change in distribution, using data collected in a single region, the Czech Republic, and over similar time periods. We also aimed to identify significant drivers of population changes of Czech birds, using a large set of predictor variables and virtually all species regularly breeding in the region. No significant predictors were common across the three measures of population change tested. Abundance increased mostly in forest birds, while the change in magnitude of population trend was positive in species with a higher level of legal protection and in r-selected species. Species extending their distribution include wetland birds, above-ground nesters and north European species. Although individual measures of population changes are positively correlated, their predictors are different. This limits possibilities of simple comparisons, but also offers a better insight into forces shaping bird population changes in time and space.",

    "abstract": "Due to their falling cost, unmanned aerial vehicles, often called drones, are increasingly used as a tool in bird research and conservation. However, behavioural responses of birds to flying drones are still not well understood, for example do birds recognize drones as predators, as benign, or as neutral elements? How do they react to drones? We answered these questions and described the behaviour of birds toward drones during a study with White Stork Ciconia ciconia in north-eastern Poland. We used a small quadrocopter and noted flight initiation distances (FID) of adult storks on nests and behavioural reactions of their young towards drones. During nest inspections by drone, adult White Storks showed FIDs of between 1 and 20 metres, but occasionally did not even flush during drone approaches. FID was mainly affected by breeding stage, but some storks even ignored the working drones close to the nest (14%). Birds that escaped from the nest at the egg stage, returned to it on average within 23 seconds. The most common reactions of young White Storks to the drone were scaring (42%) and akinesis (34%). The rapid return of adult storks to the nest, even when scared away, shows that drones are not an highly invasive tool for examining their breeding outputs, even during the most sensitive period, i.e. egg stage. We believe that drones will soon become an important and common tool in research of the White Stork for determining breeding success and examining nests for hazards, e.g. waste, strings or electrocution risk. Our research can be a useful guide to researchers for predicting stork behaviour during inspection of their nests in the near future.",

Successful nests were significantly smaller and denser than those that were predated. Nest size decreased significantly during the course of the breeding season and increased with nest height. The relationship between nest size and the likelihood of predation was still significant even when the effects of laying date and nest height were controlled. Nest size was negatively related to fledging success even when only successful nests were considered. This finding is contrary to the prediction of the \"sexual display\" hypothesis, which states that nest size is positively related to fledging success, and suggests that nest size may signal phenotypic quality through the ability in this species to build a small but compact nest. It seems that both natural selection and sexual selection have led to the evolution of small nests in the Olivaceous Warbler. This is the most likely reason why the difference in nest-size between predated and non-predated nests was apparent, even in unmanipulated settings.",

Females were sampled during incubation and during the chick-rearing period.

This habitat difference in condition was not explained by the differences in the start of egg-laying or clutch size. Females lost more mass from incubation to the chick-rearing stage in the coniferous than in the deciduous forests. Although the values of most blood parameters changed from incubation to the chick-rearing stage, no habitat-related change was observed. There were no habitat differences in the number and quality of fledglings or in female condition during the chick-rearing period.

Parents provisioning the nest allocated food accord- ing to begging by nestlings. Those nestlings that got fed begged nearer the parents, with lower latency and higher intensity, and stretched up to a greater height while begging. Moreover, the feeding rate was higher when more nestlings begged in the nest. There were slight differences between males and females with respect to prey type brought to the nest. Bigger nestlings got a larger proportion of food because they begged more intensely, but there was no evidence of parental favouritism towards bigger chicks.",

Species lists typically focus on recording rare and endangered species, usually by volunteers who watch birds during their free time, which may lead to an uneven distribution of observations during the week. We examine whether and to what extent a weekend bias exists in the recording by volunteers of rare bird species. We used a database summarizing 1679 records throughout Poland of 154 rare bird species represented by 2433 individual birds. The proportion of individual birds recorded during weekends was significantly higher than expected by chance. The proportion of records of rare birds that were made during weekends varied from 32.4% in July to 54.9% in November and the weekend bias was lowest during the summer holidays (i.e. July and August). Species varied in their weekend bias, however species size and conspicuousness scores did not explain species-specific weekend bias. Species richness as a function of sampled individuals did not differ between weekends and weekdays. We suggest that potential biases caused by increased weekend recording need to be considered when comparing abundances based on lists from different sites or seasons, e.g. in studies on the effect of weather on birds. Our results suggest that the weekend effect is not qualitative but only reflects changes in sampling effort across the week and therefore records from weekends and weekdays are comparable in term of species composition.",

    "abstract": "Plumage bacteria might influence the trade-off between parental and self-preening efforts in birds, therefore affecting breeding success. However, too little is known about natural variation patterns in plumage bacterial communities for these hypotheses to be thoroughly assessed. We studied the density and phylotypic richness of plumage bacterial assemblages in wild breeding populations of Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca and Great Tits Parus major in the same area and breeding season, using flow cytometry and ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA). The density of plumage bacteria was higher in Tits than in Flycatchers, providing evidence that bacterial microflora differs even between co-occurring hosts that share habitat, nest site and foraging preferences. It is concurrent with the finding that migratory birds might have lower bacterial loads than sedentary birds. In both species bacterial loads were higher in females than in males, which along with two earlier studies, indicates the generality of this sex pattern. A negative correlation between parental body mass and the richness of feather-degrading bacterial phylotypes was found in Pied Flycatchers. In Great Tits, higher bacterial densities in the plumage of parent birds were associated with the production of fewer fledglings. However, the causality of these associations remains to be tested experimentally.",

We study the effect of group breeding on the reproductive biology of the Carrion Crow Corvus corone, a species that was usually described as non-cooperative. Our study population is located at the southern limit of the distribution of the species, which confers special characteristics to its breeding biology. Early breeders had a significantly larger clutch size and produced a higher number of fledglings. Replacement clutches were very rare and always unsuccessful, contrary to what happens in other European Carrion Crow populations. More than half of the breeding attempts (66.1%) in our study area showed cooperative breeding but it had only a significant effect on laying date — group-breeding females laid eggs significantly earlier than did pair-breeding females. We also explored brood parasitism by Great Spotted Cuckoos Clamator glandarius on the reproductive success of Carrion Crows. Brood parasitism reduced the number of both hatched nestlings and fledglings. However, group-breeding and pair-breeding nests had similar probabilities of being parasitized. Finally, we also examined the effect of some meteorological variables on the breeding performance of Carrion Crows. The average precipitation during the nestling period was positively related with number of fledglings raised.",

We addressed this question in the case of the European Roller Coracias garrulus, an endangered species listed in Annex I of the European Union directive for bird conservation. For secondary hole-nesting birds, such as rollers, the breeding micro- and macrohabitat selection may rely on the location of the nest hole in a tree and its immediate surrounding environment as well as the larger scale foraging habitat. We used both of these criteria to compare the characteristics of Green Woodpecker Picus viridis holes that either were or were not occupied by breeding pairs of the European Roller. Our study was carried out in an agricultural landscape of southeastern France where the population of European Roller is trending towards an increase. When compared to unoccupied holes, occupied holes were at a lower height (approx. 6 m above ground) and were preferentially located in dead trees with other holes in close vicinity. Occupied holes were also located in landscapes with lower land use intensity (i.e., higher proportions of meadows, fallow lands, and fewer hedgerows and built areas) than non-occupied holes. Finally, fallow lands and meadows harboured more Orthoptera, an important food resource for rollers, than other land cover categories. Thus, our results highlight the importance of these land covers for the species management and indicate that they may be favourable areas for nest-box provisioning.",

Therefore patterns of variation in blood haemoglobin content of wild birds are an important aspect of functional ecology. In this paper we report results concerning variation in haemoglobin concentration in the blood of adult Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major during the nestling rearing period (days 7–15 of nestlings life) of first broods in central Poland in 2003–2009. The most important findings of this study are: (i) average haemoglobin concentration in blood differs between Blue Tits and Great Tits, with higher values in Blue Tits; (ii) males differ from females in both these species, with higher values in females, and (iii) there is also significant variation among years, with parallel tendencies for both species. We explain the patterns of haemoglobin content variation in adult tits by differences in metabolic demands for oxygen transported by blood. The demands are higher for the smaller-bodied species (Blue Tits), heavier working sex (females) and in years with worse physical and trophic conditions, though only non-significant relationships with weather conditions (temperature and rainfall) or food availability (measured by frassfall) were found during our long-term study.",

The reproductive value hypothesis predicts that the risk assumed by adults should increases with nestling age, whereas the risk of harm-to-offspring hypothesis predicts the opposite pattern. We assessed the risk-taking behaviour of nesting males and females Northern House Wrens, Troglodytes aedon, faced with a predation threat (plastic owl model) when rearing 3–4 and 10–12 days old nestlings. We used the time elapsed until parents first entered the nest-box as a measure of risk-taking behaviour and alarm calling rate as a proxy of nest defence. Females resumed sooner parental activities when exposed to the model when nestlings were young, supporting the risk of harm-to-offspring hypothesis. In contrast, the time lasted to resume parental duties by males did not differ between nestling ages. Alarm calling rate increased with the nestling stage, as predicted by the reproductive value hypothesis. We suggest that nesting House Wrens responded to both nestling requirements and to the reproductive value of the brood, assuming greater risks when nestlings are more vulnerable and a more intense nest defence when nestlings are older.",

We presented a stuffed Black-billed Magpie Pica pica to 19 pairs of sparrows. To assess the defence intensity we used the \"risk index\", increasing with time spent reacting and riskiness of the reaction (number of approaches and attacks), while declining with increasing distance from the predator. Females did not adjust their nest defence to the brood value and males did so only partially, tending to defend the early broods more intensely, which marginally supports the \"value of offspring hypothesis\". The birds did not adjust their nest defence to quality or defence intensity of their partners, thus the \"differential allocation hypothesis\" was not supported. Male nest defence was more intense than in females and increased with male badge size.

The importance of tide in such ecosystems is well studied for aquatic species such as waders, but its impact on the stopover behavior of land birds that also depend on these sites is still unknown. Bluethroats Luscinia svecica are small-sized passerines that feed on the ground and low vegetation and, therefore, experience continuous changes of habitat availability due to the tide regimens. The aim of this study was to analyse the habitat use and to test the impact of tide on home range size of Bluethroats stopping over at coastal marshes. For that, we used data on radio-tagged birds at a tidal marsh in Northern Iberia. Bluethroats were radiotracked from the 20th of August to the 20th of September. Individuals were surveyed from 3 to 17 days, and birds with lower body mass at the day of capture stayed for longer period. Mean home range size was 2.0 ha (SE = 0.2), and the main habitats occupied were reedbeds (ca. 30% of a home range area) together with tidal flats with both free- and low-halophytic vegetation (30%). Reedbeds were situated at a higher altitude over the sea level than open waters, mudflats and low halophytic vegetation. Home ranges tended to be larger in birds found to occupy zones close to the sea level, thus with a longer tide-mediated flooding period, suggesting a negative effect of tide on home range size, and/or that Bluethroats staying at lower altitude did not find as much food as at higher altitude, so they were forced to move over larger surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Woodpeckers are important primary excavators that produce nest-sites that are also used by several other cavity-nesting animals. However, the value of nest sites produced by different woodpecker species for other cavity-nesters is not generally known. We studied old Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus cavities to examine their importance for other cavity-nesting forest bird species. Over a 31-year period (1987–2017), we annually monitored the occupancy of 655 cavities excavated by the Three-toed Woodpecker in 86 territories of the species in a 170-km2 area in southern Finland. Eight bird species used old Three-toed Woodpecker cavities for breeding, and the occupancy of these cavities by all secondary users was 21.3%. The expected mean number of lifetime occupancies by secondary cavity-nesters for a single cavity was 2.03. This is equivalent to a mean of two cavities occupied per territory per year, if we assume that Three-toed Woodpeckers produce a new cavity every year. The actual numbers of annually occupied cavities by secondary cavity-nesters can be substantially lower especially in territories that are not constantly occupied by the Threetoed Woodpecker. Based on the use of old cavities and densities of secondary cavity-nesting bird species, we conclude that cavities made by Three-toed Woodpeckers are most significant for the species itself, which accounted for 23.3% of nests in old Three-toed Woodpecker cavities. When Three-toed Woodpeckers reused an old cavity rather than occupy a freshly excavated cavity, 93% of cavities selected were originally excavated by Three-toed Woodpeckers. In addition, old cavities are important for the Pygmy Owl Glaucidium passerinum — up to 26–31% of breeding attempts were in old Three-toed Woodpecker cavities. The importance of old cavities for other hole-nesting bird species like the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca or the Great Tit Parus major was rather minor considering their densities within woodpecker territories.",

We studied Nuthatch nestling food composition along with availability of its presumed main food resource — folivorous caterpillars — in a primeval forest, free from direct human impact (Białowieża National Park, Poland), in 1998–2004. Food brought to young during 4281 feeding visits (235 broods) was recorded. Nestlings were fed mostly caterpillars (53% of visits), but winged insects (14%), beetles (11%) and spiders (10%) were also regularly provided. The proportion of caterpillars increased with increasing caterpillar availability (measured by frassfall), with a maximum around the seasonal peaks and a later decline. The proportion of caterpillars in the diet was lower on days when frassfall was low (< 0.1 g/0.25 m2/day), irrespective of the temporal distance from the frass peak, while the proportion of winged insects increased on such days. Above the 0.1 g frassfall threshold, the proportion of caterpillars regularly exceeded 50%, reaching 90% on individual days. As in the majority of years the 'caterpillars' remained above the 0.1 g level over long periods, this could account for a comparably small interyear variation in the proportion of caterpillars in the diet, despite nearly tenfold differences in caterpillar abundance across years. 'Caterpillars' were brought significantly less often to the smallest, 5-day old, nestlings (52%), than to older ones (64%, 71% and 72% for 10-, 15- and 20-days old young, respectively). Spiders were most often provided to the smallest nestlings.",

Natal and breeding dispersal was studied in the migratory population of the Mute Swan Cygnus olor in Poland. The species showed male-biased natal dispersal with mean dispersal distance of 99.7 ± 20.0 km for males and 17.7 ± 5.4 km for females. Consistently, larger proportion of female swans showed natal philopatry, when compared with males (36.4% vs. 9.1%). The dispersal distance has shortened over the last three decades. This tendency prevailed in males and was associated with reduction in annual migration distance due to milder winters and adaptation for wintering in urban areas. Analysis of breeding dispersal showed that only 12.3% of breeding attempts were associated with changing territories (N = 945). Breeding dispersal distance was female-biased (0.66 ± 0.19 km for females vs. 0.35 ± 0.14 for males; N = 316 individuals). Occurrence of mate-switching and poor reproductive success were positively associated with probability of dispersal, but moving to a new territory did not increase breeding output in a season following dispersal event. Dispersive behaviour in the Mute Swan may be perceived as a part of species-specific ecological flexibility, allowing individuals to adjust to the changing conditions at the breeding grounds.",

In the present study we provided a countrywide profile of autumn crane migration across Italy between 2001 and 2007 (486 records). To investigate the association of climatic characteristics with temporal and spatial migration patterns, we used weather data and climate anomalies over 60 years (1948–2007; NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project database). Autumn migration showed different phenological patterns along two main migratory routes: 1) a Southern Italy route and 2) a Northern Italy route. The Southern route, across the lower Adriatic Sea was only partially described before, and more inferred than documented, whereas the Northern route, across the Po River plain, resulted as a new flyway, never described before. Crane migrations along the Northern route occurred 7 to 14 days earlier than along the Southern one. Along both routes, we detected mass migration events concurring with particular weather conditions: the use of Southern route was associated with southward winds in the Balkans, the records along Northern route with high pressure and favourable westward winds in Central Europe and in the main stop-over site (Hortobágy) of likely origin. In the last 60 years, the occurrence of the latter weather configurations has slightly, but consistently, increased, suggesting that the Northern route may have recently established as an alternative route for the cranes migrating from Eastern Europe, joining the two traditional continental routes (the West-European, and the Baltic-Hungarian).",

These changes appear to depend on both air temperatures during the winter and the prosperity of the city's inhabitants, who feed ducks with bread and scraps of food.

    "abstract": "Studies dealing with the individual survival of birds in open populations usually estimate survival according to capture-recapture models like the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS). In fact, these models estimate local apparent survival (ϕ), which is a combination of the probabilities of true survival (S) and site-fidelity (F), i.e. death and emigration are confounded. These S and F parameters can be estimated by using 'robust' models (e.g. Barker's model), which use additional resighting and dead reports data. We aim to compare the results (and associated biological implications) obtained by analysing juvenile and adult survival in a Polish urban population of Blackbirds Turdus merula using both the CJS and Barker models. Our CJS models estimated high ϕ values for both juvenile and adult birds (0.48 and 0.62, respectively). The lower scores for juveniles could be interpreted as low juvenile overwintering survival. By fitting Barker models to the same dataset we determined that juvenile site fidelity was lower than that of adults (0.91 and 0.93, respectively), so natal dispersal was slightly greater than breeding dispersal. The high fidelity causes similarity between apparent survival and true survival parameters (S: 0.51 for juveniles, 0.64 for adults). The results are comparable with data from other urban populations. Thus, using robust models certainly allows one to reduce the noise of movements confounding and/or masking survival probabilities, but one can also determine the individual or environmental variables affecting any of them separately.",

Repeated visual observations of food brought to young in over 500 broods, during 14 seasons (1993–2007), showed that Marsh Tit used a highly specialised diet in rearing young. Soft-bodied, folivorous caterpillars typically composed > 80% of the nestling diet both in riverine and oak-hornbeam habitat. Spiders formed the second most important prey type (c. 12%). Diet composition fluctuated across years but the proportion of caterpillars in the diet remained high (70–90%) despite more than hundredfold variation in the caterpillars' supply across years. Within years, diet composition changed with nestling age and the broods' synchronisation with the seasonal peak of caterpillars availability. Young that were fed within 15 days before and 10 days after the peak received a high (> 80%) proportion of caterpillars, independent of their age. The share of caterpillars in the diet dropped only outside of that period. In most seasons, Marsh Tit young appeared in nests more than two weeks before the caterpillar peak; consequently, the share of caterpillars fed to small young in the earliest broods was lowest (c. 62% on average). Marsh Tits strove to collect caterpillars even when they were scarce, rather than switch to alternative food types. Spiders were brought in highest numbers (up to 20%) to the youngest (1–7 days old) nestlings. This suggests that spiders contained specific nutritional ingredients required by the small young.",

    "abstract": "A reasonably-complete bird inventory is the crucial starting point for the analysis of the bird community. We evaluated the efficiency of point counts in detecting forest birds and verified how many sampling points or occasions are needed to adequately characterize the bird community. We sampled birds in 5 forest stands (conifer and beech forests) from northern to southern Italy in 2012. Sampling (through aural and visual clues) lasted 5 minutes, during which species were recorded. Data were analysed in relation to both the number of sampling points and the number of sampling occasions. Then, estimates of species richness were compared to random resampling of subsets of the original data. Results showed that after 3.8 sampling occasions (out of 19–24 sampling points) or 10.4 sampling points (given points are sampled 5 times), the species coverage of each community approached, or exceeded, the 90% threshold. Also, no difference in the mean values emerged with the subset estimates, but the latter appeared less precise. Our results suggest that the density of 1 sampling point per every 5 ha, each repeated at least 3 times, can represent an adequate optimization of the sampling effort. We provided useful methodological information for planning bird inventories in forest environments (applicable at least for Mediterranean and south-European mountain forests) when personnel and financial resources are limited, leading to a thoughtful fund management whilst providing a method to evaluate the reliability of species coverage for bird surveys.",

    "abstract": "Post-fledging behaviour and mortality between the place of birth and wintering sites can be crucial to populations of raptors. We studied this phenomenon during the autumn migration of immature Red Kite Milvus milvus using telemetry data on the population breeding in western Poland. In total 34 immatures from 17 nests were ringed and GPS–GSM transmitters were attached, but only half of them survived the post-fledging period and started their first migration to wintering sites. The main mortality factors after fledging were collisions with power lines (6 individuals — 26.1%) and poisoning in wintering grounds (3 individuals — 8.8%). The mean (± SD) duration of migration and the mean distance between the breeding and wintering sites were 91.5 ± 45.2 day (range: 27–236) and 1328.0 ± 442.4 km (range: 690–2070), respectively. The daily mean speed of migration was 17.8 ± 9.4 km/day. On migration kites stopped on average 4.3 ± 3.1 times (range 1–12) for longer than 3 days, and spent a total of 37.5 ± 10.7 days (range 20–51) at stopovers. The migration duration was negatively correlated with the day of beginning of the migration, i.e. birds that started to migrate late in the season reached the wintering grounds faster. However, when the number of days at stopovers was excluded from the migration duration, this relationship was not significant, which means that the total number of days that kites spent at stopover sites significantly influenced the total duration of autumn migration. The wintering sites of birds from western Poland were located in the Iberian Peninsula and southern France and less important was Greece where single bird followed. Regular stopping over of immature Red Kites during their autumn migration indicates the need to focus more on protecting the staging areas.",

The Yelkouan Shearwater Puffinus yelkouan nests mainly in pre-existing cavities and to a lesser extent in cavities it excavates. We have monitored breeding colonies of the Yelkouan Shearwater on two islands of the Hyères archipelago, south-east of France, for nine years to analyse nest-cavity and mate selection, to evaluate nest-cavity and mate fidelity, and to investigate their relationships with reproductive performance. Yelkouan Shearwaters selected nest-cavities providing a high degree of concealment and protection. Reproductive performance and fidelity to cavity were highest in deep cavities with a winding tunnel and a steep slope around the entrance. Mating was assortative for bill and tarsus measurements. High rates of return to the same cavity (94.7%) and mate (95.5%) were recorded. Fidelity to nest-cavity was highest when breeding succeeded the previous year (fidelity rate: 97.3% in successful breeders vs. 87.8% in unsuccessful breeders) and was most likely to result in successful breeding the same year (breeding success: 67.5% in faithful breeders vs. 43.8% in movers). The rate of divorce was low (4.5%), did not differ between islands and was not associated with breeding performance. However, breeding success increased by 22.2 ± 9.9% after mate change following a divorce or the absence of a previous mate. Such high rates of nest-cavity and mate fidelity could indicate a good population status with breeding habitat, food resource and mates of good quality.",

We expected that Tawny Owls responded to changes in land use practices, stemming from a change in both political and economic system, which may affect prey abundance and composition, breeding performance and demography. To analyze temporal changes in monitored parameters, we divided the study period into three phases (1978–1989, 1990–2001 and 2002–2014), corresponding to different socio-economic conditions. The number of nesting pairs of Tawny Owls decreased significantly in the last 13 years of the study, but the number of successful pairs fluctuated without any trend. The clutch size and number of nestlings varied without significant trends, but nesting success improved over the last 13 years. Annual apparent survival probability of the female Tawny Owls did not vary significantly over the study period (model averaged values between 0.71 and 0.73). Owls occupied nestboxes irrespective to the distance from the agricultural land during the first two study periods, but since early 2000s, owls tended to occupy nestboxes located deeper in the forest. Birds and small mammals were similarly important as prey items by biomass. Since the 1990s, the share of Microtus voles significantly decreased in the diet, while that of birds increased. In summary, changes in the diet, improved nesting success of the Tawny Owl and tendency of nesting in forest interior may indicate ongoing complex responses to the changes in environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Human-induced habitat changes have been typically linked to negative effects on native species, but an increasing number of studies show that many species are unaffected by these changes or even benefited from them. The Burrowing Owl Athene cunicularia is a raptor species that has deserved special attention in recent years due to its capacity to live in a variety of natural and modified habitats. In this study, we analyzed habitat characteristics that determine the habitat selection of the Burrowing Owl at the nest-patch, territory and landscape scales in the Pampas of Argentina. We performed broadcasting call surveys to evaluate presence-absence of owls at random points. In addition, we measured habitat variables in the field and used satellite imagery to obtain land-use information. We used Generalized Linear Models to explore the influence of habitat variables on the probability of occupancy by Burrowing Owls. Our results indicate that Burrowing Owls demonstrate good ability to live in a wide variety of habitat types and with different disturbance levels in the Pampas. At the nest-patch scale, which includes the nest-site and the surrounding patch around it, the presence of owls was positively associated with the horizontal visibility and was influenced by the land-cover type. At the territory scale, the occurrence of owls was positively associated with the presence of active (non-vegetated) dunes and negatively with croplands. At the landscape scale, the presence of owls was negatively associated with the disturbance level and positively with the amount of borders between habitats. A unique multi-scale model containing variables of the three spatial scales was more robust to explain variation in Burrowing Owl occupancy patterns than any single-scale model. This would reveal the hierarchical nature of habitat selection by Burrowing Owls in the Pampas, comparable to that observed in North American populations.",

Different preferences for foraging sites can also be found in males and females, which may minimize competition for food between them. The main goal of our study was to define sex-specific use of foraging sites of the Great Spotted Woodpecker, in the primeval oak-hornbeam-lime forest of the Białowieża National Park, E Poland. This forest has never been logged and is distinguished by the structure of great vertical and horizontal diversity, high amount of dead wood and trees which reach large dimensions. Therefore, there are a large number of potential foraging sites, and some trees, due to their species or condition, may be particularly preferred in this respect. Our study revealed that the foraging sessions of woodpeckers were longer on the dead parts of trees than on alive ones which were especially noticeable in the case of females. The longest foraging sessions were found on dead parts of Norway Spruce Picea abies for both sexes. The males foraged the longest at high altitudes (> 20 m above the ground) on thin parts of trees (diameter 5–10 cm) whereas females on sites above 15 m and on thicker parts of tree (diameter 10–20 cm). Moreover, the duration of foraging session of females increased with increasing of trunk diameter at breast height, which was not revealed in males.",

    "abstract": "Tree cavities are an essential resource for cavity-dwelling mammals, birds, invertebrates and fungi, and so are important for maintaining forest biodiversity. In North American forests, woodpeckers (Picidae) play a keystone role in cavity creation by excavating holes. However, in European forests many hole-nesting songbirds rely on non-excavated cavities that are formed by fungal decay and compartmentalization after tree damage. Several factors are recognised in initiating non-excavated cavities that are used by hole-nesting birds, including loss of a tree branch or stem breakage, but this topic is poorly studied. Here, we propose that bark stripping by large herbivores (e.g. Red Deer Cervus elaphus and European Bison Bison bonasus) could be another important, and previously overlooked, mechanism for initiating tree cavities that are used by hole-nesting birds. We suggest that, after the initial damage from herbivore bark-stripping, fungal decay can create specific elongated, slit-like cavities, which are particularly important as nest sites for some common forest songbirds. We outline this idea using original observations and evidence from the literature, primarily from the primeval forest in Poland's Białowieża National Park. We also use studies from elsewhere in Europe to show a generally low usage of slit cavities by birds where large herbivores are scarce or absent. We suggest that restoring such animals in European forests could help to restore the abundance and diversity of the tree cavity resource for hole-dwelling species. We encourage future research to investigate this proposal of large herbivores being important agents of tree cavity formation that could enhance biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Studies on the diet composition of bird species provide valuable insights on their habitat use, trophic interactions and prey selection. Prey abundance can drive movements of raptors in their wintering grounds. But such links have been difficult to establish due to the lack of dietary information for most raptor species. Estimating the wintering diet of raptors is a challenge that requires extensive fieldwork across a large geographical area which is often not possible. The methods used in breeding sites such as nest observations are not available in the non-breeding regions. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the use of web-sourced photographs as a tool for understanding the diet of raptors and also the need for combining multiple approaches to get a comprehensive overview of diet. In this study, we use a novel approach by using web-sourced photographs and pellets to estimate the variations in the diet of Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus, a species in decline, across its wintering range in India. A total of 232 photographs and 391 pellets collected across western India, Deccan and south India during autumn, winter and early spring seasons were analysed. About 53% of photographs and 71% of pellets contained orthopterans, forming the major component of the harrier's diet. The proportion of reptiles, eggs and birds in the diet were similar across both methods. Presence of other insects in the diet was better estimated by photographs (23%) than pellets (8%) while rodent presence was higher in pellets (17%) than photographs (4%). Pellet analysis and photographs showed similar variation in diet across seasons while only pellets showed variation in diet across regions. Photographs also showed that there is significant variation in diet between the sexes of the species, with higher presence of insects and reptiles in the diet of males than females. Our results suggest that a combination of photographs and pellet analysis provide better estimates of wintering diet of Montagu's Harriers.",

    "abstract": "As a result of intensified agriculture, farmland in Europe is the habitat where the most pronounced changes have occurred in recent decades. In parallel, breeding populations of birds have been declining over much of Europe. Today, farmland has the largest proportion of Red-List species. This paper reviews studies on the impact of agriculture on birds breeding in the farmland ecosystems of Europe: breeding bird density in relation to farming practice, effects of agriculture on foraging and feeding ecology while rearing young, and consequences for breeding success.Specialised bird species are most affected by farming practice. They are rare or even absent in intensively managed farmland with a much reduced habitat and structural diversity. As crops grow fast and as their vegetation is very dense, large fields become inaccessible to or unprofitable for ground feeding birds. To exploit alternative food resources, parents feeding nestlings have to cover larger distances to isolated and distant food patches. Reduced food availability in modern farmland and increased time and energy costs of foraging may result in lower body conditions of parent birds and their broods, in a reduced breeding success and lower survival. Some species breeding in intensively farmed areas are at least locally unable to produce sufficient recruits to maintain their numbers in the long term.Our knowledge of the breeding ecology and population dynamics of farmland birds is growing, but it is still based mainly on short-term and small-scale case studies on a few species. Little is known about whether measures to improve habitat quality (e.g. set-asides) are adequate to halt negative trends in bird populations. Hence, there is a need for internationally coordinated scientific work with important implications for conservation.",

Breeding density was best predicted by the diversity of trees in the plot and was not limited by the presence of tall trees. Birds used 69% of the available tree species and preferentially selected half of them. Taller tree species were preferred to shorter ones and coniferous trees were preferred to broadleaved ones. Nests higher above the ground were more likely to be successful than nests lower down. The greater the nest height, the earlier the Magpies laid eggs and the more fledglings they produced. Pairs nesting in conifers laid earlier than those in broadleaved trees but there were no significant differences in clutch-size, hatching or fledging success between the two habitats. The nest site preference was not well explained by the success rate. Regardless of species, not only tall trees, where success was greater, were preferred but also smaller ones, despite the lower success rate. Nests in conifers were no more successful than those in broadleaved trees, despite the marked preference for conifers. Magpies that succeeded in their final breeding attempts in one season were less likely to make a contrasting nest-site choice the following season. The lack of a clear adjustment between the nest-site selection pattern and breeding success was hypothesized to be due to two non-exclusive mechanisms: 1) either there are no strong selective pressures at any type of nest-site and on the behavioral plasticity of Magpies or else selective pressures may change during the season; 2) the dependence of nest-site selection on bird quality.",

In a similar pattern of trapping, more than four times as many shrikes were caught during autumn than in spring. Males migrated significantly earlier than females in spring but not during the autumn migration, which suggests that in males there is a stronger drive to reach their breeding territories early. In both seasons and between both sexes we did not find any significant relations between the body measurements of individuals and the time of passage. The spring migration was much shorter time than the autumn migration. This was expressed by the minimum stopover duration, as well as by the time when Red-backed Shrike occurred in Eilat. There are significant differences between wing chord length, body mass and fat scores between seasons. In autumn males had longer wings, and both sexes were heavier and in better condition than in spring. The data suggest that the differences are an adaptation to their having to cross the Sahara Desert. The birds spend a statistically significantly shorter period of time at the Eilat stopover site in spring than in autumn (median 1 ± 1.5 days vs 5 ± 6.5 days). In autumn, recaptured birds were 6.3% heavier than during the first capture. The change in body mass was significantly correlated to the duration of the stopover period. The results suggest that migration over desert is energetically costly and that Eilat is a very important stopover site for migrating Red-backed Shrikes.",

In all, 180 Great Grey Shrike nests were found — 114 (63.3%) in conifers, 66 (36.7%) in deciduous trees. This population's reproductive parameters were relatively high in comparison to those of other European populations: mean clutch size — 6.6, hatching success — 92.5%, mean brood size — 5.72, mean number of fledglings per pair — 4.1, mean number of fledged young per successful pair — 5.25. Eggs (mean 27.1 × 19.9 mm) were found to be larger than reported in the literature. Nesting success was similar in both study plots, but there was slight seasonal variability: 41.0%–52.6% from 99 nesting attempts in the first plot, 42.1%–43.7% from 37 nests in the second. Predation was the main cause of nest losses. Plastic string used as nesting material appeared to be the most important cause of partial failures: 13 (8.2%) of a total of 147 nestlings surviving to fledging perished as a result of becoming tangled up in it. Nestlings rarely starved. Nests in linear habitats suffered significantly higher breeding losses (78.6%) than those in non-linear habitats (50%). The high fitness values obtained from this population were probably due to traditional farming practices, the sparing use of pesticides and the good potential food source.",

It currently numbers around 650 individuals that live in four isolated populations (Lower Silesian Forest, Janów Lubelski Forest, Carpathians, Augustów Forest). This study investigated genetic variability based on the polymorphism of six microsatellite loci in the surviving Polish populations of the Capercaillie and compares the results with the analogous variability in two large, contiguous populations in Russia. The following parameters were estimated: mean number of alleles per locus, allelic richness, mean effective number of alleles per locus, heterozygosity in each of the populations investigated. Differentiation between pairs of populations was assessed using FST. The results show that despite some inevitable reduction in genetic variability, most of the Polish populations retained a substantial level of microsatellite polymorphism. Only in the population from Janów Lubelski Forest was there a significant reduction in variability, probably due to long isolation and the recent decline. That this population has long been isolated was also confirmed by the pronounced genetic differentiation from the other Polish populations. The Carpathian population of the Capercaillie was found to be genetically structured, and in the Lower Silesian Forest population heterozygosity was low, possibly as a result of the lek mating system and also the dramatic reduction in numbers.",

Observations of individually marked birds were conducted from blinds located at city-centre sites where Feral Pigeons breed. The pigeons bred throughout the year, with peak broods in spring and summer. Different pairs timed their breeding such that the beginning of the season (from October to September of the next calendar year) overlapped the dates of completion (from April to December). 10% of pairs had already begun breeding in the autumn, while 86% did so between January and May. The remaining pairs (young ones, in particular) started breeding even later, mainly because of the lack of suitable nesting sites. The breeding period most often ended between August and October (75% of pairs), when the pigeons began their moult. 91% of the young birds joined the breeding population in their second calendar year of life. The remaining young birds had their first broods in the first or third calendar year of life. Pairs of young birds started nesting 2–3 months later than adult birds. The average length of a pair's breeding season was 183 days.",

The combined cartographic method together with voice stimulation (playback) was used during the study. The birds' reaction to the playback was also assessed. It was found that the woodpeckers reacted most strongly to voice stimulation in March and April, which led to a high rate of discovering breeding sites during this period. During the breeding period (May-June) the birds reacted less strongly to playback, which significantly decreased our ability to find their territories. The woodpeckers most often reacted to vocal provocation by drumming and emitting alarm calls, which permitted rapid confirmation of the birds' presence in their territories. During the three years of the study, respectively 29, 41 and 35 Syrian Woodpecker breeding pairs were confirmed, giving a mean density of 1.2–1.7 pairs/10 km2 for the entire study area, and 13.8–19.5 pairs/10 km2 calculated for the area of optimal habitat, such as orchards, tree lines and the scattered tree growth associated with human settlements (21 km2). The densities noted are among the highest found in both Poland and Europe.",

The entire period of the nestlings' stay in the nest (1–10th day of life) was also considered. The ambient temperature did not influence the size of losses at either stage of the nestling life. Rainfall affected the size of nestling losses in the periods when they were 6–10 and 1–10 days old. The influence of rainfall explained only 11% of nestling losses.

There is some controversy as to whether these patterns result from opportunistic feeding behavior or from prey size selectivity leading to food-niche segregation among predators. This study examined the effects of body size on the diet of avian predators in the sagebrush habitat of north-eastern Utah. The assessment was based on data collected from the analysis of pellet contents and was deliberately confined to mammalian components, almost exclusively from rodents. A significant positive relationship was found between predator size and both average and maximum prey size, but no such correlation was found for the minimum body size of prey. In general, there was considerable overlap in the rodent prey taken by different raptors, suggesting opportunistic feeding behavior in these predators. However, the size (and species) of rodent prey that contributed most to the consumed biomass was different for each bird species and correlated well with its body size. The revealed pattern of larger raptors acquiring most biomass (energy) from larger prey, implies food selectivity based on its energetic profitability, and niche segregation that could facilitate the coexistence of a high diversity of avian predators in the sagebrush habitat. The possible role of food limitation and competition in the evolution of body size in raptors and the consequences of size-dependent predation are discussed.",

Vertebrates constituted 3.8%, with reptiles and mammals being the main prey of this type (1.8% each). Despite the small size of the invertebrates, this group reached > 60% in terms of biomass. All the main prey items varied significantly among seasons. Odonata was the most important group in all seasons, reaching its maximum value in summer. In the case of vertebrates, reptiles were captured mainly in spring, mammals in winter. With regard to indirect interaction with seeds, a total of 901 seeds associated with lizard remains were found in 77 pellets, indicating that they had previously been consumed by these reptiles. External visual damage of seeds was low and only 1.1% was destroyed. No seeds germinated after the four-month germination experiment and practically all of them were unviable. In conclusion, these results indicate that Grey Heron diet on islands varies in comparison with continental zones, including an important number of invertebrates and reptiles. Furthermore, this bird acts as an opportunistic secondary seed disperser, although its ecological effect does not seem to be very significant for the dynamics of the Canary Island ecosystems.",

However, in socially monogamous birds with low breeding abundance, such as the Red-backed Shrike, extra-pair paternity (EPP) was thought to be an exceptional and random incident. Drawing on samples collected in an unusually dense Red-backed Shrike population in the Czech Republic, we show through DNA microsatellite typing that among 65 chicks from 15 nests, 10 individuals (26.5%) had been sired by males other than the nest-attending social mate. All 10 extra pair young were of male sex. In all cases, genetic fathers of extra pair young stemmed from neighbouring territories. Extra pair fathers had significantly longer tarsi than social mates, indicating that female choice was a function of age-class dependent male body size. Our findings support sex allocation theory, which suggests that promiscuous females mating with higher quality males should produce mostly sons.",

    "abstract": "Producing high quality offspring of good logical performance, able to survive to independence and, then, to reproductive maturity is a major component of life history strategies. The ability of nestling altricial birds to develop a good physiological condition depends to a large extent on the amount and quality of food provided by parents, as well as other aspects of parental care. We hypothesized that experimental changes to the original brood size should affect both parental Blue Tits and their offspring, resulting in corresponding changes in the body condition of the nestlings. Over two breeding seasons, using two habitat sites, we conducted an experiment with two manipulative treatments applied to broods of three-day-old nestlings — the reduction or enlargement of broods by three nestlings, and one non-manipulative control treatment. Our aim was to test whether the experiment would affect a number of different measures of nestling condition: blood concentrations of hemoglobin and glucose, heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and morphometric condition index, all being analyzed when the nestlings were 13 days old. We found no effect in the case of hemoglobin, despite the fact that it had previously been shown to be sensitive to large-scale differences in trophic conditions between habitats and years and to the experimental removal of nest parasites. All the remaining variables, i.e. heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, glucose concentration and morphometric condition index, responded to the experimental treatments, showing different but reasonable patterns of variation. We suggest that an experimental increase in brood size definitely hinders the development of nestling physiological condition, but even an experimental reduction of broods can affect some physiological indicators (glucose), probably because of readjustments in the feeding rate.",

Testosterone levels, defense activity, prey supply for broods and reproductive performance were related to breeding density and breeding experience of males. Defense activity, as measured by responses to broadcasted hooting calls and dummy owls during the territorial period, correlated positively with testosterone concentration. Males with more breeding experience had high testosterone levels and occupied better territories in dense breeding areas than less experienced males which had low testosterone concentrations. Mate fidelity was linked male quality: females were more likely to be tenacious in good territories. Testosterone levels dropped between territorial and feeding periods, however males with higher concentrations fed nestlings more frequently with high mass prey per night because food was more abundant in territories they had secured. We suggest that differences in testosterone levels in the provisioning period are related to the males' abilities to acquire territories of different quality.",

Here we studied the spatial needs and habitat selection of the endangered Aquatic Warbler at a major migration stopover site in France, the nature reserve of the Seine estuary. We radio-tracked 15 migrant birds in August 2008 to study habitat use and selection at that stopover site, and analysed faeces and blow trap samples to determine the local diet of the species and to compare food availability among the different available habitats in the reserve. Range size was estimated with fixed kernels and was on average 9 ha (90% isopleths), with daily core ranges (50% isopleths) of just over 1 ha. There was no variation in range size or habitat use during the survey period (August) or during an individual stopover stay. Studying habitat selection within the modelled ranges, we found that the species displayed a preference for wet grassland habitats. Larger daily ranges included more reedbed and fewer grassland areas. This matches the habitat preferences known from breeding and wintering grounds. The main identified prey belonged to a few invertebrate orders, with Odonata, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Araneida making the largest contributions to the biomass consumed. There was no significant difference in invertebrate availability between grassland and reedbed habitats in the study area. The availability of grassland habitats close to the reedbeds appears to be a key parameter to ensure the rapid and efficient refuelling of migrant Aquatic Warblers during their autumn migration.",

The aim of our study was to analyse the influence of agroforestry landscape characteristics and the age of forest patches on the presence of breeding and non-breeding Ural Owls. The research was conducted in the Polish Carpathian foothills during 1996–2007. Breeding Ural Owls need at least 100 ha of forest situated far from human habitation, and at least part of such a forest should be over 60 years old. The forests inhabited by the Ural Owl were also frequently surrounded by other patches of forest connected by wooded corridors. Non-breeding Ural Owls did not exhibit any preference for some of the examined habitat characters. Hence, young owls probably have large dispersal abilities and spread randomly in the search for new territories. A positive dependence between the occurrence of non-breeding owls and distances from breeding territories shows that non-breeding birds can remain for some time in the vicinity of territories occupied by adult Ural Owls.",

    "abstract": "Overwintering strategies are important for the survival of resident birds in temperate climates and among the most important are adjustments in roosting behaviour. In cavity roosting birds, previous studies have frequently used contact checks of man-made nest boxes to quantify roost-site occupancy. However, there is a concern that occupancy rate estimated by this method may be biased due to procedural disturbance. In this study, we quantified this potential bias by examining the winter time occupancy of 182 nest boxes in a floodplain forest in the Czech Republic. Nest boxes were checked three times a month from November to February 2007–2010 by three methods with decreasing level of potential disturbance. We obtained 1319 records of roosting birds of three species, with 94% being Great Tits, Parus major. We found a considerable decline in nest box occupancy throughout the winter when using the contact method (capture and handling of the bird), whilst occupancy rates remained constant when using the two non-contact methods (visual inspection of the opened nest box; the inspection by Infra red light mini camera passed through the entrance). The contact method was also associated with lower reuse rate of individual nest boxes. In conclusion, the commonly used direct night checks of nest boxes caused a disturbance to roosting birds and thus can lead to biased conclusions when studying winter time roosting behaviour in birds. More generally, this study demonstrates that using nest boxes may introduce bias in studies conducted during the non-breeding season, similarly as has been demonstrated for studies conducted in the breeding season.",

Therefore, spatial variation in the quality of breeders and predation rate within colonies should be directly reflected by the gradients of breeding success and chick survival. We have investigated relationships between nest location characteristics and survival of Whiskered Tern Chlidonias hybrida chicks in the colony at Jeziorsko reservoir, central Poland. We found that pairs nesting in the central, densely occupied areas of subcolonies had higher chick survival rates in comparison to edge pairs. There was also strong support for the positive effect of egg size and the negative effect of hatching date on the chick survival. Since pairs breeding in the central parts of subcolonies laid eggs of greater size and initiated laying earlier, we suggest that within-colony patterns of chick survival could be primarily attributed to the spatial variation in parental quality rather than to the higher predation pressure in the peripheral zones of the colony. There was also a moderate support for age variation in the survival rates of chicks, which ranged from 0.72 ± 0.06 to 0.91 ± 0.07 in different 5-day intervals of pre-fledging period. The survival of chicks over the entire pre-fledging period was estimated at 0.29–0.33, depending on the model.",

Besides altitude, density of earthworms was the main predictor of Woodcock distribution at the landscape (mesohabitat) scale: earthworms were more abundant in woodlands where roding males were detected than in those where birds were not detected, and were also more abundant in woodlands than in nearby pastures, in contrast to the winter pattern reported in previous studies. Woodcock exhibited a slightly higher diurnal activity in summer, while in winter there was a much sharper contrast within the daily activity cycle and greater activity occurred at night. Microhabitat selection during summer was assessed by comparing vegetation structure at sites in which Woodcock were detected, either from radio-locations or by flushing birds out with pointing dogs, and at randomly selected points. Sites selected by Woodcock had a higher density of stems of less than 5 cm diameter, a lower density of stems of more than 40 cm diameter, and higher canopy cover at 0.5–2.0 m above ground than randomly selected sites. The vegetation structure of the habitat selected by Woodcocks would offer protection against predators and allow Woodcocks to move and search for food. The fact that structural and biotical determinants of Woodcock distribution at the two spatial scales considered were different may reflect a trade-off between competing demands manifested as scale-dependent association with habitat attributes. Based on the results of this study, we propose that the food (earthworm) abundance could be the main criterion for the Woodcock's habitat selection at the mesohabitat scale (landscape level), which would explain both the seasonal change in local distribution and in activity patterns, whereas the need for cover and protection from predators would be more important at the microhabitat scale (occupation of particular sites).",

    "abstract": "Flight morphology traits affect flight performance and energetic demands, and hence they are of special importance for migratory birds. It is believed that high wing aspect ratio (ratio of wing span squared to wing area) and low wing loading (ratio of body weight to wing area) both reduce the energetic costs of flight, thus allowing for enduring flight and fast migration. We addressed this topic in a four-year study on the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica population near Warsaw, Central Poland. We hypothesized that individuals possessing wings with higher aspect ratio and lower loading should arrive at the breeding area earlier than other individuals, and that these individuals should be characterized by higher annual survival than the average individual. Male Barn Swallows arrived at the breeding ground on average earlier than females, and older birds arrived earlier than second year birds. Males with high aspect ratio wings arrived from Africa earlier than the average male, independent of age. There was no significant association between aspect ratio and arrival date in females. The relationship between male wing aspect ratio and arrival date remained significant when controlling for the effects of potential confounding variables (including the estimates of male phenotypic quality, body condition and body size). High aspect ratio wings may help male Barn Swallows migrate faster than the average male, and thus arrive at the breeding area earlier in spring and achieve the benefits of early arrival. However, the relationship was weak, explaining only 5% of the variation in male arrival date (age, and hence experience, explained 38% of the variance). Wing loading was significantly correlated with timing of arrival in both male and female Barn Swallows, with early arrivals being characterized by higher wing loading than later ones. This finding can be explained by the benefits of arrival at the breeding quarters with body reserves that should help copy with costs of early arrival. We found no significant relationship between wing area and timing of arrival. Furthermore, we found no evidence for wing aspect ratio and wing loading determining annual survival rate in the Barn Swallow.",

During the study period, a total of 376 nests of 20 cavity-nesting bird species comprising six primary and 14 secondary cavity nesters were located in the riparian forest. The cavity use pattern showed that one-third of the cavities were reused by birds and that the majority of the reused cavities were located in live trees. A lesser proportion (5%) of cavities used by birds was reused by other animal taxa. Competition for nest cavity use was observed among bird species in which Common Myna Acridotheres tristis was found to be the major competitor. A strong correlation was found between the bird body mass and nest cavity dimensions. Cluster analysis based on tree and cavity characteristics divided the avian community into five groups. We constructed a nest web for community structure that showed cavity resource use by various primary and secondary cavity-nesters. Woodpeckers (Greater Golden-backed Woodpecker Chrysocolaptes guttacristatus, White-naped Woodpecker C. festivus, and Browncapped Pygmy Woodpecker Dendrocopos nanus) as well as barbets (Brown-headed Barbet Psilopogon zeylanica, Coppersmith Barbet P. haemacephala and White-cheeked Barbet P. viridis) formed the key excavators in the riparian forest. While many of the smaller secondary cavity-nesting birds depend on the excavated cavities for nesting and reproduction, large-sized birds used decay formed cavities.",

Among European woodpeckers, only the Syrian Woodpecker Dendrocopos syriacus is synanthropic, occupying both rural and urban areas. In this study, habitat requirements of sympatric Syrian and Great Spotted D. majorWoodpeckers were investigated in two urban populations from central Poland. The occurrence of Syrian Woodpecker was found to be associated with walnut trees, fruit trees and mainly older softwood trees (poplars, willows). Plots with Syrian Woodpeckers were characterized by trees scattered among single-family buildings and within tenement houses in town centres. In contrast, plots with Great Spotted Woodpeckers were densely wooded, often with high share of hardwood trees and located in suburbs or residential woods. The aforementioned results show that these two sibling woodpeckers occupy different niches in urban populations. Moreover, this study supports the statement that urban areas are important for the Syrian Woodpecker in central Europe — a rare species in the European Union. Trees removal in cities, especially softwood trees, is a serious threat to the preservation of Syrian Woodpecker populations.",

Breeding success depends on diverse, not mutually exclusive, effects such as the life strategies developed by species, environmental, ecological and anthropogenic factors. The influence of nest and nest tree characteristics, landscape composition and human disturbance on the breeding success of the vulnerable Cinereous Vulture Aegypius monachus in breeding colony in central Spain was analysed. A number of variables characterising the vegetation around the nest-tree, the nest-tree, and the nest itself were selected and analysed. We found that bigger and less deteriorated nests, taller nesting trees and a higher shrub coverage in a radius of 100 m around the nest resulted in an increased breeding success. Although nesting sites characteristics and nest quality can be related to birds' age and breeding experience, our findings show that geographical orientation of the slope where the nest is located as well as nest accessibility and habitat selection have an influence on Cinereous Vulture breeding success. We recommend that mature forests, steeper slopes should be carefully conserved and protected from anthropogenic disturbances in order to strengthen the conservation of breeding areas of this forest-dwelling endangered raptor species.",

    "abstract": "Body size differentiation may have developed in response to environmental gradients. A pattern of large individuals prevailing in colder areas is often observed and is explained by the heat conservation hypothesis (Bergmann's rule). To understand patterns driving body size variation in a pelagic seabird, the European Storm Petrel Hydrobates pelagicus, we examined the relationship between wing length, body mass and environmental variables in breeding areas (sea surface temperature, air temperature and wind speed). As this species has been divided into two subspecies: Mediterranean H. p. melitensis and Atlantic H. p. pelagicus, we performed the analyses at different scales (species, Atlantic subspecies and regional North Atlantic). At the species and subspecies scales, there was a longitudinal increase in wing length from west to east. At the subspecies and regional scale, we found a latitudinal increase in this variable from south to north. This result and the significant increase of wing length with decreasing sea surface and air temperatures are concordant with Bergmann's rule. In addition, body mass at the species and subspecies scales decreased with increasing wind speed, what may have a functional implication (small body mass may increase manoeuvrability over waves in conditions of stronger wind). Both genetic (two subspecies differing in body size) and environmental factors seem to be important forces driving intercolony variation in body size. Our study on sexual size dimorphism (SSD) revealed that in 156 molecularly sexed adults from the Faeroes, wing and tail length, and body mass exhibited female-biased SSD, while head-bill length showed male-biased SSD. The best discriminant function for sexing based on body measurements correctly classified 75% of individuals. Considering low correctness of proposed functions and geographical variation of body size, use of alternative methods (e.g. molecular tools) is recommended for sex discrimination in the European Storm Petrel.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have suggested dietary segregation between nestling and adult birds resulting from both dietary requirements of offspring and distance to the foraging sites. We examined the diet in terms of composition and dimension, as the weight, habitat and taxonomy of prey in nestling and adult male and female Bluethroats Luscinia svecica spp. cyanecula at a recently colonized area in a mosaic of wetland (with sewage water) and terrestrial habitats in south-west Poland. On the basis of faecal samples collected between 2009–2012 from several broods and 94 adults, we found that nestlings had significantly lower diet diversity, consisting of heavier prey items. Comparing the proportion of seven major food types (order of insects/invertebrate class) we showed that the diet composition of adult and nestling Bluethroats differed significantly. The diet of nestlings contained significantly more soft-bodied prey items, namely Diptera and Lepidopteran larvae, and significantly fewer Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Furthermore, since adult showed marked decrease (contrary to young Bluethroats) of diet diversity and number of prey in the progress of the breeding season, hence our entire findings can imply that nestlings are fed in a selective manner receiving more profitable (soft-bodied and terrestrial) prey, and adults adjust their diet consuming less profitable (more chitinized and smaller) prey. This ultimately suggests the partial dietary segregation between nestling and adult birds, both in the term of size (biomass) and composition of prey. The use of a broad spectrum of food items and various prey types, and particularly the low dependence of nestlings on aquatic insects, suggests that Bluethroats have very plastic dietary requirements, which is most likely a factor facilitating the recent population recovery and adaptation to ecotonal zones between moist/wetland and terrestrial habitats with abundant moist soil, in newly settled areas of Europe.",

    "abstract": "Monocultures of even-aged trees in short rotation are a forest system of low ecological complexity that has been described as unsuitable for the establishment of stable populations of forest birds. However, key habitat quality cues could make them attractive to forest specialists. This paper assesses the suitability of poplar plantations in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula for a forest specialist, the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor. Poplar stands occupy a small area of an agroforestry mosaic landscape where semi-natural Mediterranean woodland is predominant. Population size, nesting success, home ranges and habitat selection were studied by radio-tracking and monitoring during the breeding season and the winter. Poplar plantations were preferentially selected for breeding and foraging in the spring and the winter. Home ranges in the breeding season and the winter (32.4 and 438.5 ha, respectively) were similar to those observed in semi-natural woodlands that have been studied in Europe. However, population density (0.25 territories/100 ha) was lower than that described in most European semi-natural woodlands. Nesting success was low (0.54), due to strong competition with other cavity nesters, predation of nests by the Greater Spotted Woodpecker, and loss of one of the adults. Fifty per cent of the foraging activity during the breeding season took place in an area of 180 metres around the nest. The amount of standing dead wood in poplar stands was much higher than in the surrounding habitats and source areas. The moderate breeding success and the high rate of adult predation may suggest that poplar plantations act as an ecological trap, in which standing dead wood may be a habitat quality cue that attracts birds to this non-ideal habitat. Poplar plantations become even less suitable when most of the available habitat is felled at the same time. Suitable planning of poplar plantation rotations and recovery of riparian forest is the best way to ensure the survival of Lesser Spotted Woodpecker populations in the long term.",

    "abstract": "During 2008–2011, nine juvenile Saker Falcon Falco cherrug females were tagged with satellite transmitters in Slovakia. Satellite telemetry provided new insights into the juveniles' movements. In this study we present the use of temporary settlement areas (TSAs) during the movement of the tracked juveniles. We characterized natal areas (NAs, the first TSA in the life cycle of juvenile, restricted to the nest) and TSAs as areas where the distance between the all-night perches did not exceed ten kilometres and where a particular bird spent at least five consecutive days. In these areas 3 types of polygons were identified in relationship to the area of use — a home range (95% kernel polygons), a core area (50% kernel polygons) and an overall used area (100% minimum convex polygons). The overall used areas were highly variable and probably influenced by exploratory flights, when sakers fly out of their home ranges and come back at night. Habitat preference was then analysed in the TSAs for a better understand of juvenile habitat requirements. For habitat preference a CORINE raster image (version 13/2006) with a resolution of 100 × 100 m was used. In the TSAs 14 habitat categories were recorded, but for statistical analysis only 8 habitat categories were used. Conservation status of the NAs and TSAs was also described. Arable land represented the dominant habitat category in the TSAs (mean 67.64% for overall used areas, and 80.94% for core areas). A significant difference was found in the habitat structure of the overall used areas, the home ranges and the core areas. All of the tracked Saker Falcons preferred arable land, while avoiding two habitat categories — forests and scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation associations. The number of days spent in the TSAs (9–139 days, mean = 46.7 days) and in the NAs (36–134 days, mean = 62.3 days) varied by different individuals. Most of the NAs and TSAs are at least partially covered by protected areas, only four areas had no conservation status.",

    "abstract": "Many woodpecker species rely on different forms of deadwood for nesting and foraging. However, the knowledge of the effect of enrichment of their habitat with different types on deadwood of this species group is lacking. Complex conservation-oriented management, including deadwood enrichment, was applied in a 20 ha even-aged oak-dominated woodland in Hungary. The foraging activities of woodpecker species were documented on selected treated trees over one, two and three years since these measures were implemented. The 109 individual oak trees examined represented five deadwood types: damaged-, girdled-, felled trees, and low- and tall stumps. We analysed the relationships between three variables (depth of foraging work, type of deadwood, and year) and foraging activity. Our results illustrated the prompt responses of woodpeckers to the treated trees. The woodpeckers used the five deadwood types in very different ways, and foraging activity was found to vary greatly in terms of depth of foraging and between years. More activity was carried out on both low- and tall stumps than on any other type one year after the treatment, whilst work on girdled trees and tall stumps predominated two and three years after the treatment. The utilisation of felled- and damaged trees by woodpeckers proceeded at a markedly slower pace than that of girdled trees and stumps, but the utilisation increased gradually. Most of the foraging activity was found to be on the outer bark, however, work on the inner bark and in the sapwood increased between the three years. The measures to conserve the woodpecker species should include the permanent creation and maintenance of various forms of deadwood to provide diverse and continuous foraging sites for woodpeckers.",

    "abstract": "Avian incubation relies on maintenance of the appropriate temperature and humidity within the nest. Previous studies suggested that conductance of the nest wall to water vapour was relatively low, albeit greater than the conductance of the eggshell, but no empirical studies confirmed this. In this study hygrometer loggers were used to measure water vapour inside and outside nest cups to determine conductance of the nest wall. Average water vapour conductance values for nine species of passerine ranged from 479 mgH2O·day-1·Torr-1 for Common Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs nests to 712 mgH2O·d-1·Torr-1 for Eurasian Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus nests. Generally, water vapour conductance values were two orders of magnitude higher than that of published values for the eggshell for these species, although humidity in the nest cup were comparable to published data for passerine nests. These results indicate that in the study species the nest wall was not an effective barrier to water vapour loss. Reconsideration of high values for nest wall conductance, nest attentiveness and sources of water to create humidity, have led to a new approach that deals with nest humidity as part of the water budget during the incubation period. Over time the amount of water vapour required to raise nest humidity far exceeds that released by the eggs. It is proposed that nest humidity is driven by cutaneous water loss from the incubating bird, rather than water vapour lost from the eggs, in order to counter loss of humidity through the nest wall and during incubation recesses.",

Orchards were the preferred tree stand of the woodpecker, where 58% of its nests were located. The average diameter of tree in which the woodpeckers nested was much higher than the average trees available in territories (47.4 cm and 32.5 cm respectively). The condition of the nest trees was worse than the average trees present in the territories of the birds. Amongst Syrian Woodpecker nesting habitats, only orchards had a worse state of health compared to trees growing in groups, rows or forests. Apple trees Malus domestica with 43.5% of nest sites were also in worse health condition compared to willows Salix spp. (20.3% of nest sites), poplars Populus spp. and walnut trees Juglans regia. The average height of trees with nest holes was 11.3 m and the average height of nest hole placement was 4.2 m. The Syrian Woodpecker is an ecologically flexible species, but it requires trees with larger diameter trunks that are in poorer health as nest trees, such as, for example, apple trees or soft wood trees such as willows. The protection of non-forest tree stands dominated by these species and orchards, which are preferred by this bird, may be important to maintain the Syrian Woodpecker in the agricultural landscape.",

    "abstract": "Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) have been implemented across Europe in an attempt to address biodiversity losses associated with agricultural intensification. For many declining farmland bird species, the reduced availability and suitability of nesting and foraging habitats are thought to play a major role in population declines and some AES have hoped to counteract this by encouraging the provision of such habitats. This study aimed to determine the relative importance of AES on the territory selection of a widespread but declining farmland bird, the Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella. Yellowhammers were more likely to locate territories in areas containing 'enhanced margins'; i.e. where field margin habitats were sown with wild flowers and/or agricultural legumes. An average of 0.033 ± 0.008 ha of this 'enhanced margin' habitat was present within 100 m of Yellowhammer territories compared to 0.020 ± 0.008 ha within 100 m of random points. This preference may reflect the higher invertebrate chick food abundance associated with this habitat as they contained, on average 46.3% and 36.8% more invertebrate food items than cereal and floral crops respectively. Alternatively, given that chick food abundance was similar between grass and enhanced field margins, this observed preference may be the result of a more open sward structure which increases prey accessibility and improves predator avoidance. Yellowhammers selected territories containing early succession hedgerows, as these constitute the most suitable nesting sites, and preferred territories containing a suitable songpost. Our results suggest that management strategies aiming to conserve breeding Yellowhammers should focus on increasing the coverage of invertebrate rich AES habitats such as floristically-enhanced margins and pollen and nectar plots, and ensure that they are located within typical foraging ranges of cut hedges with elevated songposts.",

    "abstract": "In spite of environmental uniformity of the European Plains, a conspicuous east-west gradient in the woodland avifauna and breeding bird community composition has been revealed. The species richness in the western woodland avifauna is lower by 32-36% than in the respective eastern samples (n = 120-127 species). Apart from being poorer in species, western communities tend to contain a higher proportion of species which develop dense populations. These features may result from past - mostly postglacial - natural events, from a secondary gradient in the intensity of human impact or from both of them. The data at hand provide evidence for a strong prevalence of the second factor. In view of the mostly anthropogenic character of the differences described, many west-European data can hardly be used as models of the natural patterns in studies of breeding bird ecology. New continent-wide comparative research is necessary to better control for anthropogenic bias in field data. For valid future pan-continental comparisons of bird communities a few large patches of near-pristine woodland should be preserved in the East, as well as restored in the West. Bird ecology studies need also a better co-operation with the archaeozoological and historical research to take into consideration past conditions which could also have influenced the present-day life patterns of European birds.",

The mean nest density (3.2 nests/km2) was higher than that recorded by other authors in agricultural landscapes, but lower than in urban areas. The nest construction was adapted to fit young willow trees. The mean clutch size was similar to that recorded in other populations (4.43), but eggs were smaller (41.2 mm × 29.1 mm). The hatching success was lower (76%) in comparison with other studies, but the mean number of fledglings (2.15 per nest and 2.96 per nest in successful broods) was relatively high. The main reasons for losses were unhatched eggs, predators, starved nestlings and poor nest construction. We hypothesise that the smaller egg size and lower hatching success recorded in this population was due to unfavourable and unpredictable feeding conditions (floods) during the period of egg formation and egg laying. Later in the season, receding floodwaters laid bare areas suitable for foraging on invertebrates; waterfowl eggs also became readily available. Predation was low (lack of nonbreeding stock of Hooded Crow). As a result of good conditions during chick rearing, the overall reproductive output was relatively high in comparison with other populations.",

To determine diet and predict impact of food sources on Red-backed Shrike populations, three methods should be used together (pellet content analyses, collar sampling and analysing larders). Our findings suggest that pellet content analyses is an easy and non-invasive method for estimating prey diversity and frequency index. Collars are necessary to determine nestling diets. Analyses of prey remains in larders should be used to find large prey, handled before eating. In more advanced geographical analysis of the content of shrike diet, we suggested to pool together data obtained by different methods from the same place, and/or carefully assign methods of diet analyses.",

Multiple regression and path analysis showed that weather factors (temperature and precipitation) during the breeding period determine the long-term variation in the wing length in both adult and young birds. Changes in wing length were explained by natural selection and habitat selection. In breeding and pre-migratory periods, temperature and precipitation influence in food availability, and thus affect optimisation of energetic expenses on feeding. It was revealed that long-winged individuals are best adapted to cold and rainy conditions, the short-winged ones, to warm and dry summers. The weather conditions obtaining when the birds arrive at the breeding grounds could be linked to differentiation in availability of optimal places for establishing territories, thereby influencing cempetition for breeding territories and the effectiveness of their occupation by morphometrically different birds.",

The age structure of the tree stands, the area of shrub coverage and the number of predators (apart from squirrels) were similar in both parks. 95% of the nests discovered at the beginning of the breeding season were found again in June and July. Any increase in the heights of the nest sites in successive periods of the breeding season and any changes in the type of vegetation selected for nest construction were recorded. In April, Blackbirds most often used coniferous trees. At the start of the season, when deciduous plants began sprouting leaves, Blackbirds preferred those whose leaves appeared earlier. But later in the season, no difference was found between the numbers of nests in trees developing their crowns earlier or later. The shorter period of nest use in conifers is probably due to their selective penetration by corvids. The selective penetration of such trees by predators probably reduces the frequency of nest building in them between the first (pentads 1–3) and second (pentads 4–6) period of the breeding season, despite the fact that they provide better concealment for nests. The selection of nest sites by the Blackbirds in this study confirms both the predator-pressure and the nest-concealment hypotheses.",

First arrival dates were compared to spring temperatures along migration routes in southern Europe and France and in the UK. The arrival of 11 species (e.g. Sand Martin, Blackcap and Pied Flycatcher) was significantly earlier with the mean trend for all species showing an advance of 1.6 days/decade over the study period. Over all species, trends in first arrival date were not significantly different between the two time periods but there were differences for Turtle Dove, Whitethroat and Lesser Whitethroat. Monthly mean temperatures along the European part of the birds' migration route were generally negatively correlated with, but can only explain < 30% of the variability in, first arrival dates. The consequences of both a changed phenology and differential phenological changes between species require urgent investigation.",

This paper reports on the results of the first quantitative study of food ecology in combination with the breeding biology of a North African population of Blue Tits occupying distinct patches of oak habitat (high-altitude semi-evergreen zeen oak versus low-altitude evergreen cork oak). To check for between-habitat differences in intensities of nest parasites feeding on chicks, all nests monitored were heat-treated during the chickraising stage. The peak demands of the chicks were found to coincide with the peak date of caterpillar availability in both habitat types. Food availability was much higher in the semi-evergreen habitat, and the diversity of prey delivered to the chicks was higher in the evergreen habitat. Surprisingly, breeding success was very low in both habitat types. It is suggested that several environmental constraints may cause maladapted avian breeding responses in heterogeneous Algerian habitat mosaics. Spatial variation in micro-climate may influence the capacity to adaptively adjust breeding responses to distinct habitat types.",

It was found that only the vertical diameter of Great Spotted Woodpecker nest-hole openings and the entrance-hole area (49.2 mm, 17.8 cm2 respectively) were significantly larger than the corresponding parameters in Middle Spotted Woodpeckers (44.9 mm, 16.2 cm2). The average tree diameter at nest-height was 42.7 cm in Great Spotted Woodpeckers and 38.2 cm in Middle Spotted Woodpeckers, and did not differ between the two species. There were no correlations between the tree diameter at nest height and nest height in either species. The small variation in hole-entrance diameters (CV ≤ 10%) and the distance that a predator had to reach to plunder the nest (≥ 19 cm) are most likely to protect woodpeckers' broods against arboreal predators — mainly Pine Martens. It is concluded that the tree diameter at nest-height probably makes little or no difference with respect to avoidance by Middle Spotted Woodpeckers of competition with Great Spotted Woodpeckers.

    "abstract": "There is a controversy over the effects of old nest reuse on the breeding biology of hole nesters. Some authors have shown that the presence of old nest material could increase ectoparasite pressure and/or reduce cavity size, whereas others argue that it could facilitate nest-building and serve as an informative cue for breeding birds. However, the possible functions of old nests may not be limited to the reproductive period in burds that perform autumnal courtship or use nest cavities as shelters during the winter season, as is the case with the Tree Sparrow. The importance of the presence of old nest material on nest box choice during the non-breeding period and its implications on the subsequent breeding performance of this multi-brood species are assessed. Occupancy rates and reproductive parameters (such as phenology, clutch size, nestling condition, breeding success) were compared between woodcrete and wooden nest boxes with and without old nest material inside. During the non-breeding period no effect of box type or its content on nest box selection was discovered, but in spring it was found that the strong preference of birds for breeding in woodcrete nest boxes was independent of the presence of old nests. In relation to this latter point, evidence was found that old nest reuse could negatively affect the reproductive output of Tree Sparrows: clutches were laid later, nestlings had longer wings (which presumably fledged earlier) and reproductive success was lower in nest boxes containing old nest material. The results of this study suggest that, taking the non-breeding and breeding seasons as a whole, the accumulation of old nest material seems to be detrimental rather than advantageous to this species.",

We tested whether there was any relationship between the characteristics of a pine forest in the Iberian Peninsula and the condition of Great Tit nestlings reared in that forest. The parameters used to estimate nestling condition were weight, haematocrit and the presence of haemoparasites. The results suggest that mature forests produced nestlings in better condition but with a higher prevalence of haemoparasites than young forest, possibly because mature forests are a good habitat for both the bird and the parasite vector.",

A total of 105 adult birds were measured, while blood samples were taken from 59 individuals. The results showed that the two geographically close populations of Reed Warblers differ in wing morphology, with birds from the inland population having more pointed and more slotted wings than those from the coastal population. There was a slight but significant difference in microsatellite allele frequencies between the two populations (FST = 0.015), suggesting that gene flow between the two populations is partly restricted. The differences in wing morphology imply that the two populations use different migratory routes and/or winter in different areas.

    "abstract": "The autumn world population of the endangered Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola probably numbers between 23 000 and 69 000 individuals, including 5 000 to 44 000 first-year individuals, depending on variation in breeding success and post-fledging survival. After breeding, the species migrates as early as August along a westerly route along French coast to reach its African wintering grounds. In 2009, French ringers have carried out targeted mist-netting to enhance the capture of the species, using tape luring in suitable habitats. Overall, 874 different individuals were captured in France in that year. In 2010 similar ringing effort allowed the capture of 646 different individuals. From this ringing information, we propose a simple method to estimate the number of individuals which stopped in the country during the autumn migration, considering all birds or first-years only. Splitting the country in two parts (northern and southern), the method uses the total number of captures and the number of southern recaptures of birds first ringed in the north. Overall, we estimated that between 24 000 and 30 000 individuals — most of them in their first calendar year — stop in France each year during the fall migration. These estimates suggest that probably all first-year Aquatic Warblers migrate by this western flyway and stop in France to refuel, while adults may partly use a different flyway or may stop in France, but for shorter times or at fewer sites. The proposed figures highlight the importance of maintaining suitable refuelling habitats for the species all along coastal France.",

    "abstract": "Migrating birds are known to avoid topographical barriers. At these barriers, the local environmental conditions often lead to a high concentration of migrants at certain corridors or points usually referred to as ‘bottlenecks’. The Greater Caucasus and the Caspian Sea are such barriers for migrating birds in south-western Asia. A narrow coastal plain between the Greater Caucasus and the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan (Besh Barmag bottleneck) provides excellent conditions for studying bird migration of a poorly known region. Here, surveys were carried out in autumn 2011 and spring 2012 to count raptor, passerine and waterbird migration from three different observation points. Data for fixed block of six hours continual observations together with random counting hours have been interpolated by a special calculation to obtain estimated grand totals per species. In total, 278 bird species were recorded, eight of which are red-listed as globally threatened by the IUCN (i.e. Sociable Lapwing Vanellus gregarius, White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala, Saker Falcon Falco cherrug, Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus, Eastern Imperial Eagle Aquila heliaca, Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga), another eight as ‘near threatened’. Calculations indicated 1.24–1.51 million visible migrants in autumn 2011 and 0.65–0.82 million in spring 2012. For four species (Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Rosy Starling Sturnus roseus, Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax), the mean passage estimates exceeded 100,000 individuals. 15 species meet or are well within the range of the criterion of 1% of the world population. For a further 19 species they exceed the criterion of 1% of the flyway population. Dalmatian Pelican and Little Bustard were observed in great numbers representing 33–57% and 41–48% of the world population, respectively. Both species and, additionally, raptor and waterbird migration are discussed. The results presented here serve to underline the importance of Azerbaijan for migrating bird species in general, and to highlight in particular the great potential of the study area as a location for long-term monitoring studies in a remote and little-studied region.",

    "abstract": "Understanding ecological requirements of animals is essential to improve habitat management and conservation strategies for endangered species. However, as most studies on Golden Eagle's habitat preferences and breeding ecology have been conducted in northern latitudes (e.g. USA, Scotland, Scandinavia and the European Alpine region), our knowledge of the species ecology in the Mediterranean basin is more limited. Currently, only 16 pairs still remain in Sicily (southern Italy) and in spite of this delicate status of conservation, there were no previous attempts to analyse ecological requirements of the species in the island. Therefore, we monitored Golden Eagles from 1990 to 2012, analyzed habitat characteristics of breeding territories and quantified habitat relationships with breeding performance. We used a case-control design through Generalized Linear Models to examine ecological descriptors at two different spatial scales: (i) \"territory\" defined as a plot of 4 km radius centered in the nesting area; and (ii) \"landscape\" by means of the 10 × 10 km Universal Transversal Mercator (UTM) cells where the species was present or absent. At the territory scale, the presence of Golden Eagle was positively related to the ruggedness of the terrain and to the extension of arable land, and negatively to the extension of forests. At the landscape scale the presence of the species was positively correlated with the range of slope and negatively to the aridity of the surrounding landscape and the extension of forest areas. The Golden Eagle has experienced a strong decline in breeding performance during the last two decades in Sicily, which negatively impacted population dynamics. The best model at the territory scale included the surface of sparsely vegetated areas (i.e. a surrogate of prey availability) as the best predictor of breeding output (i.e. number of young fledged). At the landscape scale, the best predictor of breeding output was the average annual temperature (positive effect) and surface of artificial lands (negative effect). Significant differences in environmental characteristics were found between occupied and unoccupied sampling units and between territories of high and low breeding performance. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining the structure of landscape arising from traditional forms of extensive agriculture in the Mediterranean basin, thereby favouring prey availability, and the importance of limiting human activities and changes in land use in rugged mountainous areas.",

The study was conducted in the Alto do Palácio region, in the Serra do Cipó National Park, southeastern Brazil. Monthly, from August 2007 to July 2009, the Hyacinth Visorbearer individuals were captured in mist nets and banded. Using mark-recapture data, we modeled monthly apparent survival (φ;) and capture probability (p), with sex and time (month) as covariates. We considered two time-since-marking (TSM) models among candidate models to control for the possible effect of transient individuals on parameter estimates. The two best-supported models (gaining 74% of summed Akaike weight) included effects of transient birds on monthly survival, with constant capture probability. The model-averaged apparent survival estimates for the first month after capture (φ;1) were considerably lower than the values for the second and later months following capture (φ;2 ). The apparent monthly survival showed difference between sexes, with females' value (φ;2 = 0.93 ± 0.03) slightly higher than males' value (φ;2 = 0.90 ± 0.03). These differences translated into distinctly higher annual survival of females (0.418 ± 0.16) than males (0.318 ± 0.12). The estimated annual capture probability was high (75%). We strongly suggest that TSM effects should be evaluated in future humming bird population studies.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, Dupont's Lark Chersophilus duponti is a threatened open-habitat bird. Prescribed burning has sometimes been proposed for its conservation, but without evidence of its effectiveness. To evaluate the short-term effects of a summer wildfire on this species, we performed several transect counts in the burnt and unburnt parts of a shrubsteppe in central Spain. The same transects were counted within a three-year interval prior to the fire and were repeated during the first two springs after the fire. We also measured the vegetation during the first two springs after the fire. In the burnt area, we observed a decrease of about 85–100% in Dupont's Lark abundance, and about 7–15% in the control area. The disappearance of the scrub cover after fire and its slow regeneration, as well as the large increase in grass cover during the second year, may explain the decrease in this habitat-specialist bird species. Fire should be avoided in areas occupied by the Dupont's Lark, as its negative effects in the short-term may cause local extinctions. However, prescribed burning may be used in neighboring areas to create new open habitats that may be subsequently colonized by this species.",

We monitored Black-backed Woodpecker Picoides arcticus nestling growth in unburned boreal forests under the influence of commercial logging. The objectives of our exploratory study were to estimate growth rate constants of weight and three morphometric measures (culmen length, tarsal length and wing length) in nestling Black-backed Woodpeckers and to determine how the amount of old coniferous habitat in home ranges may affect these rates. The amount of old coniferous habitat positively influenced weight gain in Black-backed Woodpecker nestlings but did not influence the three morphometric measures of growth rate. Our results suggest that Black-backed Woodpecker fitness may be affected by the reduction of old coniferous habitat in managed forest landscapes. We encourage further studies on the relationship between habitat quality and nestling growth as a potentially useful indicator of how habitat loss might influence individual fitness in these species.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we tested whether the Sharp-tailed Grouse Tympanuchus phasianellus experienced rapid demographic expansion and shifts in its distribution from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present and to the future. For this, we integrated two different approaches, phylogeography and ecological niche modeling, to understand the historical demography and the future of the Sharp-tailed Grouse under climate change scenarios. To this end, we re-analyzed two published mitochondrial DNA datasets to provide a comprehensive DNA characterization of populations across the range of this species. We used ecological niche models in tandem with landscape genetics to estimate the species current and historical geographic range, and to summarize effective connectivity among populations of the species at present. We found low genetic variation across the Sharp-tailed Grouse's distributions with almost no differentiation among subspecies. The haplotype network was consistent with star-shape topologies and showed no evident phylogeographic structure with the typical signature of recent demographic expansion. Taken together with the ecological niche modeling results, study outcomes supported the 'expansion-contraction' model of Pleistocene biogeography. A unique result of this study was an apparently complete range shift of this species between the Last Glacial Maximum and the present, and a signature of cryptic refugium located in Alaskan territory in North America. The usual reason for lack of phylogeographic structure is broad dispersal, rapid expansion, and panmixia. However, in view of our novel geographic insights, a simpler explanation may be very recent establishment of the species' range. The future predictions confirmed that the Sharp-tailed Grouse continues climate-driven range shifts in 2050 and 2070.",

    "abstract": "The sub-Himalayan dipterocarp forests of subtropical region in northwest India support 17 species of woodpecker. From a conservation perspective it is necessary to assess the ecological requirements of woodpeckers in these biologically diverse landscapes, which are experiencing habitat modification and decline in some woodpeckers. We studied the foraging niche differentiation among ten sympatric woodpeckers in the sub-Himalayan forests of northwest India: Dendrocopos canicapillus, D. macei, Picus chlorolophus, P. xanthopygaeus, P. canus, Dinopium shorii, D. benghalense, Chrysophlegma [Picus] flavinucha, Chrysocolaptes lucidus, and Mulleripicus pulverulentus. We examined the foraging site preferences of individual woodpecker species and explored the role of inter-specific differences in foraging behaviour as a possible mechanism for their coexistence. Observations on foraging woodpeckers were taken vis-a-vis the following niche dimensions: diameter of the foraging tree, height of the foraging bird, type of substrate on which it was foraging, vertical position with respect to canopy, condition of the forage tree and condition of the substrate. Distinct preferences were evident among species in their foraging tree diameters, foraging heights, vertical positions, and choice of substrate type, while preference for dead substrates was not an important distinguishing factor. Species that overlapped in one dimension generally segregated along other dimensions. Niche segregation in forage tree diameter was associated with body weight. Based on their overall niche overlaps species could broadly be differentiated into groups according to body size viz. small (3 species), medium (3 species), large (3 species), and very large (1 species). Our study demonstrates that differentiation in foraging may be a likely mechanism for coexistence of sympatric woodpeckers in this region. Given that larger species prefer larger substrates, removal of mature trees could affect their abundance, and homogenisation of stand structure could lead to impoverishment of woodpecker diversity.",

Drones are increasingly being used for conservational and ecological applications and their use seems to overcome these problems, but data are still scarce on their use to assess breeding success. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness, time consumption, and safety for birds of drone-conducted monitoring of nest-specific hatching success with usual ground surveys of two species of gulls, including Slender-billed Gulls Chroicocephalus genei and Mediterranean Gulls Larus melanocephalus, and two species of terns, including Gull-billed Terns Gelochelidon nilotica and Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis, breeding in the Adriatic wetlands of northeast Italy. We studied 400 nests (100 per species distributed in eight plots, each with 50 nests) and found no significant difference between the two methods in determining the number of eggs either laid or hatched per nest for all four focal species. The average coefficient of agreement between methods was high (kappa > 0.80 for all comparisons). The mean time spent determining the hatching success of 50 clutches with a drone (263 sec per plot) was significantly less than with ground surveys (760 sec per plot). There were no apparent negative effects of drone flights on nesting pairs, clutches, or young. Our results suggest that drones allow effective, rapid, and safe measurement of seabird breeding success in coastal areas.",

The White Stork Ciconia ciconia is unique being monitored for over a century and well-reflecting modern environmental changes. Its worldwide and national populations are estimated every 10 years thanks to the International White Stork Censuses (IWSC). We present the yet unpublished data of the last IWSC 2014 from the main species stronghold, Poland. We assessed the population size and compared its changes with the previous IWSC 2004 in 23% of the country area, including mountains. We looked for potential drivers of trends among land use transformations, checked population changes along altitudinal gradient, and compared the long-term trends in the global, national and regional populations. In 2014, 2560 pairs (3.61 pairs/100 km2) bred in south-western Poland, a decline by 35.5% compared to 2004. Decreases were strongly inversely related to the altitude, i.e. declines in lowlands were twice as high as in the mountains. Changes in area of grasslands, croplands, forests, and built-up areas were all weak predictors of the decline. Stork decrease in south-western Poland contradicts a stable country-wide trend in 2004–2014 (although the latest countrywide data also suggest a decline), which is inconsistent with the increase of the global population. Heterogeneity in trends indicates that Poland could be currently viewed as a transitional area, lying between large breeding areas inhabited by increasing stork populations. Notably, the western border between areas of increases and decreases coincides with the division into two migratory populations suggesting that the heterogeneity of trends may be related to migration paths and wintering grounds. Overall, our data confirm recent range shift of the species, and show difficulties in drawing general conclusions on stork demography based on regional data.",

    "abstract": "Coastal ecosystems provide important feeding opportunities for shorebirds, depending on their prey availability, hydrodynamic conditions and human pressure. We aimed to evaluate short-term responses (occurrence and minimum approach distance) of shorebirds to urbanization and natural drivers on an extensive beach arc adjacent to the largest hypersaline coastal lagoon of South America. The presence of the migrant Sanderling Calidris alba and resident Collared Plover Charadrius collaris was geo-coordinated and for each record and an equivalent number of random points we measured the distance from urban settlements, swash width and invertebrate abundance (food availability) in a snapshot sampling. The distance at which each shorebird flock escaped from humans was determined (minimum approach distance). The occurrence of shorebirds was predicted by food availability, and higher crustacean density was found in areas of shorebird occurrence (37 ± 19 individuals/m2) compared to random points (10 ± 10 individuals/m2). This result highlights the importance of the beach as a feeding area and the need for conservation of shorebirds' prey. The resident Collared Plover delayed their escape from humans in areas closer to urban areas, suggesting a higher tolerance to humans on disturbed beaches, where they can prioritize the food intake rather than vigilance. The larger flocks let the researcher get closer, corroborating the risk-dilution theory stating that flocking behaviour during foraging provides protection of birds from predators. In conclusion, our results showed that monitoring of sandy beaches based on shorebirds' presence and behaviour can be a reliable tool, especially close to coastal lagoons that constitute foraging sites for these charismatic species.",

    "abstract": "At present, the intensification of urban landcover is one of the most critical threats for biodiversity. Common side-effects of urban sprawl are anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night (ALAN). Although their negative effects have often been described, little research has concerned nocturnal wildlife, especially avian predators. Here, we investigated the effect of urban and tree cover, traffic noise and ALAN on the presence of the Tawny Owl Strix aluco, a common night-active predator in Europe. We conducted playback surveys along an urban gradient in Turin (Italy) to detect species presence. Traffic noise was measured in the field, the cover of built-up and (semi-)natural areas was estimated using GIS and multiple measures of ALAN were acquired from a light pollution map. We modelled species presence as a function of each environmental predictor and we found a significant negative relationship with light pollution, which was the foremost urban stressor affecting Tawny Owl occurrence. Our findings suggest that Tawny Owls are more likely to be found in less artificially illuminated areas and that their distribution in urban areas is not only influenced by noise pollution and the availability of suitable habitat, but also the intensity of ALAN. Therefore, light pollution could be a key driver of the spatial distribution of Tawny Owls and potentially other nocturnal species in urban ecosystems.",

The singing activity of all the males was relatively low at the beginning of the season (by the mid-May). Dark males sang mainly from open perches (67.6% of songs, compared with 23.2% for pale males). In dark males visual stimulation compensated for the relatively low acoustic activity in early spring when trees were still lacking leaves. The immediate vicinities of nest-boxes occupied by dark males were visited by females significantly more frequently than those of pale ones.",

The number of suitable nest sites for Starlings and competitive pressure were manipulated by increasing or decreasing the availability of nest boxes. Increased nest-site competition did not lead to significant changes in number among the studied species. The Starling was found to take over up to 25% of holes chosen by Nuthatches for breeding. Increased availability of nest sites did not protect Nuthatches from cavity losses, but reduced their frequency. Only 20% of Nuthatch pairs that lost their holes renested successfully in the same breeding season. No impact of Starlings on breeding woodpeckers was noted.

We review current knowledge, concentrating on analyses of demography, and present new integrated population modelling analyses designed to reveal the demographic changes most important in the decline. It is likely that changes in brood size and clutch size have not been important and our models suggest that the decline can be explained without invoking variation in numbers of breeding attempts or post-fledging survival rates. However, although changes in the egg period daily nest failure rate provide the best explanation for population change during the years of steepest decline, nestling period failures, adult survival and first-year survival could all have been equally important. Egg period nest failure rates have been higher in the preferred habitat, woodland, than in farmland and have fallen over time in farmland, where a larger decline has occurred (65 % versus 28% ), arguing against a causal link with abundance. Despite evidence for a negative effect of agricultural intensification on Bullfinch presence, little evidence exists clearly linking any demographic rate to environmental change and agricultural land-use has had little effect on nest failure rates. Predation appears to have had no significant impact. Future work should focus on contemporary investigations of the importance of hedgerow structure and woodland understorey vegetation.",

In following months males also sang at quite a high rate, but the probability of finding a singing male within the territory was lower. Males sang mainly from tree tops and power lines at a height between 8 and 10 m. Males with larger numbers of neighbours had a significantly lower mean song rate than those with a single neighbour. Most probably, males with more neighbours had to spend more time on more active and direct territorial defence, and/or listening to the song of other males. The pattern we found suggests that song is mainly used in territorial defence against rivals, and that it is used as a first line of defence. Nevertheless, this does not preclude its usefulness for attracting a mate.",

For distant communication, this species uses loud whistles. We analyzed 12 spectral parameters of 344 whistles from 23 captive adult ducks (14 males and 9 females). Discriminant analysis showed 94% correct assignment to an individual (N = 279 calls from 14 birds; 15–22 calls per bird). Separately for 8 males (162 calls) and for 6 females (117 calls), discriminant analysis showed 99% and 93% correct assignment to individuals respectively. Discriminant analysis for sex (N = 86; 3 calls from each of 14 males and 5 calls from each of 9 females) showed 100% correct assignment. Intersexual differences were governed by frequency parameters, the values of which were significantly higher in females than in males. Cluster analysis showed that differences between sexes were expressed significantly more strongly than the individual differences. The fact that the \"acoustical keys\" differed as regards the identification of individual birds or their sex may significantly enhance the reliability of acoustical recognition systems in the White-faced Whistling Duck. The data are discussed in the context of the biology of the White-faced Whistling Duck and significant intersexual differences in syringial and tracheal anatomy, which may be responsible for the sharp distinctions between the sexes in the calls of this species.",

In a forest with a dense population of Hawfinches the mapping technique underestimated their numbers by 20% in years of moderate density and by 35% during high-density years. Even though the underestimation was negatively correlated with the true density of Hawfinches, the figures obtained by both methods reflected year-to-year changes in a similar way. An improvement in mapping data is achievable either by closer attention being paid to the species during standard visits (the best ones for surveying it), or post factum by the introduction of a correction factor into the mapping-technique figures.",

A principal components analysis, which explained 53% of the total variance of the variables examined, differentiated Griffon Vulture colonies in relation to their isolation from other colonies, accessibility to humans and proximity to food resources. In addition, a stepwise discriminant function analysis between breeding and random cliffs included the height of the cliff, its substratum, the altitude, and the distance to the stock breeding unit in a model that successfully classified 97.1% of the nesting and 88.2% of the random cliffs. In comparison to continental regions the Griffon Vulture colonies in Crete were located on higher cliffs but at a lower altitude. This fact should be attributed to the species nesting on steep coastal cliffs close to the livestock's wintering areas.",

Mistle Thrush densities differed significantly from winter to winter, and the abundance of thrushes decreased as the season progressed. Bird density and mistletoe clump density were correlated positively. Birds held territories or congregated in flocks. The latter were sighted in the forest only during winter 1996/97, when the largest density of birds was noted. Flock size decreased progressively during that winter, but at the same time, the number of territorial birds remained stable. This suggests that by the end of the winter 1996/97 some birds from the flocks had begun to hold territories. Flocks were also seen in open areas, and displayed a preference for foraging on pastureland. Each individual territory in the forest consisted of several clumps of mistletoe on a few adjacent trees, which were defended against both conspecifics and other species such as Pyrrhula pyrrhula, Turdus merula and Dendrocopos major. The aggressive encounter rate was correlated positively with bird density but negatively with the progress of winter (the latter was correlated negatively with the berry supply). Surprisingly, it was not correlated with mistletoe clump density or temperature. During abundant berry years, the density of birds may have been so large that defending the fruit against numerous neighbors would have been energetically less profitable than communal foraging.",

This study investigated the influence of prevailing winds and geography on the orientation behaviour of migrants during this sea crossing by observations over two islands, one on the northern side, the other on the southern side of the Channel of Sicily. The flock was taken as the sampling unit. Honey Buzzards reached the island of Marettimo, approx. 30 km off western Sicily and 130 km NE of the Cap Bon Peninsula, regardless of the direction of the prevailing winds (NW and S). By contrast, Honey Buzzards passed via Pantelleria, about 110 km SW of western Sicily and 70 km ESE of the Cap Bon peninsula, mostly during NW winds. Birds reached Pantelleria from the NE and left the island flying WNW They applied true navigational abilities in choosing the shorter crossing between Pantelleria and Tunisia and showing a curvilinear migration. Our results agree in part with the “optimal use of wind” hypothesis. In particular, wind, geography and navigational abilities seem to interact to shape the orientation behaviour of migrating Honey Buzzards, perhaps to minimize the risks of non-stop powered flight over the water.",

Habitat and landscape scale variables played a similar general role in explaining the presence of the eight observed reedbed passerines. Reed island area was the most important factor; however, owing to the small average island area (1.74 ha), this simply indicates that too small reed patches were not occupied. A preference for an elongated shape (reedbed edges) was important for half of the species, and no other variables were included into the model of more than two species. The important practical conclusion is that both habitat and landscape scale factors should be considered in nature conservation management of reedbeds.",

The vegetation structure (visibility of the territory surroundings, and height and density of the under-storey vegetation) was described for 82 pipit territories in 2004, and for 33 additional territories in 2005. The same information on habitat variables was collected in randomly selected localities. Tawny Pipits use nesting sites with very short vegetation and with a high number of areas free of vegetation or only covered with dry mosses. The available data on the Tawny Pipit's habitat in different European localities show that the species is able to occupy a much wider range of habitats. Destruction of habitats, for example, for the construction of a new motorway, influenced pipit numbers and distribution in the study area; even so, the studied population remains the densest and most stable in the geographical range of the species. Although the study area contains Tawny Pipits and other interesting species from a conservation point of view, protection of the land may be very difficult owing to changes in habitats that are being destroyed both by infrastructure investments, and also by the financial support farmers receive from the European Union, which allows them to cultivate more land and thus destroy bird habitats.",

    "abstract": "The Blue Chaffinch is a passerine endemic to the Canary Islands and comprises two subspecies, one found on Tenerife (Fringilla teydea teydea) and the other on Gran Canaria (F. t. polatzeki). Even though the status of the Gran Canaria subspecies is endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation, knowledge of its life history is anecdotal. We studied its breeding ecology during the years 1991–2004. New data are presented on breeding phenology, number of broods per year, egg biometrics, nest-site characteristics, breeding site fidelity and breeding success. In general, the breeding biology of the two subspecies were similar, with discrepancies in some previously reported traits, such as egg laying interval and frequency of second clutches. The Blue Chaffinch breeds earlier on Gran Canaria than on Tenerife: nests were begun mainly in the second fortnight of May. We did not find any relationship between the onset of egg laying and rainfall in March. However, the onset of the breeding period was negatively correlated with mean April temperature. The Blue Chaffinch showed preferences for a south-easterly nest orientation and for nest placement at the end of branches, where the nest is hidden by pine needles. Nests were located at various heights, from 5.5 to 23.8 m above the ground. 33% of females produced two broods a year. We found no differences in nest site characteristics between successful and unsuccessful nests, which suggests that other factors may be affecting the vulnerability of nests. The main cause of nesting failure (73.9%) was predation, due mostly to the Great Spotted Woodpecker.",

Comparison of the nonbreeding with the breeding season revealed a slight variation in the diet. The Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus continues to be the most important prey species in the eagle's diet during the non-breeding season, followed by pigeons and the Red Partridge Alectoris rufa, although this varies from one region to another. In general, the decrease in the rabbit population after the epizooty (RHD) does not appear to have had an impact on the occurrence of this prey species in the Spanish Imperial Eagle's diet. Although this species is generally considered to be specialised in the capture of rabbits, the variability found between regions suggests that when the main prey (wild Rabbit) is scarce, the Spanish Imperial Eagle's diet is based on alternative prey such as pigeons or carrion.",

Although the Ring Ouzel has been considered accidental in the Canary Islands, it has been observed for the last five years in the high mountain zone of Tenerife (Canary Islands), showing it to be a regular winter visitor. Its interaction with female Juniperus cedrus cones and seeds was studied by analysing its wintering diet during January–April 2008. This juniper is endemic to the Canaries and Madeira and is classified as endangered by the IUCN. Previously, its sole long-distance disperser was known to be the Raven Corvus corax, which is unfortunately now extinct in the distribution range of J. cedrus. The results show that the diet of T. torquatus in Tenerife consists mostly of female J. cedrus cones (95% of the biomass consumed). Due to the large amount of seeds dispersed by Ring Ouzels and the effectiveness in seed germination, this winter visitor constitutes an important vector in the dispersal of J. cedrus that appears to have gone undetected in the past.

In this wetland the water level is independent of rainfall and Stilts start egg laying when average daily temperature increases to ca. 15°C, mostly in April-May, with no significant differences between years. Complete clutches usually consist of 4 eggs but 3 egg clutches happen with low frequency (2.9–5.6%). Egg size traits (mass, length, breadth and volume) tended to decrease from 2004 to 2007, probably due to deteriorating hydrological conditions of the wetland. Within-clutch variability showed both significant repeatability and laying-sequence-dependent differences among eggs, with the final egg being smaller than the clutch mean value. We found that all egg traits studied showed a negative correlation with the date of laying, which seems to be a phenomenon analogous to the seasonal decrease in clutch size, typical of birds with more variable clutch sizes. Hatching tended to be asynchronous, with average clutch hatching time being 1.84 days. The small final egg and hatching asynchrony are typical components of the adaptive brood reduction, the phenomenon not being recorded so far and remaining for future studies on the Black-winged Stilt. These are the first published data on breeding characteristics for any N African population of the Black-winged stilt.",

    "abstract": "Geographic variation is one of the most intensively studied bird song topics. However, our knowledge of geographical song variations in most species studied so far is very sparse, with many areas of the species-typical geographic distributions still unexplored. One striking example is the Yellowhammer: for this species most song studies have been conducted along well defined dialect borders, but almost nothing is known about its song characteristics in other regions of its broad geographic distribution. In this study, we investigated the song structure variations and stereotypes in different areas of western Belgium and northern France. We described 66 different song types (a-elements) in 45 males recorded. Each male had a unique individual repertoire consisting of 1 to 4 of these song types. This high variability at the individual level contrasted with the high homogeneity of the specific repertoire over the whole geographic distribution of the species. The evolutionary implications of such specificity are discussed with regard to song learning and timing of singing activity. Finally, all males recorded belonged to the western regiolect, although some mixed-singers were also recorded. These results contrast with the very few studies previously conducted in western Europe which have suggested that eastern regiolect songs were common in this geographic area.",

In the last century large parts of its habitat have been destroyed by wetland drainage and agricultural intensification. Besides protecting the remaining breeding habitats, it is of great importance to preserve suitable migration stopover habitats and wintering grounds to avert the extinction of the species.We determined home-range size and the use of vegetation associations of Aquatic Warblers on the wintering grounds in a flooded plain north of the Djoudj National Park in Senegal. Individual birds (11) were caught in mist nets and equipped with radio transmitters. Locations were assessed by radiotelemetry and a compositional analysis was conducted to determine which vegetation types were preferred within home ranges.Similar to their behaviour on the breeding grounds, the Aquatic Warblers showed no territorial behaviour in their winter quarters. They used home ranges that averaged 4 ha in size, which they shared with conspecifics and other warblers. The home ranges overlapped 54% on average, with a maximum of 90% in an area used by four individuals. The vegetation structure of the wintering habitat is similar to breeding grounds and stopover sites of the species. Preferential vegetation had 80% to 100% cover and consisted of 60 to 90 cm high stands of Oryza longistaminata, Scirpus maritimus or Eleocharis mutata. Most birds stayed more often near the edge of open water, probably for foraging. A constant inundation seems essential, because Aquatic Warblers never occurred in desiccated parts of the study site.",

In this paper, we describe nesting site conditions, nest placement and female foraging behaviour as well as food supply in vegetation types prevailing in Pomeranian breeding areas. Female Aquatic Warblers in Pomerania appeared to select ‘managed’ sites (where land use maintains suitable conditions for Aquatic Warbler) for nesting, and preferred vertical structures (ditches and edges within ‘managed’ sites) for foraging. They flew longer distances for provisioning their nestlings than in the core population (E Poland, Belarus) whereas the total distance travelled per 30 minutes was similar. In ‘managed’ sites, the total invertebrate biomass was larger than in ‘unmanaged’ sites in early June when early broods are raised. Pomeranian Aquatic Warblers are able to exploit relatively rich food sources in ‘managed’ meadows and in vertical structures and may thus balance the higher efforts of flights longer than in Eastern Poland and Belarus. To increase the availability of suitable Aquatic Warbler nesting and foraging sites in Pomerania, management by mowing should be continued. It might yield the best results when providing a mosaic of ‘managed’ and ‘unmanaged’ patches.",

    "abstract": "The effects of supplemental feeding on Eurasian Griffon range from increased survival and reproduction to population recoveries. In 2000, the appearance of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in Europe resulted in the implementation of the 1774/2002 regulation that required carcass removal and incineration at processing plants within the European Union and resulted in an immediate reduction of food availability for scavengers. We wished to evaluate the effect of the implementation of the reduced food availability on the scavenging Eurasian Griffon population. The study was conducted in La Rioja province (northern Spain). Eurasian Griffon fledglings are regularly brought to a rehabilitation center and can help evaluate the changes in nutritional condition before and after the enactment of the BSE regulations. A total of 47 first year griffons were sampled. Ptilochronology was applied to the rectrices, growth bars that are grown during the fledgling period were counted among nestlings before and after implementation of the EU-BSE directives. We found that the width of the growth bars, that represent the nutritional condition of the bird, showed significant differences over time. The growth bars before the implementation of the BSE EU-directives were significantly narrower than the subsequent period wherein carcasses were greatly reduced. The frequency of fault bars showed trends opposite to those of growth bars and there were significantly more fault bars in the pre-removal implementation period than the post-removal period. In conclusion, we consider this to be a result wherein the local adults with fidelity to their breeding colonies remained in the area while the non-breeding sub-adults and floaters have strayed in search of food. This has resulted in reduced inter-and intra-specific competition and only adults in good body condition breed resulting in healthier fledglings.",

    "abstract": "Nest characteristics can significantly affect specific behaviour of predators during nest depredation, such as relating to nest searching, manipulating and eating eggs. However, the effect of egg size and coloration on behaviour of avian predators rarely has been quantified. Since the European Black-billed Magpie Pica pica is regarded as an important nest predator in suburban areas, we studied the effect of different types of artificial ground nests — baited with chicken and quail eggs — on predation probability by magpie. In addition, to compare temporal changes in magpie predation, experimental clutches were installed at 39 active magpie nests in two breeding stages: incubation stage and stage of nestling feeding. In our experiment, magpies detected almost all artificial nests at both breeding stages. However in contrast to our prediction, nests were preferentially depredated at the first stage. This probably was due to the change of magpie foraging preference to invertebrates as a main food of nestlings. Furthermore, we found that predation rate did not differ between real and wax eggs, suggesting that magpies are not able to discriminate between them. Whereas quail eggs were carried away, chicken eggs were consumed in the nest where remnants of egg shell and egg content were left. Obviously, the possibility to immediately carry the egg away increases food attractiveness for magpies. Therefore, we conclude that chicken eggs are more suitable for identification of middle-sized avian predators than quail eggs.",

Clutch size did not vary over the study period and was on average 5.69 ± 0.04 eggs. Inter-seasonal variability was the most important component of DSR variation.

Nest height was an important nest placement covariate, nest remoteness from villages and roads were not influential. We detected the species composition of predators by watching nests of Booted Warblers and other grassland passerines as well as by observing the artificial nests. The main predators were carnivorous mammals, Common Viper Vipera berus, Harriers and corvids. Predator pressure was the main factor that determined nest success of Booted Warblers. Intra- and inter-annual fluctuations in the activity of predators may cause corresponding changes in nest success of Booted Warbler.",

During the surveys, 176 different trees with 326 holes of Black Woodpeckers were found and investigated. Habitat data at nest locations were characterized on a fine microhabitat scale — hole tree. We used individual selection indices and canonical variate analysis to describe nest-site preferences. Both analyses provided similar results. Nest-site selection of the Stock Dove was consistently associated with live beeches Fagus sylvatica with more than one hole. These features were clearly associated with diameter at breast height. Moreover, holes situated higher in tree trunk were preferred. Dead trees, mostly Scots Pines Pinus sylvestris, were avoided by the Stock Dove. We suggest that positive selection for smooth-barked beech trees with a number of holes, as well as holes situated higher might reduce the risk of predation by arboreal predators, e.g. the Pine Marten Martes martes. The positive selection for live trees, and clear avoidance of the dead ones, may reduce the cost of incubation and thermoregulation. Moreover, the live beech trees have long life expectancy compared to other tree species. Our results provide evidence that large alive beech trees with the number of holes excavated by Black Woodpeckers are necessary for maintaining breeding population of the Stock Dove.",

We evaluated bird species richness and abundance in three different distances from the stream (0, 125 and 250 m) in Cork and Holm Oak forest systems (Montado) in southern Portugal. We used 5-minute point-counts to survey birds in two daily periods (morning and afternoon) of three different seasons (breeding season, summer-autumn migration and winter), to describe seasonal and daily variations in the use of riparian galleries and adjacent areas by birds. To assess whether birds move actively from the surrounding matrix into the riparian gallery, we installed mist-nets in mid-summer, autumn migration and winter periods, in two sites adjacent to streams, and recorded flight direction of all passerines trapped in the mist-nets. Both species richness and bird abundance were significantly higher in the riparian gallery than in the adjacent matrix. Species richness was significantly higher during the summer-autumn migration period, and bird abundance significantly lower during the breeding season. Apart from the Short-toed Treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla, Nuthatch Sitta europaea and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, all other species (e.g. Blackbird Turdus merula and Sardinian Warbler Sylvia melanocephala) were generally more abundant closer to the stream than at 250 m away. A significantly higher percentage of birds moved from the surrounding matrix into the riparian gallery in mid-summer, but not during the autumn migration and winter, which suggests that microclimatic conditions are important to explain observed seasonal differences. This study shows the importance of considering seasonal variation for the management of passerine bird populations in riparian galleries of Mediterranean areas. A well conserved riparian gallery appears to be a keystone structure exerting a strong influence on the number of bird species associated with surrounding agro-forestry systems such as the Montado.",

Large-bodied birds are highly sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation. We aimed to test two hypotheses concerning landscape-abundance relationships of male Wild Turkeys Meleagris gallopavo silvestris, the largest galliform in North America. The landscape fragmentation hypothesis posits that animal populations would decline linearly with habitat fragmentation, independent of the effects of habitat loss. The landscape composition hypothesis states habitat quantity, measured at spatial scales larger than the individual territory, would influence species abundance. Using the National Land Cover Database, we extracted the metrics of landscape fragmentation and composition at turkey annual dispersal (i.e., a buffer of 16-km radius) and annual home range (i.e., a buffer of 2.15-km radius) scales, respectively, for 28 wildlife management areas across Mississippi, USA. We used the mean annual number of harvested adult males per hunter day during annual spring hunting seasons (mid-March to mid-April) from 2001 to 2005 as a relative abundance index. Male Wild Turkey relative abundance increased with increasing fragmentation of hardwood forest (i.e., deciduous trees as the dominant form of vegetation) at both annual home range and dispersal scales, contrary to the prediction of the landscape fragmentation hypothesis. Male Wild Turkey abundance also increased with increasing landscape interspersion and juxtaposition index (i.e., an index of landscape spatial configuration) at the annual dispersal scale. We found nonlinear relationships between the proportion of hardwood forest and male turkey abundance, supporting the landscape composition hypothesis. Male turkey relative abundance peaked at 29% hardwood forest within the annual dispersal distance. Diverse landscapes are beneficial to Wild Turkeys at large spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "Translocation is a useful tool for the conservation of endangered species, because it enables individuals to be moved between wild populations and between captivity and the wild. The use of captive-raised animals in these processes is sometimes the only option to recover a declining population, but captive-raised parrots are commonly seen as the worst candidates for release because they lose their ability to recognize predators, to find food in the wild and to socialize with conspecifics. The Blue-fronted Amazon Amazona aestiva is one of the most popular parrot species in captivity. Thirty-one parrots were soft released and monitored during 13 continuous months in a Cerrado area (savannahlike vegetation) of Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. Three released parrots (10%) were confirmed to die and five (16%) disappeared soon after release and no behavioral recordings or data about their destinations were available. Ten parrots (32%) showed behaviors that suggest adaptation to the wild and 13 individuals (42%) expressed behaviors more typical of captivity. Difficulties in settling were observed for the parrots after release. One released pair, and one female paired with a wild male, reproduced. There was a tendency to decrease in all captive-related behaviors and to increase in wild-related behaviors since time after release. Supplementary food use diminished as the parrots explored natural food resources. This study indicates that confiscated captive-raised parrots can be good candidates for translocation if a training program could be applied prior to their release to reduce undesirable behaviors and the chance of re-capturing by humans. Furthermore, the use of non-endangered species in conservation programs can be useful to create protocols for the conservation programs of rare and endangered species.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires can be the most influential phenomena in landscape dynamics and play an important role in determining avian populations. However, the intentional burning of habitats is still a controversial management practice and is legally prohibited in many countries. On the other hand, fires can positively control, or even slow down vegetation succession of reeds and bushes, and, in particular cases, may sustain a habitat for open marsh nesting specialists. One such species is the Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola, a globally threatened habitat specialist that breeds in open fens in Central and Eastern Europe. Because bush and reed encroachment threaten many suitable breeding areas, habitat management is necessary to maintain the open wetlands that Aquatic Warblers require for nesting. To assess whether burning was beneficial, we analysed Aquatic Warbler numbers and distribution in the Chełm calcareous marshes in eastern Poland on plots in different successional stages after accidental fires. Our study showed that numbers of warblers, at least of singing males, were lowest in the year of fire, but increased to higher levels in the year after burning and for several years after burning. We recommend that, in calcareous marshes which support up to 0.5% of the total population of this globally threatened species, intentional burning to control succession should be done before the arrival of warblers in spring in order to ensure burning is an effective management tool.",

    "abstract": "The timing of breeding and nest location in colonial birds may have fitness consequences. In particular, it has been demonstrated that peripheral breeders perform less well than core breeders. To determine whether environmental factors such as date of breeding and nest position influence reproductive success, we studied the breeding ecology of a large colony of White Stork Ciconia ciconia at Dréan, northeast Algeria, during 2011 and 2012. Mean egg-laying dates varied significantly between years and differed between core and peripheral nests with more precocious laying occurring in the center. Egg-laying in larger nests started earlier than in smaller ones in the core area but neither nest size nor nest position along the core-periphery gradient had any influence on studied breeding parameters i.e. clutch size, hatching success and chick productivity. There was no yearly difference in clutch size which averaged 4.7 ± 0.7 eggs (N = 156 clutches). Mean chick productivity was higher in 2012 (2.85 ± 1.21 chicks) than in 2011 (2.29 ± 2.28 chicks) and was marginally associated with egg-laying date. In contrast, nesting success declined with delayed onset of breeding. Results suggest that a low predation rate, abundant resources and a possible trade-off between fitness components may confound adaptive breeding-habitat selection in White Stork.",

    "abstract": "Many traits influence birdsong diversity. Patterns observed in the acoustic parameters can be a result of morphological constraint and can also be explained by phylogenetic relationships. Understanding morphologic mechanisms that can act on song structure might account how they can catalyze speciation and how they evolve in lineages sort. We analyzed the evolution of beak volume and song constraints in \"finch-like\" species of Neotropical seedeaters. We tested if beak volume limits the song structure of territorial songs, based on differences in the beaks of 19 species from the genus Sporophila (Thraupidae, tanagers). We also tested (1) if body size constrained song structure, and (2) if beak volume and body size were related to each other. The relationship of song parameters (e.g. maximum and minimum frequencies, frequency bandwidth and note rate) to these two morphological variables was evaluated through an analysis which phylogenetic relations were controlled (PGLS), testing a null and Brownian model. To perform a faithful analysis between morphologic and acoustic parameters, our data was based on measurements of the beak and territorial song for each individual that we analyzed. None of the analyzed parameters was related to beak volume or body mass, and beak volume was not associated with body mass. Beak volume, note rate, and minimum frequency showed a phylogenetic signal. These results do not support the theoretically motivated prediction that beak size acts as a limit on song structure in oscine birds. The shape and variations of song in Sporophila tanagers (Seedeaters) may be a consequence of the species' phylogenetic history, since the seedeaters showed wide plasticity in many acoustic parameters, unrelated to their beak volume and body mass. Song structure was better explained by the evolutionary relationships among the species than by morphological constraints.",

This clade includes the African taxon Sarothrura and the Madagascan Mentocrex and has been termed Sarothruridae. It was noted that White-spotted Flufftail Sarothrura pulchra and Sungrebe Heliornis fulica share a distinctive morphology of the hypotarsus, which guides the tendons for the flexor muscles of the toes. Owing to the scarcity of skeletons in osteological collections, however, other species of the Sarothruridae and Heliornithidae have not yet been studied. Here, the hypotarsus of extant and fossil members of the Ralloidea is examined. It is shown that the characteristic hypotarsus morphology is also present in Buff-spotted Flufftail Sarothrura elegans (Sarothruridae), Madagascan Wood Rail Mentocrex kioloides (Sarothruridae), and African Finfoot Podica senegalensis (Heliornithidae). Grey-throated Rail Canirallus oculeus, by contrast, which was traditionally considered closely related to Sarothrura and Mentocrex, exhibits the hypotarsus morphology found in the Rallidae. To foster future communication, it is here proposed to use the taxon name Heliornithes for the clade including Heliornithidae, Sarothrura, and Mentocrex. A previously unknown derived hypotarsus morphology is described, which characterizes the rallid taxon Porphyrio (swamphens) and may be functionally correlated with the fact that the species of this taxon manipulate food items with their feet.",

    "abstract": "Successful reintroduction programmes are usually defined by an increase in size and extent of the new population after a given period of time. Among studies of birds, these population estimates are often focused on the monitoring of nesting attempts and productivity. For many raptors, however, this approach can overlook a large number of non-breeding adults and immature birds leading to underestimation of population size and reproductive potential. A more thorough approach is to generate assessments of total population size. In this study we used a line transect survey methodology and multiple covariate distance sampling to assess the change in population size of a reintroduced raptor species, Red Kite Milvus milvus, across a 2600 km2 area of central southern England. Surveys were performed in spring and autumn between 2011 and 2016 in an area 45 km to the south of the initial English reintroduction project which started 25 years previously. Survey routes avoided using roads where possible to counter the potential attraction that such landscape features may have (e.g. increased food availability, perches etc.). The use of roads was unavoidable in some instances; however, we found no evidence of Red Kite attraction to these landscape features when comparing distances of observations from stretches along roads with 5000 randomly-generated locations. Distance of detection was influenced by bird activity (greatest when the bird was on the ground or interacting with other birds) and extent of woodland but not by time of day, seasonality or when comparing between years. During the five years, estimated population size doubled from approximately 490 to 1100 individuals; a density of one Red Kite per 2.5–3.5 km2. This suggests an increase in the breeding population in the study area from c. 95 to 174 pairs. During the study, rate of population growth was not uniform; rapid growth was recorded in years two and three followed by a slowing over the last two years of the study. While an overall increase in population and availability of suitable nesting habitat across south-eastern England indicates that there is still potential for expansion of the Red Kite breeding population, other factors are potentially limiting this growth.",

    "abstract": "Nest structure and nesting material may have important consequences for avian reproductive behaviour and performance. Nuthatches Sitta spp. build nests made of loose bark flakes without any structure or nest cup to contain eggs and nestlings. We have aimed at understanding the implications of unstructured bark flake nests in Nuthatches for microclimatic conditions in the nest, ectoparasite infestation, parental care and nestling begging through a nest exchange experiment. To that end, we have experimentally replaced natural bark nests of Nuthatches Sitta europaea by structured moss nests built at the same time by Great Tits Parus major for some pairs and compared their ectoparasite abundances, nest microclimate variables and the behaviour of nestlings and parents with those in natural Nuthatch nests. The experimental treatment did not affect ectoparasite loads. Nest-boxes containing structured nests made of moss showed higher and more variable temperatures, higher thermal maxima and less variable humidity conditions than unstructured control nests made of bark flakes. However, bark flakes conserve heat better than moss during the night and morning hours, which may be transmitted to buried eggs and nestlings and reduce incubation and brooding costs for females. This may explain why females remained out for longer during incubation recesses at natural nests. Nestlings of 9 days in natural nests rested further apart than nestlings in structured experimental nests although there were no differences with respect to begging intensity between the two treatments. Hatching and fledging success was similar in both groups but experimental nests resulted in nestlings with shorter tarsi and wings before fledging. The poorer nestling growth in experimental nests cannot be explained by effects of ectoparasites, nestling aggregation or nestling begging or parental care. Adaptations for remaining buried in the nest material and the heat-conserving properties of loose bark flakes may reduce energy costs for nestlings during female absences.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural ecosystems have faced dramatic changes during past decades, resulting in a dramatic loss of farmland biodiversity. The Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra is considered a suitable indicator for the conservation value of farmland habitats, and has recently suffered strong declines throughout much of its European range. As a basis for targeted conservation measures, we investigated the habitat preferences of this species in north-eastern Germany by comparing the composition of male territories with randomly chosen control sites. A territory was defined as the area within a radius of 150 meters around the assumed centre of the territory, as the majority of nests is found within this radius. To assess food availability for nestlings, arthropod abundance within the most abundant land use types i.e. crop fields, fallows, grassland as well as within unploughed strips was investigated. In total we found 102 male Corn Bunting territories, which were mainly composed of crop fields (50%), grassland (28%), and fallows (12%). Territories compared with control sites were characterized by a lower proportion of crop fields, a higher proportion of fallows, more diverse land use types, more abundant field boundaries, unploughed strips, and tracks, and a higher availability of song posts. However, neither the number of larger (≥ 1 cm), smaller (< 1 cm) or all arthropods differed significantly among analysed land use types i.e. crop fields, fallows, grassland, unploughed strips. Our study confirms the significance of habitat heterogeneity and especially of sites with sparse vegetation (fallows > 10%) and song posts (> 70 m 'linear song posts' or > 1 solitary post per ha) for the habitat selection of male Corn Buntings. We conclude that measures to halt population declines of Corn Buntings seem to be relatively easy to implement, provided that farmers are granted a fair compensation.",

    "abstract": "Hummingbird vocalizations are usually displayed in two contexts. When foraging or defending territories, males and females usually display relative simple calls as territorial advertisement, while during courtship males perform individually elaborate songs to mate attraction or through singing assemblies (leks). About 15% of all described hummingbird species form leks or singing assemblies during the breeding season. However, the vocal repertoire displayed by males in these arenas has been rarely described. Here we studied the songs of Green Violetear Colibri thalassinus in a temperate forest from central Tlaxcala, Mexico, to document structure and variation within and between singing assemblies established over 3 years. We found 41 well differentiated and structurally complex syllable types across eleven recorded singing groups of Green Violetears (≈12 syllable types per singing group). The songs of most birds were repeats of the same 3–4 syllables, but the syllables types emitted can vary. Birds from the same lek tend to have similar song. Comparison of syllable sharing within-groups showed a Jaccard'similarity coefficient averaging 0.51 ± 0.09 (mean ± SD), and 0.24 ± 0.01 for among groups comparisons. These differences were corroborated by bootstrapping tests finding no significant similarity among males from different leks. However, significant similarity in syllable sharing was found between males from the same lek. No significant correlation was found between song similarity and geographic distances between leks. We have documented that static songs of lekking Green Violetears are more complex than had previously suggested. The variation of vocal repertoire among leks indicates the apparent presence of \"vocal dialects\" that are variable across time and space. The song variation in the context of discrimination ability in vocal neighborhoods requires further research.",

In this paper we study variation in egg length, breadth, volume and shape in Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca in Łódź, central Poland, during 2002–2012, in relation to climatic and habitat-related factors. We found a significant decreasing trend in egg length, breadth and volume across the study years and a slight tendency for eggs to be a little more elongated in a forest site than in an urban parkland site. Even though mean monthly temperature in May is known to have increased since the 1970s in the area of Łódź, the average ambient temperature during the time of formation of eggs in particular clutches tended to decrease, with increasing variability at the same time, in 2002–2012. Egg size traits showed a positive association with average temperature and a negative relation with variability in temperature during egg formation. In spite of a general trend for spring temperature to increase, mean clutch-specific temperature during egg formation decreased and variation in this temperature increased over the years of this study, which explains the overall decreasing trend in egg sizes. We also found that fledging success was positively correlated with egg length, but not any other trait. Therefore, a decrease in egg sizes resulting from climate changes may influence nestling performance, with potentially negative consequences for the Pied Flycatcher population.",

    "abstract": "Recent climate change has a major impact on the sizes and distribution of bird populations, the phenology of their breeding/migration and migratory behaviour (migration distance, migration strategy). We documented changes in the numbers of juvenile Blackcaps migrating in autumn through the S Baltic that were paralleled by changes in wing length of captured individuals during a 43-year study period (1967–2009). We suggest that the observed trends may indicate changing population composition of migrating birds. In the Blackcap, wing length distinguishes among different populations and increases with increasing migration distance of a given population. Available published data show that long-distance and short-distance Blackcaps pass the study region. Hence, we assumed that shorter-winged birds are short-distance migrants wintering in the southern Europe, and that longer-winged individuals are long-distance migrants wintering in the sub-Saharan region. It seems that in 1967–1980 most Blackcap populations declined, but, as wing length slightly increased, the rate of this decline has been higher in the shorter-winged/short-distance Blackcaps. Over the subsequent 24 years alongside with rapidly growing numbers of birds, we noted a remarkable decrease in wing length. This indicates a pronounced increase in the number of short-distance individuals compared to long-distance migrants. Both groups may benefit from improved conditions at their breeding grounds, but the shorter migration route and favourable conditions at wintering sites north of Sahara could favour short-distance migrants over the longer distance and longer-winged Blackcaps.",

Bordered by Turkey Oak forests, this open area forms a wedge-shaped clearing in that woodland. Since trees and taller shrubs are rare in the area, it is mainly ground nesting bird species that occur in the clearing. In order to discover whether it is more advantageous to nest in the recultivated area (clearing) than in the nearby forest or at its edges, 150 artificial ground nests were constructed. On 7 May 2002, one quail egg and a plasticine egg of similar size were placed in each of the artificial nests. After a week it was found that 24% of nests in the clearing, 30% of those in the forest edge, and 44% of the ones inside the forest had suffered depredation. The proportions of damaged plasticine and quail eggs inside the forest and at the forest edge were similar, whereas the quail eggs in the clearings were significantly less damaged than plasticine eggs. Of all the experimental eggs, significantly more plasticine eggs (29%) were damaged than quail eggs (17%), which suggests that small-bodied predators are unable to break the quail eggs. 18% of the plasticine eggs attacked, and 72% of the quail eggs attacked were removed from the nest by the predator. Among the predators, small mammals were dominant in the clearing and inside the forest, and birds at the forest edge. Based on the prédation of quail eggs, the survival chances of ground nests in the clearing are greater than at the forest edge or inside the forest.",

Estimates of several species' breeding populations in these cities were used to calculate their densities in the total area of breeding habitat in each city used by the species in question. The relationship of the densities of several common species was compared. Of 39 species analysed, 18 showed higher densities in Hamburg, 4 in Warsaw and 2 in Berlin. A gradient of increasing density from Warsaw to Berlin and Hamburg (Western gradient) was found for 16 species: Columba palumbus, Troglodytes troglodytes, Prunella modularis, Turdus merula, T. philomelos, T. viscivorus, Sylvia atricapilla, Phylloscopus collybita, Ph. trochilus, Regulus regulus, R. ignicapillus, Garrulus glandarius, Parus cristatus, Certhia brachydactyla, Fringilla coelebs, Pyrrhula pyrrhula. An opposite (Eastern) gradient was found for only 3 species: Columba livia f. domestica, Oriolus oriolus and Passer domesticus. Suggested causes for most of the larger differences among the three cities in the densities of particular species are the variation in the richness of vegetation (higher in both German cities) and differences in the stage of synurbization (i.e. adaptation to the urban environment) of specific avian species.

The nestlings were later seen to be fed by the two pairs of adult birds. In the second case, a nest containing 4 eggs laid by one female wastaken over by another which, having chased the nest owner away, laid 5 eggs of her own. The likely cause of nest sharing in the first case was the loss of eggs at an early stage of laying by the second female. In the second case, nest sharing seems to have been caused by nest competition. The details of the parents and siblings of the females involved in the first case permits the conclusion that the absence of competition between the females (and even their co-operation in feeding the young) was not caused by their genetic affinity.",

A DNA-based procedure was utilised to sex individuals and to assess the accuracy of morphological criteria for the sex identification of adult breeding birds: discriminant analysis on the sample level and within-pair comparisons. Males were significantly larger than females in all body measurements used in the discriminant function selection process. Owing to considerable overlap in measurements, however, the sexes cannot be accurately separated by biometrics at the population scale. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced in bill length measured from the corner of the gape to the tip, but only 79% of individuals were correctly identified on the basis of this parameter alone. When two variables, bill length and wing length, were combined, the discriminant function was of similar efficiency (80%) in determining the sex. The accuracy level of sexing may be improved by comparing mates within pairs: combined comparisons of bill length and body mass were as accurate as the genetic technique, but sex assignment was restricted to 76% of the measured pairs.",

This paper analyses data (1988–1995) on the numbers of Knots and the timing of their migration in the Puck Bay region of the Baltic Sea (N Poland). The timing varied greatly between seasons. The timing of adult migration is linked to breeding success. In seasons with low breeding success both males and females leave the breeding grounds earlier, and the correlation between the mean date of adult migration and the number of juveniles is consistent with this phenology. The differences between the departure dates from the Taimyr breeding grounds provided by published sources and the dates of arrival at Puck Bay suggest that Knots cross the northern tundra regions very quickly (at least, the earliest birds to arrive do so). The numbers of juvenile Knots turning up on the Polish coast appear to depend not only on the lemming cycle in the breeding grounds, but also on other factors, like local weather conditions, which could influence the number of juveniles observed.",

Three relatively independent processes play a significant part in the population dynamics of the study area: 1) initial abundance and reproductive intensity, 2) survival rate between breeding seasons, and 3) redistribution of birds across their range. The weather in spring, when the birds arrive and settle, was found to be equally important. The population density, nest site fidelity of adults and yearlings, and immigration rate were related to temperature patterns in May.

The wintering Great Grey Shrike Lanius excubitor was censused in Poland more than two decades ago (during the winters of 1988/89 and 1989/90). Single censuses were made during each winter on sample plots varying from 4.1 to 35.1 km 2 (mean: 16.4 km 2 ). Altogether, data from 404 plots, covering in total more than 6.6 thousands km 2 were used for the analysis. Based on this data and environmental information gathered in GIS databases (Corine land cover CLC1990 database, digital elevation model GTOPO30 dataset) we modelled habitat- and spatial-related variation in shrike distribution. Birds were recorded on 45% of study plots. The mean density was 4.8 individuals/100 km2. In both seasons density in meadows was roughly two times higher than in arable fields. We modelled spatial distribution of wintering birds using combination of GLM and three-dimensional local regression. Models were cross-validated to check their temporal consistency. Repeatable spatial pattern of population distribution allowed to make predictive dis- tribution maps. As a general rule, wintering shrikes avoid regions with severe, continental climate and prefer lowlands dominated by agriculture. On the basis of our models, population of the Great Grey Shrike wintering in Poland during late 1980s can be roughly estimated at about 7.7 thousands of individuals.",

    "abstract": "Plumage colour is classified as pigmentary or structural, depending on whether it is caused by pigments or by feather microstructure. However, recent findings indicate that carotenoid-based plumage colouration also reflects at UV-blue wavelengths and that the underlying structure is related to the reflectance properties of the yellow feathers. Thus, yellow plumage is based on interactions between structural and pigmentary components. This study investigat- ed the relationships among the vegetation structure of breeding territories, both components of plumage colour, T-cell- mediated immune response and body mass of nestling Great Tits Parus major. By using a model of avian visual percep- tion, we found that, while plumage yellowness was associated with mature vegetation, plumage brightness and UV- blue reflectance were related to immature habitats in territories. We noted considerable variability in the development of carotenoid-based colour components under different environmental conditions, as plumage yellowness, but not brightness or UV-blue reflectance, depends on the availability of carotenoids, which is assumed to be high in mature territories with high food abundance. Territorial features denoting mature territories were also related to high body mass and immune response in nestlings, but none of the colour components were related to these variables of the veg- etation structure, suggesting that habitat quality is related to nestling body mass and immune response through mech- anisms different from those through which it is related to colour.",

We aimed to determine which microhabitat characteristics in the Holm Oak forest could account for the presence of Crested Tits, and checked whether the nestling diet in the Holm Oak forest resembled that obtained in the pine forest. Vegetation maps were produced using GIS from observations made in the field (tree species, tree and shrub cover). Nestling diet was recorded through video surveillance. Crested Tits bred in mature, low-density areas in the pine forest. Those breeding in the Holm Oak forest built their nests in areas including pine trees and avoided densely forested areas. Birds breeding in the pine for- est started laying by mid-April and the average clutch size was 5 eggs. In the Holm Oak forest, birds started laying by the end of April and average clutch size was also 5 eggs. Fledglings weighed around 12 g in both forests.

In both hosts the fre- quency of Cuckoo parasitism was fairly constant throughout the breeding season. The parasitism rate (defined as the proportion of nests parasitised by the Cuckoo) was significantly higher in Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus (12%) than in Marsh Warblers Acrocephalus palustris (4.6%). The rejection rate in Reed Warblers (7.4%) was the lowest ever reported for this species, while Marsh Warblers rejected 57.1% of Cuckoo eggs. As a result, the hatching success of the Cuckoo in Reed Warbler nests was higher than in Marsh Warbler nests (74.1% and 28.6%, respectively). The fledging success of Cuckoo chicks in the nests of the two host species was similar. Nest survival was significantly lower in para- sitised nests than in non-parasitised ones. The breeding success of the Cuckoo (proportion of fledged young to the total number of eggs laid) was higher in the nests of Reed Warblers (29.6%) than in those of Marsh Warblers (7.1%), but the difference was not statistically significant. In 2001-2003 both host species were parasitised at a similar rate, but in 2004-2008 the level of parasitism dropped dramatically in Marsh Warblers.

The study of the breeding biology of Great Reed Warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus was carried out at Milicz fishponds (SW Poland) during 18 discontinuous breeding seasons between 1970 and 2017. Over the study period, Great Reed Warblers started breeding progressively earlier; both the earliest and median first egg laying dates advanced, whereas the latest laying dates remained unchanged. Egg volume and clutch size did not change between 1972 and 2017. Mean clutch size of all nesting attempts was 4.8 (SD = 0.69, n = 1135). Nestling growth rates were similar in 1971 and 2016. Nestling period shortened during the study period. The decrease amounted to 0.7 days between 1970–1984 and 2004–2017. No temporal trends in fledgling production were observed. The proportion of successful broods varied considerably between years (range: 37%−76%) but did not show any consistent trend throughout the study period. More cases of Cuckoo Cuculus canorus parasitism were observed in 1997−2017 than in 1970−1984 (7% of nest losses versus 0 respectively), whereas starvation of nestlings was more frequent in 1970−1984 (10% versus 2% of nest losses). Breeding densities varied between seasons with no significant trend across the study years.

We compared the abundance of Great Tits and its main food competitors, the Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs and other tits species (Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus, Coal Tit Periparus ater and Crested Tit Lophophanes cristatus), and breeding parameters of Great Tits in four forest types: a mixed forest, a native broadleaf forest, a Maritime Pine Pinus pinaster plantation and a Blue Gum Eucalyptus globulus plantation in Central Portugal. The breeding parameters (laying date, clutch size, egg volume, hatching success, fledging success and chick body mass) were collected from nest boxes placed in the four forest types. The censuses indicated a higher abundance index of Great Tit and its food competitors in the mixed and broadleaf forest, when compared to the monoculture plantations. Occupancy rate of nest boxes was not directly related with tit abundance due to differences in the availability of natural nest cavities among forest types, and differences in preference for nesting cavities among tit species. However, a Great Tit abundance index gave similar results to the densities described in the literature, except for the Great Tit in the Eucalyptus plantations where the placement of the nest boxes should explain our value of 2.1 birds ha-1, which is four times higher than that reported for other Eucalyptus plantations. Egg volume differed significantly among forest types; it was higher in the pine plantations and lower in the Eucalyptus plantations. Surprisingly, all other breeding parameters (laying date, clutch size, chick body mass, hatching and fledgling success) were similar among forest types and between years. On the other hand the number of eggs, hatchlings and fledglings were lower than those obtained in other studies in the Iberian Peninsula. Our results suggest that Great Tits have a high plasticity that enables them to adjust their breeding strategies even to forest plantations, if nest sites are available.",

Here, we examined the contributions of habitat geology, first egg dates, clutch sizes and year in determining intraspecific variation in the intensity of speckling patterns on the eggs of Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major breeding in deciduous woodlands with underlying calcium-rich limestone and calcium-poor gritstone rock types in northwest England. Eggshell speckling patterns varied significantly in relation to habitat geology, with both species laying more heavily speckled eggs in woodlands with gritstone rock types than in woodlands with limestone rock types, even though the weights of laying females and the availability of aerial invertebrates never differed between the two habitat geology types. Meanwhile, there was no variation in eggshell speckling patterns in both species in relation to first egg dates, clutch sizes or year. The eggs of both species were probably more speckled in the calcium-poor gritstone woodland because laying females were compensating for reduced eggshell strength in those woodland areas where there was low calcium availability by depositing more protoporphyrin-based pigments, that constitute the darker speckles and form at locations on the egg where the shell is thinnest, than conspecifics laying eggs in the calcium-rich limestone woodland. We thus conclude that micro-geographic heterogeneity in habitat geology types significantly influence the eggshell patterning of birds' eggs and more broadly our study confirms that environmental factors strongly influence intraspecific variation in avian eggshell patterning.",

If not removed, this material can accumulate and render cavities unusable, as recorded in some nest-box studies. Data from earlier studies of tree cavities, however, showed that nest material can decrease mostly due to in situ decomposition, but the relative difference between nest decomposition in tree holes and nest-boxes is still unknown. We undertook parallel studies of decay in tree holes and nest-boxes used by European Starlings Sturnus vulgaris in oak-hornbeam stands (SW Poland). We inserted into its tree holes and nest-boxes litter-bags filled with cellulose and wool. After 7.5 months of exposure we detected much greater decomposition in tree holes than in nest-boxes. In tree holes a median 75% of cellulose and 26% of wool disappeared, whilst in nest-boxes a median of only 2% of cellulose and 14% of wool. These results are the first to document the relative difference between natural and artificial breeding cavities in the extent of nest decomposition. We also discuss the effect of nest material accumulation in tree holes and nest-boxes on the different nesting conditions available for hole-nesting birds. Taken together with: microclimate, nest safety, competition with social insects and presence of ectoparasites, the physical accumulation of nest material appear to be distinctive feature that differentiates the natural and artificial sites of tree-hole-nesting birds.",

    "abstract": "Grassland fire suppression causes numerous ecological changes including increases in woody vegetation, reduced biodiversity, and population declines of grassland species. Elimination of vegetation structure created and maintained by fire is a major driver of these changes. In this study, we documented a seldom-described nesting preference in Brewer's Blackbirds Euphagus cyanocephalus through the discovery of 56 nests in recently burned (0 and 1 years-since-fire) mixed-grass prairie. After locating nests via systematic rope dragging, we monitored them to characterize fates and then measured vegetation characteristics at and near nests to determine how vegetation structure influences nest survival. Most Brewer's Blackbird nests were located in patches burned within 1.5 years of the nesting attempt, though such patches made up 21% of the landscape. Nests were located on the ground and consisted of fine grasses lined with animal hair. Site selection analysis showed that Brewer's Blackbirds were 38 and 34 times more likely to nest in 0 and 1 year-since-fire patches than unburned patches, respectively. Nest survival analysis indicated a daily survival rate of 0.96 (0.32 overall survival). Lower survival rates were associated with higher bare ground and litter cover at the microsite (5 m from nest) and nest site (at nest), respectively. These results demonstrate that Brewer's Blackbirds exploit fire-associated vegetation structure in tree-limited landscapes. This research suggests that restored grassland disturbance regimes extend broad benefits to non-obligate taxa, as well as reveals previously repressed fire-associated behaviors of wildlife.",

    "abstract": "Incubation of eggs and nestlings is energetically costly and may be affected by the amount of thermal insulation the surrounding nest provides. In many small passerine species, animal-derived materials, i.e., feathers and hair, are often used in the nest lining where, presumably, their lower thermal conductance offers better insulation. A previous study that involved partial deconstruction of thrush nests revealed that different parts of the nest confer different levels of insulation. The present study examined the insulatory values of Common Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs nests because of the high proportion of animal-derived materials in their cup lining but not the outer nest. Insulatory values and cooling rates of temperature loggers inside the cup were determined for whole nests and then only the cup lining. There were no significant relationships between nest measurements and measures of thermal insulation. However, removal of the outer nest wall reduced the insulatory value by around 10% despite the cup lining being less than half the thickness of the complete nest wall and the cup lining being only a third of the total nest mass. Differential placement of animal-derived materials within the cup lining of Common Chaffinch nests means that the birds seem to be able to confer a high level of insulation without expending too much energy searching for a large mass of particular nest materials.",

    "abstract": "We studied a sympatric and crossbreeding population of the Lesser and the Greater Spotted Eagle in the Biebrza Valley, NE Poland. In order to follow the dynamics of hybridisation and its possible causes we monitored these two species between 1996 and 2012, using visual and genetic species identification. Individuals in up to 51 territories annually were determined as one of the two species or as a hybrid according to plumage characteristics. Feathers from adults and chicks from 114 broods were collected and genotyped using 30 nuclear markers. Hybridisation was observed with both methods already at the beginning of the study, and showed a significantly increasing trend. The proportion of broods producing hybrids of the Greater and the Lesser Spotted Eagle increased during the study by over 30%. The percentage of territories occupied by pure Greater Spotted Eagle pairs declined to 50% at the end of the study. The increasing number of mixed pairs highly significantly correlated with the decreasing number of pairs of the rare Greater Spotted Eagle, but weakly with the numbers of the more common Lesser Spotted Eagle. Mate replacement was frequently recorded and favoured the Lesser Spotted Eagle or hybrids. Adult males were the most often replaced sex (71%), possibly due to their higher mortality. Sex ratio at the nestling stage did not diverge from 1:1. Overall, 13 cases of within-pair species composition change were recorded, leading mostly to hybridisation (61%), but sometimes also to re-establishment of pure A. clanga pairs (23%). Alteration of habitat towards that preferred by the Lesser Spotted Eagle and differential sex-mortality are discussed as the most possible causes of the increasing crossbreeding rate.",

Although much has been learned concerning the social organisation and ecology of this species, over 45 years of research at Hastings Reservation, central coastal California, USA, has left us with a large number of unanswered questions ranging from relatively minor issues such as why adults have white eyes and why juveniles have a plumage similar to adult males to more major issues such as how cavity limitation could act as a driver of their unique social behaviours and how brood reduction is adaptive. Here we briefly discuss some of these questions and speculate as to how they might be addressed by future work. Long-term studies are important as a means of addressing many demographic and behavioural questions, but are even more valuable as a means of generating new questions that would have been overlooked without detailed knowledge of natural history and general ecology.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic noise, a consequence of expanding infrastructure and industry in ecosystems, is a serious and ubiquitous threat, which can significantly modify the behaviour and certain population parameters in animals. Birds are particularly vulnerable in this respect, given that they communicate mostly vocally in dense habitats. In the winter time traffic noise can modify distribution of birds by masking of their alarm and contact calls. Additionally seasonal variation in avian auditory can modified birds responses to traffic noise during winter. The present paper reports the results of an investigation into the influence of a busy road (annual average 6673 motor vehicles per day) and traffic noise on woodland birds in winter. To our knowledge this study is the first to assess the effect of road noise on woodland birds during winter. We counted birds using the point—count method at 36 survey stations located in the forest at various distances from the road. At each such station we assessed selected habitat parameters, the distance from the road and the noise intensity level. We recorded a total of 454 birds belonging to 19 species. The mean noise intensity during the counts was 74.9 ± 2.6 dB at the stations situated 60 m from the road, 49.3 ± 2.5 dB at the stations 310 m from the road and 41.2 ± 2.9 dB at the stations 560 m from the road. The abundance and species richness of wintering birds did not depend on distance from the busy road or traffic noise in December, but in next months (January and February) the number of species and bird abundance were lower near the road. There were also differences in the abundance of a particular ecological bird assemblages distinguished according to food preference or social behaviour in relation to distance from the road. The proportion of granivorous birds decreased from December to February and with increasing noise level. The proportion of birds belonging to flocking species was related primarily to survey month and increased from December to February. This case study indicates that, in contrast to the results obtained during the breeding season and the autumn migration in the same study plot, road and traffic noise has no effect on the number of birds in the vicinity of a road during December. However in the next months, in January and February bird abundance and number of species was lower near the road, similar as during breeding and autumn migration periods.",

However, many studies have shown inconsistent results among species, populations, and study years. We investigated sex ratio patterns in a population of Japanese Tit Parus minor, which is closely related to the Great Tit Parus major. In this fouryear study, a total of 1500 offspring from 191 nests were sexed. We found that the proportion of male offspring in each brood was negatively related to laying date and clutch size only in the first clutches. This corresponds to our prediction that in sexually dimorphic Japanese Tits, females may control sex ratio by adjusting clutch size or the timing of laying to reduce costs of rearing. However, this relationship did not appear in later clutches, indicating that manipulation of sex ratios occurred only in part of the season. Parental quality was not related to sex ratio in either first or later clutches. Our results suggest that female Japanese Tits may control the sex ratio to balance reproductive effort and self-maintenance rather than to raise the offspring fitness benefits in relation to the quality of parents, and that they use a different sex allocation strategy between first and later clutches.",

We investigated whether structural colors represent class signals related to age, sex, and territory ownership in a social, sexually monochromatic species, the Eurasian Magpie Pica pica. We examined the reflectance spectra from white scapulars, bluish iridescent secondary and greenish iridescent tail plumage, as well as size of white scapular patch. Significant color differences between age classes were found in all measured plumage parts, with adults having plumage with higher color score, that is brighter, shorter wavelength-directed, and more saturated color, than young magpies. Color differences between males and females and between breeding adults (territorial owners) and non-breeding adults were only detected in the tail plumage. Size of white scapular patch did not differ between age and sex classes. Color differences among individuals belonging to different social classes may lessen agonistic confrontations. Sex differences in coloration may enable prompt sex recognition and thus facilitate pair formation. Higher tail color scores of adults, particularly males, support previous suggestions that the tail characteristics of avian species with relatively long tails represent a visual signal of the bearer's quality.",

    "abstract": "Birds inhabiting urban areas have to deal with high levels of ambient noise. Some species show a certain song flexibility that enables them to reduce noise interferences in their communications. This vocal adjustment usually implies an increase in the minimum frequencies of songs. Since urban noise is mainly made up of low frequencies (about 2.5–3.5 kHz), song of species that sing at higher frequencies could be less susceptible to being masked by anthropogenic noise. This study explores whether such species also show any kind of adjustment to noisy environments. For this purpose, the spectral and temporal parameters (note duration, maximum and minimum frequency and diversity) of the song of the European Wren Troglodytes troglodytes were analysed in three different environments (urban, periurban and rural). To evaluate the impact of noise on the vocalizations, a specific acoustic descriptor of song variability was developed. Song variability increased along the urban noise gradient from rural to urban areas and the duration of notes decreased from rural to urban zones. Urban wrens developed more complex songs with higher frequencies and longer notes than their rural counterparts, whereas peri-urban birds occupied an intermediate position, although closer to urban ones in the length of notes. These changes could be associated with higher background noise levels, although other possible causes, such as the population density, could also explain them. Maximum frequencies were mostly outside the background noise range and differed among habitats, whereas lower frequencies unexpectedly did not differ among habitats. Our results suggest that differences in song parameters among species may lead to different mechanisms of vocal adjustment. Even in wrens, with high frequency vocalisation, interference with urban anthropogenic noise could show certain changes in their vocalizations.",

Using a museum collection of Red-backed Shrike clutches, we estimated the repeatability of characteristics describing the intensity and contrast of egg pigmentation, as well as egg size and shape. Digitalized photographs of eggs were used for all measurements. Repeatability was highest for overall pigmentation intensity and overall pigmentation contrast (R = 0.81 and R = 0.82 respectively). Lower values were recorded for egg breadth (R = 0.66) and shape (R = 0.57). These findings suggest that eggshell patterning, as well as the variables describing egg size and shape, may respond to natural selection. Among the possible functions of this trait, condition signalling within species and mimicry are the most probable. To obtain more evidence of this, however, further studies in wild populations are required.",

    "abstract": "Mast-seeding is widely considered to be an adaptation that minimizes seed predation. The superabundance of seeds during mast years greatly exceeds the capacity of seed predators to consume them. These notions were based on research on food specialists such as insects and rodents. However, mast-seeding may have different impact on the behavior of corvids that are food generalists. The Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius is a widespread scatter-hoarding corvid that uses acorns as a food reserve for winter. In mast-years, the birds are supposed to be satiated by the greater seed supply and are able to store their surplus, acting as dispersal agents, whereas in poor crop seasons they use most of the crop for current consumption and thus become seed predators. In such a situation, a dispersal agent may become a seed predator, and vice versa. The main task of this study was to determine the levels of pre-dispersal acorn predation by Jays during non-mast years to verify the notion that under such conditions Jays act mostly as seed consumers. During two consecutive non-mast years, tagged acorns were radio-tracked and the acorns' fate (cached or eaten) was assessed. We found extremely low pre-dispersal acorn predation by Jays (0.9%). The possible reason is that temperatures in period of acorns collecting (September–October) are high enough to allow invertebrates to remain active, so the Jays may supplement their diet with insects and also fleshy fruits. Therefore, almost all acorns were cached and scatter-hoarding Jays provided effective seed dispersal, with extremely low consumption of acorns.",

    "abstract": "The pattern of autumn migration of the Robin was studied through an analysis of daily dynamics for the birds caught in the years 1984–1997 at four ringing stations (two on the Baltic coast and two in inland Poland). In a given year, migration dynamics was found to be distinctly similar at all stations. It showed conspicuous consistence (± 2 days) in the dates with peak numbers. This could be explained by assuming that Robins take off at the same time across a large breeding ground, and arrive almost simultaneously at stopover sites located over extensive areas. Moreover, migration dynamics from year to year at a given station was also remarkably similar, though this phenomenon was more distinct at the inland stations than at the coastal ones. Day-to-day fluctuations in numbers were on an average the highest at the coastal station most exposed to variable weather, the lowest at the inland stations, and intermediate at the more \"sheltered\" of the coastal station. The paper discusses the extent to which such results can reflect the influence of weather conditions on passage, or else a precise internal (physiological and genetic) mechanism responsible for the timing of migration.",

Nest sites had a significantly higher percentage of foliage cover and a greater cover and abundance of rattans, suggesting that Abbott's Babbler sites its nests in areas with a large number of potential nest sites.

The higher abundance of the Collared Flycatcher was once considered a possible cause of mixed singing. To examine this hypothesis we studied the influence of the Collared Flycatcher on the interpopulational song variability in the Pied Flycatcher in four areas with different abundances of Collared Flycatchers. We focused on: 1) the abundance of mixed singers and their distribution; 2) geographical variations of typical Pied Flycatcher songs. We show for the first time that mixed singing in the Pied Flycatcher is common also when its abundance is as high as and higher than that of the Collared Flycatcher. In the old area of sympatry about 40% of all Pied Flycatcher males had Collared-Flycatcher-like syllables in their repertoire. At the same time, the habitat distribution of mixed singers matches that of the Collared Flycatcher. In the context of our data we propose a hypothesis of mixed song-formation. We have also demonstrated interpopulational variability in pure Pied Flycatcher songs, with species-specific differences being more pronounced in sympatric populations than in allopatric ones. This pattern is in agreement with the theory of character displacement and acoustic divergence in a sympatry zone, but the differences discovered in pure vocalizations are evidently not the result of interactions with the sibling species.",

Analysis of 23 blood samples (performed by radioimmunoassay) collected during the molt, i.e., at the time of plumage development, revealed significantly higher testosterone levels in males molting to the adult color than in those molting to the subadult one. This may suggest a certain role played by testosterone in the regulation of delayed plumage maturation. However, there were no marked differences between males of different coloration and/or age during the breeding season. Analysis of 46 blood samples collected outside the molting period confirmed the seasonal testosterone pattern (spring peak and winter minimum) typical of most temperate passerines.",

Based on a logistic regression, three factors had an influence on breeding success: study area, breeding phenology, and plant cover type. Location of the nest inside the shrub, as well as luminosity inside a shrub varied between studied shrub species, but did not significantly affect breeding success. The percentage of successful nests was significantly higher in Olite than in Toro (64.5% and 37.9% respectively). In Olite, but not in Toro, clutches laid early (first egg laid prior to 1st May) were more successful than clutches laid late. The highest breeding success was recorded in nests located in thorny shrubs and, especially, in those found in Blackberry bushes. Conservation of Blackberry shrubs appears to be an appropriate measure to increase breeding success of the Southern Grey Shrike.",

Accordingly, most studies dealing with the stopover ecology of this species have been chiefly focused on the habitat use and the availability of suitable habitats along its route of migration. In contrast, much less attention has been paid to other environmental causes potentially explaining the use of stopover sites. Our aim here was to investigate whether the Aquatic Warbler at an apparently suboptimal stopover site with small area of suitable habitats stops over only during adverse weather conditions. We used data obtained at a suboptimal (Jaizubia marshland, northern Iberia) and another optimal (Villefranque, southwestern France) stopover sites during the autumn migration over four seasons (2007–2010). The Aquatic Warbler tended to stop over at Jaizubia in days with rain, a fact that was not so evident at Villefranque, supporting the hypothesis that they used the suboptimal site only, or mostly, when adverse weather conditions forced them to land. In contrast, the optimal habitat was used independently of weather conditions. To properly identify key stopover localities for the Aquatic Warbler, we should consider the potential influence of adverse weather in occurrence of individuals, especially in small areas without preferred habitat.",

We collected data on parent birds (age), their breeding performance (laying dates, clutch size, nesting success), and the offspring sex ratio in two types of old growth habitats over three years. The individual broods varied from all male to all female, but no significant deviation from parity was detected at the population level. The inter-brood variation could be accounted for neither by environmental (season, habitat) nor parental (female age, laying dates, clutch size, and brood size) variables analyzed. The primary sex ratios (at laying) did not differ from the secondary (brood) sex ratios. Thus, there was no indication of post-hatching sex ratio adjustments, either.

Two 30–31.5 ha plots were regularly checked each year to find most nests present, usually observed since the period of their construction. Mean clutch size (5.27 ± 0.66, for best year — 5.5) finally produced small family size, owing to a partial loss, fledging and post-fledging mortality. Average breeding losses calculated traditional way were 72.8% (n = 202), mostly due to egg robbing, then predation on nestlings (three times less frequent), and, sporadically, adverse weather conditions at the moment of fledging. Nesting success (5.9–35.7%, 27.2% on average), strongly varying between years, is lower than in most Hawfinch populations from other (anthropogenic) habitats, being one of the lowest among temperate Passerines. In spite of low production of young the species remains numerous across deciduous stands of the Białowieża Forest, with its numbers even increasing since the 1980s. This large and dense population living in an apparently optimal habitat may, sporadically, be supported by influxes from other (anthropogenic?) sites.",

The interactions between the structure of field margins and biota have been recognized, yet the understanding of the importance of various components of the margins and adjacent areas is still incomplete. The aim of our study was therefore to determine the relative importance of structural features of the margins and diversity of adjacent crops for birds breeding in field margins. The study was carried out in 70 field margins covered with semi-natural vegetation, situated in SW Poland. Both the number of species and bird density were most strongly positively related to the development of tree and shrub layers, while presence of ditches and percentage of reed cover (positive effects) had much less importance. Analyses conducted at the species level revealed the complexity of bird-habitat interactions resulting from various requirements of individual species. Overall, for 22 abundant species and for the threatened species, the development of the shrub layer turned out to be a particularly important feature of field margins positively associated with occurrence of e.g. Emberiza citrinella, Linaria cannabina and Streptopelia turtur. Other significant positive effects had the development of the tree layer (e.g. Turdus merula and Turdus philomelos), presence of ditch (e.g. Acrocephalus palustris, Sylvia communis), and number of gaps in woody vegetation (e.g. Lanius collurio). The diversity of adjacent crops had positive effects only to some threatened species (e.g. L. collurio and E. calandra). Abundances of common and threatened birds were not correlated, which reflects different habitat demands of these two groups. Because of diverse bird-habitat relationships, maintaining a variety of field margins (in particular the shrubby ones), should be accepted as a rule in biodiversity-oriented management of agricultural landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Egg size is a basic species-specific life-history trait in birds which influences offspring performance through the nestling stage and, therefore, fitness. Shells of snails are the principal source of calcium for female parids and some other passerines during egg formation. Shortages in the availability of snail shells may lead to laying smaller eggs with thinner shells. In urban green spaces that require protection against pests, the numbers of snails may become greatly reduced in response to molluscicide treatments. The use of a molluscicide treatment against pest slugs in the Botanic Garden, Łódź, Poland, in 2013 and 2014 provided a unique quasi-experimental setting to study the effect of molluscicide on both non-target snails and Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus eggs. Using a forest study site where no treatment was applied as a control area, we tested for effects of the molluscicide treatment in the Botanic Garden on the density of snails and on the egg volume of Blue Tits. We found that after the molluscicide treatment a dramatic drop in snail numbers occurred, which likely restricted the availability of snail shells for egg laying Blue Tits in the Botanic Garden. Correspondingly, egg sizes significantly decreased in the Garden, while they stayed constant over time in the forest. Eggs in bigger clutches were more strongly affected by the molluscicide treatment than eggs in smaller clutches. Our quasi-experimental study suggests that Blue Tits are sensitive to poor availability of snail shells. This is manifested by laying smaller eggs, which require less calcium to be incorporated in the eggshell, in response to a dramatic drop in the availability of snail shells. This result is expected to raise awareness of potential indirect and inadvertent effects of park pest management on biota other than molluscan pests.",

    "abstract": "Studies dealing with the selection of tree species and characteristics for cavity-nesting birds are important to evaluate the abundance and quality of available resources in the environment. The aim of this study is to characterize the use of trees by woodpecker species in the subtropical piedmont forests of northwestern Argentina by using the analysis of niche selection, breadth and overlap in a total of five woodpecker species of different body size found in these subtropical forests: White-barred Piculet Picumnus cirratus (small woodpeckers), Golden-olive Woodpecker Colaptes rubiginosus, Golden-green Woodpecker Piculus chrysochloros, Dot-fronted Woodpecker Veniliornis frontalis (medium-sized woodpeckers), and Cream-backed Woodpecker Campephilus leucopogon (largest woodpeckers). From a total of 54 tree species, only 15 were used by these woodpecker species. Primary excavator species were moderate specialists in tree use (Levin's index), and they showed selection according to their availability (Ivlev's index) of four of the fifteen tree species (Calycophyllum multiflorum, Amburana cearensis, Cedrela balansae, Astronium urundeuva) and snags. There was a high overlap (Morisita's overlap index) in the use of tree species between Picumnus cirratus and medium-sized woodpeckers, while less overlap was found between Campephilus leucopogon and other woodpecker species. Both living trees and snags were used by the woodpeckers, although snags were more important for small and medium-sized woodpeckers, whereas living trees were more important for Campephilus leucopogon. Both snags and living trees had a large diameter at breast height (DBH) in > 50 cm. Results show the existence of different cavity-excavation niches for woodpecker species in subtropical forests of Argentina, and they allow us to identify the important relationships between these birds and the available tree species. Thus, the results of this work may be useful to develop sustainable forest management guidelines for this group of birds.",

    "abstract": "The Atlantic Forest in southeastern South America is a biodiversity hotspot with high species richness and high forest loss. Three large to medium-sized woodpecker species (Robust Woodpecker Campephilus robustus, Lineated Woodpecker Dryocopus lineatus, and the globally threatened Helmeted Woodpecker Celeus galeatus) coexist in the south of the ecoregion, and show remarkable convergence in plumage patterns and colouration, possibly driven by interspecific interactions. We assessed differentiation in nest tree species, nest substrates, and timing of breeding and evaluated whether nesting ecology may be a factor explaining an association with mature forests in the Helmeted Woodpecker. Robust and Lineated Woodpeckers excavated cavities in nine and eight nest tree species, respectively, whereas Helmeted Woodpeckers specialized narrowly on laurel trees (88% of nest cavities in two species in genus Nectandra of 52 ± 14 cm DBH). Helmeted Woodpecker is further distinguished by a more frequent use of living, partially decayed trees and by more frequent re-use of nest cavities. When nesting in selectively logged forest (vs. old-growth), Robust and Lineated Woodpeckers used trees with smaller DBH and Robust Woodpeckers excavated lower in trees. Helmeted Woodpeckers selected nest trees with similar dimensions in both environments, indicating lesser flexibility. Helmeted Woodpeckers bred 20–23 days later in the year than Lineated and Robust Woodpeckers, potentially allowing them to avoid nesting near the two larger species. The narrow specialization of Helmeted Woodpecker on nesting in Nectandra trees of large sizes at the onset of decay is a possible factor in making it sensitive to selective logging effects. To stop declines of Helmeted Woodpecker we recommend (1) sparing large trees from selective logging (including Nectandra and tree species used for roosting), and (2) restoring more forested areas to mature forest conditions.",

Observations have been made in many avian species but causes of this behaviour remain unknown and no hypothesis was proposed to fully explain its occurrence. In this review, I collected observations of interspecific feeding in birds reported during the last 40 years and compiled a comprehensive dataset based on all published reports of interspecific feeding. It consists of 186 cases observed in 107 species worldwide and summarizes the information on involved species, their age, sex, and possible causes of this misdirected parental care. Additionally, I report a case of Great Spotted Woodpeckers' Dendrocopos major young fed by Eurasian Nuthatches Sitta europaea. Observations of interspecific feeding are highly skewed in favour of North American and European species, probably due to historical (long research and ornithology traditions) and language issues (publishing in English). Interspecific feeding does not seem to be related to nest type but is mostly associated with males allured by loud calls of nestlings from nearby allospecific nests. However, most of the observations remain only anecdotic and an empirical research that would try to find plausible explanations of the evolutionary advantages of this behaviour still remains to be carried out.",

The observed social structure was defined by adults and juveniles occupying individual but partially-overlapping home-ranges, with typical groups of 2–3 birds (maximum of 9 birds) having a changeable composition. There was no evidence of exclusive territoriality among individuals or groups during the winter, and no evidence of stable social groups with a consistent membership. Instead, the major social units detected were male-female pairs, with mostly casual associations between other individuals. Individual home-ranges averaged 31 ha (10-63 ha, n = 9) and their core areas overlapped with each other by an average 14% (0-65%), indicating that Marsh Tits in this population had very large spatial habitat requirements during winter. Our results have relevance for Marsh Tit conservation, and also the understanding of the drivers and plasticity of social organisation in the family Paridae; we discuss our findings in the context of the discrete and basic flock system exhibited by other species within this group.",

    "abstract": "Habitat is a key determinant of breeding success in hole-nesting birds. Identifying the factors that influence breeding success is important in understanding nest-site selection behaviour and devising appropriate conservation strategies. This is especially true for declining species like the migratory Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. Here, I analyse the effect of 24 habitat variables on clutch size, hatching success and fledging success for 137 Pied Flycatcher nests in Gloucestershire, UK, using volunteer-collected data from a 5-year period. More successful nests tended to be located in areas with a lower density of mature trees but abundant saplings. Tree and sapling species richness was also important. Success was positively related to abundance of Oak Quercus robur and Silver Birch Betula pendula and negatively related to Beech Fagus sylvatica, Sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus and Bracken Pteridium aquilinum. Success was lower in boxes facing south-southwest and higher in boxes located on sorter trees. Despite Pied Flycatchers often being regarded as birds of grazed (open) woodland, success was not related directly to grazing. Close proximity to footpaths was associated with significantly lower clutch size, numbers of young to fledge, and percentage success, while close proximity to water was associated with increased success at all stages of breeding. This is a single-site study and the generality of these findings at other sites cannot be assumed without empirical testing. However, the results provide useful additional insight into success-habitat interactions in this species that, to some extent, challenge the general view of Pied Flycatchers, in the UK at least, as grazed woodland specialists.",

    "abstract": "Human activities may generate geometrical landscape (i.e. composed of rectilinear and repetitive landscape units) structures that can significantly influence the spatial distribution of birds. While bird distribution in various landscape types has been extensively studied, the role played by landscape configuration and composition in different facets of bird diversity remains unclear. Here, these two main components of landscape characteristics (i.e. configuration and composition) are disentangled and their relative influence on three different facets of bird assemblages: taxonomic and functional characteristics, and the presence of rare species, is tested. We chose four large coastal salinas of Western France as a relevant model of geometrical and human-dominated landscapes where each landscape unit can be easily identified and mapped. The landscape characteristics of these sites were mapped and quantified. Then, terrestrial breeding birds were sampled in 172 point-counts using a standardized protocol. 69 diurnal terrestrial bird species were detected and considered in analyses (waterbirds and owls excluded). Landscape composition was found to have a higher influence on bird communities than landscape configuration, which fits with the “landscape composition hypothesis”. More specifically, the most “extreme” landscapes — those with low terrestrial surface areas, low landscape richness and diversity, low cohesion, and very patchy landscapes with complex geometrical shapes — host the lowest bird taxonomic abundance, richness and diversity and functional richness, but are characterized by the presence of rare species (mainly wetland specialist species, e.g. Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus and species with restricted ranges e.g. Bluethroat Luscinia svecica namnetum). Our results suggest that conservation plans in such geometrical and human-dominated habitats should not only focus on one aspect of landscape characteristics or one aspect of biological diversity but also consider the adverse effects of landscape characteristics on these different facets.",

    "abstract": "This paper synthesizes all available quantitative information on total breeding densities of Estonian forest bird assemblages, as estimated in territory mapping studies since the 1950s. There have been two approaches, one based on multiple visits (typically 7–8), and the other of reduced effort, developed for long-term monitoring. Compared to these mapping methods, line (strip) transects give ca. 30% lower estimates; they also vary widely. After quality checking, a total of 90 mapping estimates were extracted. The estimates were then integrated into 'typical densities' by habitat types, after critically assessing data quality and bias. 'Typical density' is conceptualized as a range of common density values in actual topographic, soil, forest-age and landscape conditions, under minor recent thinning influence. It also considers 15–20% underestimation of the territory mapping, which was demonstrated using a case study on post-breeding nest searching of three thrush (Turdus spp.) species. The Estonian forest bird densities show monotonous increases along the stand age, following three alternative shapes related to site productivity: a major increase within 100 years in the most productive forests, a delayed increase (also post 100 years) in pine forests of medium productivity, and slow and slight increases at low-productivity sites. Such density estimates can serve as a basis to analyse deviations in particular conditions and be integrated into land-use scenario-modelling tools across landscapes. It is important to keep the territory mapping approaches to bird census in active use and development, since several issues in conservation and ecosystem functioning cannot be addressed by relative assessments.",

Heavy metals: Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu — were determined in various organs of nestlings, fledglings and mature birds as well as egg yolks. Resting metabolic rates, hatching success and eggshell thickness were used as biomarkers of environmental exposure to industrial pollutants. The clutch size (2.97 versus 3.61) and hatching success (81.5% versus 87%) were lower in the colony from the more polluted site. The relatively high metal contents in the yolks indicate that off spring are only partially protected from toxic compounds. Gulls were able to regulate body contents of essential metals Zn and Cu, but Pb and Cd accumulated rapidly in the liver, kidneys and lungs of growing birds. Cd also accumulated in the ovaries at the similar levels as in the kidneys. Cd and Pb may have affected earlier stages of development when parents were foraged in a close vicinity of the heavily polluted area but once the young gulls had reached maturity they then foraged in distant areas. During this period they were exposed to pollutants in the same way as the gulls from the less polluted site. There was no growth impairment identified in gulls from the more polluted area, and their resting metabolism (RMR) calculated per unit of body weight was lower, indicating that energetic costs for detoxification were not as high.",

In a total of 47 urban parks and suburban woods, 22 wooded areas were occupied by Great Spotted Woodpeckers during the breeding period. All woods greater than 50 ha in area were occupied by woodpeckers. On a five year scale, territorial stability was positively correlated with woodland size. The requirement of wooded area per territory was slightly higher in urban parks (6.7 ± 2.7 ha, n = 10 wooded areas) than in suburban woods (5.7 ± 1.3 ha, n = 5), and was negatively correlated to the vegetation cover. The area of woodland per territory in Rome was higher than in neighbouring deciduous oak woods. This suggests that urban habitats are of inferior quality for breeding Great Spotted Woodpeckers, probably owing to features of their vegetation and their isolation from other woodland patches. Maintaining mature stands of natural vegetation with old and dead trees in larger urban parks could be useful to encourage the occurrence of Great Spotted Woodpecker in cities.",

The mean onset of egg-laying was 22 April (range 19–26 April). There was a tendency to start breeding earlier in warmer springs. The mean clutch size was 5.07 ± 0.74. There was a positive correlation between clutch size and the date of egg-laying. These data suggest that there was a compromise between the tendency towards earlier breeding and clutch size. In the study area the Greenfinch is a double-brooded species. Unlike other studies it was noted that the average clutch size increased in the second half of the breeding season. The maximum clutch size coincides with the second or replacement clutches. Hatching, fledging and breeding success were lowest when clutch sizes were largest. The nesting success estimated with the Mayfield and the “traditional” method was approximately similar (0.40 and 0.44 respectively). Cats and mustelids were probably the cause of most breeding failures. Corvids were not responsible for nesting failures.",

The density and numbers of these birds are governed mainly by changes in the groundwater table caused by floods, droughts or fires. Aquatic Warblers breed successfully when the groundwater table coincides with the topsoil level; the optimal water table lies in the range from 12 cm above the soil to 5 cm below it. Between 1981 and 2002 successful first-clutch breeding occurred 11 times (47.8%); in only 4 years was second-clutch breeding successful (17.3%). First and second clutches both failed in 9 years (39%). The pattern of changes in the population size and data on the recovery of the population size following such unfavourable years indicates that the key factors governing the overall population size are not migration or wintering conditions, but rather the state of the breeding biotopes.

Species composition depended on both the spatial structure of a fragment and the features of its surroundings. Local declines and appearances of species had a similar influence on the turnover in all size classes of the fragments. Species that contributed most to the total turnover were: Lanius collurio, Phasianus colchicus, Anas platyrhynchos, Emberiza schoeniclus, Columba palumbus and Sylvia communis. However, there were differences among species contributing most to the turnover according to area size classes. Heterogeneous habitats in a mosaic-like, agricultural landscape do not function as islands.

    "abstract": "The length of the tarsus and wing, and the weight of the Dipper were measured in four mountain ranges in Spain (Cantabrian Mountains, western Pyrenees, the Central Mountains and Sierra Nevada). Birds from the Sierra Nevada were the largest but there were no significant differences among the other three areas. In the north, the range of the C. c. cinclus and C. c. aquaticus subspecies overlapped. In the south only aquaticus was present and in the central mountains only cinclus. The biometrics of cinclus in the north and centre were similar but aquaticus was larger in the south than the north. Spanish populations of C. cinclus thus appear to go against the predictions of Bergmann's rule. The residual index (RI) was calculated for individual birds from the regression of mass/tarsus length. RI was higher in males than females in the northern populations, but the same in the centre and south. According to this index, males (but not females) were heavier than the theoretical weight in the north and lighter in the centre and southern ranges. Some other variations in the Spanish populations are also discussed.",

In contrast to this belief, the paper describes the replacement of at least three males and at least one female at one nest in SW Poland during the spring of 1994. The first pair occupied the nest for 5–8 days, the second pair for one day, and probably only the third pair remained at the nest to actually breed. Additional data on arrival patterns show that such replacements of non-breeding storks may occur much more frequently than was previously thought, especially in areas of intense migration. Consequently, the most common phenological observations (e.g. the arrival dates of the first and second White Storks) are not really useful for defining the timing of breeding. It is suggested that the beginning of nest occupancy should be defined by the beginning of the permanent stay of the second partner, and not just by the date of the birds' first appearance.",

The globally endangered Sichuan Partridge is endemic to montane southwestern China, where it inhabits subtropical broadleaf forest. Its use of various habitats within the forest is poorly known. Habitat use by Sichuan Partridges in Laojunshan Nature Reserve, Sichuan, was studied during the breeding season (April—October). Habitat characteristics at feeding places were compared with randomly selected sites. Auditory detection was used during transect surveys of calling males to locate birds and their feeding scrape sites. Partridges were recorded in primary and secondary broadleaf forest, but not in coniferous plantations or farmland and settlements. Birds occurred between 1400 and 1800 m a. s. l., typically on the ground with a gentle slope of between five and 15 degrees, close to paths and water sources. The habitats used by Sichuan Partridges differed from the random sites in that they had a denser shrub layer, greater tree cover, thicker deciduous leaf depth and lower abundance of bamboo. Principal Components Analysis identified factors interpretable as concealment, topography and leaf litter depth as key axes of variation in Sichuan Partridge habitats. We suggest that habitat management plans incorporating this new information can now focus more effectively on identifying, protecting and restoring those sites within protected areas that are most suitable for the Sichuan Partridge.",

In Kayan Mentarang National Park (Indonesian Borneo) the Great Argus Pheasant Argusianus argus displayed different levels of calling activity. The study was conducted at a period when the birds were highly vocal, and again, at the same site, when the birds were significantly less vocal. Transect counts during periods of low vocal activity resulted in 13–20% lower density estimates compared to periods of high vocal activity, but these differences were not significant. Estimates derived from five-minute point counts during periods of low vocal activity, however, were 52% lower than those from periods of high vocal activity. Comparison of the two methods shows that density estimates derived from the point count method were consistently lower than those from the line transects. The lack of a fixed calling season in Argus Pheasants makes year-round censuses possible, yet the distinct temporal differences in calling rates necessitates that caution be exercised when results obtained in different years or at different times of the year are compared. It is concluded that there is an increased need for understanding the behavioural plasticity of species if census methods are to be improved.",

Tawny Pipits sang with a very variable rate of 4–28 songs per minute (mean ± SE 16.0 ± 1.35). Songs were thus short, with an average duration of under 0.5 sec. At the same time, songs were relatively complex in structure and consisted of 2–3 (max. 5) units of frequency between 2.7 and 5.3 kHz. Based on visual inspection of sonograms and further cross-correlation analysis, 20 different song types were distinguished. Each male had only a single song type in his repertoire and the rendition of strophes produced by a male were very stereotypical. The songs of different males exhibited varying levels of similarity, from completely different, through sharing some within-song units, to strongly similar on sonograms. However, even the strongly similar songs of different males demonstrated some individuality in frequency parameters or fine note structure. On average, there were only 0.38 different song types per male within the population studied, and 83% of males sang song types shared with at least one other male. Nine of the 20 song types described were unique, i.e. sung by single males. The results of this study suggest that a highly variable song rate may be a signal of male motivation, whereas individual differences in song structure probably enable individual recognition.",

Study areas were surveyed from March to early July, and the booming period of the Great Bittern was from March to July, varying between 58 to 108 days. The start of booming activity was linked to climatic factors. We visited 143 active nests in the study population, with the majority of females starting to lay eggs at the end of April to the beginning of May. The mean clutch size was 4.8 ± 0.8 (n = 109, range 1–6). There was no significant difference in clutch size between years or within years as the season progressed. Hatching success was high 92% (n = 78 broods). For all years of the study the breeding success (measured as a proportion of successful broods to all broods) was 51% (n = 120). The mean number of fledglings (15-days old chicks) per breeding female was 1.5 (SD ± 1.7, n = 116) and the mean number of fledglings per successful female was 3.0 (SD ± 1.2, n = 58). The main mortality factor for eggs and nestlings was mammalian predation. The high breeding parameters obtained for this population were probably due to extensive fish management and the good and stable food resources in the fishponds surveyed. Long-term monitoring and study of the population structure and breeding parameters of the Great Bittern in relation to known environmental factors are an essential tool for the conservation and management plans for this threatened species.",

Nevertheless, because of a lack of defensive mechanisms in potential prey, the influence of non-native predators should have longer-lasting and more deleterious repercussions. The breeding ecology of the Coot was studied in the Milicz Ponds reserve and compared with data from 20 years earlier. In the meantime, non-native, mammalian predators (American Mink Mustela vison, Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides and Raccoon Procyon lotor) turned up in this area, while the numbers of Hooded Crow Corvus cornix, the main predator of Coot nests, decreased. Compared with 1980–1982, the number of Coots in 2002–2003 dropped by more than half and mean clutch size decreased. Breeding success and the number of hatchlings per pair remained unchanged; in the 1980s, however, Coots renested more frequently, there was greater nesting synchrony and breeding seasons were demonstrably shorter. Moreover, although predation still remained the main cause of losses, its numbers were decreasing. Coots nesting on islands were the most successful, which was due to the weaker predation on the part of Crows. In contrast, the mammalian (non-native) predators did not appear to play a significant role in the breeding success in 2002–2003. Nevertheless, taking into account the breeding parameters of the Coot population and the nature of the relationship between mammalian/bird predators and Coots, it does seem that the low density of Coots in 2002–2003 was a reaction to the pressure of mammalian predators.",

While the advantages associated with roost site selection compared to nearby areas have been studied, the factors ruling the selection of roosts within a roosting site remain largely unknown. We investigated what factors affect the preference for roosts within a winter roosting site of Brambling Fringilla montifringilla. Type of vegetation, microclimate, topography and sources of disturbance were considered as possible variables affecting site selection and thus the density of birds. The density of droppings estimated at each of 300 sampling plots was used as an index of density of birds within the roosting site. We modeled density of birds using Generalized Additive Models with different explanatory variable combinations. Results show that factors shaping site selection are similar to those affecting habitat use at other scales, with Brambling resting in higher densities in warmer areas. This can be explained by the protection from winds and radiative heat loss during night, in accordance with results of previous studies at broader scales. In addition, we found a negative impact by human activities, Brambling avoided areas close to roads and forest tracks, possibly as a consequence of local traffic but also the of the affluence of people to watch the birds. Results suggest that site selection is best explained by the interaction between variables rather than by individual variables.",

Brood size manipulation affected body mass, heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (H:L) and fledging probability in both species and the level of triglycerides in nestling Great Tits. Extra food supply influenced only fledging probability, with no other effect on indicators of nestling performance. An effect on nestling body mass and a lack of effect on cell-mediated immune response in the brood-size experiment suggest that nestlings in enlarged broods sacrificed growth to maintain immunity. In general, effects of both types of experiments were probably to some extent masked by specific character of the study site — an urban parkland with high human-induced disturbance.",

In order to analyze their sexual size dimorphism we collected morphometric data and, for genetic control, feather pins as DNA source of 71 adult Water Rails and 31 Spotted Crakes during the breeding season 2008–2009. We determined the sex of each individual using PCR based molecular techniques taking into account the length polymorphism of the sex linked CHD1Z allele encountered in Water Rails. The polymorphism of this sex marker may have caused erroneous conclusions in previous studies using different approaches. In the present case, unawareness of the polymorphism would have lead to the misclassification of 50.8% of the individuals, which would result in problems with morphological comparison of the sexes. In general, males of both species were significantly larger than females. However, single measurements partly showed a high overlap of the sexes. Conducting a stepwise discriminant function analysis revealed bill, maximum wing chord and tarsus length as best discriminants for Water Rail. The resultant discriminant function, which allows assigning an individual to one of the sexes with a specific accuracy by its body measurements, correctly classified 98.6%. In Spotted Crakes the analysis included tarsus and wing length into the model and assigned the sex with an accuracy of 100%. The discriminant functions thus represent a simple and cost efficient way to determine the sex of these rallids for field ornithologists.",

    "abstract": "Availability of nest survival estimates over large spatial and temporal scales is necessary for the complex modelling of population dynamics. However, there may be no standardized nest monitoring schemes, as a primary source of data, for many species, locations or years. Although other potential datasets often do exist, their applicability for analysing large-scale temporal patterns in nest survival is not well established. We used an alternative dataset of ringing records of 3 091 nests of the Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio, representing five time series (6 to 42 years) from different sites within the Czech Republic, to analyse long-term variability in nest survival. We modelled trends in daily nest survival rates (DSR) over the years, either assuming a constant DSR, or accounting for unequal nest search efforts during the breeding season by assuming that DSR varies as a function of nest age and seasonal date. We found that even sparse nesting data may produce realistic estimates of nest survival. DSR varied greatly among sites, from 0.975 to 0.984, corresponding to a nest success from 48% to 62%. Both modelling approaches yielded almost identical estimates of DSR trends over the years. In this study, nest survival has either declined at all three agricultural sites or remained stable at one suburban site since the late 1980s. We conclude that sparse datasets with unequal searching effort during the nesting cycle and/or nesting season can be used to estimate long-term trends in nest survival, but this approach is warranted only if the analyses, based on different assumptions, yield consistent estimates.",

In order to study the causes of this variation, we assessed the variability of nest types (architecture and size) and vegetation structure, and examined their consequences for breeding parameters in a population of Bay-capped Wren-Spinetail breeding in Spartina densiflora saltmarshes located at a coastal lagoon on Atlantic coast in east Argentina.

All nests were built with stems and grass leaves of S. densiflora. We found that open nests were built in sites with denser vegetation than enclosed nests. Nesting success and nest survival were not affected by nest architecture and size. The ability to adjust nest structure according to the vegetation density may be a strategy aimed at increasing nest concealment to reduce the temperature inside the nest or to avoid nest depredation. A flexible nest architecture strategy in Bay-capped Wren-spinetail is a possible adaptation to living in simple, yet structurally variable environments such as saltmarshes.",

We tested the hypothesis that potential intraspecific abundance is a more powerful predictor of detection of a novel food source than interspecific abundance and predation risk. The hypothesis was tested using latency of Great Tits Parus major to find bird-feeders in relation to the abundance of Great Tit and other birds, as well as cats recorded close to novel feeders in urban and rural habitats. Data were collected during winter 2013/2014 in eight cities and nearby rural areas across Poland. Generalized linear models, multimodel inference and hierarchical partitioning showed that the probability that Great Tits used a novel birdfeeder was positively correlated both with the number of Great Tits and all other tits combined in the vicinity of feeders. Latency in feeder usage was negatively related to the number of conspecifics, and it was less strongly negatively related to the number of other tits and the abundance of all other species. The effect of the number of other tits interacted with the environment; the number of tits positively correlated with latency in rural areas, while this relationship was negative in urban areas. Latency until arrival at a feeder was shorter for males than for females. The effect of cats at feeders on bird behaviour was statistically non-significant. Thus, latency until arrival at novel birdfeeders was predicted by local population size and abundance of other bird species, but not mammalian predators, and this relationship may be altered by the environment.",

However, in arctic to temperate regions species richness in birds shows also a seasonal pattern with high species numbers in summer and low numbers in winter. Is it possible to explain this pattern by high energy availability in summer and low availability in winter? The 'energy availability hypothesis' rests on a positive correlation between abundance and species richness. Using weekly counts along a transect in Northern Bavaria (S Germany), we found the expected seasonal annual as well as biannual cycles in species richness (108 species observed in total). In contrast, the number of individuals showed no clear seasonal cycle, but erratic fluctuations particularly in winter. Weather conditions had only small effects on the number of individuals and on species richness. Adding weather variables to analyses increased explained variance only by 1.5% to 10%. The energy availability hypothesis is not able to explain the seasonal variation of species richness in temperate regions. However, bird assemblages during winter consist of species able to feed on various resource types, in particular seeds produced during summer. These left-overs provide the resources for diet generalists to survive the winter.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of bird nest orientation in dense forest interiors are relatively unknown. Using data collected in primeval temperate forests at the Białowieża National Park in Poland, we found that two arboreal nesting species, the Song Thrush Turdus philomelos and the Hawfinch Coccothraustes coccothraustes, located significantly more of their nests in the southern half of tree crowns than in the northern half. Nest orientation also depended on nest height: the higher Song Thrush and Hawfinch nests were in the crowns of trees, the stronger preference both species had for locating their nests toward the south. For the Song Thrush, tree species interacted with the date of clutch initiation to influence patterns of nest orientation: Song Thrushes located more of their nests on the 'south-facing' sides of live Norway Spruces Picea abies as the nesting season progressed. Spring temperature during the nest construction period affected Hawfinch nest orientation, with significantly more 'south-facing' nests during colder springs. The directional orientation patterns we observed may be viewed as a response of nesting birds to weather conditions during nest site selection and nest construction periods, when exposure to solar radiation could help regulate nest temperatures during cold mornings or days.",

    "abstract": "Recent climate change is frequently invoked as the cause of changes in phenology and distances of migration. Birds are expected to reduce the length of migration in response to milder climatic conditions, and during the last years, there are a growing number of records of European long-distance migrants wintering in the Iberian Peninsula. For this reason, we have used in this study the available ringing and recoveries data for the Eurasian Reed Warbler in the Iberian Peninsula during winter, spanning 1959–2015. We show that during the last decades this insectivorous species occurs regularly during winter in South-western Europe, which could be related to the recent climate change. Some Iberian birds wintered in breeding areas, or nearby, which could indicate a potential process of sedentarization, while Eurasian Reed Warblers from Central and Northern Europe shortened the migration distance avoiding the crossing to Africa. Iberian wintering grounds seemed to be related to the origin of the birds, with British Eurasian Reed Warblers staying more northerly that individuals from Central Europe, and Eastern birds showing a tendency to winter on the Mediterranean coast. Our results support the contemporary trend of migrants overwintering at higher latitudes. Despite the considerable increase of wintering records during the last decades, we cannot confirm a real expansion because there has been an increase in ringing activity over the study period. Nevertheless, the presence of this species has become consistent during winter in well-sampled areas where it was absent in the past. With warmer winters we expect changes in the migratory system, and also an increase in frequency of long-distance migrants that avoid the crossing of the Mediterranean and the Sahara desert to remain in southern Europe during cold months.",

    "abstract": "Nest predation is a major cause leading to reproductive failure of many avian species. Identifying nest predators is crucial for understanding the ecological context of nest predation and habitat management. The mountains of Southwest China harbors numerous species in the Phasianidae family, many of them endemic or threatened, however, little is known on the nest predation pressure on these ground breeders. We placed 32 artificial nests (each containing two chicken eggs) in broadleaf montane forests with different vegetation structure, and monitored predators with infrared-triggered cameras. The artificial nests were resembling nests of Golden Pheasant Chrysolophus pictus, a representative of the threatened species inhabiting montane broadleaf forest. We analyzed how environmental factors impact survival of artificial nests using Cox proportional hazards regression. With a failure rate of 62.5%, we recorded 40 predations where eggs were preyed or moved away, 19 predation attempts where animals spotted and contacted with, but failed to prey on or move away the eggs, and 109 pass-by events. Corvids, especially Large-billed Crow Corvus macrorhynchos was the primary culprit, committing all but one predations on artificial nests. Other potential predators included Père David's Rock Squirrel Sciurotamias davidianus, Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius, Red-billed Blue Magpie Urocissa erythrorhyncha, Chinese Porcupine Hystrix hodgsoni and muridaes. We found that understory cover and vertical openness were the determining factors on survival of artificial nests. Presence of understory cover and low vertical openness significantly increased survival time of artificial nests. We didn't detect significant effects from horizontal openness and distance to nearest patrol trail. Further studies with real nests are however required to examine these conclusions, and to explore reproduction strategies of ground nesting pheasants coping with threats from avian predators.",

    "abstract": "Bird communities wintering in the mosaic-like farming landscapes of SW Poland were studied to assess drivers of intra-seasonal changes in numbers and habitat associations of birds. During two severe winters (November–March) the complete area search method was applied to count birds and link their occurrence with weather and habitat in six plots (320 ha in total). A modelling approach was used to test birds' responses to environmental factors at community and species levels. These farmlands were inhabited by diverse and dense populations of wintering birds, including a significant proportion of species of conservation concern. Bird numbers revealed decreasing trends, with winter- and species-specific fluctuations, affected in particular by snow cover. The lowest population indices were recorded in mid-winter (February) and remained low until mid-March. Field margins (6.6% of the total area) supported 35.6% of individuals and 55.0% of flocks. The preference for field margins over other farmland habitats was particularly prominent during severe weather conditions. Our results suggest that during severe winters, complex farmlands are important areas for birds, enhancing their known importance to breeding birds. Intense snowfall in mid-winter rather than temperature drops lead to immediate population declines, aggravating the effects of natural food depletion. Adverse weather keeps populations at low levels until mid-March, despite the influx of spring migrants. Behavioural adjustments to winter conditions elicit the characteristic habitat distribution of birds, exposing the crucial importance of non-cropped landscape elements. In particular, the variety of field margins significantly contributes to the persistence of internationally important populations of farmland birds in Poland.",

Of the 59 threatened parrot species in the Neotropics, information on diet is available for only 34. Unsustainable forest management can eliminate trees with seeds and fruits that are key food resources for parrots. Tucuman Amazon Amazona tucumana is an endemic and threatened parrot species categorized as Vulnerable that occurs only in Andean montane forests of northwestern Argentina and southern Bolivia; i.e., the Southern Yungas. The diet of Tucuman Amazon, food availability, specialization, key food resources, and seasonal and spatial variation of food resources were determined. Feeding bouts of Tucuman Amazon were recorded from December 2007 to February 2009 in El Rey National Park. Availability of trees with seeds, fruits or flowers that could be used by Tucuman Amazon as food resources was assessed in phenology plots in cloud forest (high elevation humid forest) and transition forest (semideciduous forest located in the piedmont). Both forest types showed marked seasonality in availability of food resources for Tucuman Amazon. Sixty-six percent of this species feeding bouts were on seeds. Podocarpus parlatorei is the most widely used tree species by Tucuman Amazon in the cloud forest during the reproductive period and Acacia visco in the transition forest in the non-reproductive period. Podocarpus parlatorei could be critical for the development of Tucuman Amazon chicks, due to the high fat and oil content of its seeds and fruits. Tucuman Amazon used fewer food tree species during the non-reproductive than the reproductive period, showing a greater specialization of food resources (i.e., narrower niche breadth). To ensure the production of fruits of P. parlatorei and A. visco, sustainable forest management in the Southern Yungas should retain an adequate level of these key resources for Tucuman Amazon.",

Although thermal properties of nests are widely studied, no reports to date have dealt with the relative effects of the various structural parts of the nest wall. This experimental study investigated the effects of air movement, and for the first time, the effects of wall structure, on nest insulation for the Common Blackbird Turdus merula and Song Thrush Turdus philomelos of the Turdidae. Insulatory values, i.e. difference in cooling rate measured simultaneously inside and outside a nest, and internal cooling rates within the nest cup, were determined using temperature loggers under still-air and moving-air conditions. Moving-air increased insulatory values and internal cooling rates in both species. Insulatory values were positively correlated with the nest base thickness, but not nest side wall thickness. Removal of the outer nest wall and cup lining to reveal the internal mud cup of thrush nests reduced the insulatory value compared to the whole nest, the effect of which was exacerbated under moving-air conditions. These results may reflect that the nest wall confers huge insulatory advantages and especially so during periods of air movement. However, it is unclear whether this is related to the presence of particular nest materials that confer insulation, or to the amount of air trapped in the nest wall. Alternatively, the thermal conductivity of the materials lining the cup wall may be important.",

    "abstract": "Existing parentage analyses of large raptors have mostly used naturally shed feathers as a source of DNA. There is evidence that eagle nests are sometimes visited by conspecifics. Are these visitors involved in extra pair-paternity? More than 400 feather samples of nestlings and full-grown White-tailed Eagles were obtained in May at 13 nest sites in the Czech Republic, mainly during the years 2010–2016. The samples were genotyped at six microsatellite loci to determine the identity and number of individuals occurring at each nest site and to test genetic monogamy. In the end, 110 unique genotypes of possible parents were identified from moulted feathers found below nests and were used in a parentage analysis together with 86 offspring genotypes. Interestingly, more than two adult genotypes were sampled from shed feathers in one-third of 64 checks of 11 nests, but nest success was not affected by the number of genotypes. No case of extra-pair paternity was recorded. The results showed that feathers of individuals other than the parent pair can be found below nests of White-tailed Eagles during a single breeding season, and the identity of parents at individual nests can change even during seven years of study, which is inconsistent with the expected longevity, lifelong monogamy and presumed territoriality of White-tailed Eagles. We cannot recommend DNA sampling of nesting pairs on the basis of feathers found below eyries, because the most likely parent was recorded in the appropriate year only in 58% of cases with this method.",

Drumming was heard in two of the six territories identified and sound recordings were made over four breeding seasons. Analysis of the recorded files consisted of counting and measuring intervals between strikes in all instrumental signals consisting of or containing drumrolls. The results showed that a form of drumming was performed but that it was infrequently produced in a discrete roll. It was usually soft and lacked the regularity of pattern found in the territorial drumrolls of other European woodpeckers. There was also a marked lack of consistency in the amplitude of strikes. As an acoustic signal, this study suggests its principal function to be a communication between partners in relation to the location and construction of a nest site.",

    "abstract": "Breeding ranges of European bird species will probably shift as a result of the climate change in forthcoming decades. Although it is unclear whether these shifts will come true, one perceives the magnitude of these shifts as a measure of the intensity of the pressure of climate change on particular species. From this perspective, it is interesting to ask how these shifts relate to current species' population trends. For this purpose, we related the data on potential northward shifts of European breeding ranges based on projections of climate change to the long-term population trends for the period 1982–2011 of birds breeding in the Czech Republic. We predicted that the relationship between the magnitude of range shift and the population trend will vary according to the geographic position of species' distribution in relation to the position of the Czech Republic. The results indicated support for this prediction. After accounting for the effects of various ecological traits like habitat association, migration and life history strategy, populations of the species with the largest shift declined, if the centre of their distribution was in the northern Europe, but increased if their distribution centre was on the south of the continent. These results suggest that the climate change is among the main factors causing recent changes in bird populations but its effects strongly depend not only on species sensitivity to these changes but also on geographic context.",

This trans-Saharan migratory bird significantly transits along the French Atlantic coastline during post-breeding migration and the right bank of the Gironde estuary has been identified as an important stopover site. We studied the spatial occupancy strategies of stationing individuals during August of three successive years (2010–2012). We characterized habitat use by radio-tracking individuals revealing relatively small foraging ranges (6.6 ± 2.6 ha on average) with only 1 ha actually exploited (core area), and a relatively high habitat fragmentation rate. Capture-mark-recapture analyses assessed the average stopover duration of individuals and body-mass variations during their stopover. The estimated average stopover duration was 6.46 ± 0.46 days (95% confidence interval: 4.4–9.6). Lean birds tended to forage significantly more than stout birds: on average, they gain 2.81 ± 0.89% of their initial mass each day whereas stout birds only gain 0.12 ± 0.56%. Analyses of droppings characterized the local diet. We noticed that Aquatic Warbler preferentially used partially-flooded or flooded habitats with heterogeneous and rather low vegetation, such as bulrush beds or bulrush beds mixed with reed beds. Orthoptera, Araneae and Hymenoptera represented the largest contributions to the consumed biomass (64.7%, 13.4% and 8.9% respectively). The importance of the fuel deposition rate of lean birds reflects the importance of the estuary as a stopover site for the species. It means that the available resources allow birds to replenish and continue their migration route. However, the sustainability of the site's functionality is questioned because of the evolution of habitats (erosion, rise in water levels and changes in food web).",

We found high within-clutch repeatability of all the egg traits studied. As theoretically expected in peripheral parts of the species geographic range, there was considerable variation in egg-size traits among the study populations, with eggs being distinctly smaller and more elongated at a site characterised by most human-modified habitat composed of maquis scrubland with rare Pistacia trees. Egg length and shape tended to be affected by the altitude of nest site and by clutch size, but not laying date. We found some effects of egg traits on hatching and fledging success, suggesting that fitness advantage of egg sizes is dependent of egg shape. We conclude that the above patterns of variation in egg size and shape of the African Blue Tit populations have influence of fitness. Our finding of considerable variation in egg traits between separate peripheral populations confirms the theoretical expectation and seems to be a novel result.",

Nests are expected to be larger or thicker in colder environments, although the relationships between nest design and weather differ between species. Here we present the results of an analysis of the external height of the nest wall in Paridae that accepted small standardized nesting boxes for breeding. The study populations were monitored in a relatively cold Mediterranean study area. We found that Coal Tits Periparus ater built higher external nest walls than Great Tits Parus major or Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus, after controlling for the first-egg date and clutch size which are assumed to reflect aspects of the quality of the nest builders. Our measures of nest size were not closely associated with the average ambient temperature, but nest walls tended to be shallower when there was more rain. Nest-shape asymmetry, as reflected in the difference in the external height of the nest measured closest to and farthest from the nest-chamber entrance, was observed in all three species, but the average asymmetry was highest in Coal Tits. In asymmetric nests, more nest material was added to the side that was closest to the front wall considered to be the coldest and least protected against harsh weather. Thus, nest size characteristics differ between three ecologically similar species inhabiting the same cavity type in the same coniferous woodland habitat, which would imply that different species do not respond in the same way to the same set of environmental factors.",

A total of 1399 nests were found, distributed in 120 colonies, mostly consisting of 1–5 nests. In the built-up area, the density reached 31.85 nests per km2. House Martins selected areas with a larger proportion of old buildings and open spaces, and closer to the nearest sources of food or mud. Only the distance from colonies to the nearest mud source and the proportion of open spaces were included in the regression model. As far as nest-sites are concerned, 33% of all nests were built under eaves, 34% under the ledges of balconies with architectonic ornamentation, and 15% within balconies. Birds selected nest sites offering better adhesion of nests to the substrate; to compensate for poorer adhesion, the number of nest walls touching other nests was increased. There was a positive relation between nest site height and building height. Nests were not uniformly distributed around the circle, but no clear patterns emerged from the data.",

    "abstract": "The diet of the Barn Owl was investigated in 13 localities in the Pisa province, Central Italy. In each locality the percentage of forest and cultivated land, and the linear development of roads and rivers were recorded. To estimate the prey availability, the small mammal communities in seven different localities within the same province were sampled during live trapping sessions. Barn Owls preyed mainly upon rodents (79.4% ) and insectivores (18.8%), while birds were eaten to a small degree (1.9%). The main prey taxon was Apodemus sp. (39.7%), followed by Microtus savii (26.1%). The relative frequencies of these two prey items were negatively correlated. Statistically significant differences in the mean prey weight in the thirteen localities were detected. The mean prey weight was positively associated with the wood surface and negatively with the area of cultivated fields. A positive relationship between prey diversity and cultivation was recorded. This indicates that Barn Owls which forage in cultivated habitats tend to prey on smaller species, mainly shrews and voles, and to have a more diversified prey spectrum. On the contrary, owls foraging in wooded areas were more specialized and preyed on larger animals.",

Ordinations identify the main gradients within the species composition pattern: from arable land to natural habitats and from woodland across open, dry areas to wet meadowlands with rivers and ponds. Regression models describing the relationship between species richness and habitat show that the best positive predictors of species richness are woodland, scrub, natural meadows, unfarmed patches such as piles of stones or brushwood, and ponds. Regression models of the habitat affinities of the 30 most frequently recorded bird species are used to describe the present-day situation and to predict the effects of possible changes in Latvian farmland. The current high bird diversity is largely upheld by a non-intensive agriculture and large set-aside areas. Both further abandonment and development towards western standards of agricultural production may have adverse effects on populations of several species of conservation concern. Environmental considerations should therefore become an integral part of the development of Latvian agriculture.",

An average disturbance affected 25 geese, occurred at 43 m distance to the cause and lasted 31–60 s. Geese feeding prior to the disturbance reacted more strongly than resting ones, and they were more sensitive to disturbances during the hatching and moulting/flightless period. More than fifty percent of the disturbances were caused by dogs — they affected significantly more geese, caused longer durations of disturbances, and probably higher energy costs. There were highly significant positive correlations between a reaction, the duration of a disturbance and the number of geese affected. However, distance to the waterline correlated only with the number of geese affected. Distance to waterline and distance to the source of the disturbance had a high impact on the number of geese affected in a regression model. When disturbances occurred at greater distances, these were more serious, lasted longer and affected more geese. Separate analysis of the dogs demonstrated the influence of dog size (the larger the dog, the greater the disturbance), but not whether it was on a lead. Fleeing into the water was caused by dogs more often than expected. Habituation to an urban environment and predictions for fleeing behaviour are discussed.",

Similarly, the deviation of the volume and breadth of a particular egg from the mean egg volume and breadth in the clutch was positively correlated with the deviation of nestling mass from the mean nestling mass in the nest. Nestling growth and development in terms of asymptotic mass (g), maximum growth rate (g/day), tarsus length, and longest remex length were also positively correlated with egg size. The effect of egg size was particularly pronounced in the period of termination of intensive growth rate, development of thermoregulation, and feather development.

A total of 50 nestlings were colour-ringed in two breeding seasons in the valley of the Pitarque River (Teruel, E Spain), and were monitored weekly until May of the following year. 59 nestlings were also colour-ringed in two nearby localities (4–5 km) to detect possible dispersal to and from our study area. Mark-recapture analyses were used to estimate weekly survival, which was assumed to be constant for periods of four weeks in order to reduce the number of parameters. Models with the effect of time, age class, season and year were fitted, and the best models were selected using quasi-likelihood Akaike's Information Criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (QAICC???). The best three models included seasonal variation in survival, and the second and third models also selected the effect of age class. The seasonal variation in the survival of young Magpies exhibited two critical moments: firstly, on becoming independent of the parent birds (August—September), and secondly, when individuals abandoned the communal roost and started to establish their own territories (February—March). The weight of 14-day-old nestlings positively affected survival until 4 and 6 months after leaving the nest. No evidence for dispersal was found; this supports the view that survival does indeed decrease in the cited periods, possibly because of the increased risk of predation.",

Nestlings, juveniles, and adults captured in mist nets were ringed with different combinations of colour rings to identify their age during visual observations in the autumn sexual display period. Before the autumn display, breeding nests were dyed in order to identify nest material added during the autumn display period. In winter, nest boxes were inspected to catch the birds roosting in them at night. The study was conducted in optimal and marginal habitat types. In the optimal habitat during the autumn sexual display, adult birds were much more abundant than in the marginal habitat. During the breeding season, 41% of the nest boxes were occupied in the optimal habitat, compared with 8% in the marginal habitat. The respective figures during the autumn display were 95% and 45%. Autumn nests were built in 83% and 12% of the nest boxes, respectively, and in winter, 35% and 7% of nest boxes, respectively, were used by birds for night-time roosting at night. The autumn display continued from early September to the end of October. For roosting at night in winter (November-March), Tree Sparrows selected nests according to their insulating quality. Most often they roosted in nest boxes containing nests from the breeding season with autumn nests built over them, then, in descending order of frequency, in nest boxes with autumn nests built in empty boxes, in boxes with breeding nests, and in completely empty boxes. Among birds roosting at night and captured on the first survey in winter, 86% were represented by pairs that had built those nests during the autumn display. Young birds that did not build autumn nests typically roosted at night in tree crowns. This implies that the construction of autumn nests is primarily a consequence of the autumn sexual display, and secondarily may be an adaptation for winter survival. The winter survival rate was significantly higher in juvenile Tree Sparrows that were found in nest boxes on winter nights than in those that were not.",

    "abstract": "The Woodpigeon Columba palumbus is a species generally increasing in numbers in most of its populations, including the urban population, which, two centuries after its emergence, is still expanding across the European Lowland. New for the species is a tendency to form dense breeding aggregations in suitable urban parks, with a corresponding slower increase in some other towns. This trend was driven by the presence of important nest predators, mostly Hooded Crows Corvus corone. Another factor involved was access to open farmland within the economic range of feeding flights. Nesting success (1st brood) in urban habitats free of important predators was up to 50–77% but it fell to only 3–7% when predators appeared. Consequently, some urban populations of the Woodpigeon went into a phase of decline. In the farmland and secondary woods, the nesting success was also variable, ranging between 12 and 42% for unknown reasons. Safe urban populations produced 4–5 times more offspring per pair per season, yet their expansion was rather slow. Therefore, the urban overproduction may contribute to an increase in the total species abundance, owing to (deduced) overspill of recruits to the poorly reproducing subpopulation in the countryside. Alongside other factors such as amelioration of winter conditions and changes in agriculture, this would contribute to the documented growth of the whole population of the species. The shortage of firm data on the pristine breeding success (from extensive natural forests) remains the main obstacle to better understand the population dynamics of this migratory species.",

    "abstract": "The Turquoise-fronted Amazon Amazona aestiva is one of the most extensively poached species as a result of illegal trade in Brazil. Reintroduction programs have been increasingly used in the management of these animals in captivity. Several preparatory procedures should be carried out during the pre-release period to characterize the group of animals and subsequently increase the success of reintroduction programs. The most important procedures are temperament assessment and environmental enrichment training, which is expected to influence the behavior of the released birds. This study aimed to assess the temperament of the amazons in captivity and its influence on a reintroduction program. The temperaments of 50 parrots were classified from shy to bold and monitored during five phases of activity throughout the study: environmental enrichment training in captivity, a period of acclimatization in an aviary placed in the release area, the offer of fruit from the release region, dependence on the aviary after it was opened, and post-release food supplementation. Once the animals were released, they were monitored for 18 months. Temperament assessment supported the reintroduction project, because through this information it was possible to predict the individual behaviors of reintroduced animals when dealing with environmental challenges. The purpose of the pre-release environmental enrichment training was to encourage individual amazons to increase exploratory behaviors, and was effective in enhancing the natural behavior of the species and reducing stereotypies. Animals classified as shy required a longer intervention period to achieve the same results since they exhibited greater dependence on the aviary and, consequently, took longer to explore the release area. In the medium term, no significant difference was observed between shy and bold parrots in their departure after opening the aviary, use of supplementary feeding, or survival. Therefore, the activities performed prior to release adequately promoted similar habituation conditions for both profiles.",

To examine how hybrid zone is affected by the abundance dynamics of these species and their reproductive performance, we studied a mixed colony at Włocławek Reservoir, central Poland, for over 7 years, from 2002 to 2009, and included data from the species monitoring from 1990 to 2001. To evaluate the species abundance dynamics and possible mechanisms of reproductive isolation, breeders (n = 226 individual birds) were trapped on nests and colour-ringed; breeding performance was studied in detail for 202 breeding pairs with both mates known. Between 2002 and 2009 the proportion of Caspian Gulls among breeders had strongly increased (from 14% to 42%), whereas the proportion of Herring Gulls had declined (from 70% to 35%). The frequency of hybrids varied a little with no clear trend (mean 20%, range 15–28%). The colony size during that time was approximately stable, with 125–135 breeding pairs. 32 individuals originating from outside the zone, ringed as nestlings in the core range of either species, were recorded as breeders at the study site, documenting dispersal of parental species into the zone. The immigration of the two parental species showed contrasting temporal patterns in the two compared decades, 1990–1999 vs. 2000–2009. The immigration of Herring Gulls as measured by the reencounter probability declined nearly three times, while approximately twofold increase was seen in Caspian Gulls. Birds tended to choose phenotypically similar mates, so that there were fewer heterospecific pairs than expected under random mating. Numbers of homospecific, heterospecific and mixed pairs were similar during 7 years. On average, males of Caspian Gulls were significantly heavier than males of Herring Gulls. Caspian Gull pairs bred on average 7 days earlier than pairs of Herring Gulls. No differences in clutch size, clutch volume or hatching success among pairs of different composition were found, indicating weak postzygotic isolation. Current abundance of species in the hybrid zone is changing dynamically and is primarily driven by the strength of immigration from outside the zone.",

    "abstract": "Chewing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) are the most widespread obligate ectoparasites living in the plumage of birds. Lice have to cope with unusual mechanical effects during ringing, and they could fall off their hosts. We assumed that trapping birds in nets, taking measurements and estimating condition could reduce their louse burdens. Lousiness affects life expectancy and reproductive success, so if ringing causes remarkable louse loss, the fitness of ringed birds could be altered. Lice are usually collected at ringing sites, and ringing precedes parasite sampling. This may therefore lead to an underestimation of louse prevalence and intensity. Here we tested whether ringing reduces the louse burden. We allocated Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica in the breeding season to two experimental groups — the birds were subject to either a standard ringing procedure (recording biometry, fat and other condition scores, feather hole counts), or a reduced one (only feather hole counts). We used feather holes (traces of louse chewing) as a measure of louse loads. Holes were recounted after a month. Significantly more new holes appeared in the reduced ringing procedure group, indicating tat the usual ringing procedures effectively reduce louse loads. We believe this is the first evidence that bird ringing affects ectoparasite infestations.",

For reference, we placed the same sets of bags in the litter, at 23 random sites in the forest. The bags were removed in March 2010. After seven months of exposure almost all cellulose (median 92%) and most of hair (median 57%) disappeared from bags in the holes. These values were as high as (for cellulose) or even higher than (for hair) as in the litter samples. Additionally, some bags disappeared from almost every second hole, which suggests their removal by larger animals. The high decomposition rates alone would suffice to clear holes between consecutive seasons but, in the study area, this process was apparently enhanced by mechanical cleaning.",

We analyzed trends in phenological shifts during each period and tested the influence of local and large-scale meteorological variables both in Pyrenees and on cranes' breeding areas on autumn migration dates. We found a similar and strong advance of phenology (20 days in 30 years) in Common Cranes passing the Western Pyrenees and this despite local variations in meteorological conditions. The increase in spring temperatures at northern latitudes, which could affect both spring migration and timing of breeding, as well as the variations in local winds in the Western Pyrenees were correlated with the phenological shift.

    "abstract": "Although the main environmental determinants of bird distribution are contingent on the spatial scale of studies, the consistency of species distributional patterns has rarely been considered in large- and local-scale analyses. The competing roles of biotic, abiotic and landscape features in shaping the distribution of Azure-winged Magpies were assessed at two spatial scales: a large-scale analysis of 50×50 km blocks across nearly the whole of the species range (the Iberian Peninsula), and a small-scale assessment based on point counts of 50-m radius located near the northern edge of its distribution. The observed species distribution can be explained mainly by geographic and climatic features whereas the influence of landscape factors is weak. Azure-winged Magpies are more abundant near the core of its range in southwest Iberia and rarify towards the north and the east, in what seems to be a limitation of their ability to tolerate colder and drier climates, respectively. At local level, Azure-winged Magpies are habitat generalists avoiding urban sprawl whose probability of occurrence decreases with elevation, reaching zero above 1,600 m a.s.l. The species prefer wooded environments, although it tends to avoid mature, dense forests. The occurrence of potential competitors (Common Magpie Pica pica and Jay Garrulus glandarius), whose habitat preferences widely overlap with those of the Azure-winged Magpie, had no influence on either the large-scale or local distribution of Azure-winged Magpies. From a conservationist standpoint, the presence of the species in agricultural, pseudosteppe habitats with thinly forested watercourses highlights the importance of conserving gallery forests in the regions less suitable for the species.",

    "abstract": "According to the majority of studies, brood parasitism may have significant negative effects on the reproductive success of an incubating female. The ability to discriminate a parasitic egg in a nest could decrease breeding costs. We tested this ability in two species of diving ducks — Common Pochard and Tufted Duck — by adding experimental parasitic eggs of Mallard Anas platyrhynchos. Individual reactions were compared with control nests, where no parasitic egg(s) were added. We looked for three different reactions to the parasitic egg(s): (1) abandonment of the clutch, (2) ejection of the eggs from the nest and (3) acceptance of the eggs. In total, experiments with 15 Common Pochard and 24 Tufted Duck nests were carried out. The parasitic egg(s) (as well the brooding bird's own) were ejected from a nest only sporadically, the most common reaction being to accept the eggs. Abandonment of the clutch proved to be the only negative reaction to parasitic egg(s), a reaction that occurred significantly more often in Tufted Duck clutches. The ability to identify parasitic eggs does not always need to be a profitable antiparasitic strategy. This strategy could lead to the abandonment of the clutch and could diminish the nest success of the host female.",

    "abstract": "Conspecific brood parasitism is an alternative reproductive tactic in which parasitic females lay eggs into the nests of other females of the same species who carry out the subsequent parental care. Conspecific brood parasitism is reported to be common among birds, however detailed information about rates of parasitism based on molecular identification of alien eggs at the population level is still scarce. Here, we used protein fingerprinting of egg albumen to identify eggs laid by parasites in a breeding population of Common Pochard Aythya ferina. Among 42 nests sampled during 3 field seasons, 162 eggs out of 432 (37.5%) were classified as parasitic. Conspecific brood parasitism occurred in total in 39 nests (93%). Average clutch size was about 10 eggs. However, after exclusion of parasitic eggs, the clutch size decreased to about 6 eggs. The number of parasitic females ranged from 1 to 7 and the mean number of parasitic females per clutch was 2.53 ± 0.28. We found a significant negative correlation between the number of parasitic eggs within a clutch and the timing of breeding — parasites laid most of the eggs before the estimated peak of initiated nests. In addition, number of parasitic eggs was negatively related to number of host eggs in the clutch. This observation implies that cost of excessive parasitism might cause clutch size adjustment in the host but other possible explanations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The 'fixed schedule hypothesis' proposes that parental investment is independent of offspring needs in order to maximize adult survival or to prevent reduced future fecundity. We tested this hypothesis on Tawny Owls Strix aluco by experimental manipulation of brood size. We measured the call frequency of begging chicks, feeding frequency of males, overnight weight gain of nestlings and parental body condition in reduced or enlarged broods, and in control broods. In reduced or enlarged broods nestling begging calls reflected the respective decrease or increase in demand, but the frequency with which the males fed did not differ between the reduced and enlarged broods. Consequently, chicks gained body weight more rapidly in reduced broods, whereas those in enlarged broods grew more slowly. Male body weight did not change during the early nestling period when they delivered food to reduced or enlarged broods, but the condition of females worsened in the enlarged broods. As the males did not increase the feeding frequency in the enlarged broods, the females were under pressure to pass on more of the prey to nestlings begging in these broods. Male Tawny Owls regulated their feeding effort according to a fixed schedule, independently of the chicks' needs, to maintain their body condition. Nevertheless, the females whose condition deteriorated during the feeding of enlarged broods did not stop brooding earlier, nor did they suffer mortality in the breeding period.",

In this study we test two hypotheses concerning the phenomenon of partial mortality in nestling altricial passerines: (1) non-adaptive starvation hypothesis based on the assumption that partial brood losses are caused by starvation and undernourishment and has no adaptive value, and (2) adaptive starvation hypothesis assuming that losses from starvation might be elements of an adaptive strategy of reducing surplus nestlings in broods that are over-large. To test the above hypotheses we divided broods of two tit species Great Tit Parus major and Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus into two categories: broods with incomplete, less than 100% fledging success and broods with complete 100% fledging success. Subsequently, we compared physiological performance of nestlings between brood categories using blood hemoglobin concentration. We predicted, that if non-adaptive starvation hypothesis was correct, in broods with complete fledging success nestlings should be in better condition. Alternatively, if the adaptive starvation hypothesis was correct, no such difference in nestling condition should occur. In accordance with our prediction, we found that for both species, broods of nestlings that attained 100% fledging success had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration than broods in which fledging success was less than 100%. This result strongly supports non-adaptive starvation hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays the use of remote photography systems is very popular for diet assessment. Despite the popularity, there is a greater need for evaluation of these systems against traditional methods of diet assessment, such as direct visual observation. The diet of Lesser Kestrel nestlings and adult provisioning rate were assessed using cameras and direct observations at four nests with various brood sizes during the breeding season in 2013. The study was conducted in an intensively cultivated area that belongs to a Special Protected Area of the Natura 2000 network in central Greece. Diet composition (prey type and size) was not affected by the recording method, the sex of adults, the brood size, the period of the day or the age of nestlings. Tettigoniidae was the most frequent prey delivered by adults. Our results from both methods showed that males delivered more prey items than females, supporting the general consensus of reversed sexual dimorphism for the Lesser Kestrel. The provisioning rate was not significantly related to brood size, but it was affected by the method of observation, parent sex and the interaction of method and nestling age. According to the direct observations, provisioning rates increased as nestlings grew up, while they decreased based on camera information. Higher provisioning rates recorded in direct observations at later nestling stages, can be explained by higher food requirements of nestlings. The decrease in provisioning rate with nestling age was mostly affected by the camera function, as a result of digital limitations, nest type and Lesser Kestrels behavior.",

Feather δ13C values showed that Marsh Warblers occupy a biome dominated by C4 vegetation during the stopover in northeastern Africa, whereas C3 habitats are used during the complete moult in southern Africa. East European Marsh Warblers differed in their stable isotope profiles from other European regions, suggesting a certain level of population segregation in southern Africa. A dual-isotope assignment approach confirmed this difference and helped us restrict the autumn staging areas to lower elevations of the Ethiopian Highlands west of the Rift valley. Available ring recoveries, however, suggested high levels of population mixing both on migration through East Africa and in the final wintering grounds.",

    "abstract": "Woodpeckers feed primarily on insects, larvae and other arthropods; however, several members of this family include plant products in their diets, such as sap. Among them, the genera Sphyrapicus and Melanerpes include the most species that specialize in sap consumption. In semiarid forests of Argentina, sap is an important food item in the diet of the White-fronted Woodpecker, Melanerpes cactorum. The aim of this study is to investigate why White-fronted Woodpeckers only consume sap from certain plants while avoiding other available plants of the same species and explore seasonality of their plant selection. We expected that combinations of plant traits (i.e. sugars concentration of sap, sap flow intensity, plant size, plant health and plant microhabitat), rather than one particular trait, determine which tree they select for sap feeding in different seasons. We examined five plant species: Sarcotoxicum salicifolium, Prosopis ruscifolia, Ziziphus mistol, Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco and Stetsonia coryne that were used most frequently for sap consumption and were consumed in all seasons by ten groups of White-fronted Woodpecker in semiarid Chaco, Argentina. Plants selected by White-fronted Woodpeckers for sap consumption were mainly larger plants that yield high sugar concentration. Of the plant species we studied, individual plant selection in all seasons was more evident in those plant species that constitute an important part of their diet (i.e. Prosopis ruscifolia and Stetsonia coryne). The selection of plants offering a greater reward in sap quality strongly suggests that the White-fronted Woodpecker maximizes food energy intake as a response to the seasonality that characterizes semiarid climates of temperate regions and conditions of food resources availability. Our results show that large trees are selected as sap trees by White-fronted Woodpecker, therefore, we recommend activities that promote retention of large trees in Chaco region.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring waterbirds is fundamental to understand the health status of wetland habitats. However, this monitoring has to be conducted by means of reliable data collection that can provide accurate information on population trends. Usually, waterbird monitoring is difficult, as nesting grounds are usually located in inaccessible reedbed, and by eye detection of cryptic species is hard. Drones have the capacity to overcome most of these problems, as they can provide with an aerial view of places otherwise unreachable, while reducing the disturbance and time spent in the field. The present study aims to compare the accuracy, disturbance levels, and managerial efficiency between ground (traditional) and drone counts of a cryptic species, the Purple Heron Ardea purpurea. Traditional monitoring methods were only capable of detecting 35% of the nesting pairs detected by the drone surveys (8.0 ± 11.8 versus 22.9 ± 38.2 nesting pairs in ground and drone surveys, respectively). Consequently, colony size estimates between methods showed poor agreement, to the point that traditional methods missed colonies otherwise detected by the drone. No apparent negative effects on nesting pairs where found when flying the drone. In addition, mean time spent to survey breeding sites with a drone was far less than with the traditional approach, down to a six-fold time reduction. This reduction, together with a lack of disturbance observed when conducting the drone monitoring, and an increasing monitoring precision and accuracy, supports the use of drones as the least invasive option for studies on population monitoring on hardly accessible sites.",

    "abstract": "In bird species with a lek mating system, male mating success is usually correlated with time spent at the lek, suggesting strong selection for lek attendance. We studied the lekking of Great Snipe Gallinago media males over 5 breeding seasons in Poland and found that, in apparent contradiction, 75% of males changed leks, often several times, within a single breeding season. GPS-tagged individuals tracked for an average of 31 days visited up to 9 different leks, often visiting 2–3 leks in quick succession within a few hours. Transitions between leks were entirely nocturnal, peaking before midnight. The majority of males that changed leks moved to sites within 50 km of the original lek, but 10% of males dispersed more than 100 km. Lek-switching males typically made several transitions between leks during the breeding season (median = 4), with most mobile birds changing display sites more than 20 times. Lek-switching probabilities showed seasonal variation, with no males changing leks early in the breeding season and frequent changes thereafter. The daily probability of lek change showed large inter-individual variation, allowing two groups of males to be distinguished, those who never or rarely changed leks (mean daily probability of lek change 0.02) and those who frequently changed leks (mean daily probability of lek change 0.23). This type of heterogeneity in male lekking behaviour is consistent with the hot-shot scenario of lek evolution. Here, lekking males with low mating chances should benefit from lek-switching — in contrast to top-ranking males — because changing display site may allow them to find leks with higher mating chances. Furthermore, regardless of its immediate success or failure, lek-switching can be seen as a form of prospecting behaviour that will pay off in future breeding seasons. Consistent with this, many of our lek-switching males moved in a way that suggests informed dispersal. The prevalence of intraseasonal lek switching in different Great Snipe populations across Europe should be assessed using the modern tracking devices, as this behaviour is likely to be much more widespread than reported in many previous studies.",

This suggests that the environmental conditions in the Białowieża Forest during the study period did not change or had no influence on egg size. Laying sequence had no influence on egg dimensions; only egg length depended on clutch size. Some characteristics of the females did affect the size of eggs: heavier birds and those with longer tarsi laid larger eggs. Older females did not lay significantly larger eggs than younger females.

    "abstract": "The purpose of the research was to find a time frame for the beginning, duration of maximum intensity, and end of nocturnal bird migration. The research was carried out using photo registration on a radar screen during the spring and autumn seasons of 1999–2001. Examination of the average length of daylight at the beginning of migration and the onset of civil twilight yielded a high correlation factor for both spring and autumn. The results showed that, on average, nocturnal migration began at the onset of civil twilight, that is, half an hour after sunset. The time elapsing between the onset of migration and the maximum concentration of migratory birds averaged about 70 minutes in both spring and autumn. Nocturnal migration usually came to an end within the one and a half to two hours after sunrise. We ascertained the seasonal time shift for the onset of nocturnal migration corresponding to the seasonal time shift related to the approach of darkness. The average times of the beginning, maximum intensity and end of nocturnal migration were found to be related to photoperiodic factors.",

Bird abundance was studied in the years 1999–2000 and 2005–2007 in three categories of sampling plots: 1) in small woods — with or without active fox dens, 2) along transects — starting from dens and running across arable land, and 3) around points — located at dens and far from them. Thus, variability in bird density was analyzed in relation to the presence/absence of Red Fox (in woods) and to the intensity of Red Fox penetration of crops (approximated by distance from a den). Two groups of bird species were distinguished with respect to their vulnerability to Red Fox predation pressure: 1) potential fox prey, i.e. species nesting on the ground and in low vegetation; and 2) birds not threatened by foxes, i.e. species nesting in tree holes and in tall vegetation. To investigate the relationships between bird distribution and Red Fox dens in woods, a step-wise multiple regression of bird density and species number on woodland structure was first performed. The residuals derived from the model were used to evaluate the impact of foxes by analyzing the differences between woods with and without active dens. Neither the species number nor the bird density differed significantly between woods with and without active dens. The differences in bird density observed between years in woods with or without active dens were not significant, either. No relationship between bird density in crop fields and distance from fox dens was found. The results are contrary to those of earlier studies and show that Red Fox does not affect farmland bird distribution, diversity and abundance, at least in the short term.",

Breeding parameters and the number of parental pairs' young recruited into the breeding population were determined for 52–112 marked pairs over three breeding seasons. Pairs had an average of 4.4 broods and produced 3.6 fledglings per breeding season. From 39 to 49% of pairs in various seasons did not have any young recruited. Every fourth pair (25–30%) had a single young bird recruited, from 12 to 20% of pairs — two young, from 4 to 11% — 3 young, and 6% of pairs had from four to six young recruited. The number of recruits depended on the breeding parameters of the parents: it was lowest among young pairs (low quality birds), those that began breeding late in the season, had a short breeding season, or low breeding success. In contrast, high quality birds with a long breeding season, the highest reproductive parameters and breeding success, had the most young recruited. Survival rate of young after leaving the nest was not found to be influenced by the starting date or the length of the breeding season of pairs. However, nesting conditions, such as pair density in colonies, may influence the fate of young birds after they leave the nest and are recruited.",

    "abstract": "The European avifauna on agricultural land has been permanently diminished over the past few decades. This phenomenon is clearly connected with agricultural intensification and the recent land cover changes. The main aims of this study were to identify the land cover preferences of a farmland bird species, the Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis in Hungary and investigate the link between the recent trend of the abundance of this species and the land-cover change. We employed GIS and statistical methods to assess the link between the abundance of this species based on the Hungarian common bird monitoring database (MMM) and the spatial proportion of the Corine Land Cover (CLC) categories in different buffer zones with 300, 600 and 1200 m from the observation points. Based on the significant statistical connections, we could identify and select land cover categories that serve as habitats and land cover categories that this bird species does not inhabit. The land cover preference of the Eurasian Skylark, in case of some land cover category, is depending on the grain scale (circle radius distance from the observation points). In analyses arable lands has been omitted because this land cover type is the well-known habitat of the species. According to our results, the Eurasian Skylark prefers permanent crops (vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations) inside 600m and 1200m buffer zones, and pastures inside 1200m buffer zones, while it does not prefer urban fabric areas and heterogeneous agricultural, forests, and wetlands or water bodies inside 300m and 600m, scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation associations (transitional woodland-shrub and natural grassland areas) inside the 600m and 1200m radius buffer areas. The identification of these regional (European level) land-cover categories allowed us to analyse the recent (1990–2012) and the predicted (2006–2050) characteristics of habitat changes of this bird species, associated with land cover change. Based on our results, we could estimate that the Skylark habitat will decrease by 188 560 ha between 2006–2050 in Hungary.",

    "abstract": "In birds, adaptations that mitigate predators' impact are usually ineffective in confrontation with introduced and rapidly expanding invasive non-native predators. As a consequence, bird populations often decline in the period following the time when predator population is established. Changes in bird numbers and nest spatial distributions in breeding populations of the Eurasian Coot Fulica atra and Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus were studied in Mazurian Lakeland, northeastern Poland in 2002–2003 and 2016, and were analyzed with reference to the abundance of invasive American Mink Neovison vison, whose density declined since mid 1990s. The study was based on a census of breeding pairs and a search of nests at 31 lakes. The numbers of breeding Coots and Grebes increased 2.6-fold and 1.2-fold, respectively. In both study periods Grebes displayed a strong tendency to nest in the vicinity of human settlements and in colonies; however, the percentage of Grebe pairs nesting near settlements and in colonies decreased from 51% to 34% and from 73% to 57%, respectively. Coots also preferred to nest in the vicinity of human settlements. Distributions of their nests have not changed significantly over time: in both periods 55–60% of Coot nests were found in close proximity to human settlements and 13–19% in Grebe colonies. The obtained results suggest that breeding populations of the Coot and Great Crested Grebe can cope with the invasive American Mink, whose predation was considered to be the main reason for waterbird declines in Mazurian Lakeland at the end of 20th century.",

I studied the establishment and growth of a new breeding colony of the globally Near Threatened Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus at the newly created Karla Reservoir, Central Greece, between 2012 and 2017. The reservoir began filling with water in 2009. The first pelicans were observed in 2009 and numbers increased to 950 in June 2015. Since then the occurrence pattern changed and numbers fluctuated seasonally, being high during breeding and almost zero during summer and autumn. The first pair bred in 2011 and breeding pairs reached 445 in 2017, becoming the second largest colony of Dalmatian Pelican in Europe and manifesting an annual growth rate of 176.4%. The high rate of increase and re-sightings of ringed and tagged Dalmatian Pelicans suggest that colonisers must have been immigrants from the nearest two colonies in Kerkini Reservoir and/or Lake Prespa (northern Greece). Breeding success ranged from 0.54 to 0.88 young/nest, which is low for the species. Both the change in occurrence pattern and the low breeding success must be attributed to reasons other than nesting conditions. From a conservation point of view this new breeding colony may act as an ecological trap for Dalmatian Pelicans, as low water quality will probably continue favouring conditions leading to mass pelican mortality.",

    "abstract": "Mixed-species flocks of birds are cohesive groups of two or more different species that are kept in formation by systematic behavioral interactions among the members of the flocks. Typically, mixed-species flocks form themselves around a nuclear species, which presents a specific pattern of movement during foraging, and a song that is recognized by the other species. In the understory of Neotropical forests, representatives of the family Thamnophilidae, in particular species of the genus Thamnomanes, have become adapted for the role of nuclear species in mixed-species flocks. In the present study, we describe the mixed-species flocks led by individuals of Bluish-slate Antshrike Thamnomanes schistogynus in a forest dominated by bamboo Guadua sp. in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. We collected data within a 600 × 600 m grid subdivided into 36 1-ha plots, with a total area of 36 ha. Within this grid, we delimited the home ranges and core areas of the resident mixed-species flocks. We also identified the composition of each flocks, frequency, fidelity of its members and determined the relationship between mixed-species flocks and vegetation structure within the grid. We delimited the home ranges of eight mixed-species flocks. The mean home range, estimated using the Minimum Convex Polygon method, was 3.45 ± 0.17 ha, and estimated using the autocorrelated kernel density estimation method was 3.65 ± 0.15 ha, and the mean core area, 1.14 ± 0.03 ha. The home ranges of the mixed-species flocks led by T. schistogynus in southwestern Amazonia are among the smallest recorded in species of the genus Thamnomanes. We identified 71 different bird species in the mixed-species flocks with a mean of 41.1 ± 2.1. While the geographic distribution of the lead species T. schistogynus coincides almost exactly with that of the bamboo forests of southwestern Amazonia, our results did not indicate any systematic relationship or fidelity between the mixed-species flocks led by this species and the bamboo forest.",

One of those species is the White-winged Woodpecker, endemic to Central Asia and considered one of the least-studied woodpecker species worldwide. We investigated habitat selection and cavity tree selection of this species in South Kyrgyzstan. Between March and mid-May 2009, we systematically searched for woodpeckers with playbacks on circular plots (n = 63) and subsequently used occupancy models, which account for imperfect detection, to examine relations between woodpecker occurrence and habitat factors. Occupancy rate of the White-winged Woodpecker was 0.50 (95% CI 0.36–0.64) as opposed to the naïve estimate of 0.44 (calculated as occupied plots divided by total plots); detection probability was 0.85 (0.68–0.93). Model selection revealed a preference of the White-winged Woodpecker for walnut forests, with occupancy rate declining with altitude. Cavity trees were positively associated to walnut forests and to the occurrence of damaged trees (living trees with broken and/or dead limbs), had larger diameters at breast height and were more likely damaged than available trees. Future management plans for walnut forests should consider habitat requirements of the White-winged Woodpecker, which may also benefit other species.",

In this observational study, we examined whether nestling begging behavior reflects hunger level and how parents respond to nestling begging in the Black-billed Magpie Pica pica by putting small video-cameras in six Magpie nests. Our results revealed a strong effect of nestling begging behavior on parental feeding. Begging earlier than others and stretching the neck towards the parent was important in inducing parental provisioning regardless of age of the nestlings. Being closer to the nest entrance slightly increased the chance of being fed, but did not influence parental feeding priority. The number of nestling begging events increased with the time interval since the last feeding, which indicates that begging frequency reflects the hunger level of the brood. However, in contrast to what can be predicted when begging behavior reflects hunger levels of nestlings, nestlings increased their begging level when parents provided more feedings in the previous visits and vocalized begging negatively affected the probability and the order of being fed by the parent. In addition, sensitivity in begging behavior and parental feeding decisions depended on nestlings' age, which suggests a possibility that parental feeding decisions change with growth stages of nestlings. Our results imply that begging behavior and food allocation in Magpies does not solely determined by the hunger level of nestlings.",

During three breeding seasons (2010–2012), we visited two coastal cliff colonies of Red-legged Cormorants Phalacrocorax gaimardi in the Ría Deseado, Argentina, and studied how nest site characteristics influenced their breeding success. We measured six physical characteristics at 46 nest sites, and we counted the number of fledglings produced each year from each nest (breeding success). We also related nest site temperature and wind exposure with nest site orientation. Breeding success was higher at nest sites with a broad base (greater capacity for holding young) and at nests that were less exposed to winds greater than 25 knots (46.25 km/h), which were sites with a north orientation. The lowest breeding success was observed in nest sites that were exposed to the strongest winds (i.e., sites with a south orientation). Strong winds often blow eggs and chicks away from the nests and increase opportunistic predation by gulls Larus sp. No significant relationship was found between nest site orientation and nest site temperature. Breeding success decreased with the distance to the nearest nest, which agrees with the idea that higher density of reproductive individuals reduces effectiveness of predators. Nest cover, distance from the top of the cliff, and distance from the tide line had no effect on breeding success at this study scale. Our results suggested that nest site characteristics that were related to protection against adverse weather conditions (e.g., strong winds) and avian predation, in combination with a suitable nest space, determined the breeding success of Red-legged Cormorants.",

Cavity entrances are hypothesized to be excavated in directions that allow for maintenance of microclimatic variables inside the cavity, or are alternatively linked to wood hardness of cavity-bearing trees, and are for those reasons often non-randomly oriented. It has been suggested that the mean direction of these cavity entrances vary across latitudes, from south-facing entrances at high latitudes to entrances facing east and west closer to the tropics. I show non-random distribution of the orientation of cavities excavated by at least one species of woodpecker i.e. Yellow-tufted Woodpecker Melanerpes cruentatus near Tena, Ecuador, and that entrances face predominantly towards the southeast.

Except for the relatively stable large population in the Biebrza valley in north-east Poland less is known about population trends of peripheral populations in western, central and south-eastern regions of the country and whether trends differ depending on region. We investigated the long-term population dynamics in 38 small populations between 1969–2013 in the four Polish regions. Summarizing the trends of all small populations of Aquatic Warblers showed a significant decline in total number of individuals and declining number of populations over time. However, population trends were distinctly different in the different regions, with stable dynamics in south-east, moderate decline in north-east and sharp decline in the central and western regions. During the study period 19 out of 38 populations became extinct (11 populations in the western region, two in central region, four in north-east region and none in the south-east region). Five of these populations were later recolonised thus suggesting a pattern of metapopulation dynamics. To mitigate the negative trends and increased risk of local and regional extinction in the western and central parts of Poland effort should be put to increasing dispersal among populations by increasing the number of stepping stone patches between the viable large eastern populations and the smaller central and western ones.",

    "abstract": "Many reedbed passerines forage outside their nesting territory. This peculiar behaviour could allow reproductive individuals to feed in areas where resources are plentiful and/or to nest in areas where predation risks are low. These hypotheses were investigated for the Moustached Warbler Acrocephalus melanopogon and the Reed Warbler A. scirpaceus in a 40-ha of reedbed in southern France. Vegetation structure, abundance of arthropod-prey, location of singing males, and bird local abundance were estimated along three transects 1-km long and 125-m distant parallel to the shore. Reed density increased from the lake inland, concurrently with a decrease in plant diversity. Food availability (sweep-netted arthropods weighted by their occurrence in species diet) varied positively with plant diversity and negatively with reed density. The dummy-nest experiment suggested a negative relationship between predation risks and reed density. While local abundance of each Acrocephalus species correlated spatially with food abundance, singing males were distributed evenly among the three transects. This suggests that predation risk associated with vegetation density has little influence on nest-site selection. The regular spacing of singing males further suggests that predation risk is primarily affected by nest density.",

This is a very low value in comparison to other studies (ca. 7% on average). The low level of polygyny is attributable to the low food abundance in a natural floodplain, as the nestlings in this population were fed on predominantly small food items. Both polygynous males were recorded in 2002; this year was unusual, because flooding in early June (around the hatching date) destroyed most of the broods. This could have led to an influx of new females into the study area, a change in the operational sex ratio, and new mating opportunities for males.",

The diet of nestlings in a mosaic-like urban environment was studied using the neck-collar method. We found no significant difference in the length of Redstart and Black Redstart prey items. However, the two species did bring to their nestlings invertebrates of different taxa. We used the variance partitioning method based on multivariate Redundancy Analysis to test the influence of habitat, timing of breeding, and the species of redstart itself on nestling-diet composition. Most of the variance in the nestling diet (all the canonical axes explained 70.6% of the variance) could be attributed to habitat variables (34%) and the timing of breeding (8.9%), but only 8.1% to the species of redstart. We suggest that the diet of the two redstart species is influenced largely by current prey availability and, consequently, that interspecific competition is avoided primarily by territory exclusion rather than by food-niche separation. We consider the variance partitioning method to be a powerful tool for identifying the effects of various explanatory variables that could influence food composition in birds.",

We investigated whether the migration strategy adopted by first-year Wood Sandpipers is susceptible to temporal variations. Wood Sandpipers were trapped during the July–September period from 1997 to 2007 at the Jeziorsko reservoir, central Poland. Intra- and inter-seasonal variation in stopover length, refuelling rates, departure fat loads and flight range were investigated. There was a constant decline in the refuelling rates over the course of the migratory season, reaching 0.55 g/day at the end of August. Such low refuelling rates are considered typical of energy-minimizers. Despite showing high refuelling rates at the beginning of the season, first-year Wood Sandpipers left the stopover site with relatively low fuel reserves, resulting in a low potential flight range of about 1200 km, which suggested travelling in small hops — a trait characteristic of energy-minimizers. There was also considerable inter-seasonal variation in the adopted migration strategy. The results suggest that sandpipers caught at the beginning and at the end of the migratory season behaved as energy-minimizers, at least in some aspects of the migration strategy, unlike the intermediate migrants, which adopted a typical time-minimization schedule. These observations indicate that the migration strategies of waders may depend on the environmental conditions encountered en route and are thus likely to exhibit high intra- and inter-seasonal variation.",

Using a conspecific female dummy we experimentally simulated a situation where a female returning to her own nest is confronted with a conspecific parasite. The behaviour of the tested females towards the experimental dummy was compared with their responses towards the stuffed female Ring-necked Pheasant Phasianus colchicus used as a control. The reactions towards both dummies were similar: Pochard females typically swam silently around their nests and observed the dummy. The lack of differences between the measured parameters recorded in the experiments with conspecific and pheasant dummies may indicate that female Pochards do not recognize the conspecific in...",

However, its migration patterns and wintering grounds can be affected by climate change with local fluctuations in numbers linked to weather conditions. Between 2010 and 2015 we annually carried out 15 transects/winter month in order to count the wintering population of Common Buzzards across Eastern Romania to look for climatic factors explaining variation in wintering density. Transects were controlled during two weeks from the end of the month, each covering a distance of 40 km, outlining the broadest winter monitoring of raptors in Central and Eastern Europe. Road survey was used, with a car driving at a low speed, and two observers counting birds, recording distance and habitat where birds occurred. In analyses, in addition to local weather data also 9 indices integrating weather conditions across longer time windows and larger areas were included. The wintering density calculated for the five-year period was 0.539 individuals/km2 fluctuating during the winter seasons with a possible cyclic pattern. The Buzzards selected pastures and herbaceous vegetation associations for hunting across their wintering grounds. Common Buzzard numbers fluctuate during the winter season (highest in December). They are positively influenced by rising solar flux and negatively by the low North Eastern Europe temperatures and Arctic Oscillation Index recorded within 14 days before the survey, which drive birds to southern wintering areas. These weather conditions (high pressure and low temperatures) represent the onset of the Siberian Anticyclone, a regular, annual weather system that occurs in Eastern Europe every winter.",

Here we explore the relationship between latitude and nest entrance orientation in closed nests of Passeriformes in the southern Neotropics (Furnariidae, Rhinocryptidae, Troglodytidae, Tyrannidae), using both published and original data. We found a positive and significant correlation between mean entrance orientation and latitude, and report significantly non-random nest orientation at 62% of the locations with available samples. Overall, there is a trend for nests at lower latitudes to have north-northeasterly orientations, and for nests at higher latitudes to be oriented northwest.

    "abstract": "Food resources are linked to habitat characteristics and are one of the most important forces which constrain avian life histories. Availability of food affects avian body condition and strongly determines avian breeding performance. For many small passerines in the Northern Hemisphere, lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars) and arachnids are crucial dietary components during the rearing stage, but scarce information is available for Neotropical regions. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the food delivery rates to the nestlings of caterpillars and arachnids and the tree-canopy cover and proportion of exotic trees of the nesting habitat of the insectivorous Masked Gnatcatcher Polioptila dumicola. In addition, as caterpillars and arachnids are high-quality prey-items for nestlings, we also evaluated whether differences in food delivery rates of these two prey-items were associated with nestlings' growth rates. We videotaped 23 nests in native forests of central-east Argentina during 2015–2018 breeding seasons. Both caterpillars and arachnids deliveries were positively associated with tree-canopy cover at the nest surroundings. Percentage of exotic tree-canopy cover in the nest surroundings was low (mean 8.18%), and was not associated with the frequency of food delivery. The proportion of arachnids delivered was positively associated with the asymptotic values of body mass and with the nestling tarsus maximum growth rate. Our results confirm that food resources are influenced by the tree-canopy cover in the nest surroundings, suggesting that less tree-covered patches of forests may contribute to a general decrease in the amount of food. We conclude that differences in nestling diet between habitats with different degree of tree cover contribute to explaining variance in the breeding performance of this species. Due to the alarming degree of alteration of these forests in recent decades, we highlight the importance of preserving forest portions with a high tree-cover that ensure better nestling growth in austral Masked Gnatcatcher's populations.",

Carotenoid pigments, which are responsible for the characteristic yellow, orange, and red colours, are particularly important as antioxidant for the developing embryo. The Investment Hypothesis addresses variable female allocation of maternal resources into egg yolk and predicts that high quality females and females paired to high-quality males will invest more in their eggs. We test predictions of the Investment Hypothesis in the Diamond Firetail Stagonopleura guttata. In captive females and their pair males, we compare yolk carotenoid (lutein and zeaxanthin) allocation and egg size in relation to traits indicative of individual quality (body condition, flank spot number, bill and rump colour). Females with more white flank spots laid larger eggs that contained more lutein, the major carotenoid found in the Diamond Firetail eggs. Total carotenoid concentration in egg yolk was not related to any other female characteristic. Females laid larger eggs when paired with a high quality male (dark red rump).",

    "abstract": "Predators are supposed to exert strong selection pressures on their prey, especially when phenotypic traits such as secondary sexual characters promote mating success at the expense of costs in terms of natural selection. Signaling theory predicts that individuals of superior phenotypic quality will enjoy an advantage in term of mating success, but also in term of natural selection, if such individuals are in prime condition both before and after development of exaggerated secondary sexual characters. We tested this prediction in the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica being preyed upon by the Eurasian Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, using extensive samples of feathers from prey and non-prey. We measured tail length and coloration of outermost tail feathers in the black area of the proximal and distal part of tail feathers, but also the white spot of the tail feathers. Prey had significantly less dark distal, but not proximal parts of their tails, while there was no difference in coloration of the white spot between prey and non-prey. Prey had significantly paler tail feathers than non-prey, especially among long-tailed individuals. These results suggest that Barn Swallows with long tails that fail to deposit large amounts of melanin in their tail feathers run an elevated risk of predation.",

Varied Tits Poecile varius are socially monogamous passerine birds with a distribution in Japan, Korea, and northeast China.

Extra-pair paternity occurred in 16 of the 40 broods (40%) and accounted for about 14.7% (37/251) of offspring, higher than the average value (11%) among socially monogamous birds. The relatedness between social partners did not correlate with the percentage of extra-pair offspring in the brood and there was no difference in heterozygosity between maternal half-siblings. As the first such investigation in this species, this study adds to our understanding of their mating system and will be useful for comparative studies of variations in extra-pair paternity rate.",

    "abstract": "The western European populations of Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe have halved over the past two decades. In this context of increasingly fragmented populations, a key issue is to understand the role of immigration in the maintenance of remnant populations. We characterized the local survival, fecundity, recruitment and immigration rates of a small, geographically isolated, coastal French population during a period of population stability, while the regional population was rapidly decreasing (1991–1999). Annual local adult and juvenile survival rates were estimated with capture-resighting data at, respectively, 0.463 ± 0.052 (n = 157 adults) and 0.215 ± 0.054 (n = 363 nestlings). Only 2.1 immigrants joined the population per year (7.3% of all recruits). This annual immigration rate (0.039) is lower than all 14 available estimates for small to medium-sized birds. The local population growth rate depended equally on all demographic parameters, apart from a minor influence of the immigration rate. Within-site breeding dispersal distances were low, and differed between sexes (78 ± 49 m for males, 259 ± 274 m for females). Juvenile and adult survival rates appeared lower than for populations of wheatears settled in high quality habitats, but this deficiency was compensated by high fecundity and the 2 annual immigrants. The small population size (22–27 pairs), extremely low immigration, and strong dependence on local recruits suggest that this population was demographically isolated on a patch of moderate habitat quality, with no chance of rescue by immigration in case of stochastic event. Indeed, this population went extinct in the 2000′s, after a disturbance of unknown origin.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the year-round movement behaviour is fundamental for the effective conservation management of an ecologically important species. In the heavily human-modified landscape of Central Europe, Saker Falcons Falco cherrug have adapted to intensively managed agricultural habitats, often nesting and roosting on electrical pylons. We studied the ranging behaviour and habitat selection of one juvenile and three adult Saker Falcons equipped with GPS/GSM loggers in the Czech Republic and Austria between 2015–2017. Upon release from a rescue centre, the juvenile Saker Falcon used temporary settlement areas (TSAs) with a median size of 231 km2 (minimum convex polygons, MCP 95%). Median of breeding season home ranges for the three adults was 15 km2 over six breeding events. After breeding period, the adults remained close to the nest site, occupying an area with median of 10 km2 until they departed for their autumn migration. Departure dates ranged from 21 September to 9 November. Winter TSA sizes had median of 99 km2. Adults returned to the breeding area between 12 February and 4 March. Annual breeding home ranges overlapped by approximately 84–99% indicating high site fidelity. The most utilised land cover types within winter TSAs included arable land and heterogeneous agricultural areas. Analysis of night-time roosting sites showed a substantial preference for high voltage pylons compared to trees. Our results could benefit conservation planning and species management practices, focusing on both improving the safety of anthropogenic elements and increasing habitat diversity.",

Ten bird species utilised the old cavities (most frequently Great Tit Parus major, Grey-headed Woodpecker and Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca).

The study found experimental evidence that Ca deficiency may affect reproductive traits also in birds breeding in non-acidified but naturally base-poor habitats. Positive effects of calcium supplementation on the egg volume, shell thickness, start of laying and fledglings' parameters of Great Tits Parus major and Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca breeding in base-poor pine forests in Estonia were revealed. The adverse effects of calcium shortage seem to be more pronounced in the years with the most unfavourable breeding conditions. Authors suggest that in such years birds may respond to calcium shortage by postponing egg-laying. The cost of egg formation in base-poor areas might be much higher than has been estimated on the basis of the energy and protein content of eggs. This fact should be considered more seriously in life history models of wild birds.",

Occupied nests (n = 41) had a predominantly south-easterly exposure and were located on average 20 ± 8 m above the ground. The availability of suitable nest holes positively influenced the size of breeding colonies. The preference for SE-facing holes could be affected by winter winds, which blow from the NW. To describe the habitat conditions in 20 Jackdaw nesting areas in Rome, in comparison with 14 randomly selected sites from the same area, 25 variables in plots within a 28.8 ha area were measured. Built-up districts covered on average 77% and 78% of the total area of occupied plots and random plots, respectively. Ruderal areas covered 5% of the total area in occupied plots and 0.4% in random ones, wooded areas correspondingly 20% and 12%. Stepwise discriminant function analysis carried out on habitat variables in nesting areas and random plots provided a model based on the proportion of ruderal areas and gardens that correctly classified 90% of cases. Jackdaws are associated with habitats characterised by the interspersion of ruderal areas, gardens, and built-up districts that provide suitable nest sites. Effective protection measures in urban areas should concentrate on the conservation both of suitable cavities in old buildings and of relict patches of ruderal and open habitats bordering city centres.",

The true breeding density there was 4.0–8.4, reaching as much as 15.2 p/10 ha in some years, while, according to the combined territory-mapping method for the same period, it was, on average, 5.8 pairs/10 ha in oak-lime-hornbeam, 3.3 pairs/10 ha in riparian ash-alder, but less than 0.5 pairs/10 ha in mixed coniferous-deciduous or young deciduous stands (marginal habitats for this species). Being among the most numerous species in the Białowieża Forest bird community, Hawfinches hold small nesting territories that are sometimes loosely grouped. Nests are built at an average height of 18.1 (7–34) m in the tree canopy. Hornbeams are the preferred tree species for nesting in the oak-lime-hornbeam stands (also clumps of mistletoe in the continental maple), while black alders in the riparian woodland. Originally, the Hawfinch must have been a species of old, high forests. Its recent nesting elsewhere — low in bushes or, preferably, along woodland edges — is likely to be a secondarily acquired trait; it could also be due to a bias — Hawfinch nests are more easily discovered in such localities.",

We examined the differences between bird communities inhabiting the relict growth of river meanders and those inhabiting secondary plantations along the Rivers Otava and Blanice (Czech Republic). In addition, we investigated whether the well-developed oak plantations on artificial fishpond dams, which are common in the studied landscape, might compensate for the loss of bird diversity following river regulation. Breeding bird community and habitat attributes were studied on 30 fixed-width line transects and analysed using Multivariate Redundancy Analysis. Relict meanders were the most structurally diversified habitat type, with the highest species diversity and the great richness of forest birds. In contrast, secondary plantations were the simplest stands with the poorest communities inhabited by more farmland species. Fishpond dams, though resembling the meanders more so than secondary stands, were found to be insufficient compensation for river meanders in regard to avian diversity. Supporting diverse plantations of softwood tree species and widening the narrow belts along river banks are highlighted as ways of managing riparian stands that are beneficial to birds.",

    "abstract": "European Robins are found at \"La Font Roja\" Natural Park in SE Spain throughout the year. Analysis of recaptures of individually marked birds during 3 years strongly suggests that individuals breeding in the park abandon it during the winter, while a new wintering population occupies the park between November and March. We found that during 5 weeks in April and 3 weeks in October the two populations overlapped. We also analysed the biometry of the \"local\" (breeding) and \"wintering\" populations. The local population had significantly shorter wings, and longer tails and tarsi than the wintering population. In both populations, juveniles had shorter wings and longer tails than adults, but tarsus length did not differ between age classes. Among the local birds, males had longer wings and tails than females, but tarsus length did not differ between sexes (sex could not be determined in the wintering population). Biometric analyses supported the hypothesis of the occurrence of two separate populations in the study area, and also that the migratory tendency (as derived from wing and tail lengths) was higher among the wintering birds.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural expansion at the expense of natural habitats and the intensification processes in agricultural production are globally among the main causes of biodiversity and ecosystem services loss at large scale. This process can completely alter food provision for birds and have negative consequences for their diet and breeding performance. Under the hypothesis that changes in land use limit food resources for raptors, our aim was to analyze variation in nestling diet between natural areas and areas with different degrees of agricultural intensification (natural forest, traditional farmland, intensive farmland) in a population of American Kestrel Falco sparverius breeding in nest boxes and cavities. Through the analysis of pellets and prey remains collected during the reproductive season of 2012–2013 we found no differences in diet diversity among areas and the diet in the three areas was monopolized by arthropods. However, the diet did change in composition between areas. Numerically, Orthoptera dominated the diet in the three areas, although with a higher percentage in the forest area. The frequency of vertebrate consumption was affected positively by the area occupied by natural forest and stubble, while the soybean cover affected the consumption in a negative way. In both agricultural areas, the diet was complemented with different groups of arthropods suggesting that changes in land use generate a functional response in the American Kestrel that is able to take advantage of available resources in each sampling area. Long-term analysis of diet variation within the framework of agricultural intensification and its relation with demographic parameters and individual performance will allow to evaluate the impact of this variation in the diet on kestrels.",

In our study we tested the hypothesis that the decision by juvenile Reed Warblers to perform such flights over the natal area during the post-fledging period depends on weather conditions and the phase of the lunar cycle. We analysed the data on nocturnal movements of 26 birds radio-tagged near their natal site on the Courish Spit (SE Baltic coast). We infer from our results that the decision in juvenile Reed Warblers to take off on a nocturnal flight over the natal area is triggered by intrinsic stimuli and depends only very slightly on environmental conditions. Comparison of these data with a previous study of the effect of weather and the lunar cycle on long-distance nocturnal pre-migratory flights by juvenile Reed Warblers suggests that the motivation to leave the natal area at night increases under good visibility and conditions favourable for flight.",

    "abstract": "Mute Swan Cygnus olor numbers have recently increased in a dramatic fashion in Western Europe and in North America, suggesting there could be potential consequences for the rest of the waterbird community. Breeding Mute Swan pairs may behave territorially towards other waterbirds, taking advantage of their larger size, and hence cause concern regarding their potential effects on waterbird communities. We studied how the within-site distributions of breeding Mute Swans and other waterbirds were related to each other, in order to assess if there is support to the assertion that breeding Mute Swans may affect the distribution of the other waterfowl within waterbodies. We mapped waterbird and swan distribution within fishponds during the Mute Swan breeding period. Relying on spatial point pattern analysis, our first finding is that breeding Mute Swans were located in the vicinity of the other waterbirds, using the same area within fishpond. Waterbirds do not completely desert the area used by breeding swan pairs within a waterbody, hence not supporting the claim that Mute Swans dislodge the other species. If an exclusion process by Mute Swan breeding pairs towards waterbirds exists, it is not strong enough to generate deserted areas by waterbirds around breeding Mute Swans. Our second finding is that breeding Mute Swans were not located where the density probability function for waterbird presence was the greatest within a fishpond, i.e. breeding Mute Swans were not located in the centre of groups formed by other waterbirds within each fishponds. This may indicate slightly different micro-habitat preferences or use within fishponds, or could indicate the potential occurrence of interactions. In conclusion, these results question whether the increasing Mute Swan populations actually directly threaten the other waterbird communities in such habitats, and require population control as is often claimed.",

Predation was the main cause of nest failures, although there was no significant difference in nest predation between secondary (SCN) and primary (PCN) cavity (burrow)-nesting species. Offspring predation rate was the only one recording significant result; the lowest offspring predation rate was associated with PCN species — Amazonian Motmot but, again, there was no significant difference between PCN and SCN species. On the other hand, SCN species — Swallow Tanager has compensated offspring losses due to its increased fecundity, which enabled two broods per breeding season.

    "abstract": "Shrikes from the genus Lanius are generalists in terms of diet, even consuming highly toxic species, as blister beetles (Coleoptera, Meloidae). Despite the fact that regular predation on these coleopterans have never been described both in recent and historical literature, birds stand out as one of the groups to most often prey upon these insects. In the Old World, records of shrikes preying on oil-beetles — most of them treated as anecdotal — have been published since the 19th century. However, despite being repetitive, no review or in-depth study of this behavior has been conducted. After a literature study and new data collected in the Iberian Peninsula, it seems an extended behaviour within the clade. As could be observed in a high number of cases, birds even apply a specific technique, selecting specific body parts to kill the beetle, more sclerotic and presumably less toxic. In some cases, strict predation has been demonstrated. To date, at least six different shrike species — Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio, Great Grey Shrike L. excubitor, Iberian Grey Shrike L. meridionalis, Loggerhead Shrike L. ludovicianus, Lesser Grey Shrike L. minor, and Woodchat Shrike L. senator — have been found to show signs of preying on at least nine Meloidae species throughout Europe, North Africa and North America, constituting a line of research that should be studied in greater detail.",

    "abstract": "Nest construction may result in niche creation by the bird, i.e., modification of the immediate environment in terms of temperature or humidity. Here thermal insulation of nests of the Common Blackbird Turdus merula was investigated using a heat source placed inside the cup. The temperature profile of the nest wall was recorded using thermistors placed at different positions in the nest wall. Temperatures were affected by the layers in the wall with the grass cup lining and mud cup offering more insulation than the outer wall. Thermal conductance of the wall of Common Blackbird nests was relatively high compared to other reports for this variable in other passerine species from Australia. Variation among Common Blackbird nests in terms of temperature differences across layers, and thermal conductance overall, correlated with the thickness of the grass cup lining. Thermal insulation provided by a nest wall is dependent on the thicknesses and types of materials used in each part of the wall. Previous studies using nest deconstruction have demonstrated that the various layers in a wall have differing thermal characteristics. This is the first report of clear differences in the temperature profile across the different parts of the intact nest wall. Whether this pattern is also observed in nests of other species requires further investigation. The placement of different materials within the nest wall by the bird is not a random process and the results support the idea that the avian nest is involved in niche creation.",

Preferred nesting sites were in permanent plant cover and orchards; crops were used less frequently than expected.

The breeding success of males recorded in at least two breeding seasons, and nesting at least once in the study area, was analysed. The lifespan number of offspring was positively and significantly correlated with longevity. The reproductive investment in the first year of life did not correspond with longevity, and hence nonbreeding males in the first year did not compensate for the losses in fecundity. There were no differences in longevity between dark, intermediate and female-like coloured males. Darker males were less successful in their breeding attempts in the first year than paler birds. Breeding in the first year of life positively influenced the future number of fledglings, and the greater investment in reproduction in this year positively affected future brood size in dark males. Among males successfully breeding in the study area from their first season, dark males reared significantly more offspring during their lifetime, and in the first year of life, than paler ones. Nevertheless, in the total sample, lifetime brood size did not vary between differently coloured males, perhaps because dark males are more vulnerable to predators. The general difference between differently coloured males lay in how breeding efforts were distributed during life. Dark males can maximise reproductive investment from the first breeding year, while paler males increased average brood size in the following years of life only.",

In Poland, the Black Grouse is one of the most endangered bird species, however very little is known about diversity of this native population, bordering on to the area of Europe in which the species maintains a continuous range. To complete the knowledge of genetic structure of European populations, we analysed microsatellite polymorphism in 97 native Polish birds, along with 39 introduced individuals, originating in Belarus and at a breeding centre in Poland, regarded as representing the gene pool from the north-eastern part of the country. The results confirmed that isolation of populations and recent decreases in their sizes have reduced genetic diversity in Poland's populations of the Black Grouse. The results also indicated the presence of two genetic groups in Poland, involving birds of the north-eastern part of the country and the Carpathians Foothills in a first group, and the population from the Sudetes (Izerskie and Karkonosze Mountains) in a second. We suggest that the conservation effort should treat these two groups as independent units. We also analysed a fragment of the mitochondrial Control Region (CRmtDNA). The comparisons of sequences obtained with data from other Eurasian populations indicate that populations of the Black Grouse in Poland should be included within a large Conservation Unit — the northern tetrix — which comprises birds from Eastern and Northern Europe.",

    "abstract": "Sex allocation theory predicts equal offspring sex ratio when costs/benefits of producing each sex are comparable. However, when costs of rearing or fitness values of sexes vary, skewed offspring sex ratio toward the one sex may be beneficial. In this study we analysed seasonal secondary sex ratio (proportion of males) in broods of the Common Kingfisher Alcedo atthis, the socially monogamous, three- to four-brooded (per season) species with biparental care in which adult females are slightly larger than males. Fieldwork was carried out in the Danube river system from Bratislava to Gabčíkovo (SW Slovakia) during 2014–2018. In total, 959 nestlings from 149 broods of 78 breeding pairs were sexed, amongst which 483 were males and 476 were females. We considered the following assumptions: 1) no seasonal shift in sex ratio, as studied population occupies habitats rich in food; 2) female biased broods early in the season, as females' rapid maturation enables them to breed in the season they have been born; 3) male biased broods early in the season as several young males have been documented to be nest helpers. However, only a few such cases were observed, so it should be treated with caution. The sex ratio of individual broods ranged from 0 (all female) to 1 (all male), but the mean nestling sex ratio did not deviate from parity. We found no effect of year, brood size, or laying date. Thus, our results agree with outcomes of other avian studies where balanced seasonal sex ratio has been found.",

During a long-term study on the reproductive biology of the species on fen mires on the river Biebrza in north-eastern Poland, we frequently heard males singing more intensely or uttering warning calls close to nests. Here we test whether this behaviour is reproducible and therefore constitutes a mate investment or paternal investment. During the incubation periods, hides were erected ca. 30 m from nests. During 30-min periods male song bouts were counted while a test person was either concealed inside or placed outside the tent, hence well visible as a potential predator. The production of song showed a sevenfold increase during the presence of a clearly visible test person. This observation indicates that male song in Aquatic Warbler serves as a warning signal and hence can be regarded as a type of mate or paternal investment.",

    "abstract": "In birds, offspring-parent interactions play an essential role in facilitating offspring survival at nest-leaving. In contrast to nidicolous nestlings, nidifugous chicks are expected to hatch in ground nests, leave the nest soon after hatching, and presumably exhibit precise parent-offspring recognition during this time. Yet, some studies document variation in nidifugous behavior and offspring-parent recognition of semi-precocial chicks during the nest-leaving stage in the family Laridae. We examine patterns in nest-leaving age, mobile capacity, and parent recognition in wild and captive chicks of the Saunders's Gull Saundersilarus saundersi that is one of ground nesting and colonially breeding species. Our results indicated that the development of locomotor activity in nidifugous chicks coincided with the nestleaving age. Soliciting behavior of experimental chicks increased with age, but they strongly discriminated vocalizations of pseudo-parents against unfamiliar adults only at the early stage of nest-leaving. We suggest that parent recognition by chicks during this short period may play a key role in facilitating their own survival while moving to a new environment with their parents after leaving the nest. More studies using a comparative approach are needed to understand how nesting ecology, nest-leaving behavior, and parent-offspring interaction are interconnected in the members of the family Laridae.",

The qualitative analysis suggested that UV does not increase brightness of most examples of feathers that appear dull in the visible range, though it may add to the conspicuousness of plumage already bright by human standards. Black but shiny or iridescent birds, whose feathers reflect UV, are the possible exception. Though methods used did not allow the quantitative comparison of the strength of this reflectance with that in the visible range, it seems likely that UV may enhance brightness of iridescent feathers of black coloured birds. Moreover, the supplementary examination of some other, randomly selected species, as well as findings by other authors, suggest that in some cases U V m ay be important in birds' perception of feathers, especially if they are black or white.",

Only in the case of the Buzzard there were significant differences in clutch sizes and numbers of fledglings in the various years. In this species the mean number of fledglings was positively correlated with the rodent availability index in a given year. There was no such relationship between the abundance of prey items found in Goshawk nests and the number of fledglings. The correlation between the number of newly-fledged Buzzards and Goshawks in a given year could have been due to diet overlap between the two species.",

Large-scale conversion of natural and rural areas into irrigated farmlands is ongoing in North Africa, but the effects of this habitat modification on steppe bird species are not investigated. In this study, we investigated the breeding biology of the Eurasian Stone-curlew nesting in grazed steppes and irrigated farmlands in south-western Morocco. Breeding data were collected during 2017 and 2018 breeding seasons on 59 nests. Egg volume was significantly higher in grazed steppes than in irrigated farmlands (37.3 ± 2.30 cm3 vs 35.1 ± 2.11 cm3, average ± SD), possibly due to greater food availability in the former habitat. On the other hand, daily nest survival over the incubation period did not differ between habitats and it was quite high (0.85 [95% CI: 0.71–0.93]) also when compared to the data available for other regions. These results suggest that birds nesting in protected areas characterized by traditional pastoralism might find better conditions for reproduction which allow them to lay larger eggs. In addition, the ongoing process of agricultural intensification in the area does not seem to affect the likelihood of nest failure. Our data add to the few available pieces of evidence regarding the effect of breeding habitat on the reproductive biology of the Stone-curlew in the southern range of its distribution. Further data are needed in order to understand the conservation implication of our findings and, in particular, how the observed variability of egg size might affect chick quality and survival.",

    "abstract": "In tropical forests many forest-dwelling non-aquatic passerines build nests by forest streams. It has been proposed that this behavior protects the nest from predators. However, this hypothesis has been rarely tested, and relevant aspects of the relationships between nesting birds and forest streams are to be studied. Firstly, it is not clear whether tropical forest understory passerines can indeed select stream banks for nest construction, as researchers often use forest streams as pathways, which could cause the false impression that nests of certain species are more frequently found near water. Secondly, it is expected that if birds select stream banks for nest construction, they will choose nest spots with characteristics that could increase nest survival. We studied nest site selection in two Atlantic Forest birds: the Blue Manakin Chiroxiphia caudata and the Star-throated Antwren Rhopias gularis. Nests were searched near and far from water, and a number of stream characteristics, including width, depth, water speed and water sound were compared between nest sites and random sites chosen upstream or downstream. Finally, we addressed whether stream variables could explain nest daily survival rate (DSR). Nests of both species were found only near or over water, and the average DSR was 0.975 for the Blue Manakin and 0.972 for the Star-throated Antwren. Our results provided support for the \"aqua-phobic nest predator hypothesis\", since we found a positive correlation between DSR and stream depth for the Star-throated Antwren and a negative correlation between nest distance from water and DSR for the Blue Manakin. However, stream parameters were not among the main variables explaining nest site selection along streams. This suggests that partial isolation provided by forest streams may reduce nest predation and can drive these species to use stream banks for nesting. The main predators of Blue Manakin nests were birds (80% of filmed predation events), whereas nests of Star-throated Antwren were preyed upon mostly by mammals (54.5% of the records).",

Among 178 bird-glass collisions recorded only 3% took place within 10 cm from glass edge, although this glass band (i.e. 0–10 cm from edge) covers over 30% of the whole glass area, on average. More inner parts of glass (10–70 cm from glass edge) had collision frequency slightly higher than expected by their coverage or proportional to their coverage. Different collisions recorded at one glass seemed independent suggesting no spatial aggregations within single glass. This study is the first to demonstrate the non-random risk of bird collision in relation to position on the glass surface and may suggest that there is no need to implement mitigating measures, like visible markers placed on the glass, closer than 10 cm from the glass edge.",

In this study, we have analysed the nesting dynamics of five waterbird species: Grey Heron Ardea cinerea, Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, Little Egret Egretta garzetta, Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax and Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis, that had settled in a colony in the Royal Castle Park of Racconigi (Cuneo, NW Italy) over a 17-year period (2000 to 2017). The Great Cormorant and the Cattle Egret settled in the colony in 2008 and 2012, respectively. We analysed the relationships between the number of breeding pairs of the five species. In addition, we used the time series forecasting method to study the nesting dynamics and the impact of the new settlements on the pre-existing colony. The number of nests of the Great Cormorant and the Cattle Egret increased annually, and these species significantly affected the nesting trends of the other pre-existing species: Grey Heron, Black-crowned Night Heron and Little Egret. The Grey Heron mainly suffered from the occupation of its old nests by the Great Cormorant from 2008 to 2013. However, since 2014, the Grey Heron has been able to react, by displacing its breeding site to the tops of trees adjacent to the old heronry, and this has resulted in an even greater number of nests than before 2008. The Black-crowned Night Heron and the Little Egret suffered more from the settlement of the new species than the Grey Heron did, and started to suddenly or gradually abandon the breeding site. The colony has been modified profoundly by the settlement of the Great Cormorant and the Cattle Egret, and it is still subject to dynamics that could transform it in the coming years.",

We investigated how foraging behaviour during chick rearing varies in males and females with brood size, offspring age and individual body mass of parents, in a sexually size-dimorphic waterbird, the Whiskered Tern Chlidonias hybrida. Our study took place at the carp fish ponds in southern Poland, where both invertebrates (dragonflies, a typical prey of females — caught by picking) and small vertebrates (fish, tadpoles, frogs, males typical prey — caught by plunge-diving) are plentiful and available for both sexes during chick-rearing period. In total, 1680 attacks of 29 uniquely marked birds (16 males and 13 females) were observed during chick-rearing period. Foraging techniques were affected by sex of the parent and offspring age, interacting with body mass, and brood size. Males foraged mainly by plunge diving, but avoided this foraging technique if their broods were small and when offspring were young, probably because the chicks were too small to consume vertebrate prey caught by diving. In contrast, females foraged mostly by picking prey from the air, water surface or floating leaves, for most of chick-rearing period, but increased frequency of plunge diving as offspring age increased. A significant interaction between body mass and offspring age suggests that birds differing in body mass foraged differently as their offspring grew. We conclude that despite sex-specific differences in foraging behaviour (and prey type delivered to the chicks), both sexes in the Whiskered Tern alter foraging behaviour in response to both brood and individual birds' attributes.",

    "abstract": "Human-induced changes in the natural environment impact upon a wide variety of genetic processes at all levels of population structure. Insight into these processes is now achieved by analyses of genetic diversity allowing the past and present condition of populations to be assessed and compared. Given its severe fragmentation and small size, the population of the Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus in Poland can be regarded as especially prone to gene-pool alteration. Moreover, this is a region of Europe in which different genetic lineages of the Capercaillie may be present, ensuring that certain conservation decisions may be even more difficult than they otherwise would be. Bearing the above in mind, we decided to study polymorphism of the mitochondrial DNA Control Region (mtDNA CR) in remnant and extinct populations of the Capercaillie in Poland. The extinct population was represented by samples from birds hunted in the Lower Silesian Forest (SW Poland) between 1951–1962. We compared sequences obtained with data from the large, continuous population present in Russia and Scandinavia. Analysing 331 bp of mtDNA CR for 168 individuals, we identified 24 haplotypes, among which only 6 had not been reported previously in the species according to GenBank. Our data confirmed a previous suggestion regarding the genetic structure of the species in Poland, i.e. that birds from Augustów Forest (NE Poland) are related to Russian and Scandinavian populations, constituting a part of the lowland group within the boreal lineage. The Carpathian population is in turn confirmed as an independent genetic group within the boreal lineage, while specimens from the Solska Forest (SE Poland) prove to be highly differentiated from birds in other Polish populations; most likely because they derive from — or have been connected via gene flow with — birds present in the Balkans. Further genetic analysis is necessary to resolve this evolutionary relationship between Capercaillies from south-eastern Poland and those of the Balkans. Where practice is concerned, the overall advice is that three Conservation Units are to be recognised in Poland. In addition to those, the extinct population from the Lower Silesian Forest has been deemed part of the lowland group within the boreal lineage, albeit a distinctive one, given the possibility of gene exchange with Carpathian birds. We further suggest that some aspect of this extinct population's genetic diversity reflects an uncontrolled process of reintroduction taking place in the past.",

    "abstract": "The seasonal presence of the Oriental Honey Buzzard Pernis ptilorhynchus in Israel has changed during the last two decades. Up until the late 1990s, it occurred in Israel as a rare spring migrant, but has since been more frequently observed. In the last decade, it has established itself as a regular over-winterer in Eilat, as well as a rare summer visitor. The reasons for this change are unclear; however, this process is concurrent with the invasion of the Dwarf Honey Bee Apis florea to the southern part of Arava, the region extending from the Gulf of Aqaba to the southern tip of the Dead Sea. Similar invasions of this social honey bee, native to East Asia, have been reported from East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Using standardized line transects to count Oriental Honey Buzzard, and by creating a Honeybee Invasion Index (HII) for Dwarf Honey Bee, based on data collected by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority to estimate its distribution, we show that the abundance of overwintering Oriental Honey Buzzard in Eilat is significantly related to the distribution of DHB in southern Arava. We suggest that the invasion of Dwarf Honey Bee in the area facilitates the presence of Oriental Honey Buzzard outside the migration season.",

Fish pond complexes supported about 20% of the individuals of the total estimated Lithuanian population of Little Grebe, about 40-50% of Red-necked and Black-necked Grebes, almost all breeding Whooper Swans in Lithuania, about 20% of the individuals of the total estimated Lithuanian population of Greylag Goose, 40% of Shelduck, 30% of Tufted Duck, more than 20% of Gadwall, Pintail and Shoveler. Certain ponds were possible breeding sites of Ferruginous Duck, a globally threatened species. The large fish pond complexes are the most important in Lithuania staging sites of Black Storks and the principal stopover sites of wildfowl with up to 30 000 staging swans, geese and ducks being daily recorded in some ponds. These man-made wetlands are amongst the most important stopover sites for many species of waders with up to 8000 Lapwings, 2600 Ruffs and 1400 Dunlins recorded in some ponds. Several large ponds complexes regularly support concentrations of Whooper Swan, White-fronted Goose, Gadwall, Shoveler, Pochard and Lapwing, exceeding the 1% Ramsar threshold. New forms of aquaculture being brought about by the market economy may affect the key waterbirds habitats in the large fish ponds.",

Of 17 breeding sites, 16 were used by Bearded Tits also outside the breeding season. The numbers of birds recorded peaked in second half of October and declined thereafter. Flock size averaged 3.1 (range 1–55) birds and correlated with total number of Bearded Tits recorded during the single survey. Birds mostly foraged on reed seeds taken from reed ears. Foraging on the ground occurred mostly at the beginning and at the end of non-breeding season. Searching for invertebrates peaked in December—January.",

    "abstract": "The Greater Rhea Rhea americana is a South-American flightless bird whose populations have decreased due to poaching and fragmentation of suitable habitats, and there has been an urgent need to carry out management practices to prevent local or regional extinctions. Several studies revealed that reintroduction might be an appropriate action for increasing the viability of wild populations of this species. Nevertheless, although this is a popular and useful conservation strategy, the animals to be released should be prepared against risks like predation and dispersion that could influence the post-release success. We evaluated the effect of an antipredator training applied to captive-bred Greater Rheas before they were released into the wild, on their dispersal and home range size and overlap, supposing that the trained animals would avoid dispersing into places with predators and, consequently, they would reduce their home range. We also studied the habitat use by the released rheas. Eleven trained and nine control (untrained) animals were marked and monitored two to four times per day during the first week, and from 4 to 19 consecutive days per month during four months, throughout the breeding and post-breeding seasons. The antipredator training affected the home range in different ways according to sex. Trained females exhibited smaller home ranges (mean ± S.E.: 0.54 ± 0.58 km2) than the rest of the individuals (control females 5.8 ± 0.75 km2, control and trained males: 2.11 ± 0.65 km2 and 2.96 ± 0.65 km2, respectively), whereas their overlap was greater (63.83 ± 16.95%) than that of the untrained females (24.04 ± 21.88%). Males of both experimental groups showed similar distances travelled (3.21 ± 0.29 km), which were also greater than those of females (2.21 ± 0.32 km). The home ranges of males were not influenced by the training and they showed a high degree of overlapping (among control males 29.96 ± 18.95%, and among trained males: 35.81 ± 18.95%). Both groups similarly used crops and in lesser extent open areas and grassland. Only the trained females reduced their movements and wandering as a result of the previous conditioning. They moved to crop or open areas, avoiding tall vegetation such as that present in grasslands, which may make difficult to detect predators. On the other hand, in the males, the influence of the reproductive season and the complex mating system exhibited by this species prevailed over the possible effects of training. Our work shows new and useful data about the spatial behaviour and reintroduction for conservation of the Greater Rhea.",

Despite being a major scavenging raptor in many urban areas, studies on Indian subspecies of Black Kites Milvus migrans govinda are very few. We studied the pattern of offal preference by Black Kites foraging in the dumping sites adjoining two major markets of Kolkata, India through cafeteria experiments, where successful foraging events and abundance of foraging Black Kites were recorded. We also carried out questionnaire surveys among 156 meat and fish sellers of 32 markets of this area to assess their offal disposal practice and understand their attitude towards Black Kites. During questionnaire surveys majority of the respondents (77.92%), indicated that Black Kites consume various kinds of offal, particularly chicken offal from garbage dumps of Kolkata. 51.92% respondents opined that Black Kite population has declined in Kolkata, and 41.03% of them believe such decline is due to food scarcity. Still many respondents (64.74%) sell their offal, which reflect their indifferent attitude towards this scavenging raptor. During 'cafeteria experiments, we noticed that foraging kites pick up small pieces of offal from the garbage dumps, particularly chicken, mutton and fish offal (in 15.45 ± 7.749, 9.7 ± 4.542 and 9.95 ± 4.951 successful foraging events/h respectively). Energy content (cal/g) of sun-dried samples of each type of offal substances revealed that the energy (calorie) of swine offal was highest followed by beef offal, mutton offal, chicken offal and fish offal. In spite of being energetically rich, beef and swine offal were less selected by Black Kites possibly because they are visibly larger than other offal, thus requires greater handling time and invites higher risk of kleptoparasitism. Successful foraging events were significantly influenced by offal type, but not by months, study sites or by the relative abundance of foraging Black Kites.",

In the final model we found a difference between sites, while separate submodels for the study sites showed that females had higher H:L ratio than males in the urban parkland site, with the opposite result being found in the forest site. We suppose that the pattern of variation in H:L ratios we found may result from greater parental expenditures of females as compared to males. Such difference in the H:L ratio between habitats could be the reason for the substantial difference in trophic conditions between the forest and park areas during the breeding of tits.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge about migration strategy and availability of stop-over sites of globally threatened migratory birds is crucial for the implementation of efficient conservation plan. In this study, we investigated the refuelling strategy of the globally threatened Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola at stop-over sites during the autumn migration in West Europe and Africa (40 and 72 sites, respectively, documented in published works about stop-over ecology and sites). Based on fuel reserves of captured birds we calculated potential maximal range of non-refuelling flight from stop-over sites located on the Atlantic flyway migration route. We tried to verify the hypothesis that Aquatic Warblers are able to cross the Sahara during one non-stop flight. We found that mean range of flights was affected significantly by the stopover geographic location but not by age of the birds and stop-over habitat. Individuals staging in France are able to cover smaller distances (mean 612.7 km) compared to individuals staging in Portugal and Spain (mean 857.5 km), i.e. closer to two important geographical barriers (the Gibraltar Strait and the Sahara desert). However, maximal ranges of the heaviest individuals were longer (2370 km in France and 1998 km in Portugal). Our study suggests that Aquatic Warblers are generally not able to cross the Sahara during one non-stop flight. Only some individuals with high fat loads starting from stop-overs in Portugal may be able to cross the Sahara without refuelling. However, due to diel air temperature pattern in the desert they need to stop at least once to rest and wait for nighttime drop in temperature to continue migration. Within the Sahara there are many small patches of suitable habitats which can facilitate resting and maybe even refuelling. Observed and predicted reduction of available area of stop-over habitats may have serious negative consequences for population dynamics of many land-bird species, including the globally threatened Aquatic Warbler.",

    "abstract": "Species with known long-term changes in abundance and distribution enable exploring the role of newly accessible sites in population regulation. In Western Europe, the Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa islandica is one of the few wintering shorebirds with increasing populations. The French coasts comprise a major wintering site within its global wintering area, with several thousand individuals at some sites. Nevertheless, the role and importance of French sites in general distribution patterns of the species remain unclear, especially as its hunting was legal there until 2008. In contrast, recent increases in protected areas in France (from 4,000 ha in 1973 to 28,000 ha in 2005) offer new safe sites and suitable habitats for the species. In this study, we assessed the numbers and distribution of Black-tailed Godwits along the coasts of Western France. The main wintering sites in France are progressively occupied from August, reaching peak occupation in late autumn or early winter although few of the ten sites listed showed similar patterns of monthly variations in the distribution of Godwit numbers. France welcomes c. 28% of the total L. l. islandica population in mid-winter over the period 2003–2007. Numbers declined steadily from the base year (1977) until 1991, then progressively increased, reaching a maximum in 2010 (c. 27,000 individuals). The creation of Nature Reserves throughout the 1990s probably contributed to the increasing number of Godwits in France, with new accessible sites visited and occupied intensively during the period of population increase. The clearly contrasting phenologies between the British Isles and France suggest that most of the individuals first arrive in the United Kingdom after the breeding season, and then some of the birds move to southern sites in either France or Iberia, while very few birds fly directly to France from Iceland.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the intensification of agricultural practices in olive orchards, including intensive use of agrochemicals, along with the absence of natural herb layer, has led to a decline in songbird communities. Increased nest predation has been suggested as another important factor in the decline of farmland birds. High abundances of alternative prey species, such as European Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus may attract generalist predators, which may increase predation rates on bird nests, a phenomenon known as hyperpredation. In this work, we evaluate artificial nest predation in intensively farmed olive orchards, using quail eggs (one plaster and two natural eggs in each nest) placed on the ground (97 nests) and on trees (106 nests). 53.7% of nests (109 out of 203) were predated; 51 of these nests had at least one egg with signs of predation and in 58 nests all eggs were predated. Nests placed on the ground (61%) were predated more frequently than those on trees (46%). Rabbit abundance was identified as one of the main factors increasing the probabilities of a nest being predated. Despite lower rates of nest predation in areas with low rabbit abundance, we found a higher diversity of nest predators, such as Mustela nivalis, Mustela putorius, Martes foina or Erinaceus europaeus in these areas. This study suggests that conservation efforts aimed at increasing the breeding success of farmland birds should avoid areas with high abundance of rabbits owing to the phenomenon of hyperpredation.",

    "abstract": "The rate of telomere loss is increasingly being used as a marker of biological aging, organismal senescence, and survival probability. These protective ends of chromosomes act to protect coding DNA during replication and by buffering against degradation from reactive oxygen species (ROS). In many organisms, telomere loss has been linked to increased levels of metabolism, biological stress and disease. Here we validate a medium-throughput and reliable method to measure relative telomere length in Sand Martins Riparia riparia. We performed the qPCR assay on a population of variously aged individuals from eastern Hungary. We detected a significant negative relationship between relative telomere length and age and observed a clear drop in telomere length in older age classes (> 4 years) but no relationship with gender or body mass. Our results in this cross-sectional study support findings in other passerine species that report a lack of long telomeres in older individuals. The method that we describe will allow longitudinal studies of Sand Martin individuals in wild populations to track telomere dynamics related to various life history characteristics and individual health.",

Altogether, 48 territories of owls in 16 farm building complexes were found. Distances between nearest-neighbour nest sites were 16-203 m. In the Little Owl the average distance was 43 m ± 28, in the Tawny Owl 159 m ± 61. The number of young in broods of Little Owls nesting in coexistence was significantly lower compared to those nesting with other owls. The considerable incidence of coexistence found was related to the specific conditions of the study area: “islands” of farm building complexes offered favourable nesting sites, while the surrounding monoculture fields provided hunting territories with only limited opportunities for nesting. The productivity of the Little Owl and Barn Owl in the study area was low, probably because of interactions brought about by nesting in close proximity.",

Theft by chicks from neighbouring broods has rarely been quantified but may have similar reproductive consequences and the factors that influence it require further study. We took advantage of unusually diverse weather during the critical early stages of growth to elucidate the factors driving kleptoparasitic behavior of Common Tern Sterna hirundo chicks. Kleptoparasitism was restricted to misty days when large chicks were fed much smaller fish than on other days, inducing them to steal from neighbouring broods with young chicks. Our study indicates that kleptoparasitism by chicks could be a way to overcome shortfalls in parental provisioning, and may be a net cost of colonial breeding. Our results both provide evidence of a potential mechanism behind food-stealing by chicks and suggest hypotheses for future testing.",

One was a migratory, lower density, population in the Wielikąt complex of ponds, and the other was a population with a density about 20 times higher, at industrial reservoirs in the suburban landscape of Bytom-Rozbark. The migratory population (at Wielikąt) was characterized by the facts that it constituted only up to 4% of the breeding community of waterbirds; second broods were recorded only in isolated cases; and breeding losses amounted to 30% of which half were caused by predators, and the remainder mainly by waves. The other population (at Bytom-Rozbark) was characterized by the facts that; it constituted as much as 16% of the breeding community of waterbirds; breeding started earlier (75% of first broods were initiated in the first half of the breeding season); 30% of pairs went on to have second brood; and all breeding losses (15%) were exclusively the results of predation. The migratory population did not saturate the available habitat. Channels between the Wielikąt ponds were the optimal habitat Territories there were occupied earlier than in the ponds, and more pairs began breeding in the first half of the breeding season. The highest average clutch sizes and the largest eggs were also recorded there. It was shown that this species prefers channels and then small, shallow industrial reservoirs with a wide fringe of emergent vegetation and a high representation of Typha sp. because the inundation of nests, as a result of waves, did not occur there.",

After nest loss, Least Terns commonly renested and experienced 30% apparent nest success in 1995–1996 (n = 233 nests). Nest success and predation differed by location on the alkaline flat in 1995 and overall, but nest success and flooding did not differ by microhabitat type. Predation was highest at nests ≤ cm from debris (driftwood/hay) in 1995. No differences in nesting success, flooding, or predation were observed on comparing nests inside and outside electrified enclosures. Coyotes and Striped Skunks were confirmed nest predators, and Ring-billed Gulls were suspected nest predators. We identified one location on the alkaline flat of about 1 000 ha with consistently lower nest losses attributable to flooding and predation and the highest hatching success compared with other parts of the alkaline flat; it was typified by open ground and bisected by several creeks. Management activities that minimize flooding and predation in this area could further enhance nest success and theoretically increase overall productivity of this population of Least Terns. However, the efficacy of electrified enclosures and nest-site enhancements, as currently undertaken, is questionable because of considerable annual variation in use by and protection of Least Terns.",

Single birds were seen in nearly 39% of all 299 encounters, while the largest concentrations, between 16–28 individuals, accounted for 9%. 78% of all birds were observed on meadows flooded with communal wastewater. The remaining ones stayed around irrigation ditches (n = 172, 11.5%), sedimentation basins (n = 88, 5.9%) and reedbeds (n = 72, 4.8%). The mean size of the Water Pipit concentration was largest on the meadows (mean ± SE = 6.54 ± 0.50 individuals) and smallest at the sedimentation basins (mean = 1.44 ± 0.14). In this winter season (December-first half of March), rainfall enlarged numbers of birds to forage on the meadows, and the thickness of the snow cover was positively correlated with bird abundance at the sedimentation basins. The dominant available prey items inhabiting the warm wastewater were Diptera larvae (96%), 88% of which belonged to the genus Eristalis. The mean (± SD) invertebrate biomass was highest in the basin sediments (1.03 ± 1.14 g/dm3 of deposits), and lowest on the flooded meadows (0.20 ± 0.37 g/dm3 of deposits). The results point to the significance of the artificial environmental conditions created by warm sewage water, which enable the birds to remain largely independent of the weather and thus to overwinter in a cold region of central Europe.",

The mean distance between the hatching and parasitised nests was 0.9 ± 0.11 m (range 0.5–1.2).

There were differences with respect to threat postures with hybrids performing diagonal neck threats more often and intentional movements less often. This seems to be related to their hybrid origin, since Greylag Geese most often show diagonal neck and forward threat displays. There was no direct evidence for hybrid superiority or inferiority.",

Contrary to the hypothesis of density inflation in island populations, no indication of higher densities in Corsican Finches (0.6–2.1 pairs/10 ha) was found in comparison with Citril Finches (1.3 pairs/10 ha). In fact, population densities in the mainland population of the Catalan Pre-Pyrenees (7–10 pairs/10 ha) were extraordinarily high in comparison with all other study areas.",

Factors such as food limitation, availability of nesting sites or competition are not so important. Nest predation is usually more common along the edges of forests than in their interiors. The aim of this study was to determine how breeding losses in the secondary cavity-nester Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis that bred in natural holes varied with distance from the forest edge in primeval stands of the Białowieża National Park (NE Poland). A comparison of the breeding losses along the edges and in the interiors revealed no statistical differences. The main nest predators were the forest species Apodemus flavicollis, Martes martes. and Dendrocopos major. It is better to keep forest tracts unfragmented, with a belt of bushes and thickets or woodland in an early successional stage along the edge. This would protect forest birds from predators living in open habitats.",

In order to analyze body mass, the residual index (RI) was used because it corrects body mass related to body size. The mean RI value for males was negative during the whole breeding season and positive during autumn and winter and it did not vary greatly between the periods. In females, the mean RI was definitely greater during egg incubation compared to other periods. The RI value of females was higher than that of males during the egg incubation and large nestlings periods, showing no significant differences in other periods. Female Southern Grey Shrikes (but not males) fitted to the programmed anorexia hypothesis during the breeding season whereas in winter they did not increase their body mass, in clear contrast to what has been put forward in some theoretical models.",

The expression of this behavior can reduce the cost of foraging during the breeding season and ultimately this can be reflected in physiological parameters. Here we analyzed the relationship between the trophic strategy of Common Terns Sterna hirundo and two hormones, that are known to be involved in decision-making during the reproductive cycle and foraging activities: corticosterone (CORT) and prolactin (PRL). The study was conducted during the breeding seasons 2012–2014 at the Banter See colony in northern Germany where individuals with different foraging strategies were identified and monitored since 2008. We studied the concentration of hormones in two groups of birds: kleptoparasitic individuals i.e. individuals who steal the food captured by another individual, and honest individuals i.e. individuals who obtain the food on their own. Blood samples were obtained during the mid-incubation period using a non-invasive technique. Both hormones showed no significant relationship to each other. CORT concentration was similar in both groups of birds. However, the concentration of PRL was higher in parasitic than honest individuals in 2014. In addition, CORT modelling indicated a year effect (higher CORT in 2013), and PRL modelling indicated a significant effect of year (higher PRL in 2012) and a significant interaction between year and the trophic strategy in 2014. The results show no clear relationship between the feeding strategy and studied corticosterone and prolactin levels.",

The number of daily foraging observations was used as an index of bird abundance. The daily mean number of foraging observations for Parus major, P. caeruleus, P. palustris, Sitta europea, Certhia familiaris and Dendrocopos major was significantly higher in natural old-growth vs managed forest (ratio 4.8 : 1 for all six species pooled and 3.1 : 1, 3.2 : 1, 4.7 : 1, 5.7 : 1, 7.4 : 1 and 4.7 : 1 for the above-mentioned species, respectively). As the larger dominant species has an advantage in competition for nest holes, we would expect these to exhibit the smallest abundance ratio skews. This was not, however, the case and consequently, the results of this study do not support the hypothesis that a lack of nest holes should be the primary limiting factor for hole nesting species in managed forests. It was found that the species showing the strongest preference for foraging on dead wood were the same that had the most pronounced density skew between forest types. This could indicate that the lack of food resulting from silvicultural practice could be very important as a limiting factor in managed forests. Analyses of the use of dead wood of different diameter and from different tree species indicate that forest birds exploit diverse types of dead wood. Partially decayed standing dead wood was the most important substrate for the majority of species.",

Reed Warblers slightly preferred cattail to reed for nest building, but there were no differences in the number of successful and unsuccessful nests in these two vegetation types. Nest height above surface correlated significantly with the water depth, the old vegetation height, and the average reed stem diameter. It also rose slightly in the course of the breeding season. Reed stem thickness and reed density were significantly greater at nests than those in random samples in the reed vegetation. The clutch size decreased throughout the breeding season. Successful nests were situated closer to the open water than predated ones. The proportion of parasitized nests was greater in reed clumps than in homogeneous vegetation.

Egg mass explained a higher portion of the variability in young mass in nests of heavier females. Those females produced smaller young for eggs of a given size.

We observed the variation in bird abundance, assessed with the point count method, over a 25-year period (1993–2017) within two phytosociological facies of the hay-meadows in the lower Saône Valley (3.000 ha), eastern France: a meso-hygrophilic facies characterized by increasingly early mowing, and a hygrophilic facies mown later, with thereby a lower risk of nesting failure. At the beginning of the monitoring (1993–2001), birds were evenly distributed within the two facies. Later on, as more than 90% of meso-hygrophilic meadows were already mown by July 1, birds became more abundant in the hygrophilic facies. This trend was observed in each of the two most abundant species, the Whinchat Saxicola rubetra and the Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra. In two hygrophilic areas (55 and 76 ha) and two meso-hygrophilic areas (49 and 116 ha), passerine territories were mapped in 2011 with the territory mapping method and invertebrates were captured weekly on transects with colour plates and Barber traps. In spite of substantially higher invertebrate abundance, passerine territory density was lower in meso-hygrophilic study sites (6.4 territories/ 10 ha vs. 10.6). Within each study site however, captured invertebrates were more abundant in the areas selected by territorial birds. In fact, bird abundance estimated from point counts in 2011 varied negatively with the percentage mown by July 1 within a 200m-radius in 2010. This apparently adaptive behaviour leading to a selection of later mown fields seemed to be successful since bird abundance increased until 2010. However, after a succession of extreme climatic events (droughts, late floods), passerine abundance declined thereafter in both facies.",

    "abstract": "Female birds are exceptionally consistent in laying rather uniform and individually specific eggs, so that variation in eggs of individual females is low, while variation among females is high. Repeatability is a population-level parameter used in quantitative genetics to quantify the level of intraindividual consistency in relation to interindividual variation in phenotypic traits, in this case, the egg traits. The statistical measure of repeatability is intraclass correlation of particular egg traits clustered in clutches. This study is based on a long-term dataset on repeatabilities of the length, breadth, volume and shape of eggs of Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus investigated in two ecologically varying sites (an urban parkland versus a mature deciduous forest) around the city of Łódź, central Poland in 1999–2013. Coefficients of repeatability of egg length, breadth, volume and shape in the study populations of Blue Tits showed some variation between years and study sites, but were generally very high, on average 0.7 or more, and did not significantly differ between the traits within years. The observed differences between repeatabilities do not seem to be strongly associated with year-specific weather indicators for the first half of April. Only coefficients of variation in mean daily temperature influenced repeatabilities of egg length and breadth, whereas effects of mean temperature were non-significant. Repeatability of egg length in the forest and breadth in both sites increased with increasing variation in daily temperature, whereas repeatability of egg length in the urban park site showed a reverse relation with variation in temperature. Year-site-specific mean laying dates, clutch sizes and egg volumes, considered as indicators of breeding conditions, tended to negatively affect the repeatabilities. However, in general, repeatabilities of different egg traits were not consistent in their variation between years and sites, which suggests an important role of stochastic factors in shaping this variation. External factors that are able to force females to diversify traits of eggs in a particular laying sequence do not seem to directly result from the environmental conditions prevailing during a spring period critical for laying eggs in a population in a given year (the first half of April), but seem to be linked to more subtle aspects of variation in the conditions for egg laying, as shown by links with the mean values of basic breeding parameters.",

    "abstract": "For many birds breeding success may be related to the availability of nesting sites, particularly in ecologically specialized cavity-nesting birds. For burrow-nesting species, the selection of an appropriate substrate may be fundamental to a successful breeding attempt. The Lesser Crescent-chested Puffbird Malacoptila minor is a bucconid with a restricted distribution, which is found in the states of Maranhão and Piauí, in northeastern Brazil. It is the only bucconid listed as threatened with extinction, and little is known about its natural history. A total of 49 nests were found over three breeding seasons (2017–2020). Nests consist of burrows dug in the ground that are used only once for breeding. Incubation lasted 21.2 ± 1.3 days and the nestlings fledged after 19.5 ± 2.9 days. The nests contained two or three eggs. The mean hatching rate was 0.46 ± 0.47 eggs per nest and the fecundity rate was 1.0 fledgling per female. The production was 0.53 fledglings per nest, apparent reproductive success was 22.4% (N = 49), and was 15.7% (N = 49) when based on Mayfield's protocol. The probability of breeding success per period was greater during the incubation phase than during the nestling phase. Predation was identified as the principal cause of nest failure (77.5%), mainly during the incubation phase. Three predators were identified: the Crab-eating Fox Cerdocyon thous, the fire ant Solenopsis saevissima, and a lizard, the Common Tegu Salvator merianae. Breeding season starts with the onset of rainy season and nest flooding did not appear to be a concern, which contrasts with the available data on other bucconids. The results of the present study are the first data on the breeding biology of the Lesser Crescent-chested Puffbird, and represent an important advance in the understanding of breeding patterns in the Bucconidae.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of the conservation status of a species is the first step to prevent local extinction and to plan appropriate, effective and scientifically sound conservation actions, hence knowledge of the distribution, population trends and characteristics of preferred habitat is crucial for the conservation of a species. Galliformes are facing increasing threats related to overhunting, habitat loss and fragmentation, and human disturbance. The Sicilian Rock Partridge (hereafter Rock Partridge) Alectoris graeca whitakeri is a significant conservation unit endemic to Sicily (Italy) classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN due to a decreasing population. Few studies have been conducted on the occurrence and population density of this subspecies. Here, we estimated its population density and identified which habitat factors drive the occurrence of this species on Mt. Etna. We used a combination of sampling methods (species-specific play-back calls, distance sampling, camera-trapping) to collect count and presence/absence data, which were then integrated into a single habitat model (presence vs. absence). We obtained 24 responses from play-back calls (plus 8 individuals observed while performing the play-back calls), 8 sightings from distance sampling, 6 detections from camera-trapping. Probability of occurrence of Rock Partridge on Mt. Etna was positively driven by shrub and meadow vegetation, whereas its occurrence decreased with an increase in both woody areas (coniferous and deciduous) and elevation. Population density estimated using play-back call data resulted in 0.80 pairs/km2 (95% CI: 0.17–2.22) over an area of 53.7 km2. The density of Rock Partridge on Mt. Etna appeared to have slightly declined and its distribution undergone a contraction since the previous survey. Several potential threats to the Rock Partridge in Sicily are currently increasing and should be mitigated to ensure the long-term survival of this unique population on Mt. Etna, as well as in the whole island of Sicily.",

This is especially true for the Białowieża forest, NE Poland. The biogeographical history of emblematic forest clades of birds, e.g. woodpeckers, tits and nuthatches, is analyzed from molecular phylogenies which allow to determine their pace and mode of origination and differentiation. The flyways which connect temperate and tropical realms played a major role in the origination and differentiation of many extant lineages. Then, large differences in the structure of bird communities between North American and European forests are discussed and explained in the light of the geographic configuration of major land masses and past climatic changes and upheavals throughout the Neogene. From long term in depth studies in this forest, the composition and structure of bird communities may be used as references for understanding and measuring the processes and mechanisms of change in communities of the western managed forests.",

    "abstract": "The Baillon's Crake Zapornia (Porzana) pusilla is considered as one of the least known Rallidae species of the Palaearctic. Very little information exists about its ecological requirements and knowledge on diet refers to very few observations. Based on the analysis of faecal samples (N = 59) from two study sites in Djoudj National Park (NW Senegal), we describe the major diet components and examine how seasonal and environmental factors influence its dietary composition. All faeces contained remains of invertebrates. Coleopterans were the most frequent prey items with an occurrence in 95% of the samples. Other important food items were: Odonata (82%), Aranaea (78%), Nematocera (59%), and Brachycera (44%). Remains of gecko skin were the only evidence for vertebrate prey. 75% of the faeces contained plant matter, especially seeds of Eleocharis mutata which constituted in some individuals > 90% of the sample content. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to assess whether occurrence of prey items was an effect of selection or environmental variation, considering both consumed items as well as prey availability. Sweep netting was used to provide an estimate of relative abundance of potential invertebrate prey.Despite pronounced seasonal changes in temperature and humidity, models revealed a lower influence of meteorological variables on prey composition and availabilty. Rather we found water level, date and site having the highest impact in the models. In contrast to decreasing diversity of available food items in the course of the season, diversity in the faeces remained constant indicating Baillon's Crakes prey less selectively when resources diminish. Furthermore, diversity of Baillon's Crakes' diet was lower at higher water levels, suggesting stronger selectivity when prey abundances are high as implied by positive relationships of several invertebrate groups with water level. Despite the rapidly declining water levels and decreasing abundances of e.g. Nematocera, Odonata and Mollusca in the course of the season, we found no clear shift from aquatic to a more terrestrial dominated composition of taxa in the birds' diet. This might be due to the selection of profitable prey such as araneans or molluscs but could also be explained by better accessibility due to physical changes in the habitats e.g in the case of consumed Odonata and Saltatoria. High disintegration of invertebrates in the faeces rendered quantification of prey items impossible. Biomass estimates could support the assessment of specialization of the Baillon's Crakes as well as the detection of seasonal succession of the wetlands' biotic communities.",

We investigated brood patch development of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus in Isla Quiroga, Argentina, during 2012–2013. Here, we evaluate if brood patch development (in a narrow sense i.e. increase of the brood patch area and temperature measured with an electronic probe thermometer) varies according to laying date of the eggs, and with respect to adults' body condition and size, total clutch volume, and/or the sex of the adults. We found that brood patch temperature reaches its maximum when egg laying is finished, while brood patch area is fully developed starting from the end of the first quarter of the incubation period. The later the penguins started to breed the warmer the initial brood patches — when first egg is laid. Besides, the incubation period was shorter in penguins breeding late. Furthermore, adults in a good body condition had cooler initial brood patches than adults with poor body condition. In contrast, total clutch volume, body size index, and sex of the adults were not related to brood patch development. We conclude that initial brood patch temperature in Magellanic Penguins is associated with environmental factors, like laying date, and physiological attributes, like body condition.",

    "abstract": "Waterbirds are declining globally due to different threats that affect their abundance and shift both their breeding and wintering ranges. Cormorants disperse over vast distances during winter and are suitable indicators of the impacts of human-wildlife interactions and abiotic factors. During wintering periods, Pygmy Cormorants Microcarbo pygmaeus use regular roosts where they overnight on suitable perches, a refuge from adverse weather conditions and disturbances. Our study aimed to determine the wintering population size of the Pygmy Cormorant and its dynamics across 23-years (1996–2019) at seven roosting sites in the Maritsa River valley, Southern Bulgaria. This is a critical site for the species conservation where 3065–8180 birds are wintering annually. The wintering Pygmy Cormorant population showed a tendency to increase between 1996 and 2019 (λ = 1.03 ± 0.001). Each year Pygmy Cormorants were most abundant in December (mean ± SE, 2609 ± 185 individuals), while the lowest numbers were recorded in March (1207 ± 106). Pygmy Cormorants aggregated to roost between 4:00 PM and 5:30 PM throughout the study. The area of wintering foraging habitat of the Pygmy Cormorant increased significantly across all roosting sites in the study period from 2675.97 ha to 22564.35 ha. The number of Pygmy Cormorants at the roost was positively affected by the drop in the daily air mean temperatures and the decrease of the day length. Despite the global population increase, the Pygmy Cormorant faces a high risk of human-induced mortality during wintering and is thus regionally classified as endangered.",

The general breeding biology of the White-throated Dipper is known well, but only a few studies have focused on survival and dispersal during the post-fledging period. In this study we report on results revealed by radio-telemetry, a method which has not been used in the species to date. Nestlings (37 individuals from 9 nests) in a mountain population of central Slovakia were radio-tagged on the mean expected fledging age (22 days post-hatch) and monitored daily until death, disappearance or reaching independence. Only 22–32% (depending on the handling of uncertain data) of fledglings survived the first 12 days post-fledging. Predation was the most frequently suspected cause of death. The daily survival rate was markedly lower during the first two days after fledging (0.717–0.758) than later (0.914–0.941). The daily movement distance remained stable during the first week post-fledging and increased around the age of reaching independence (c. 12 days post-fledging). On the other hand, the distance from the natal nest and the within-brood distance (length of river occupied by fledglings from the same nest) increased gradually since fledging. We propose that in our study population the low post-fledging survival could be potentially balanced by frequent renesting and/or double-brooding, timing of which corresponds well with the age of reaching independence when juvenile birds disperse outside the natal territory.",

In this study we analyse the reproductive ecology of two species of Recurvirostridae, Black-winged Stilts Himantopus himantopus (more numerous) and Pied Avocets Recurvirostra avosetta (less numerous), nesting in an unstable habitat of the Saharan wetland of Chott Ain El Beida, Algeria, North Africa. The onset of egg laying was more stable and similar between years in Black-winged Stilts (15–19 April, on average, N = 315) than in Pied Avocets (13–21 April, on average, N = 73). Black-winged Stilts and Pied Avocets showed opposite yearly trends in egg laying dates. Clutches composed of 4 eggs dominated in both these species. They did not differ in hatching success of complete clutches (on average 73% and 77%, respectively). Average weights of eggs decreased from year to year during 2005–2007, suggesting that the individual quality of breeding birds decreased over the study years, probably corresponding with the progressive deterioration of the habitat. In the Black-winged Stilt, but not in the Pied Avocet, egg sizes decreased with the progress of the laying period. Another difference between egg-related aspects of the breeding ecology of these species was that only in Black-winged Stilts egg shape tended to affect hatching success of clutches, so that clutches of more elongated eggs had higher hatchability. To conclude, some aspects of breeding performance of waders may have a different form even in closely related species, depending on changing ecological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Birds defend territories by engaging in potentially costly behaviours, such as vocalizations and aggressive interactions. Songs are usually good proxies of individual quality, thus could help guarantee access and exclusivity to food, sexual partners and nesting sites. We described territorial and vocal behaviours of the Riverbank Warbler Myiothlypis rivularis, a year-round territorial wood-warbler (family Parulidae), and tested for relationships between territory size and individuals' vocal attributes. From October 2018 to April 2019, we banded 14 males and 9 females in the Atlantic Forest of south Brazil. We estimated territory sizes of nine pairs and recorded 10 and 5.4 h of 9 males and 6 females vocalizations, respectively. In male songs, a tradeoff between trill rate and frequency bandwidth indicates mechanical vocal constraints in the production of both parameters. Territory size did not relate to male song parameters, which could signal individual, rather than territorial, quality. However, females with broader bandwidth songs occupied smaller territories. Although the reduced sample size, which precludes generalization, this result may be a first indication of female song acting on territoriality in this species. Overall, this work presents new data on Riverbank Warbler and contributes to the knowledge on vocal tradeoffs in male songs and both male and female territorial behavior for wood-warblers. In addition, we highlight the need for further studies focused on female song, which like male song could be associated with territory defense.",

    "abstract": "Several bird species show differential migration in relation to age and/or sex classes, often associated with morphological and behavioural differences. The Western Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus is a partial migrant, showing a strong sexual dimorphism in size. This species migrates on a broad front, undertaking long water crossings through the Mediterranean Sea. In this study we carried out a two-year survey on the pre-breeding migration of this species at three sites located in the Central Mediterranean region: the islands of Ustica and Panarea (Tyrrhenian Sea) and the Strait of Messina (Peloritani Mountains). The aim of this study was to analyse the flight strategies of this broad front migrant in relation to wind patterns, such as in relation to different sex and age classes. Our results revealed differential flight behaviours among harriers belonging to different sex classes, with adult females less attracted to islands than adult males during a sea crossing, and adult males reaching higher altitude early in the season along a mountain chain. It is suggested that adult males, thanks to their smaller size, use to a larger extent soaring flight by exploiting even weak thermals en route. Unlike the Tyrrhenian islands, few immatures were seen passing along the Peloritani Mountains, probably because they fly at lower altitudes over mainland, passing over areas where they can eventually find prey and/or rest at stop-over site en route. In conclusion, our study shows that the location of the observation post can affect the result concerning migration survey of both sex and age classes in this species, leading to evident bias.",

The reconstructed rib cage is compatible with some levels of the airsac ventilation mechanics. The reconstructed segmental position (relative to the vertebral column) of the shoulder girdle at the level of 11th or 12th vertebra agrees with evidence from both modern birds and theropods. The wing must have been largely folded in the resting position, but the geometry and mechanism of wing folding remain conjectural.

Throughout the 1980s House Martin numbers increased continuously over the whole area, the greatest population density being 4.6 occupied nests per 10 ha. The number of breeding pairs in the city centre was stable, and the density there varied from 2.1 to 3.0 occupied nests per 10 ha. The highest density of occurrence was recorded in the new housing estates, where increases in the House Martin population were recorded. These was related to the construction of new buildings, which provided fresh nesting sites. The nests were built at heights from the first to the fifteenth storey. Over 96% of the nests in the housing estates were built in the corners of the window openings. In the entire study area the preferred nesting sites were on the southern (35.2%), northern (26.1%) and eastern (13.3%) sides of buildings. In the city centre the greatest number of nests had south-facing entrances, while in one of the other study plots, the entrances to most nests faced north. No more than 7% of the total number of martins' nests available in a given year were occupied by Passer domesticus.",

Multiple regression of relative fitness on tarsus length, bill height and forearm length, revealed significant phenotypic selection on male forearm length and female bill height. However, nestling mortality during the bad weather depended on their age, which suggested breeding date as a focal trait for selection. The multiple regression analysis of relative fitness on both body traits and hatching date shows that in males only breeding date was significantly related to fitness, and selection on forearm resulted from correlation of forearm with hatching date. A similar analysis in females shows that both bill height and timing of hatching were equally related to fitness, therefore in this sex both bill height and date of hatching were focal traits for selection.",

    "abstract": "An abundant resident in Israel, the Graceful Warbler breeds in the northern and central parts of the country and has recently invaded desert areas following their human settlement. Possible seasonal changes in age and sex structure were investigated, as were differences in body measurements in individual sex and age classes as well as changes in the numbers of the Graceful Warbler population in Eilat. No difference was recorded between spring and autumn in the proportion of males to females, nor were significant differences found in the numbers of males and females ringed during the spring and autumn seasons. There was a significant difference in the proportion of juvenile to adult birds trapped in spring and in autumn. Moreover, males had longer wings than females in both seasons. There were no differences in body mass or body condition between sexes in the two seasons. Furthermore, adults had longer wings than first-year birds. Juveniles had longer wings in autumn than in spring, but no differences were recorded in the adults in this respect. In addition, juveniles were in better condition in spring than in autumn; however, there was no difference in body condition of the adults between seasons. The fact that a significant trend was found in the numbers of Graceful Warblers trapped in spring but no such trend in autumn, that a large proportion of recaptured birds were noted in both seasons, and that a high number of individual birds were caught repeatedly during the study period, suggests the existence of a stable or increasing breeding population in Eilat all the year round. In addition, the Bird Sanctuary is like an oasis in the desert environs of Eilat. Hence, the lack of differences among the years in the proportions of males and females between the seasons suggests that it is mainly breeding pairs that occupy the area.",

    "abstract": "Citizen science (i.e. monitoring or research schemes with volunteer participation in data collection) is becoming an increasingly used tool that may yield reliable estimates of species distribution ranges. In 2017 and 2018, we assessed the fine-grain distribution and habitat use of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker in the Basque Country (N Spain) by combining two citizen science approaches: opportunistic observations gathered from internet collaborative databases, and standardised records collected by volunteers trained with a species-specific fieldwork protocol. Six out of the thirty-four opportunistic observations were located out of previously known distribution ranges. Because the reliability of those observations was difficult to assess, opportunistic observations should be validated to avoid false positives. As for the species-specific approach, Middle Spotted Woodpecker occurrence was examined by conducting itineraries with point counts and audio-stimulation, sampled twice during the pre-breeding season, in 95 UTM units of 1 km2. Woodpeckers were recorded in 29 of those units. In combination with recent species-specific studies, our results show that Middle Spotted Woodpeckers occurred mainly in a core, continuous range (69 positive units in and around the Izki forest) and in two smaller ranges (6 units in Montes de Vitoria and 5 units in Sierra de Entzia). Out of previously known distribution ranges, the species-specific approach showed that woodpecker occurrence was negatively affected by the distance to the core Izki forest and, to a lesser extent, positively influenced by the tree basal area of the forest stand. While the species-specific fieldwork approach allowed to improve the delineation of distribution ranges and the assessment of habitat use, the opportunistic approach pointed out to overlooked ranges but showed limited efficacy to assess the fine-grain distribution of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker.",

    "abstract": "Migratory birds have evolved the ability to accumulate fat reserves to fuel their migratory journeys. However, increased fuel load leads to an increased body mass, which is expected to impair flight performance and increase predation risk. Results of previous research are contradictory, with some studies reporting detrimental effects of fat load on flight performance, while others showing no such influences. Furthermore, no studies have investigated the relationship between fat load and flight performance in obligate aerial insectivores, which are known to accumulate only moderate fat loads while migrating overland and not crossing wide ecological barriers such as oceans or deserts. In this study we investigated the inter-individual variation in short-term flight performance (flight manoeuvrability, velocity and acceleration) in juvenile Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica in relation to fat load in Poland (central Europe), during the initial stages of autumn southward migration. We evaluated individual swallow fat loads by means of a Total Body Electrical Conductivity (TOBEC) scanner. In order to evaluate short-term flight performance in a standardised manner we used flight tunnels. We controlled statistically for the independent effect of wing morphology, which can be expected to influence flight performance. Juvenile fat loads were on average 7.5% (range 0.2–20.5) of lean body mass, but we found no negative effect of the fat mass on short-term flight performance traits. Individuals with larger fat mass reached higher velocity compared to leaner ones, which is in line with theoretical expectations. However, fat mass did not significantly predict flight manoeuvrability or acceleration. The results indicate that relatively small fat loads accumulated by juvenile Barn Swallows during overland migration do not impair short-term flight performance.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization presents wildlife with many novel environmental challenges and opportunities, including navigating new physical structures and exploiting unique food bases. Thus, animal species that persist or thrive in urban environments may have superior cognitive abilities that allow them to navigate and solve anthropogenic problems. Prior studies have shown neural and behavioral differences between animals inhabiting urban and rural environments, but few have tested cognition-related behavioral responses of animals in an urban context. We administered a novel foraging challenge to caged male House Finches Haemorhous mexicanus — a successful urban and native desert species in the southwestern United States — captured from two urban and two rural locations to examine population differences in problem solving. This task involved opening a tin lid that was slid over the bird's normal small food dish and left only slightly ajar (with no food visible). Male House Finches display exaggerated, sexually selected plumage color that is dependent on diet, so we also tested the hypothesis that more colorful males can better solve foraging problems. We found no differences in problem solving success between urban and rural birds. However, among rural birds, we found that redder males were more likely to solve the foraging task than less-red males. Also, birds that lost more mass during the study were more likely to solve the task, but this was only true among less colorful birds. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that plumage redness reveals foraging skill in House Finches found in their native environment.",

    "abstract": "The Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius is a highly polytypic bird species composed of 34–36 subspecies. The contribution of formation of glacial refugia to the evolutionary process that generated its tremendous diversity has not been studied. We investigated the contribution of microrefugia to the subspeciation process of the Eurasian Jay in the Japanese archipelago. By assessing genetic diversity and reconstructing a mitochondrial phylogenetic tree, we asked whether divergence of a subspecies on a peripheral island (Sado Island) from the subspecies on the mainland of the Japanese archipelago (Honshu and Kyushu, hereafter mainland) occurred via formation of a microrefugium outside the mainland macrorefugia. We also assessed morphological differences between the Sado Island and mainland jay populations. We tested whether the observed morphological differences can be explained by adaptation of the Sado Island population to a species-poor microrefugium. Genetic analyses inferred that the Sado Island population survived in a refugium outside the mainland macrorefugia from around the late Middle to Late Pleistocene. The morphology of the Sado Island jay population was characterized by greater trait variance, larger body size, and a disproportionately large bill when compared with the mainland population. These results are consistent with the expected patterns of morphological evolution in microrefugia with reduced species diversity. We suggest the importance of ecological release in a microrefugium on Sado Island for the evolution of geographical variation of the Eurasian Jay in the Japanese archipelago. This is the first study to assess the significance of microrefugia for the diversification of the Eurasian Jay.",

Independently of periods, individuals recovered as immatures had longer dispersal distance than those recovered as adults. Our study revealed that proportion of recoveries representing strong natal fidelity (within the distance of ≤ 38 km around the natal colony, N = 37, 51.4%) differed significantly between the studied periods with the highest proportion (71%) in 1981–2014 and lower proportions in periods 1932–1939 (35%) and 1940–1980 (27%). We also found that the distance of dispersal from the natal colony was affected significantly by the period, with the distance in 1980–2014 being significantly shorter compared to 1940–1980 and with a tendency to be shorter than in 1932–1939. Direction of dispersal from the natal colony was affected significantly neither by period nor age of recovered birds. On average Grey Herons dispersed with a marked SW directional component. Our results indicate that Central European population of Grey Herons have shortened average distance of dispersal from the natal colony since the 1930s. This observation is concordant with changes reported for other European waterbirds.",

    "abstract": "Changes in biometric characteristics of a migrating bird population at a given capture site could reflect that the migration strategies of the species may be changing. A robust data set (15,520 records) was used to analyse the changes in biometric characteristics of the Eurasian Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla in western Hungary between August and October during the study period (2001–2019). All age and sex classes displayed similar phenology of monthly captures and biometric change: the average wing length, fat score and body mass increased in the migrating population from August to October. This could be explained by changes in the morphometric distribution of different migrating populations, in later months more birds might arrive from a larger distance, primarily from the Baltic regions and the Czech Republic. The biometrics of juvenile birds captured in August did not change significantly from 2001 to 2019, while the wing lengths decreased and fat scores increased significantly between 2001 and 2019 in September and October in both sex classes. This could be explained by a change in the migration distance or different morphology of individuals from the north which stopped over at the study area. Due to the global warming and habitat changes in the last decade, the shorter migration route and favourable conditions at overwintering areas north of the Sahara or around the Mediterranean could favour Blackcaps which migrate a shorter distance.",

The subject of our study were Chaffinches captured in Masurian Lake region (NE Poland) from 1996 to 1998. Each bird caught was visually examined for the presence of ticks. Birds' droppings and small volumes of birds' blood were collected in order to ascertain the presence of coccidia and blood parasites. Additionally the presence of bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi - the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in birds' blood was measured with the nested-polymerase chain reaction method. In total amount of 225 Chaffinches were captured. 44% of them were infested by ticks belonging to Ixodes ricinus species (larvae and nymphs) only. Coccidia from genus Isospora were found in 80% (n = 35) of birds. Protozoans from genus Haemoproteus were ascertained in 53% (n = 59) of Chaffinches and bacteria B. burgdorferi was found in 12.7% (n = 166) of the birds. Three groups of parasites (I. ricinus, Isospora sp., Haemoproteus sp.) were found together in 26% (n = 38) of Chaffinches whereas only 5% of the birds had no parasite infection.",

From among 315 clutches of Tree Sparrows studied, 20 exhibited one-day interruptions in the laying of first and second broods, while 2 were characterised by two-day interruptions. Amongst third broods, there was just a single one-day interruption noted in each year of the study. Interruptions did not occur immediately prior to the laying of the last egg in a clutch. Only in the case of the first brood in 1995 could a period of cold account for interruptions; in the remaining cases, the phenomenon must have been influenced by non-meteorological factors. The Tree Sparrow resembles the House Sparrow Passer domesticus in having far fewer interruptions to laying than other small hole-nesting birds, such as tits Parus spp. This is probably a reflection of the genus Passer having evolved in dry areas, where the accumulation of body reserves in the female prior to laying is an adaptation reducing the length of the breeding period to match the time associated with the rainy season, when food is abundant.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection is generally thought to be weak in cooperative breeding species, largely because polygamous mating patterns that drive sexual selection can erode the kin-selected benefits of cooperation. Social selection, on the other hand, is expected to be strong among cooperative species especially because of the intense competition over status and resource access. In support of this view, several studies have shown monogamous mating and little sex difference in cooperative species. However, most previous studies have focused on species with relatively simple social systems and few studies have examined how mating patterns, social organization and ecological attributes have influenced the evolution of ornamentation in cooperative species. Here I used secondary data to examine several hypotheses and shed some light on how social and sexual selection influenced the evolution of phenotypic sex traits in cooperatively breeding birds. Despite the broad assumption that cooperative breeding species are monomorphic, results demonstrate that sex differences and the presence of ornamentation are widely spread in the group. Stable environments with higher precipitation are associated to the strongest differences between sexes. Results indicate that although extrapair matings and environment attributes are determinant to the evolution of sex differences, males and females of cooperative species seem to be more alike than their non-cooperative counterparts. The extent of mutual ornamentation found in cooperative species indicates that the combination of both sexual and social selection are imperative to determine how evolution has shaped phenotypic attributes in cooperative species.",

Still, comparatively fewer efforts are conducted in areas of low species richness, such as deserts. We estimated avian species richness and occurrence in response to environmental factors and anthropogenic activity in Aldesa Valley, Saudi Arabia. Because of the presence of permanent water and associated vegetation in the valley, this region is suitable to support high biodiversity. During a two-year study, we divided the valley into 40, 250 m-segments and used time area-searches from May 10 to August 10 in 2014 and 2015 to estimate bird species richness and occurrence. We used generalized linear models to assess drivers of species richness. We analyzed the local distributions of the six most commonly detected bird species: House Sparrow Passer domesticus, Laughing Dove Spilopelia senegalensis, Tristram's Starling Onychognathus tristramii, White-spectacled Bulbul Pycnonotus xanthopygos, Palestine Sunbird Cinnyris osea, and Sinai Rosefinch Carpodacus synoicus using occupancy modeling. We recorded 24 avian species belonging to 18 families and seven orders. Observed species richness was positively correlated with search duration, segment area, and extent of herbaceous coverage. Ecological covariates influential in determining occupancy varied across commonly-observed species. Tristram's Starling selected for sand areas, unlike the House Sparrow who appeared to avoid sand and rocky areas. Palestine Sunbird occupancy was positively correlated with herbaceous cover types. Species detectability was overall positively correlated with search duration. House Sparrow's detectability was negatively correlated with tree canopy area. Signs of anthropogenic activities (such as number of vehicles, people, and domestic animals) affected detectability for species differently e.g. positively for House Sparrow and negatively for Palestine Sunbird.",

    "abstract": "Nesting is a prerequisite for breeding in a wide range of birds, and nest-sites become a key resource ultimately influencing individual fitness. In that context, reuse of nest-sites by breeding pairs has been observed in a variety of bird species. White-collared Swifts Streptoprocne zonaris constitute one example in which reuse of nest-sites from previous reproductive seasons has been reported. In this study we explored this behaviour in the main location of the species in Cuba, the natural area of Topes de Collantes (south-central Cuba), where breeding pairs occupy several natural rocky caves. We also studied nest-sites locations to identify determinants for reuse and followed nest content to quantify nesting success. During a three-year period of study, 82 nests were constructed in 67 nest-sites at three nesting colonies located at the area. Nest-sites were occupied in the four placement-location combinations at the caves: ceiling-hole, ceiling-ledge, wall-hole and wall-ledge, and were located at a height range of 0.90 to 9 m. A total of 31 nest-sites were reused at least once, which implies an incidence of nest-site reuse for the area of 46.3%. Nest-site reuse was related to characteristics of the nest-site location: reused nest-sites were less often observed at the ceiling-ledge combination as well as at the highest locations in the caves. Nesting success was measured as success in producing at least one fledgling, and was higher in reused (87.1%) than in not-reused (59.5%) nest-sites. These results confirm the existence of some benefits of nest-site reuse in the Cuban populations of the White-collared Swift, suggesting that the high quality breeding pairs might detect and select particular nest-sites to guarantee a successful breeding. This study also highlights that conservation of the caves and their natural characteristics at the natural area of Topes de Collantes is key for the Cuban populations of the species.",

Woodpeckers (Picidae), despite raising young in tree cavities that are safer from predators, should orient the entrances of their nest cavities in a direction that results in a favorable cavity microclimate. Because Picid nest cavity orientation is not well-studied in the Pacific Northwest of North America, we measured nest cavity orientation of White-headed Dryobates albolarvatus, Hairy D. villosus, and Black-backed Picoides arcticus Woodpeckers, Northern Flicker Colaptes auratus, and Williamson's Sapsucker Sphyrapicus thyroideus within burned and unburned, dry conifer forests of the eastern Cascade Range in Washington, USA (N = 684). Each woodpecker species had a mean angle of nest cavity orientation in a northerly or easterly direction and ranged from 12.3° for the Northern Flicker to 117.6° for the Black-backed Woodpecker. Hairy Woodpeckers, Northern Flickers, and White-headed Woodpeckers showed strong evidence for nonrandom nest cavity orientation, and Northern Flickers showed particularly high dispersion with a multimodal distribution of cavity orientations. Although the mean and variance of cavity orientations did not differ substantially between woodpeckers, cavity orientation differed based on nest tree species. Woodpeckers may orient their nest cavities in an easterly direction so that cavities warm quicker in the morning, to avoid hot afternoon temperatures and prevailing west and north westerly winds, and because the majority of cavities were located in burned forest where shading from canopy cover is reduced.",

A few nest-boxes were taken over by wasps, hornets, squirrels and a bat. Particular bird species preferred different types of nest-box. Significant relationships were found between the occupation of a nest-box and the nature of the park, the density of trees near the nest-box, its concealment among the branches, its inclination and cleaning. No relationship was found between nest-box site and the density of shrubs nearby or the direction which the entry hole faced.",

    "abstract": "The Superb Lyrebird is a sexually dimorphic passerine that although is not considered endangered, it has been declining in population size since the 1940s due primarily to urban development. Recent reports suggest that lyrebirds may be threatened by chlamydial infection. We studied levels of faecal infection by two microparasites in lyrebirds: Chlamydophila psittaci and Escherichia coli in the Sherbrooke Forest, south-eastern Australia. Fresh faecal samples were obtained from 33 lyrebirds (15 adult females, 13 adult males and 5 juveniles) — estimated of 27.5% of the population, all of them tested negative to Ch. psittaci. E. coli prevalence was compared between adult males and females and no difference was found. This result is expected, for instance, if E. coli is sexually transmitted and lyrebirds are promiscuous. Trends for juveniles to be more parasitized than adults were detected, but they were statistically not significant. Behavioural analyses of video footage indicate that E. coli infected birds did not allocate more or less time to any of the activities considered than did non infected birds. This might suggest that E. coli infection in lyrebirds is relatively benign, and behavioural effects may thus be subtle. No significant differences were found in specific measurements of foraging behaviour but non infected birds tended to scratch more frequently than infected birds.",

Therefore, it is important to know the habits of these birds during the period of raising chicks. The habitat use, movements and home range sizes of partridges rearing their chicks up to three weeks old were studied in western Poland in the years 1995–2001. Twenty one pairs with chicks were localized daily by radiotracking. The partridge broods mostly used cereals (54.4% of their locations), but permanent wild vegetation (19.6%) turned out to be preferred. Most locations (56.8%) took place up to 10 m from field edges. The average distance of daily movements was 160 m (range 0–890 m) and was shorter in the diversified landscape of small fields than in the simplified landscape of large fields. The area of home ranges (100% MCP) during the first three weeks of chick's life averaged 12.0 ha (range 2.9–34.1 ha) and no significant differences were found between the two field types. The size of home ranges decreased with the proportion of cereals and wild vegetation in the regions where individual broods occurred. It was concluded that large-scale crop fields create worse living conditions for Grey Partridge broods than more diverse small fields.",

    "abstract": "Studies on nest-site selection can reveal aspects of habitat requirements of the target species, and can be useful to infer about how habitat changes can affect local populations. The Helmeted Manakin, Antilophia galeata, is a piprid that inhabits mainly the humid gallery forests that occur along watercourses of the savanna-like Cerrado biome from central South America, and like most tropical forest understory passerines, it is poorly known under a nest-site selection perspective. Here we provide nest-site selection assessment based on nine variables for a population of the Helmeted Manakin from southeast Brazil. We found that females strongly selected Miconia nervosa (Melastomataceae) as a nesting plant species. Further, we demonstrated that the presence of nests was positively associated with canopy cover and with the occurrence of the endangered jussara palm trees, Euterpe edulis. These results suggest that the Helmeted Manakin is specialized in reproducing in mature and well-preserved gallery forest tracts. Gallery forests are narrow stripes of riparian vegetation from the endangered Cerrado domain, and here we showed that even in these linear habitats, the Helmeted Manakin can seek for specific portions for nesting. This is one of the few studies reporting nest-site specialization in a Neotropical forest-dwelling passerine.",

    "abstract": "Long-term breeding bird censuses in Białowieża National Park (BNP), north-east Poland, have revealed rather low densities of birds and high community stability which may be features of near-natural forest conditions. This paper reports on a long-term census of breeding birds in 50 ha of oak woodland in central England which contained both managed and undisturbed areas. New information is provided on breeding bird density and its spatial variation within English mature broadleaved woodland to address two questions: Under what circumstances are English woods likely to support higher densities than those occurring in BNP? Is there evidence that population and community stability is lower in English woodland? The overall bird density was lower than in the BNP oak-hornbeam stands, at the scale of both the whole study area and the undisturbed stands. Densities of three of the five dominant species (Cyanistes caeruleus, Parus major, Troglodytes troglodytes) were lower in BNP, Fringilla coelebs was higher, while Erithacus rubecula was similar. Within the undisturbed stands, densities of seven of 12 species, including T. troglodytes, were similar to those in BNP, two were considerably higher (C. caeruleus, P. major) and one much lower (F. coelebs). Selection of the external woodland edge by several species resulted in relatively high overall densities in the edge zone. The broad composition of the bird community remained fairly stable with the exception of declines in tropical migrants and increases in shrub layer nesters. Temporal abundance patterns of species showed much individuality. Trends of several species appeared to be driven by changes in habitat structure. However, the same species remained numerically dominant or characteristic of the wood throughout the study period. This suggests there was a core of resilient species, much as proposed for BNP. Although caution is needed in drawing conclusions from a single site, with the exception of a small number of species, in recent decades there is unlikely to have been a general pattern of higher densities of birds in English woodland than in BNP. However, some English woods with highly complex vegetation structures, or a high proportion of edge habitat, do have exceptionally high densities (> 100 territories/10 ha).",

    "abstract": "A large part of European forests is managed using modern forestry techniques, and it is interesting to explore the relationships between forest bird abundance and variables describing the forests from the perspective of forest managers. The aim of our study was to identify these relationships through nation-wide bird monitoring and forestry data in Czechia. After controlling for the effect of altitude, the forest characteristics that exhibited a significant effect on the abundance in the highest number of species are the proportion of conifers, growth phase and tree damage. In the next step, we performed a principal component analysis to reveal general patterns in those species-specific responses. The main gradient obtained was determined by altitude and discriminated species associated with lowland forests (e.g. Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata) from those associated with highland forests (e.g. Red Crossbill Loxia curvirostra, Tree Pipit Anthus trivialis). This suggests an important role of altitudinal climate zones in shaping forest bird abundance. The second gradient showed a cluster of species with higher abundance in broad-leaved forests with higher stem density, more vegetation layers, and more damaged (e.g. Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, European Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca). At the opposite end were clustered species with higher abundance in more coniferous forests, lower stem density, fewer vegetation layers and less damaged (e.g. Eurasian Siskin Spinus spinus, Crested Tit Lophophanes cristatus). The second gradient can be explained by forestry practices applied in Czechia. Specifically, broad-leaved forests generally have a longer logging cycle compared to coniferous forests, resulting in generally older stands exhibiting more signs of damage and multiple vegetation layers, while coniferous forests predominantly maintain a single-vegetation layer structure. Bird association with growth phase was independent from altitude and other forest characteristics.",

All these forests show a high degree of naturality since they appeared as a result of natural restoration. A total of 47 species of birds were noted, out of which 41 are breeding in this area.

Majority of species, also the dominant ones, attain a somewhat higher density in the National Park than in the remaining part of Bialowieza Forest.

Species number was evaluated using point counts on six plots localised in Polish and German farmland (from 30-52 points/plot, 10 min/point, radius - 100 or 150 m). The equation: S = cAz, where S - species number, A - sample size (number of points), c, z - parameters, was used to test the relation between point counts number and species numbers. The coefficients of determination amounted to 0.95-0.99. Among the parameters of equation, c was more strongly correlated with landscape parameters (e.g. wood cover). The analysis revealed, that unified farmland requires bigger representative sample size compared to other, more diversified types of farmland. At least 50 points are needed for proper comparing bird species number between farmlands or periods.",

    "abstract": "In herbivores, habitat preference is influenced by resource availability, which is most evident in desert ecosystems. The desert puna is a South American environment dominated by grassy steppes with local grassy cushion plants associated with moist soil conditions, which form the habitat called 'vegas'. In this environment, Puna Rhea Rhea tarapacencis has a strongly selective foraging strategy towards plant species that are in low abundance but that exhibit low contents of secondary compounds, fiber, or both. This contrasts with other generalist herbivores of arid environments, which prefer plant species with high fiber content and are highly abundant. We determined habitat use by Rheas in three habitat types: foothills, valley and vegas; and provided evidence of their feeding habitat preferences. From 2011 to 2014, we estimated density of birds and environmental variables such as total plant cover and abundance of total food, preferred foods and non-preferred foods. In particular, the density was estimated indirectly based on counting and collecting feces of the birds in transects. We analyzed the effect of the habitat type and environment variables on bird density; and compared the environmental variables among habitats. Puna Rheas used the three habitats, but fecal records were very scarce in vegas. The density was higher in foothills than in the valley (0.45 and 0.01 inds/km2, respectively), increased with higher abundance of the preferred foods and declined with increased non-preferred foods. The foothills were preferred as they had the highest abundance of the preferred foods and the non-preferred foods were similarly abundant in foothills and valley. The vegas had the highest total plant cover and the lowest abundance of all food species consumed by the Rheas. Therefore, the abundance of preferred foods, which have the best nutritional quality, represents a good predictor of habitat preference and, possibly, an essential resource during the life cycle of the Puna Rhea.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone may affect many aspects of passerine maturation including the expression of plumage coloration and spring migration in adult birds. However, how the testosterone level changes during bird development is not well known. We compared the testosterone profile during juvenile development of a sexually dimorphic species, the Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, and a monomorphic species, the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix. We first tested whether testosterone influences plumage coloration and increases at the onset of molt in males of the dimorphic but not the monomorphic species. We found that a testosterone level increase occurred in both sexes and species during later stages of molt, and thus was not related to male plumage coloration. We also investigated whether the increase in testosterone level coincides with juvenile dispersal. If testosterone affects dispersal behavior in these species, both sexes should show an elevated testosterone level during dispersal, but this increase should occur earlier in the Wood Warbler, which disperses earlier than the Blackcap. In juvenile Blackcaps, the increase in testosterone level occurred on the 43–68th day after hatching, while in Wood Warblers it occurred on the 32–36th day (i.e. 11–32 days earlier). The increase in testosterone level coincided with the onset of the post-juvenile dispersal in both species. This study provides the first direct evidence of a testosterone level increase during juvenile development in two free-living migratory birds. While not correlated with species plumage coloration, this increase might affect other aspects of behavior, e.g. juvenile dispersal.",

    "abstract": "Leukocyte profiles, such as the heterophile/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, are influenced by several ecological and ecophysiological factors and are generally considered to be independent and robust indicators of stress levels in birds. We tested the hypotheses that Semipalmated Sandpiper Calidris pusilla presents a positive association between physiological stress (H/L ratio) and molt, and that there should be a negative association between physiological stress (H/L ratio) and body condition (mass). During its annual cycle, Semipalmated Sandpiper performs long-distance migrations and often arrives in South America in September/October when it can undergo molting before its migration to the north. In May, while preparing to return to its reproductive sites, Semipalmated Sandpiper increases its body mass. The research was carried out on Restinga Island of the Rio Paraíba estuary in northeast Brazil. Data collection took place during the wintering of Semipalmated Sandpiper in October 2017 and February and May 2018. We found a positive association between the H/L ratio and the presence of molt in October and February, but a negative association between the H/L ratio and body mass in May. Our results support the hypotheses that the presence of molt should be positively associated with the H/L ratio due to the high energy and nutritional costs that molting requires and that the H/L ratio and body mass should be negatively associated due to the favorable nutritional status of Semipalmated Sandpiper during its preparation to migrate to its reproductive areas.",

    "abstract": "Despite a huge diversity of egg shapes among birds, similar egg shapes occur in species that differ in habitats and are not phylogenetically closely related; this indicates the presence of factors limiting the egg shape variability. We assume that one of these factors is a general pattern of egg shape change across all birds. We tested a hypothesis of allometric patterns of egg morphometric traits (radii of blunt end (infundibular zone, ri), pointed end (cloacal zone, rc), lateral zone (rl) and maximum diameter (D)) scaling against egg length (L). Phylogenetic allometric analysis was applied. We also studied hierarchical distribution of variation in egg traits at different taxonomic levels in order to determine the degree of egg shape variability on each of them. We revealed allometric patterns in the scaling of egg traits: D and ri scaled against L with negative allometry, while rc and rl were positively allometric. A high degree of covariation was observed between the length and diameter, radii of the lateral and infundibular zones, i.e. traits that are associated with the overall size of an egg, the degree of its elongation, and the shape of infundibular zone. Evolutionary correlation between L and rc was rather low. The greatest variation of egg traits resided at the level of orders. The identified general trends in egg shape variation are realized on the basis of various groups of birds in phylogenetic and ecological sense that assume the influence of these factors on the bird's egg shape.",

In the Caucasus region 29% of males were polyterritorial (6% - bigynous) whereas in the Volga region no cases of males polyterritoriality nor bigyny were observed. Literature reveals that in regions, where polygyny in the Whitethroat was observed, the breeding period is short and the species has only one breeding cycle in a season. In the areas where the breeding period is long, bigyny has not been found, but cases of double-broodness was observed. Author suggests that bigyny in the Whitethroat evolved as a response to the short breeding season, which does not allow males to have two successive broods in a season. The only way to increase their reproductive success is to establish a second territory immediately after the first female starts to lay.",

In the present study we compare early embryonic development, especially somitogenesis and muscle cell formation, in birds from lines of quail exhibiting different patterns of postnatal growth. We use classical staging techniques that use developmental landmarks to categorize embryonic maturity as well as morphological measurements of specific tissues. These techniques were combined with immunodetection of somite specific gene products to test the hypothesis that differences in postnatal development would be reflected in patterns of embryonic tissue partitioning.",

The annual variation in the proportion of asynchronous clutches depended on median dates of egg laying, in the years when females started egg laying later more asynchronous clutches were observed. The females from synchronous clutches started egg laying significantly earlier than females from asynchronous clutches and were more synchronised with the peak of caterpilars. No differences in clutch size and number of fledglings between asynchronous and synchronous clutches were found. The frequency of females that started incubation earlier showed no significant difference when mated with either after-2nd-year or 2nd-year males. Also, breeding success was not significantly different between broods of various hatching types and was 87% for asynchronous clutches and 94% for synchronous clutches. The time of breeding and high predation pressure could be main reasons for females of the Red-breasted Flycatcher to start incubation before laying the last egg of its clutch.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the niche differentiation between sympatric species that permit species to coexist and partition resource is the central concept in ecology. In this context, we evaluated the differences in roost site resources between two sympatric Otus species — Andaman Scops-owl Otus balli and Oriental Scops-owl Otus sunia in the Andaman Islands using a multi-scale approach. We measured variables that influence roost site use by owls at three different scales (tree, patch and macro). A total of 38 and 69 independent roost locations of O. balli and O. sunia respectively were recorded. We found that both species showed a high preference for Arecaceae plants at tree scale, possibly for their spiny structures that could offer protection. But both species showed different selection patterns at the patch and macro scales. At the patch scale, O. balli selected roosting sites in patches with relatively mature tree stands (characterised by higher tree height, girth at breast height and canopy cover) with thick understory cover (understory cover, height, and herbaceous elements). In contrast, O. sunia was found to select trees in secondary or highly disturbed forests. Land use and land cover types distinguish both species from their habitat preferences at a macro scale with a very low predicted overlap. The area of potential roost sites is very low for O. balli when compared to O. sunia. Our findings suggest that the two sympatric species' preferences for roost sites are shaped by the characteristics of evergreen forests of the Andaman Islands. Hence, any further changes to this forest type may have adverse effects on the endemic O. balli.",

Among these, still articulated wings and leg bones of an adult female Booted Eagle Aquila pennata, feathers and several bone fragments of one adult Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus and several individuals of Common Buzzards Buteo buteo were identified. While predation of Eagle Owls on different raptor species is well known, booted Eagles and Long-legged Buzzards are rarely preyed upon. Based on changes that occurred in the overall diet of owls at this particular eyrie, it is hypothesized that a shortage in the main prey species (induced by land use changes in the region) may be the cause of these extraordinary predation events. While predation of Eagle Owls on large diurnal raptors is more an exception than a norm, in areas where threatened diurnal raptors breed, the presence of Eagle Owls may cause conservation concerns/prove to be problematic.",

    "abstract": "Set aside fields act as potential nesting habitat and play an important role in nest success of ground nesters in farmlands. Asian countries utilize vast areas of their land as rice fields which along with adjoining habitats act as breeding ground for around 3% bird species in the Indian subcontinent. We investigated contribution of post harvested rice fields and associated habitats in nest success of three passerines within a tropical agricultural area. Nesting ecology of 90 pairs belonging to Oriental Skylark Alauda gulgula (n = 25 nests), Bengal Bush Lark Mirafra assamica (n = 32) and Paddyfield Pipit Anthus rufulus (n = 33) was studied from February 2016 to June 2017 in a complex of agricultural fields dominated by fallow stubble in the southern West Bengal, North East India. Nests were found in the stubble fields having uncut rice bases, adjacent cropped or uncropped other fields and levees. Location of the nests and their microhabitats seemed to be the most important factors concerning nesting habitat selection. Nest success was 48%, 34.4% and 21.2% in Skylark, Bush Lark and Pipit respectively. Model estimate of constant Daily Survival Rate (DSR) ranged between 0.90–0.95. Nest survival increased between 1–5% at rice bases for the three species. Pipit nests at rice bases showed 6.5% higher survival rate than open habitat. Nests at the open microhabitat had low nest survival irrespective of species. Model goodness of fit suggested that nest survival was affected mostly by combination of microhabitat and species variables. Results suggested that rice bases in post harvested fallow rice fields might play an important role in nest survival for passerines.",

While the relationships between various personality traits and performances in diverse cognitive tasks are not consistent, few studies have examined the effects of a particular personality trait on different cognitive abilities. We measured the exploratory behaviour of 35 individuals lab-reared Java Sparrows Lonchura oryzivora with a novel environment test and a novel object test. Three cognitive abilities of birds, for discrimination learning, reversal learning, and inhibitory control, were quantified in three classic cognition tasks (a colour association task, a colour reversal task, and a detour-reaching task). We found no correlation between the exploration and the trials required to pass the colour association task or the detour-reaching task. The slow explorers, however, needed less trials to reach the criterion in the colour reversal task. Our results suggest that slow explorers hold higher reversal learning ability. Slow-exploring style would be advantageous to birds when facing unpredictable environmental changes.",

We describe the minimum distances between nest sites, breeding success, elevation and the use of nesting cliffs of different breeding pairs of Andean Condors in the north-central Andes of Ecuador. We undertook 840 hours of observations of eight nesting events in areas on an elevational gradient from 2500 m to 4500 m during 2018 and 2019. Nesting events in Ecuador since 1996, were also reviewed which provided us a total of 21 breeding attempts at 16 nest sites. Minimum distances between the sites of breeding attempts were 25 m (since 1996) and 310 m (during the fieldwork). The nearest neighbour distance of Andean Condors simultaneously sharing the same cliff during partially overlapping breeding was 550 m and in different cliffs 2720 m. Breeding success was 0.75 and higher in reused nests. The results present previously unknown information that contributes to reproductive ecology and emphasizes the importance of the cliffs as critical areas for the conservation and permanence of the Andean Condor where management actions are urgent.",

Wśrod przedstawicieli Ardeidae znana jest klasyczna i jedyna w swoim rodzaju forma mutualizmu pomiedzy czaplą zlotawą, Bubulcus ibis (L.), a du­ zymi ssakami (STEEET, 1958). Inny, nearktyczny gatunek czapli Leueophoyx thula (MOLINA) W określonych okolicznościach wystepuje, podobnie zresztą jak poprzedni gatunek, w roli symbionta bydla rogatego na Florydzie (BICE, 1954). Nawet czapla siwa, Ardea cinerea L. byla obserwowana jako symbiont daniela, Dama dama L. (CUEEY-LINDAHL, 1956). Eozne formy komensaUzmu i mutualizmu legowego, obserwowanego pomiedzy poszczegolnymi gatunkami Ardeidae, a takze pomiedzy przedstawicielami rodzin Plegadidae i Accipitridae opisalem wcześniej (JOZEFIE, 1957). O ile roznorodnośc symbiozy pomiedzy kregowcami a symbiontami bez­ kregowymi ksztaltowala sie w filogenezie, wywolując glownie u tych ostatnich daleko idące zmiany anatomo-morfologiczne, o tyle przejawy komensaUzmu, czy mutualizmu pomiedzy wyzszymi kregowcami wiązą sie przewaznie ze zmianami zachodzącymi w ich etologii. Wyzsze formy symbiozy, jako jeden z czynnikow ekologicznych, wplywają powaznie zarowno na ksztaltowanie",

The mean and median prolonged incubation lasted 29 and 25 days respectively (n = 10), i.e., 54% and 46% respectively longer than the average incubation period. There was a negative correlation between the duration of prolonged incubation and the egg-laying date: prolonged incubation lasted longer in earlier clutches than in later ones, and territories with many breeding attempts showed short incubation prolongations. On the other hand, no correlation was found between the duration of prolonged incubation and productivity or breeding success. The results suggest that more experienced birds, which occupy higher quality territories and lay their eggs earlier, prolonged their incubation to a greater extent. Although prolonged incubation may constitute an example of adaptive behaviour, the extensive periods documented in some cases do not appear to support this assumption.",

    "abstract": "The structure of a species assemblage at given sites constitutes a key ecological parameter to understand the dynamics of bird assemblages. The aim of this paper is to (1) quantify how variable is a passerine assemblage associated with an inter-tidal reedbed area at a main stopover site in the Atlantic flyway in northern Iberia and to explore potential factors explaining the variation, with emphasis on the vegetation productivity, and (2) to test whether inter-annual fluctuations reflect possible demographic trends. Migratory birds, especially those species which show high flexibility to stop over in some places or others using an opportunistic strategy, should be expected to land in larger numbers and stay for longer periods at given stopover sites in years with higher vegetation productivity, thus with a higher amount of insect prey, since this would permit achieving higher fuel deposition rates. We used ringing data collected at Txingudi marshlands during the autumn migration of 2007–2016. The assemblage had a relatively simple structure, because few species dominated in number over the rest. Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus dominated the assemblage in nine out of ten study years, supporting the importance of the site for the species. As compared with the other two most abundant passerines (the Sedge and Willow Warblers, A. schoenobaenus and Phylloscopus trochilus, respectively), the ratio between these three warblers varied from year to year, with the Willow Warblers having much higher annual fluctuations than the other two species. This is likely linked to an opportunistic exploitation of the reed bed by this species, but we did not find significant effect of vegetation productivity (quantified by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) on the structure and diversity of the bird assemblage. Annual fluctuations in species' contribution to the assemblage did not vary linearly, except for the Bluethroat Luscinia svecica. Only for Bluethroats the proportion of captures and the mean number of captures declined from year to year. The structure and diversity of the assemblage did not seem to be affected by local conditions hence factors working at larger spatial scales or at the origin region of the migrants captured at Txingudi apparently may be more relevant at explaining the structural traits of the assemblage.",

    "abstract": "Changes in forest size and composition can affect Neotropical migratory songbirds breeding in Eastern North America, leading to population fluctuations and declines. In 2012–2014, we conducted point counts at locations previously surveyed in 1981–1983 and analysed Breeding Bird Atlas data from 1980–2013 to estimate long-term population trends of two declining ground-nesting warblers on the Eastern Shore of Maryland within the Atlantic Coastal Plain: the Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla and the Worm-eating Warbler Helmitheros vermivorum. We detected significant declines for Ovenbirds in both datasets, but we found conflicting data for Worm-eating Warblers. During 2012–2015, we investigated the effects of forest characteristics, such as vegetative composition and ground cover, on occupancy and nest success. Ovenbirds were found more where there were more and larger trees but were negatively affected by the proportion of pines, whereas Worm-eating Warblers were more abundant when there were higher numbers of trees and more pines. Nest success was not affected by vegetation other than the proportion of pine trees or leaf litter depth, both of which increased nest success. Worm-eating Warblers with more pine needles in their nests also had increased nest success. This study presents a nuanced view of how forest composition (proportion of pine trees) of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland influenced ground-nesting warblers differently, and suggests that effectively managing ground-nesting warblers in this area may differ from other regions of Eastern North America due to its unique vegetative composition, structure, and history.",

    "abstract": "Total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) is the name of a non-invasive method for investigating total body fat (TBF) in vertebrates. The error of measurement depends on body mass (for large animals the relative error is small), body shape and other factors.The ACAN-2 apparatus operating on the basis of the TOBEC method shows integer numbers (readings) correlated with lean body mass (LBM). From the series of these readings (measurements) TOBEC can be calculated in many ways.The error for LBM and TBF measurements in Tree Sparrows (of masses 22.5 ± 1.7 g) and House Sparrows (of masses 29.8 ± 2.0 g) was 1.19 g. This error may be reduced by repeating the TOBEC measurement and calculating the arithmetic mean of readings from the apparatus obtained 1 second after the commencement of measurement. Readings making up a single measurement series showed periodic irregular fluctuations of average amplitude 3 units in the case of Tree Sparrows and 5 units for House Sparrows — corresponding to errors of 0.5 g LBM in both species. Given individuals of both species were characterised by similar differences between the first and second TOBEC measurements. The TOBEC value obtained in a measurement during which a bird defecated in the chamber of the apparatus was significantly higher than that for a bird in a clean chamber. The orientation of the head in the chamber did not influence the repeatability of the TOBEC measurement. In Tree Sparrows, the relationship between TOBEC and LBM differed between those captured and held for one night prior to measurement and those measured for TOBEC immediately after capture.",

    "abstract": "Predation is one of the most important factors influencing breeding success. Many bird species suffer from high losses because of predators. I studied breeding success and replacement broods in the Red-breasted Flycatcher Ficedula parva. The Red-breasted Flycatcher is a small bird breeding in natural holes in dense deciduous and mixed forests of Europe. Data were collected during twelve breeding seasons in a primeval forest, in the Bialowieża National Park, Northeast Poland, the best preserved and protected area of the Białowieża Forest with a rich community of birds and mammals including predators. Almost half of the broods of the Red-breasted Flycatcher were lost and most of them because of predation. In cases where the brood was lost in the period of egg laying or incubation, females tended to lay a replacement clutch. First and replacement nest-sites differed insignificantly in characteristics, but new clutches were always laid in a new site. Out of 68 broods, in which a loss was found, replacement broods were recorded in 47.1% cases. Replacement clutches were much smaller and pairs raised significantly fewer fledglings. The proportions of successful and lost broods were similar in the first and replacement attempts (56.1%, and 46.7%, respectively). Red-breasted Flycatchers choose shallow nest-sites that allow the females to observe their surroundings. This allows the female to escape from the nest when a predator approaches, increasing the possibility of a repeat clutch and the attainment of breeding success in the same season.",

It played a decisive role in the scientific description of Penduline Tit and it's nest, and provided the first significant information relativing to the biology of this species. Monti was also the first to correct number of inaccuracies in earlier zoological treatises considered as “classics”. His own work was recognized throughout Europe, and quoted by German and French naturalists as Buffon. Linnaeus referred to it in his own description. Monti's analysis also enables us to gain precious information concerning the way in which ornithologists worked at the time, and the methods they used: analysing classical writings, “interviewing” bird catchers and peasants, information from missionaries, field work, analysis of specimens from zoological collections, and preparing descriptions and iconographies.",

    "abstract": "Why foraging animals sometimes leave patches before consuming all available food items is a key question in behavioural ecology. Abandoning some food would appear to be disadvantageous, yet optimal foraging theory demonstrates that this sometimes optimises energy intake rates. Crossbills Loxia are specialist avian granivores that forage on seeds within the cones of many species of conifer in the northern hemisphere. They often abandon a few seeds within cones they have fed upon. We assessed whether seeds left within Scots Pine Pinus sylvestris cones by foraging crossbills were of lower mass or in particular positions within the cone. Crossbills foraged on long cones which have more seeds per cone and heavier seeds, but avoided the longest cones, which typically have thicker scales that require more energy to open. Cones dropped by foraging crossbills contained over four seeds per cone, representing approximately one fifth of those originally present. Crossbills left mostly small or empty seeds (< 2 mg), whereas the average mass of seeds from intact cones sampled from the canopy was 3.6 mg. Infrequently, single seeds of high mass (> 4 mg) were left behind, perhaps mistakenly overlooked during foraging. Such apparent preferential foraging on heavier seeds is probably advantageous, because of the higher energy reward per seed. To directly discriminate between seeds prior to extraction would reduce energy expenditure in foraging. This raises the question of how crossbills could attain this favourable outcome. While cones scales were closed an external cue would be required. After cone scale dehiscence, seeds would be visible to crossbills, allowing them to discriminate visually among seeds and selectively extract heavier seeds, leaving lighter seeds behind within the cone. Dropping cones when few seeds are encountered or as seed mass declines towards the distal scales could be additional components of crossbill foraging strategy.",

    "abstract": "Study of population genetic structure is essential for insight in species biology, but mechanisms of its formation and factors influencing it remain insufficiently understood. Here we analyzed differentiation among populations in small colonial seabird of North Pacific, the Parakeet Auklet Aethia psittacula, which was previously considered as a monomorphic species. We compare our results with data on congeneric species to investigate the most important factors affecting the process of population differentiation in Aethini. We analyzed morphometric measurements, mitochondrial DNA control region fragment and microsatellite loci from six Parakeet Auklet colonies spanning the breeding range. Although results of microsatellite variability analysis did not reveal differences between birds from different colonies, results of control region variability and morphometric analyses testified for a slight but significant differentiation between birds from the Aleutian Islands and other parts of their range. They were significantly smaller in most linear parameters measured and had higher body condition (expressed as the scaled mass index). The results of mtDNA analysis and discrepancy between different types of genetic markers indicated that birds from Aleutian Islands and from the other parts of their breeding range probably originated from different refuges and the differentiation of mitochondrial lineages between them took place around 100 000 years ago. Our results and conclusions from the comparison with congeneric species indicated that foraging and migration patterns seem to determine population structure in small planktivorous alcids, with panmixia in highly mobile species, clear population differentiation in resident species and intermediate population differentiation in more dispersive species.",

    "abstract": "The population density and brood results of the White Stork were studied between 1984 and 1991 in Legnica voivodeship (4037 km2), where a large copper industry centre has been developed for over 30 years. A total of 2217 data items, concerning nest occupation and brood results, were collected in relation to ca. 350 nests in the study area. The density of breeding pairs was 6.7/100 km2. The copper industry was not found to have any direct negative impact on population dynamics and breeding parameters. In the 640 km2 former administrative district (powiat) of Legnica, where a meta­ lworks has been operating since 1959, the density of the White Stork population has been increasing since 1922. In Legnica voivodeship as a whole, the population density increased by about 35% between the years 1974 and 1984 or by more then in the majority of the adjacent voivodeships. The mean numbers of young per breeding pair (JZa) -1.98 and per successful pair (JZm) 2.54 as well as the proportion of unsuccessful pairs (%HPo) -19.4% were similar to the values recorded in фе other regions of Poland. Brood results around the metalworks the most heavily polluted areas revealed no negative impacts on JZa, JZm or %HPo, in relation to distance from the metalworks or wind direction.",
