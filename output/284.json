    "abstract": "Few studies in medical education have studied effect of quality of motivation on performance. Self-Determination Theory based on quality of motivation differentiates between Autonomous Motivation (AM) that originates within an individual and Controlled Motivation (CM) that originates from external sources. To determine whether Relative Autonomous Motivation (RAM, a measure of the balance between AM and CM) affects academic performance through good study strategy and higher study effort and compare this model between subgroups: males and females; students selected via two different systems namely qualitative and weighted lottery selection. Data on motivation, study strategy and effort was collected from 383 medical students of VU University Medical Center Amsterdam and their academic performance results were obtained from the student administration. Structural Equation Modelling analysis technique was used to test a hypothesized model in which high RAM would positively affect Good Study Strategy (GSS) and study effort, which in turn would positively affect academic performance in the form of grade point averages. This model fit well with the data, Chi square = 1.095, df = 3, p = 0.778, RMSEA model fit = 0.000. This model also fitted well for all tested subgroups of students. Differences were found in the strength of relationships between the variables for the different subgroups as expected. In conclusion, RAM positively correlated with academic performance through deep strategy towards study and higher study effort. This model seems valid in medical education in subgroups such as males, females, students selected by qualitative and weighted lottery selection.",

    "abstract": "Gamification refers to using game attributes in a non-gaming context. Health professions educators increasingly turn to gamification to optimize students' learning outcomes. However, little is known about the concept of gamification and its possible working mechanisms. This review focused on empirical evidence for the effectiveness of gamification approaches and theoretical rationales for applying the chosen game attributes. We systematically searched multiple databases, and included all empirical studies evaluating the use of game attributes in health professions education. Of 5044 articles initially identified, 44 met the inclusion criteria. Negative outcomes for using gamification were not reported. Almost all studies included assessment attributes (n = 40), mostly in combination with conflict/challenge attributes (n = 27). Eight studies revealed that this specific combination had increased the use of the learning material, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. A relatively small number of studies was performed to explain mechanisms underlying the use of game attributes (n = 7). Our findings suggest that it is possible to improve learning outcomes in health professions education by using gamification, especially when employing game attributes that improve learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning. However, most studies lacked well-defined control groups and did not apply and/or report theory to understand underlying processes. Future research should clarify mechanisms underlying gamified educational interventions and explore theories that could explain the effects of these interventions on learning outcomes, using well-defined control groups, in a longitudinal way. In doing so, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student.",

    "abstract": "In problem-based learning (PBL), implemented worldwide, students learn by discussing professionally relevant problems enhancing application and integration of knowledge, which is assumed to encourage students towards a deep learning approach in which students are intrinsically interested and try to understand what is being studied. This review investigates: (1) the effects of PBL on students’ deep and surface approaches to learning, (2) whether and why these effects do differ across (a) the context of the learning environment (single vs. curriculum wide implementation), and (b) study quality. Studies were searched dealing with PBL and students’ approaches to learning. Twenty-one studies were included. The results indicate that PBL does enhance deep learning with a small positive average effect size of .11 and a positive effect in eleven of the 21 studies. Four studies show a decrease in deep learning and six studies show no effect. PBL does not seem to have an effect on surface learning as indicated by a very small average effect size (.08) and eleven studies showing no increase in the surface approach. Six studies demonstrate a decrease and four an increase in surface learning. It is concluded that PBL does seem to enhance deep learning and has little effect on surface learning, although more longitudinal research using high quality measurement instruments is needed to support this conclusion with stronger evidence. Differences cannot be explained by the study quality but a curriculum wide implementation of PBL has a more positive impact on the deep approach (effect size .18) compared to an implementation within a single course (effect size of −.05). PBL is assumed to enhance active learning and students’ intrinsic motivation, which enhances deep learning. A high perceived workload and assessment that is perceived as not rewarding deep learning are assumed to enhance surface learning.",

    "abstract": "Self-appraisal has repeatedly been shown to be inadequate as a mechanism for performance improvement. This has placed greater emphasis on understanding the processes through which self-perception and external feedback interact to influence professional development. As feedback is inevitably interpreted through the lens of one's self-perceptions it is important to understand how learners interpret, accept, and use feedback (or not) and the factors that influence those interpretations. 134 participants from 8 health professional training/continuing competence programs were recruited to participate in focus groups. Analyses were designed to (a) elicit understandings of the processes used by learners and physicians to interpret, accept and use (or not) data to inform their perceptions of their clinical performance, and (b) further understand the factors (internal and external) believed to influence interpretation of feedback. Multiple influences appear to impact upon the interpretation and uptake of feedback. These include confidence, experience, and fear of not appearing knowledgeable. Importantly, however, each could have a paradoxical effect of both increasing and decreasing receptivity. Less prevalent but nonetheless important themes suggested mechanisms through which cognitive reasoning processes might impede growth from formative feedback. Many studies have examined the effectiveness of feedback through variable interventions focused on feedback delivery. This study suggests that it is equally important to consider feedback from the perspective of how it is received. The interplay observed between fear, confidence, and reasoning processes reinforces the notion that there is no simple recipe for the delivery of effective feedback. These factors should be taken into account when trying to understand (a) why self-appraisal can be flawed, (b) why appropriate external feedback is vital (yet can be ineffective), and (c) why we may need to disentangle the goals of performance improvement from the goals of improving self-assessment.",

Moreover, it was examined how cognitive engagement develops as a function of the learning process and the extent to which cognitive engagement determines subsequent levels of cognitive engagement during a one-day PBL event. Data were analyzed by means of confirmatory factor analysis, repeated measures ANOVA, and path analysis. The results showed that the new measure of situational cognitive engagement is valid and reliable. Furthermore, the results revealed that students' cognitive engagement significantly increased as a function of the learning event. Implications of these findings for PBL are discussed.",

Evidence in support of psychometrics of the JSE has been reported in health professions students and practitioners with the exception of osteopathic medical students. This study was designed to examine measurement properties, underlying components, and latent variable structure of the JSE in a nationwide sample of first-year matriculants at U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine, and to develop a national norm table for the assessment of JSE scores. A web-based survey was administered at the beginning of the 2017-2018 academic year which included the JSE, a scale to detect \"good impression\" responses, and demographic/background information. Usable surveys were received from 6009 students enrolled in 41 college campuses (median response rate = 92%). The JSE mean score and standard deviation for the sample were 116.54 and 10.85, respectively. Item-total score correlations were positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01), and Cronbach α = 0.82. Significant gender differences were observed on the JSE scores in favor of women. Also, significant differences were found on item scores between top and bottom third scorers on the JSE. Three factors of Perspective Taking, Compassionate Care, and Walking in Patient's Shoes emerged in an exploratory factor analysis by using half of the sample. Results of confirmatory factor analysis with another half of the sample confirmed the 3-factor model. We also developed a national norm table which is the first to assess students' JSE scores against national data.",

    "abstract": "Eye tracking research has been conducted for decades to gain understanding of visual diagnosis such as in radiology. For educational purposes, it is important to identify visual search patterns that are related to high perceptual performance and to identify effective teaching strategies. This review of eye-tracking literature in the radiology domain aims to identify visual search patterns associated with high perceptual performance. Databases PubMed, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using ‘visual perception’ OR ‘eye tracking’ AND ‘radiology’ and synonyms. Two authors independently screened search results and included eye tracking studies concerning visual skills in radiology published between January 1, 1994 and July 31, 2015. Two authors independently assessed study quality with the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument, and extracted study data with respect to design, participant and task characteristics, and variables. A thematic analysis was conducted to extract and arrange study results, and a textual narrative synthesis was applied for data integration and interpretation. The search resulted in 22 relevant full-text articles. Thematic analysis resulted in six themes that informed the relation between visual search and level of expertise: (1) time on task, (2) eye movement characteristics of experts, (3) differences in visual attention, (4) visual search patterns, (5) search patterns in cross sectional stack imaging, and (6) teaching visual search strategies. Expert search was found to be characterized by a global-focal search pattern, which represents an initial global impression, followed by a detailed, focal search-to-find mode. Specific task-related search patterns, like drilling through CT scans and systematic search in chest X-rays, were found to be related to high expert levels. One study investigated teaching of visual search strategies, and did not find a significant effect on perceptual performance. Eye tracking literature in radiology indicates several search patterns are related to high levels of expertise, but teaching novices to search as an expert may not be effective. Experimental research is needed to find out which search strategies can improve image perception in learners.",

In this article, we attempt to analyze the causes of the frequent confusion and conflation of EPAs with competencies and skills, and argue why the distinction is important for education, qualification and patient safety. 'Tracheotomy', 'lumbar puncture', 'interprofessional collaboration' for example are colloquially called 'skills', but its is a person's ability to perform these activities that is the actual skill; the EPA is simply the activity itself. We identify two possible causes for the confusion. One is a tendency to frame all educational objectives as EPAs. Many objectives of medical training can be conceptualized as EPAs, if 'the ability to do X' is the corresponding competency; but that does not work for all. We offer ways to deal with objectives of training that are not usefully conceptualized as EPAs. A more fundamental cause relates to entrustment decisions. The permission to contribute to health care reflects entrustment. Entrustment decisions are the links or pivots between a person's readiness for the task and the actual task execution. However, if entrustment decisions do not lead to increased autonomy in the practice of health care, but only serve to decide upon the advancement to a next stage of training, EPAs can become the tick boxes learners feel they need to collect to 'pass'. Gradually, then, EPAs can loose their original meaning of units of practice for which one becomes qualified.",

The aim of this review was to summarise the evidence for implementation of IPE, and identify challenges and key lessons to guide faculty in IPE implementation. Methods Five stage scoping review of methodological characteristics, implementation components, challenges and key lessons in primary studies in IPE. Thematic analysis using a framework of micro (teaching), meso (institutional), and macro (systemic) level education factors was used to synthesise challenges and key lessons. Results Twenty-seven primary studies were included in this review. Studies were predominantly descriptive in design and implementation components inconsistently reported. IPE was mostly integrated into curricula, optional, involved group learning, and used combinations of interactive and didactic approaches. Micro level implementation factors (socialisation issues, learning context, and faculty development), meso level implementation factors (leadership and resources, administrative processes), and macro level implementation factors (education system, government policies, social and cultural values) were extrapolated. Sustainability was identified as an additional factor in IPE implementation. Conclusion Lack of complete detailed reporting limits evidence of IPE implementation, however, this review highlighted challenges and yielded key lessons to guide faculty in the implementation of IPE.",

To that end, the reflection journals of 690 first-year applied science students at a local polytechnic were studied by means of an automated coding procedures using software. Data was collected twice, once at the beginning and again towards the end of an academic year. Outcomes of the textual content analyses revealed that students reflected on both the process and contents of their learning: critical review of past learning experiences, learning strategies and summaries of what was learned. Correlational analyses showed weak to moderate inter-relationships between the textual categories and their classroom and knowledge acquisition test grades. Taken together, the findings suggest that self-reflection on both how and what students have learned does lead to improvements in academic performance, although to a limited extent.",

    "abstract": "Gender is an essential determinant of health and illness. Gender awareness in doctors contributes to equity and equality in health and aims towards better health for men and women. Nevertheless, gender has largely been ignored in medicine. First, it is stated that medicine was ‘gender blind’ by not considering gender whenever relevant. Secondly, medicine is said to be ‘male biased’ because the largest body of knowledge on health and illness is about men and their health. Thirdly, gender role ideology negatively influences treatment and health outcomes. Finally, gender inequality has been overlooked as a determinant of health and illness. The uptake of gender issues in medical education brings about specific challenges for several reasons. For instance, the political-ideological connotations of gender issues create resistance especially in traditionalists in medical schools. Secondly, it is necessary to clarify which gender issues must be integrated in which domains. Also, some are interdisciplinary issues and as such more difficult to integrate. Finally, schools need assistance with implementation. The integration of psychosocial issues along with biomedical ones in clinical cases, the dissemination of literature and education material, staff education, and efforts towards structural embedding of gender in curricula are determining factors for successful implementation. Gender equity is not a spontaneous process. Medical education provides specific opportunities that may contribute to transformation for medical schools educate future doctors for future patients in future settings. Consequently, future benefits legitimize the integration of gender as a qualitative investment in medical education.",

    "abstract": "Since the latter part of the 1990's, the English-speaking medical education community has been engaged in a debate concerning the types of research that should have priority. To shed light on this debate and to better understand its implications for the practice of research, 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted with \"influential figures\" from the community. The results were analyzed using the concept of \"field\" developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. The results reveal that a large majority of these influential figures believe that research in medical education continues to be of insufficient quality despite the progress that has taken place over the past 2 decades. According to this group, studies tend to be both redundant and opportunistic, and researchers tend to have limited understanding of both theory and methodological practice from the social sciences. Three factors were identified by the participants to explain the current problems in research: the working conditions of researchers, budgetary restraints in financing research in medical education, and the conception of research in the medical environment. Two principal means for improving research are presented: intensifying collaboration between PhD's and clinicians, and encouraging the diversification of perspectives brought to bear on research in medical education.",

However, in Southeast Asian settings, we often see a more one-way style with little input from the patient. We investigated factors underlying the use of a one-way consultation style by doctors in a Southeast Asian setting. We conducted a qualitative study based on principles of grounded theory. Twenty residents and specialists and 20 patients of a low or high educational level were interviewed in internal medicine outpatient clinics of an Indonesian teaching hospital and two affiliated hospitals. During 26 weeks we engaged in an iterative interview and coding process to identify emergent factors. Patients were generally dissatisfied with doctors’ communication style. The doctors indicated that they did not deliberately use a one-way style. Communication style appeared to be associated with characteristics of Southeast Asian culture, the health care setting and medical education. Doctor–patient communication appeared to be affected by cultural characteristics which fell into two broad categories representing key features of Southeast Asian culture, “social distance” and “closeness of relationships”, and to characteristics categorized as “specific clinical context”. Consideration of these characteristics could be helpful in promoting the use of a partnership communication style.",

    "abstract": "Traditional psychometric approaches towards assessment tend to focus exclusively on quantitative properties of assessment outcomes. This may limit more meaningful educational approaches towards workplace-based assessment (WBA). Cognition-based models of WBA argue that assessment outcomes are determined by cognitive processes by raters which are very similar to reasoning, judgment and decision making in professional domains such as medicine. The present study explores cognitive processes that underlie judgment and decision making by raters when observing performance in the clinical workplace. It specifically focuses on how differences in rating experience influence information processing by raters. Verbal protocol analysis was used to investigate how experienced and non-experienced raters select and use observational data to arrive at judgments and decisions about trainees' performance in the clinical workplace. Differences between experienced and non-experienced raters were assessed with respect to time spent on information analysis and representation of trainee performance; performance scores; and information processing--using qualitative-based quantitative analysis of verbal data. Results showed expert-novice differences in time needed for representation of trainee performance, depending on complexity of the rating task. Experts paid more attention to situation-specific cues in the assessment context and they generated (significantly) more interpretations and fewer literal descriptions of observed behaviors. There were no significant differences in rating scores. Overall, our findings seemed to be consistent with other findings on expertise research, supporting theories underlying cognition-based models of assessment in the clinical workplace. Implications for WBA are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Medical professionals need to keep on learning as part of their everyday work to deliver high-quality health care. Although the importance of physicians' learning is widely recognized, few studies have investigated how they learn in the workplace. Based on insights from deliberate practice research, this study examined the activities physicians engage in during their work that might further their professional development. As deliberate practice requires a focused effort to improve performance, the study also examined the goals underlying this behaviour. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 internal medicine physicians: 19 residents, 18 internists working at a university hospital, and 13 working at a non-university hospital. The results showed that learning in medical practice was very much embedded in clinical work. Most relevant learning activities were directly related to patient care rather than motivated by competence improvement goals. Advice and feedback were sought when necessary to provide this care. Performance standards were tied to patients' conditions. The patients encountered and the discussions with colleagues about patients were valued most for professional development, while teaching and updating activities were also valued in this respect. In conclusion, physicians' learning is largely guided by practical experience rather than deliberately sought. When professionals interact in diagnosing and treating patients to achieve high-quality care, their experiences contribute to expertise development. However, much could be gained from managing learning opportunities more explicitly. We offer suggestions for increasing the focus on learning in medical practice and further research.",

    "abstract": "Learning in clinical practice can be characterised as situated learning because students learn by performing tasks and solving problems in an environment that reflects the multiple ways in which their knowledge will be put to use in their future professional practice. Collins et al. introduced cognitive apprenticeship as an instructional model for situated learning comprising six teaching methods to support learning: modelling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection and exploration. Another factor that is looked upon as conducive to learning in clinical practice is a positive learning climate. We explored students' experiences regarding the learning climate and whether the cognitive apprenticeship model fits students' experiences during clinical training. In focus group interviews, three groups of 6th-year medical students (N = 21) discussed vignettes representing the six teaching methods and the learning climate to explore the perceived occurrence of the teaching methods, related problems and possibilities for improvement. The students had experienced all six teaching methods during their clerkships. Modelling, coaching, and articulation were predominant, while scaffolding, reflection, and exploration were mainly experienced during longer clerkships and with one clinical teacher. The main problem was variability in usage of the methods, which was attributed to teachers' lack of time and formal training. The students proposed several ways to improve the application of the teaching methods. The results suggest that the cognitive apprenticeship model is a useful model for teaching strategies in undergraduate clinical training and a valuable basis for evaluation, feedback, self-assessment and faculty development of clinical teachers.",

    "abstract": "Weaknesses in the nature of rater judgments are generally considered to compromise the utility of workplace-based assessment (WBA). In order to gain insight into the underpinnings of rater behaviours, we investigated how raters form impressions of and make judgments on trainee performance. Using theoretical frameworks of social cognition and person perception, we explored raters’ implicit performance theories, use of task-specific performance schemas and the formation of person schemas during WBA. We used think-aloud procedures and verbal protocol analysis to investigate schema-based processing by experienced (N = 18) and inexperienced (N = 16) raters (supervisor-raters in general practice residency training). Qualitative data analysis was used to explore schema content and usage. We quantitatively assessed rater idiosyncrasy in the use of performance schemas and we investigated effects of rater expertise on the use of (task-specific) performance schemas. Raters used different schemas in judging trainee performance. We developed a normative performance theory comprising seventeen inter-related performance dimensions. Levels of rater idiosyncrasy were substantial and unrelated to rater expertise. Experienced raters made significantly more use of task-specific performance schemas compared to inexperienced raters, suggesting more differentiated performance schemas in experienced raters. Most raters started to develop person schemas the moment they began to observe trainee performance. The findings further our understanding of processes underpinning judgment and decision making in WBA. Raters make and justify judgments based on personal theories and performance constructs. Raters’ information processing seems to be affected by differences in rater expertise. The results of this study can help to improve rater training, the design of assessment instruments and decision making in WBA.",

Despite these expectations, a considerable literature in the domain of self-assessment has questioned the ability of the self-regulating professional to enact this process effectively. In response, authors have recently suggested that the construction of self-assessment as represented in the self-regulation literature is, itself, problematic. In this paper we report a pair of studies that examine the relationship between self-assessment (a global judgment of one's ability in a particular domain) and self-monitoring (a moment-by-moment awareness of the likelihood that one maintains the skill/knowledge to act in a particular situation). These studies reveal that, despite poor correlations between performance and self-assessments (consistent with what is typically seen in the self-assessment literature), participant performance was strongly related to several measures of self-monitoring including: the decision to answer or defer responding to a question, the amount of time required to make that decision to answer or defer, and the confidence expressed in an answer when provided. This apparent divergence between poor overall self-assessment and effective self-monitoring is considered in terms of how the findings might inform our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms yielding both self-monitoring judgments and self-assessments and how that understanding might be used to better direct education and learning efforts.",

    "abstract": "Workplace learning in undergraduate medical education has predominantly been studied from a cognitive perspective, despite its complex contextual characteristics, which influence medical students' learning experiences in such a way that explanation in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes and single determinants of instructiveness is unlikely to suffice. There is also a paucity of research which, from a perspective other than the cognitive or descriptive one, investigates student learning in general practice settings, which are often characterised as powerful learning environments. In this study we took a socio-cultural perspective to clarify how students learn during a general practice clerkship and to construct a conceptual framework that captures this type of learning. Our analysis of group interviews with 44 fifth-year undergraduate medical students about their learning experiences in general practice showed that students needed developmental space to be able to learn and develop their professional identity. This space results from the intertwinement of workplace context, personal and professional interactions and emotions such as feeling respected and self-confident. These forces framed students' participation in patient consultations, conversations with supervisors about consultations and students' observation of supervisors, thereby determining the opportunities afforded to students to mind their learning. These findings resonate with other conceptual frameworks and learning theories. In order to refine our interpretation, we recommend that further research from a socio-cultural perspective should also explore other aspects of workplace learning in medical education.",

    "abstract": "World-wide, universities in health sciences have transformed their curriculum to include collaborative learning and facilitate the students' learning process. Interaction has been acknowledged to be the synergistic element in this learning context. However, students spend the majority of their time outside their classroom and interaction does not stop outside the classroom. Therefore we studied how informal social interaction influences student learning. Moreover, to explore what really matters in the students learning process, a model was tested how the generally known important constructs-prior performance, motivation and social integration-relate to informal social interaction and student learning. 301 undergraduate medical students participated in this cross-sectional quantitative study. Informal social interaction was assessed using self-reported surveys following the network approach. Students' individual motivation, social integration and prior performance were assessed by the Academic Motivation Scale, the College Adaption Questionnaire and students' GPA respectively. A factual knowledge test represented student' learning. All social networks were positively associated with student learning significantly: friendships (β = 0.11), providing information to other students (β = 0.16), receiving information from other students (β = 0.25). Structural equation modelling revealed a model in which social networks increased student learning (r = 0.43), followed by prior performance (r = 0.31). In contrast to prior literature, students' academic motivation and social integration were not associated with students' learning. Students' informal social interaction is strongly associated with students' learning. These findings underline the need to change our focus from the formal context (classroom) to the informal context to optimize student learning and deliver modern medics.",

However, surprisingly little research has been published emanating from authentic higher education settings about the nature and mechanism of the pre-assessment learning effects of summative assessment. Less still emanates from health sciences education settings. This study explored the pre-assessment learning effects of summative assessment in theoretical modules by exploring the variables at play in a multifaceted assessment system and the relationships between them. Using a grounded theory strategy, in-depth interviews were conducted with individual medical students and analyzed qualitatively. Respondents' learning was influenced by task demands and system design. Assessment impacted on respondents' cognitive processing activities and metacognitive regulation activities. Individually, our findings confirm findings from other studies in disparate non-medical settings and identify some new factors at play in this setting. Taken together, findings from this study provide, for the first time, some insight into how a whole assessment system influences student learning over time in a medical education setting. The findings from this authentic and complex setting paint a nuanced picture of how intricate and multifaceted interactions between various factors in an assessment system interact to influence student learning. A model linking the sources, mechanism and consequences of the pre-assessment learning effects of summative assessment is proposed that could help enhance the use of summative assessment as a tool to augment learning.",

A PubMed search of the literature published before 8 January 2009 yielded 39 articles dealing with 18 different assessment instruments. One researcher extracted data on the characteristics of the instruments and two researchers extracted data on feasibility, reliability, validity and educational effect. Instruments are predominantly formative. Feasibility is generally deemed good and assessor training occurs sparsely but is considered crucial for successful implementation. Acceptable reliability can be achieved with 10 encounters. The validity of many instruments is not investigated, but the validity of the mini-CEX and the 'clinical evaluation exercise' is supported by strong and significant correlations with other valid assessment instruments. The evidence from the few studies on educational effects is not very convincing. The reports on clinical assessment instruments for single work-based encounters are generally positive, but supporting evidence is sparse. Feasibility of instruments seems to be good and reliability requires a minimum of 10 encounters, but no clear conclusions emerge on other aspects. Studies on assessor and learner training and studies examining effects beyond 'happiness data' are badly needed.",

This study investigated the effects of fidelity of open patient cases in adjunct to an instructional e-module on students' cognitive skills and motivation. We set up a three-group randomized post-test-only design: a control group working on an e-module; a cases group, combining the e-module with low-fidelity text-based patient cases, and a game group, combining the e-module with a high-fidelity simulation game with the same cases. Participants completed questionnaires on cognitive load and motivation. After a 4-week study period, blinded assessors rated students' cognitive emergency care skills in two mannequin-based scenarios. In total 61 students participated and were assessed; 16 control group students, 20 cases students and 25 game students. Learning time was 2 h longer for the cases and game groups than for the control group. Acquired cognitive skills did not differ between groups. The game group experienced higher intrinsic and germane cognitive load than the cases group (p = 0.03 and 0.01) and felt more engaged (p < 0.001). Students did not profit from working on open cases (in adjunct to an e-module), which nonetheless challenged them to study longer. The e-module appeared to be very effective, while the high-fidelity game, although engaging, probably distracted students and impeded learning. Medical educators designing motivating and effective skills training for novices should align case complexity and fidelity with students' proficiency level. The relation between case-fidelity, motivation and skills development is an important field for further study.",

    "abstract": "The educational environment has been increasingly acknowledged as vital for high-quality medical education. As a result, several instruments have been developed to measure medical educational environment quality. However, there appears to be no consensus about which concepts should be measured. The absence of a theoretical framework may explain this lack of consensus. Therefore, we aimed to (1) find a comprehensive theoretical framework defining the essential concepts, and (2) test its applicability. An initial review of the medical educational environment literature indicated that such frameworks are lacking. Therefore, we chose an alternative approach to lead us to relevant frameworks from outside the medical educational field; that is, we applied a snowballing technique to find educational environment instruments used to build the contents of the medical ones and investigated their theoretical underpinnings (Study 1). We found two frameworks, one of which was described as incomplete and one of which defines three domains as the key elements of human environments (personal development/goal direction, relationships, and system maintenance and system change) and has been validated in different contexts. To test its applicability, we investigated whether the items of nine medical educational environment instruments could be mapped unto the framework (Study 2). Of 374 items, 94% could: 256 (68%) pertained to a single domain, 94 (25%) to more than one domain. In our context, these domains were found to concern goal orientation, relationships and organization/regulation. We conclude that this framework is applicable and comprehensive, and recommend using it as theoretical underpinning for medical educational environment measures.",

    "abstract": "To prevent radiologists from overlooking lesions, radiology textbooks recommend \"systematic viewing,\" a technique whereby anatomical areas are inspected in a fixed order. This would ensure complete inspection (full coverage) of the image and, in turn, improve diagnostic performance. To test this assumption, two experiments were performed. Both experiments investigated the relationship between systematic viewing, coverage, and diagnostic performance. Additionally, the first investigated whether systematic viewing increases with expertise; the second investigated whether novices benefit from full-coverage or systematic viewing training. In Experiment 1, 11 students, ten residents, and nine radiologists inspected five chest radiographs. Experiment 2 had 75 students undergo a training in either systematic, full-coverage (without being systematic) or non-systematic viewing. Eye movements and diagnostic performance were measured throughout both experiments. In Experiment 1, no significant correlations were found between systematic viewing and coverage, r = -.10, p = .62, and coverage and performance, r = -.06, p = .74. Experts were significantly more systematic than students F2,25 = 4.35, p = .02. In Experiment 2, significant correlations were found between systematic viewing and coverage, r = -.35, p < .01, but not between coverage and performance, r = .13, p = .31. Participants in the full-coverage training performed worse compared with both other groups, which did not differ between them, F2,71 = 3.95, p = .02. In conclusion, the data question the assumption that systematic viewing leads to increased coverage, and, consequently, to improved performance. Experts inspected cases more systematically, but students did not benefit from systematic viewing training.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rise in the efforts to implement diversity topics into medical education, using either a 'narrow' or a 'broad' definition of culture. These developments urge that outcomes of such efforts are systematically evaluated by mapping the curriculum for diversity-responsive content. This study was aimed at using an intersectionality-based approach to define diversity-related learning objectives and to evaluate how biomedical and sociocultural aspects of diversity were integrated into a medical curriculum in the Netherlands. We took a three-phase mixed methods approach. In phase one and two, we defined essential learning objectives based on qualitative interviews with school stakeholders and diversity literature. In phase three, we screened the written curriculum for diversity content (culture, sex/gender and class) and related the results to learning objectives defined in phase two. We identified learning objectives in three areas of education (medical knowledge and skills, patient–physician communication, and reflexivity). Most diversity content pertained to biomedical knowledge and skills. Limited attention was paid to sociocultural issues as determinants of health and healthcare use. Intersections of culture, sex/gender and class remained mostly unaddressed. The curriculum's diversity-responsiveness could be improved by an operationalization of diversity that goes beyond biomedical traits of assumed homogeneous social groups. Future efforts to take an intersectionality-based approach to curriculum evaluations should include categories of difference other than culture, sex/gender and class as separate, equally important patient identities or groups.",

    "abstract": "Arguably, constructive alignment has been the major challenge for assessment in the context of problem-based learning (PBL). PBL focuses on promoting abilities such as clinical reasoning, team skills and metacognition. PBL also aims to foster self-directed learning and deep learning as opposed to rote learning. This has incentivized researchers in assessment to find possible solutions. Originally, these solutions were sought in developing the right instruments to measure these PBL-related skills. The search for these instruments has been accelerated by the emergence of competency-based education. With competency-based education assessment moved away from purely standardized testing, relying more heavily on professional judgment of complex skills. Valuable lessons have been learned that are directly relevant for assessment in PBL. Later, solutions were sought in the development of new assessment strategies, initially again with individual instruments such as progress testing, but later through a more holistic approach to the assessment program as a whole. Programmatic assessment is such an integral approach to assessment. It focuses on optimizing learning through assessment, while at the same gathering rich information that can be used for rigorous decision-making about learner progression. Programmatic assessment comes very close to achieving the desired constructive alignment with PBL, but its wide adoption-just like PBL-will take many years ahead of us.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many educational institutions in higher education switched to problem-based learning (PBL) in the last 5 decades. Despite its’ successful implementation worldwide, many institutions still encounter problems in their daily teaching practices that limit deep learning in students. This raises the question: How else can we look at PBL practice and research? The main argument of this reflective paper is to better align PBL practice with the theories or principles of contextual, constructive, self-directed and collaborative learning. This paper explains what these principles or theories are. In addition, it discusses a new way to bridge theory and practice: design-based research (DBR), which combines redesigning theory-based teaching practices with investigating these practices in close collaboration with various stakeholders. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to address the problems encountered in PBL. We should be very careful in drawing conclusions about which PBL approach works best. No single solution works optimally under all conditions. At most, DBR can help us gain better insight into why PBL with certain characteristics, preferably based on theory, might work in a specific context with particular goals in mind.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Health disparities faced by transgender people are partly explained by barriers to trans-inclusive healthcare, which in turn are linked to a lack of transgender health education in medical school curricula. We carried out a theory-driven systematic review with the aim to (1) provide an overview of key characteristics of training initiatives and pedagogical features, and (2) analyze barriers and facilitators to implementing this training in medical education. We used queer theory to contextualize our findings. We searched the PubMed/Ovid MEDLINE database (October 2009 to December 2021) for original studies that reported on transgender content within medical schools and residency programs ( N = 46). We performed a thematic analysis to identify training characteristics, pedagogical features, barriers and facilitators. Most training consisted of single-session interventions, with varying modes of delivery. Most interventions were facilitated by instructors with a range of professional experience and half covered general LGBT+-content. Thematic analysis highlighted barriers including lack of educational materials, lack of faculty expertise, time/costs constraints, and challenges in recruiting and compensating transgender guest speakers. Facilitators included scaffolding learning throughout the curriculum, drawing on expertise of transgender people and engaging learners in skills-based training. Sustainable implementation of transgender-health objectives in medical education faces persistent institutional barriers. These barriers are rooted in normative biases inherent to biomedical knowledge production, and an understanding of categories of sex and gender as uncomplicated. Medical schools should facilitate trans-inclusive educational strategies to combat transgender-health inequities, which should include a critical stance toward binary conceptualizations of sex and gender throughout the curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Professional identity impacts the workforce at personal, interpersonal and profession levels however there is a lack of reviews of professional identity research across practising health professionals. To summarise professional identity research in the health professions literature and explore how professional identity is described a scoping review was conducted by searching Medline, Psycinfo, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Business Source Complete using “professional identity” and related terms for 32 health professions. Empirical studies of professional identity in post-registration health professionals were examined with health profession, career stage, background to research, theoretical underpinnings and constructs of professional identity being extracted, charted and analysed using content analysis where relevant. From 9941 studies, 160 studies across 17 health professions were identified, with nursing and medicine most common. Twenty studies focussed on professional identity in the five years post-entry to the workforce and 56 studies did not state career stage. The most common background for the research was the impact of political, social and healthcare reforms and advances. Thirty five percent of studies (n = 57) stated the use of a theory or framework of identity, the most common being classified as social theories. Individual constructs of professional identity across the research were categorised into five themes— The Lived Experience of Professional Identity; The World Around Me; Belonging; Me; and Learning and Qualifications . Descriptions of professional identity are broad, varied, rich and multi-layered however the literature is under theorised with current theories potentially inadequate to capture its complexity and make meaningful contributions to the allied health professions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The concepts of metacognitive reflection, reflection, and metacognition are distinct but have undergone shifts in meaning as they migrated into medical education. Conceptual clarity is essential to the construction of the knowledge base of medical education and its educational interventions. We conducted a theoretical integrative review across diverse bodies of literature with the goal of understanding what metacognitive reflection is. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Web of Science databases, including all peer-reviewed research articles and theoretical papers as well as book chapters that addressed the topic, with no limitations for date, language, or location. A total of 733 articles were identified and 87 were chosen after careful review and application of exclusion criteria. The work of conceptually and empirically delineating metacognitive reflection has begun. Contributions have been made to root metacognitive reflection in the concept of metacognition and moving beyond it to engage in cycles of reflection. Other work has underscored its affective component, transformational nature, and contextual factors. Despite this merging of threads to develop a richer conceptualization, a theory of how metacognitive reflection works is elusive. Debates address whether metacognition drives reflection or vice versa. It has also been suggested that learners evolve along on a continuum from thinking, to task-related reflection, to self-reflection, and finally to metacognitive reflection. Based on prior theory and research, as well as the findings of this review, we propose the following conceptualization: Metacognitive reflection involves heightened internal observation, awareness, monitoring, and regulation of our own knowledge, experiences, and emotions by questioning and examining cognition and emotional processes to continually refine and enhance our perspectives and decisions while thoughtfully accounting for context. We argue that metacognitive reflection brings a shift in perspective and can support valuable reconceptualization for lifelong learning.",

    "abstract": "Research on assessment in medical education has strongly focused on individual measurement instruments and their psychometric quality. Without detracting from the value of this research, such an approach is not sufficient to high quality assessment of competence as a whole. A programmatic approach is advocated which presupposes criteria for designing comprehensive assessment programmes and for assuring their quality. The paucity of research with relevance to programmatic assessment, and especially its development, prompted us to embark on a research project to develop design principles for programmes of assessment. We conducted focus group interviews to explore the experiences and views of nine assessment experts concerning good practices and new ideas about theoretical and practical issues in programmes of assessment. The discussion was analysed, mapping all aspects relevant for design onto a framework, which was iteratively adjusted to fit the data until saturation was reached. The overarching framework for designing programmes of assessment consists of six assessment programme dimensions: Goals, Programme in Action, Support, Documenting, Improving and Accounting. The model described in this paper can help to frame programmes of assessment; it not only provides a common language, but also a comprehensive picture of the dimensions to be covered when formulating design principles. It helps identifying areas concerning assessment in which ample research and development has been done. But, more importantly, it also helps to detect underserved areas. A guiding principle in design of assessment programmes is fitness for purpose. High quality assessment can only be defined in terms of its goals.",

    "abstract": "Doctor-patient communication has been extensively studied in non-Western contexts and in relation to patients' cultural and education backgrounds. This study explores the perceived ideal communication style for doctor-patient consultations and the reality of actual practice in a Southeast Asian context. We conducted the study in a teaching hospital in Indonesia, using a qualitative and a quantitative design. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten internal medicine specialists, ten internal medicine residents, 16 patients in two groups based on education level and ten most senior medical students. The contributions of doctors and patients to the communication during consultations were observed and rated quantitatively by thirty internal medicine residents, 393 patients with different educational backgrounds and ten senior medical students. The 'informed and shared decision making' is the central observation in this quantitative study. The results of the interviews showed that Southeast Asian stakeholders are in favor of a partnership style of communication and revealed barriers to achieving this: doctors and patients are not prepared for a participatory style and high patient load due to an inefficient health care system does not allow sufficient time for this type of communication. The results of the quantitative study showed a sharp contrast between observed and ideal communication styles. A paternalistic style seems to prevail, irrespective of patients' educational background. We found a sharp conflict between ideal and reality concerning doctor-patient communication in a Southeast Asian context. Further studies should examine ways to change the prevailing communication style in the desired direction.",

Seventeen PBL classes (N = 241) were randomly assigned to two experimental groups—one with a worksheet provided and the other without. Students' learning of the topic at hand was evaluated by comparing results from pre- and post-lesson concept recall tests. We also obtained information about students' perceptions of factors impacting their learning using a Learning Impact Questionnaire. The data was analyzed by means of analyses of variance. Results of the study indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the levels of understanding for both groups of students. In addition, survey results revealed that the strongest factor perceived by students to impact their learning in a PBL context is the tutor followed by team and class dynamics, while the influence of the worksheet was rated lowest. These findings suggest that scaffolds such as worksheets may not play a significant role in enhancing students' learning within the social constructivist framework of problem-based learning. On the other hand, the importance of the role of tutor and collaborative small group learning which are key features of PBL is reinforced.",

    "abstract": "The recent rise of interest among the medical education community in individual faculty making subjective judgments about medical trainee performance appears to be directly related to the introduction of notions of integrated competency-based education and assessment for learning. Although it is known that assessor expertise plays an important role in performance assessment, the roles played by different factors remain to be unraveled. We therefore conducted an exploratory study with the aim of building a preliminary model to gain a better understanding of assessor expertise. Using a grounded theory approach, we conducted seventeen semi-structured interviews with individual faculty members who differed in professional background and assessment experience. The interviews focused on participants' perceptions of how they arrived at judgments about student performance. The analysis resulted in three categories and three recurring themes within these categories: the categories assessor characteristics, assessors' perceptions of the assessment tasks, and the assessment context, and the themes perceived challenges, coping strategies, and personal development. Central to understanding the key processes in performance assessment appear to be the dynamic interrelatedness of the different factors and the developmental nature of the processes. The results are supported by literature from the field of expertise development and in line with findings from social cognition research. The conceptual framework has implications for faculty development and the design of programs of assessment.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of selection, educational background, age and gender on strength of motivation to attend and pursue medical school. Graduate entry (GE) medical students (having Bachelor's degree in Life Sciences or related field) and Non-Graduate Entry (NGE) medical students (having only completed high school), were asked to fill out the Strength of Motivation for Medical School (SMMS) questionnaire at the start of medical school. The questionnaire measures the willingness of the medical students to pursue medical education even in the face of difficulty and sacrifice. GE students (59.64 ± 7.30) had higher strength of motivation as compared to NGE students (55.26 ± 8.33), so did females (57.05 ± 8.28) as compared to males (54.30 ± 8.08). 7.9% of the variance in the SMMS scores could be explained with the help of a linear regression model with age, gender and educational background/selection as predictor variables. Age was the single largest predictor. Maturity, taking developmental differences between sexes into account, was used as a predictor to correct for differences in the maturation of males and females. Still, the gender differences prevailed, though they were reduced. Pre-entrance educational background and selection also predicted the strength of motivation, but the effect of the two was confounded. Strength of motivation appears to be a dynamic entity, changing primarily with age and maturity and to a small extent with gender and experience.",

    "abstract": "Tutors in a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum are thought to play active roles in guiding students to develop frameworks for use in the construction of knowledge. This implies that both subject-matter expertise and the ability of tutors to facilitate the learning process must be important in helping students learn. This study examines the behavioural effects of tutors in terms of subject-matter expertise, social congruence and cognitive congruence on students' learning process and on their final achievement. The extent of students' learning at each PBL phase was estimated by tracking the number of relevant concepts recalled at the end of each learning phase, while student achievement was based on students' ability to describe and elaborate upon the relationship between relevant concepts learned. By using Analysis of Covariance, social congruence of the tutor was found to have a significant influence on learning in each PBL phase while all of the tutor-related behaviours had a significant impact on student achievement. The results suggest that the ability of tutors to communicate informally with students and hence create a less threatening learning environment that promotes a free flow exchange of ideas, has a greater impact on learning at each of the PBL phases as compared to tutors' subject-matter expertise and their ability to explain concepts in a way that is easily understood by students. The data presented indicates that these tutor-related behaviours are determinants of learning in a PBL curriculum, with social congruence having a greater influence on learning in the different PBL phases.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with exploring the relationship between perceptions of professional identities, interprofessional education (IPE) and collaborative practice. It seeks to introduce the concept of interprofessional responsibility as both a shift in the way in which to conceptualise the professional identity of Health and Social Care (H&SC) staff and as a new set of practices that help to inform the way in which students are prepared for collaborative working. The presented research, undertaken as part of a Ph.D. study, is based upon semi-structured interviews (n = 33) with H&SC staff who were recruited from both the United Kingdom (UK) Health Service and UK universities. Drawing upon thematic analysis of the data, the results of the research identified that previous conceptualisations of professional identity aligned to a whole profession do not relate to the way in which professionals perceive their identities. Senior professionals claimed to be more comfortable with their own professional identity, and with working across professional boundaries, than junior colleagues. Academic staff also identified that much IPE currently taught in universities serves the purpose of box-ticking rather than being delivered in meaningful way. It is proposed that the findings have implications for the way in which IPE is currently taught, and that adoption of the proposed concept of 'interprofessional responsibility' may help address some of the concerns these findings raise.",

    "abstract": "This longitudinal study aimed at investigating Polish medical students' career choice motivation, factors influencing specialty choices, professional plans and expectations. The same cohort of students responded to the same questionnaire, at the end of Year 1 and Year 6. The Chi-square, Mann–Whitney U tests and logistic regression were used in analyses. The results showed that altruistic and scientific reasons were the main motives for choosing a medical career. The motives remained stable over time. The effect of gender on altruistic motivation was stronger at the end of the study, with females' rating higher. The most favored career paths were associated with non-primary care specializations and work in a hospital. Results of the multivariate logistic regression showed that primary care specializations were more attractive to females, final year students, those from small agglomerations, and those less concerned about high earnings. Preferences regarding sector of work were formed at later stages of training. A preference shift was observed, between Year 1 and Year 6, towards favoring work in the public sector. Predictors of the desire to work in the public sector were: being a male and the final year student, paying less attention to high earnings, wanting certainty of finding work, having a stronger need for interesting and socially important work. A significant decline in the level of interest in seeking employment abroad was observed with the progress of studies. Our findings are likely to provide useful information for educators, policy planners and policy makers.",

We start by presenting evidence that traits are no longer regarded as stable deterministic predictors of behaviour. Instead, traits are found to change across generations, the life span, and in response to environmental contingencies. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore how traits change as function of medical education. Second, drawing on recent theory and research (behavioural reaction norms and the density distribution model) we highlight evidence to show how the expression of trait relevant behaviour is dependent on context, and is distributed with an average (typical behaviour or personality) and a variance (plasticity or adaptability), with traditional personality measure associated with typical responding. Third, we demystify that some traits are better than others showing that so-called \"good\" traits have a dark-side. Fourth, we show how these developments impact on how personality might be assessed, thereby presenting recent evidence on the use of contextualized personality measures, situational judgment tests, other reports, and implicit measures. Throughout the paper, we outline the key implications of these developments for medical selection practices.",

    "abstract": "While portfolios have seen an unprecedented surge in popularity, they have also become the subject of controversy: learners often perceive little gain from writing reflections as part of their portfolios; scholars question the ethics of such obligatory reflection; and students, residents, teachers and scholars alike condemn the bureaucracy surrounding portfolio implementation in competency-based education. It could be argued that mass adoption without careful attention to purpose and format may well jeopardize portfolios' viability in health sciences education. This paper explores this proposition by addressing the following three main questions: (1) Why do portfolios meet with such resistance from students and teachers, while educators love them?; (2) Is it ethical to require students to reflect and then grade their reflections?; (3) Does competency-based education empower or hamper the learner during workplace-based learning? Twenty-five years of portfolio reveal a clear story: without mentoring, portfolios have no future and are nothing short of bureaucratic hurdles in our competency-based education programs. Moreover, comprehensive portfolios, which are integrated into the curriculum and much more diverse in content than reflective portfolios, can serve as meaningful patient charts, providing doctor and patient with useful information to discuss well-being and treatment. In this sense, portfolios are also learner charts that comprehensively document progress in a learning trajectory which is lubricated by meaningful dialogue between learner and mentor in a trusting relationship to foster learning. If we are able to make such comprehensive and meaningful use of portfolios, then, yes, portfolios do have a bright future in medical education.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 2 decades, as part of reforms to the National Health Service and with it organizational changes to ambulance work in the UK, paramedic education has undergone a process of academisation and a shift from in-house, apprenticeship weeks-long occupational training, to university-based undergraduate programs. While the professional regulation and standardization of Allied Health Professionals' education in high-income countries has captured scholarly attention, the study of paramedic practice is still in its infancy and there is a need to explore its evolvement in relation to the fluid societal–political circumstances affecting its provision and demand. Based on interviews with front-line paramedics, paramedic educators and paramedic science students in the South of England, this article examines how the reforms to paramedic education have impacted the professionalization of paramedics and their discourse of professionalism. Framed within to the 'new' sociology of professions, the case of British paramedics demonstrates the complex nature of the relationship between the university and professional practice. It appears that universities, the providers of paramedic education, are caught between two opposing discourses of professionalism: on the one hand, that of providing a platform for students' socialization and engagement with professionalism 'from within' practice which is based on students' common goals and mutual experiences, and, on the other hand, serving as a conduit for managerial/organizational strategies of professionalism which appear to undermine the role of university socialization.",

In order to prevent or reduce burnout in medical residents, we should gain a better understanding of contributing and protective factors of burnout. Therefore we examined the associations of job demands and resources, home demands and resources, and work-home interferences with burnout in male and female medical residents. This study was conducted on a nation-wide sample of medical residents. In 2005, all Dutch medical residents (n = 5245) received a self-report questionnaire on burnout, job and home demands and resources and work-home interference. Path analysis was used to examine the associations between job and home characteristics and work-home interference and burnout in both males and females. In total, 2115 (41.1 %) residents completed the questionnaire. In both sexes emotional demands at work and the interference between work and home were important contributors to burnout, especially when work interferes with home life. Opportunities for job development appeared to be an important protective factor. Other contributing and protective factors were different for male and female residents. In females, social support from family or partner seemed protective against burnout. In males, social support from colleagues and participation in decision-making at work seemed important. Effectively handling emotional demands at work, dealing with the interference between work and home, and having opportunities for job development are the most essential factors which should be addressed. However it is important to take gender differences into consideration when implementing preventive or therapeutic interventions for burnout in medical residents.",

    "abstract": "Education in implementation science, which involves the training of health professionals in how to implement evidence-based findings into health practice systematically, has become a highly relevant topic in health sciences education. The present study advances education in implementation science by compiling a competence profile for implementation practice and research and by exploring implementation experts' sources of expertise. The competence profile is theoretically based on educational psychology, which implies the definition of improvable and teachable competences. In an online-survey, an international, multidisciplinary sample of 82 implementation experts named competences that they considered most helpful for conducting implementation practice and implementation research. For these competences, they also indicated whether they had acquired them in their professional education, additional training, or by self-study and on-the-job experience. Data were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach that combined qualitative content analyses with descriptive statistics. The participants deemed collaboration knowledge and skills most helpful for implementation practice. For implementation research, they named research methodology knowledge and skills as the most important ones. The participants had acquired most of the competences that they found helpful for implementation practice in self-study or by on-the-job experience. However, participants had learned most of their competences for implementation research in their professional education. The present results inform education and training activities in implementation science and serve as a starting point for a fluid set of interdisciplinary implementation science competences that will be updated continuously. Implications for curriculum development and the design of educational activities are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Although the evidence base around uncertainty and education has expanded in recent years, a lack of clarity around conceptual terms and a heterogeneity of study designs means that this landscape remains indistinct. This scoping review explores how undergraduate health professions' students learn to engage with uncertainty related to their academic practice. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review which examines teaching and learning related to uncertainty across multiple health professions. The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework of (Arksey and O'Malley in Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework International Journal of Social Research Methodology 8(1) 19-32, 2005). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, ISI Web of Science, and CINAHL and hand-searched selected health professions' education journals. The search strategy yielded a total of 5,017 articles, of which 97 were included in the final review. Four major themes were identified: \"Learners' interactions with uncertainty\"; \"Factors that influence learner experiences\"; \"Educational outcomes\"; and, \"Teaching and learning approaches\". Our findings highlight that uncertainty is a ubiquitous concern in health professions' education, with students experiencing different forms of uncertainty at many stages of their training. These experiences are influenced by both individual and system-related factors. Formal teaching strategies that directly support learning around uncertainty were infrequent, and included arts-based teaching, and clinical case presentations. Students also met with uncertainty indirectly through problem-based learning, clinical teaching, humanities teaching, simulation, team-based learning, small group learning, tactical games, online discussion of anatomy topics, and virtual patients. Reflection and reflective practice are also mentioned as strategies within the literature.",

However, the effects of such training programs on students’ metacognitive knowledge, use of learning strategies, and academic performance in the longer term are unknown. In the present study, all first-year pharmacology students from one university attended a learning strategy training program, i.e., the ‘Study Smart program’, in their first weeks. The 20% (n = 25) lowest scoring students on the first midterm received further support regarding their learning strategies. Results showed that all students gained accurate metacognitive knowledge about (in)effective learning strategies in the short- and long-term and reported to use less highlighting, less rereading, but more interleaving, elaboration, and distributed practice after the training program. Academic performance was compared to the prior cohort, which had not received the Study Smart program. While in the previous cohort, students in the top, middle, and bottom rank of midterm 1 stayed in these ranks and still differed significantly in the final exam, students in the Study Smart cohort that received the training program improved throughout the year and differences between ranks were significantly reduced. A learning strategy training program including a remediation track for lower performing students can thus support students to study more effectively and enhance equal chances for all students at university.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Professionals will increasingly be confronted with new insights and changes. This raises questions as to what kind of expertise professionals need, and how development of this expertise can be influenced within the contexts of both education and work. The terms adaptive expertise and adaptive performance are well-known concepts in the domains of education and Human Resource Development respectively. The literature, however, lacks a conceptual overview. Our research seeks to provide an overview on how adaptive expertise and adaptive performance are conceptualized. In addition we looked for what individual, task and organizational characteristics relate to adaptive expertise. We mined information drawn from existing reviews in an overview of reviews. Nine reviews met the inclusion criteria. Adaptive performance is best referred to as the visible expression of an adaptive expert and this is triggered by ‘change’. The scope of this ‘change’ lies somewhere between change that is ‘new for the learner’ and change that is ‘new for everyone in the whole world’. The extent to and way in which a learner or professional is able to deal with this change depends on the maturity of the learner or professional. We found numerous individual, task and environmental characteristics related to adaptive expertise and adaptive performance. The nature and relation of these characteristics, and their specificity in relation to adaptive expertise and adaptive performance are visualized in a figure, but also provide several suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The number of studies on the effects of mindfulness on healthcare professionals is increasing. The main aim of this study was to collate the quantitative results of original studies analyzing the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on a variety of outcomes in medical students. We also analyzed how the study design and characteristics of the intervention affect the results, and identified qualitative effects of mindfulness interventions. A literature search was performed in different databases in June 2020. Original articles meeting the following criteria were included: (1) at least 50% of the participants were medical students, (2) included a mindfulness intervention, (3) analyzed any outcome relating to mindfulness intervention, (4) peer-reviewed (5) written in English. Eventually, 31 articles including 24 different samples were included. Over half of the studies were RCTs. In over half of the studies, the intervention was 4- to 10-week original Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy or a modification of these. In general, satisfaction with the interventions was good. Based on a meta-analysis, after the intervention, the intervention group had statistically significantly fewer symptoms of stress and distress and had higher mindfulness than the controls. The beneficial effects persisted in follow-ups over months or years. Both long and shorter courses and courses with and without face-to-face sessions were effective. Both controlled and uncontrolled studies had statistically significant results. Qualitative results revealed potential factors behind the quantitative effects. The number of studies on mindfulness interventions in medical students has increased drastically. Mindfulness-based interventions seem to offer a good possibility to enhance medical students’ well-being.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In their interactions with patients and health care professionals during work-based learning, medical students are known to experience emotionally challenging situations that can evoke negative feelings. Students have to manage these emotions. Students learn and develop their professional identity formation through interactions with patients and members of the healthcare teams. Earlier studies have highlighted the issues involved with processing emotionally challenging situations, although studies concerning learning and professional identity formation in response to these experiences are rare. In this study, we explored medical students’ experiences of emotionally challenging situations in work-based learning, and the impact these experiences had on forming medical students’ professional identities. We conducted an analysis of narrative data ( n = 85), using a constructivist grounded theory approach. The narratives were made up of medical students’ reflective essays at the end of their education (tenth term). The analysis showed that students’ main concern when facing emotionally challenging situations during their work-based education was the struggle to achieve and maintain a professional approach. They reported different strategies for managing their feelings and how these strategies led to diverse consequences. In the process, students also described arriving at insights into their own personal needs and shortcomings. We consider this development of self-awareness and resulting self-knowledge to be an important part of the continuously ongoing socialization process of forming a professional identity. Thus, experiencing emotionally challenging situations can be considered a unique and invaluable opportunity, as well as a catalyst for students’ development. We believe that highlighting the impact of emotions in medical education can constitute an important contribution to knowledge about the process of professional identity formation. This knowledge can enable faculty to provide students with more effective and sufficient support, facilitating their journey in becoming physicians.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Serious games, as a learning resource, enhance their game character by embedding game design elements that are typically used in entertainment games. Serious games in its entirety have already proven their teaching effectiveness in different educational contexts including medical education. The embedded game design elements play an essential role for a game’s effectiveness and thus they should be selected based on evidence-based theories. For game design elements embedded in serious games used for the education of medical and healthcare professions, an overview of theories for the selection lacks. Additionally, it is still unclear whether and how single game design elements affect the learning effectiveness. Therefore, the main aim of this systematic review is threefold. Firstly, light will be shed on the single game design elements used in serious games in this area. Second, the game design elements’ underlying theories will be worked out, and third, the game design elements’ effectiveness on student learning outcome will be assessed. Two literature searches were conducted in November 2021 and May 2022 in six literature databases with keywords covering the fields of educational game design, serious game, and medical education. Out of 1006 initial records, 91 were included after applying predefined exclusion criteria. Data analysis revealed that the three most common game design elements were points, storyline, and feedback. Only four underlying theories were mentioned, and no study evaluated specific game design elements. Since game design elements should be based on theories to ensure meaningful evaluations, the conceptual GATE framework is introduced, which facilitates the selection of evidence-based game design elements for serious games.",

    "abstract": "As trainees resist social harm and injustice in medicine, they must navigate the tension between pushing too hard and risking their reputation, or not enough and risking no change at all. We explore the discernment process by examining what trainees attend to moments before and while they are resisting to understand how they manage this tension. We interviewed 18 medical trainees who shared stories of resisting social harm and injustice in their training environments. Interviews were analyzed using open and focused coding using Vinthagen and Johansson's work, which conceptualizes resistance as a dynamic process that includes an individual's subjectivity within a larger system, the context in which they find themselves, and the interactions they have with others. We framed these acts as an individuals' attempt to undermine power, while also being entangled with that power and needing it for their efforts. When deciding on how and whether to resist, trainees underwent a cost-benefit analysis weighing the potential risk against their chances at change. They considered how their acts may influence their relationship with others, whether resisting would damage personal and programmatic reputations, and the embodied and social cues of other stakeholders involved. Trainees undergo a dynamic assessment process in which they analyze large amounts of information to keep themselves safe from potential retaliation. It is by attending to these various factors in their environment that trainees are able to keep their acts professional, and continue to do this challenging work in medical education.",

    "abstract": "Several reasons have been given why students should have contacts with real patients early in the undergraduate medical curriculum, i.e., in the preclinical phase. However, it is not clear exactly what effects early patient contacts have with regard to knowledge construction and the development of clinical reasoning skills. We sought students' views of the effects of preclinical real patient contacts on their learning, knowledge construction and development of clinical reasoning. Twenty-four students in the third and last preclinical year of a 6-year undergraduate medical programme were divided into three focus groups which met twice, after which saturation was reached. The discussions were recorded and transcribed. Summaries of the discussions were approved by the students after some modifications. Atlas-ti software was used to create a coding framework resulting in identification of main themes and sub themes. Early patient contacts motivate students to study, help them understand the impact of illness on patients' lives, and enhance professional socialisation and memory processes. Students distinguish between analytic and non-analytic clinical reasoning in connection with real patients. Analytic reasoning involves clinical and basic science knowledge. Non-analytic reasoning involves pattern recognition and is made possible by experiential learning from different patient contacts. The students indicate that seeing real patients early in their training has several positive effects on their learning. The contacts enhance knowledge construction and clinical reasoning. Although our results will have to be validated by quantitative, observational and experimental research, they imply that educational benefits are to be gained from real patient contacts in the preclinical phase of medical education.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has documented that negative experiences in chemistry courses are a major factor that discourages many students from continuing in premedical studies. This adverse impact affects women and students from under-represented minority (URM) groups disproportionately. To determine if chemistry courses have a similar effect at a large public university, we surveyed 1,036 students from three entering cohorts at the University of California, Berkeley. We surveyed students at the beginning of their first year at the university and again at the end of their second year. All subjects had indicated an interest in premedical studies at the time they entered the university. We conducted follow-up interviews with a stratified sub-set of 63 survey respondents to explore the factors that affected their level of interest in premedical studies. Using a 10-point scale, we found that the strength of interest in premedical studies declined for all racial/ethnic groups. In the follow-up interviews, students identified chemistry courses as the principal factor contributing to their reported loss of interest. URM students especially often stated that chemistry courses caused them to abandon their hopes of becoming a physician. Consistent with reports over more than 50 years, it appears that undergraduate courses in chemistry have the effect of discouraging otherwise qualified students, as reflected in their admission to one of the most highly selective public universities in the US, from continuing in premedical studies, especially in the case of URM students. Reassessment of this role for chemistry courses may be overdue.",

    "abstract": "The Strength of Motivation for Medical School (SMMS) questionnaire is designed to determine the strength of motivation of students particularly for medical study. This research was performed to establish the validity evidence for measuring strength of motivation for medical school. Internal structure and relations to other variables were used as the sources of validity evidence. The SMMS questionnaire was filled out by 1,494 medical students in different years of medical curriculum. The validity evidence for the internal structure was analyzed by principal components analysis with promax rotation. Validity evidence for relations to other variables was tested by comparing the SMMS scores with scores on the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) and the exhaustion scale of Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS) for measuring study stress. Evidence for internal consistency was determined through the Cronbach's alpha for reliability. The analysis showed that the SMMS had a 3-factor structure. The validity in relations to other variables was established as both, the subscales and full scale scores significantly correlated positively with the intrinsic motivation scores and with the more autonomous forms of extrinsic motivation, the correlation decreasing and finally becoming negative towards the extrinsic motivation end of the spectrum. They also had significant negative correlations with amotivation scale of the AMS and exhaustion scale of MBI-SS. The Cronbach's alpha for reliability of the three subscales and full SMMS scores was 0.70, 0.67, 0.55 and 0.79. The strength of motivation for medical school has a three factor structure and acceptable validity evidence was found in our study.",

The hypothesis tested here is whether learning in the different phases of PBL is cumulative, with learning in each phase depending on that of the previous phase. The scientific concepts recalled by 218 students at the end of each PBL phase were used to estimate the extent of students' learning. The data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results show that our hypothesized model fits the data well. Alternative hypotheses according to which achievement is predicted either by collaborative learning alone or by self-directed learning alone did not fit the data. We conclude that the learning in each PBL phase is cumulative, and strongly influenced by the earlier phase, thus providing support for the PBL cycle of problem analysis, self-directed learning, and a subsequent reporting phase. We also demonstrate an efficient method to capture and quantify students' learning during the PBL process.",

    "abstract": "Many evaluation instruments have been developed to provide feedback to physicians on their clinical teaching but written feedback alone is not always effective. We explored whether feedback effectiveness improved when teachers' self-assessment was added to written feedback based on student ratings. 37 physicians (10 residents, 27 attending physicians) from different specialties (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Pediatrics, Neurology, Dermatology, Ophthalmology, ENT, and Psychiatry) were invited to fill out a self-assessment questionnaire on their teaching skills. Students completed an almost identical questionnaire to evaluate the same teachers based on their experiences during clerkships. After receiving written feedback incorporating their self-assessment and the student ratings, the teachers indicated their perceptions of the self-assessment exercise and the written feedback in a questionnaire (five-point Likert scale items) and next, in more detail, in semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 12 of the participating teachers. 25 physicians participated (67%). The results showed that self-assessment and student feedback were both perceived as useful (3.7, SD 1.0) but the latter was considered more effective. The physicians we interviewed considered the combination of self-assessment with student ratings more effective than either self-assessment or written feedback alone. Notably, discrepancies between student ratings and self-assessment were deemed a strong incentive for change. We conclude that self-assessment can be a useful tool to stimulate improvement of clinical teaching when it is combined with written feedback based on student ratings. Future research among larger groups is needed to confirm our findings and examine whether these combined tools actually lead to improved teaching.",

    "abstract": "Evidence that medical error can cause harm to patients has raised the attention of the health care community towards patient safety and influenced how and what medical students learn about it. Patient safety is best taught when students are participating in clinical practice where they actually encounter patients at risk. This type of learning is referred to as workplace learning, a complex system in which various factors influence what is being learned and how. A theory that can highlight potential difficulties in this complex learning system about patient safety is activity theory. Thirty-four final year undergraduate medical students participated in four focus groups about their experiences concerning patient safety. Using activity theory as analytical framework, we performed constant comparative thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts to identify important themes. We found eight general themes relating to two activities: learning to be a doctor and delivering safe patient care. Simultaneous occurrence of these two activities can cause contradictions. Our results illustrate the complexity of learning about patient safety at the workplace. Students encounter contradictions when learning about patient safety, especially during a transitional phase of their training. These contradictions create potential learning opportunities which should be used in education about patient safety. Insight into the complexities of patient safety is essential to improve education in this important area of medicine.",

Students were allocated to one of the two study variants on the basis of their enrolment status as full-time or part-time students. Full-time students (n = 11) followed the classroom-based variant and part-time students (n = 12) followed the online asynchronous variant which included video recorded lectures and a series of asynchronous online group or individual SPSS activities with synchronous tutor feedback. A validated student motivation questionnaire was administered to both groups of students at the start of the study and a second questionnaire was administered at the end of the module. This elicited data about student satisfaction with the module content, teaching and learning methods, and tutor feedback. The module coordinator and problem-based learning tutor were also interviewed about their experience of delivering the experimental online variant and asked to evaluate its success in relation to student attainment of the module's learning outcomes. Student examination results were also compared between the two groups. Asynchronous online teaching and learning methods proved to be an acceptable alternative to classroom-based teaching for both students and staff. Educational outcomes were similar for both groups, but importantly, there was no evidence that the asynchronous online delivery of module content disadvantaged part-time students in comparison to their full-time counterparts.",

However, research into the impact of such courses on identity formation of healthcare professionals is limited. This study investigates the influence of such programmes on graduates' educational identities, practices and career progression. Informed by constructivist grounded theory (CGT), semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 graduates (2008-2012) from one postgraduate programme, who were at different stages in their careers worldwide. The audio data were transcribed and analysed using a CGT approach. Participants enrolled in award-bearing medical education courses for various intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. The findings from this study highlight their development as educators, and educational researchers, leaders and learners, as their self-efficacy in educational practices and engagement in scholarly activities increased. Graduates attributed career progression to the qualification, with many being promoted into senior positions. They also described substantial performance attainments in the workplace. The findings contribute to understanding the complexity and nuances of educational identity formation of healthcare professionals. A qualification in medical education encouraged transformational changes and epistemological development as an educator. Awareness of these findings will inform both those considering enrolment and those supporting them of potential benefits of these programmes.",

    "abstract": "In the UK widening access (WA) activities and policies aim to increase the representation from lower socio-economic groups into Higher Education. Whilst linked to a political rhetoric of inclusive education such initiatives have however failed to significantly increase the number of such students entering medicine. This is compounded by a discourse that portrays WA applicants and students as lacking the essential skills or attributes to be successful in medical education. Much of the research in this area to date has been weak and it is critical to better understand how WA applicants and students negotiate medical admissions and education to inform change. To address this gap we amalgamated a larger dataset from three qualitative studies of student experiences of WA to medicine (48 participants in total). Inductively analysing the findings using social capital as a theoretical lens we created and clustered codes into categories, informed by the concepts of \"weak ties\" and \"bridging and linking capital\", terms used by previous workers in this field, to better understand student journeys in medical education. Successful applicants from lower socio-economic groups recognise and mobilise weak ties to create linking capital. However once in medical school these students seem less aware of the need for, or how to create, capital effectively. We argue WA activities should support increasing the social capital of under-represented applicants and students, and future selection policy needs to take into account the varying social capital of students, so as to not overtly disadvantage some social groups.",

    "abstract": "While portfolios are increasingly used to assess competence, the validity of such portfolio-based assessments has hitherto remained unconfirmed. The purpose of the present research is therefore to further our understanding of how assessors form judgments when interpreting the complex data included in a competency-based portfolio. Eighteen assessors appraised one of three competency-based mock portfolios while thinking aloud, before taking part in semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis of the think-aloud protocols and interviews revealed that assessors reached judgments through a 3-phase cyclical cognitive process of acquiring, organizing, and integrating evidence. Upon conclusion of the first cycle, assessors reviewed the remaining portfolio evidence to look for confirming or disconfirming evidence. Assessors were inclined to stick to their initial judgments even when confronted with seemingly disconfirming evidence. Although assessors reached similar final (pass-fail) judgments of students' professional competence, they differed in their information-processing approaches and the reasoning behind their judgments. Differences sprung from assessors' divergent assessment beliefs, performance theories, and inferences about the student. Assessment beliefs refer to assessors' opinions about what kind of evidence gives the most valuable and trustworthy information about the student's competence, whereas assessors' performance theories concern their conceptualizations of what constitutes professional competence and competent performance. Even when using the same pieces of information, assessors furthermore differed with respect to inferences about the student as a person as well as a (future) professional. Our findings support the notion that assessors' reasoning in judgment and decision-making varies and is guided by their mental models of performance assessment, potentially impacting feedback and the credibility of decisions. Our findings also lend further credence to the assertion that portfolios should be judged by multiple assessors who should, moreover, thoroughly substantiate their judgments. Finally, it is suggested that portfolios be designed in such a way that they facilitate the selection of and navigation through the portfolio evidence.",

    "abstract": "Beginning medical teachers often see themselves as doctors or researchers rather than as teachers. Using both figured worlds theory and dialogical self theory, this study explores how beginning teachers in the field of undergraduate medical education integrate the teacher role into their identity. A qualitative study was performed, involving 18 beginning medical teachers at a Dutch medical school. The teachers were interviewed twice and kept a logbook over a period of 7 months. The study shows that the integration of the teacher role into the teachers' identity was hampered by the idea that teaching is perceived by others as a low status occupation. Some teachers experienced significant tension because of this, while others showed resilience in resisting the negative associations that were thought to exist regarding teaching. The teachers used five different identity narratives in order to integrate the teacher role into their identity, in which the positions of teacher and doctor or researcher were found to be combined, adopted or rejected in diverse ways. The five identity narratives were: (1) coalition between the I-position of teacher and other I-positions; (2) no integration of the I-position of teacher: holding on to other I-positions; (3) construction of the I-position of teacher and other I-positions as opposites; (4) coalition between the I-position of teacher and a third position of coordinator; and (5) meta-position: trivialising the importance of status. These identity narratives offer starting points for supporting undergraduate teachers during their early professional years.",

    "abstract": "Clinical workplaces offer postgraduate trainees a wealth of opportunities to learn from experience. To promote deliberate and meaningful learning self-regulated learning skills are foundational. We explored trainees' learning activities related to patient encounters to better understand what aspects of self-regulated learning contribute to trainees' development, and to explore supervisor's role herein. We conducted a qualitative non-participant observational study in seven general practices. During two days we observed trainee's patient encounters, daily debriefing sessions and educational meetings between trainee and supervisor and interviewed them separately afterwards. Data collection and analysis were iterative and inspired by a phenomenological approach. To organise data we used networks, time-ordered matrices and codebooks. Self-regulated learning supported trainees to increasingly perform independently. They engaged in self-regulated learning before, during and after encounters. Trainees' activities depended on the type of medical problem presented and on patient, trainee and supervisor characteristics. Trainees used their sense of confidence to decide if they could manage the encounter alone or if they should consult their supervisor. They deliberately used feedback on their performance and engaged in reflection. Supervisors appeared vital in trainees' learning by reassuring trainees, discussing experience, knowledge and professional issues, identifying possible unawareness of incompetence, assessing performance and securing patient safety. Self-confidence, reflection and feedback, and support from the supervisor are important aspects of self-regulated learning in practice. The results reflect how self-regulated learning and self-entrustment promote trainees' increased participation in the workplace. Securing organized moments of interaction with supervisors is beneficial to trainees' self-regulated learning.",

    "abstract": "Peer assisted learning (PAL) is a common feature of medical education. Understanding of PAL has been based on processes and outcomes in controlled settings, such as clinical skills labs. PAL in the clinical setting, a complex learning environment, requires fresh evaluation. Socio-cultural theory is proposed as a means to understand educational interventions in ways that are practical and meaningful. We describe the evaluation of a PAL intervention, introduced to support students' transition into full time clinical attachments, using activity theory and activity systems analysis (ASA). Our research question was How does PAL transfer to the clinical environment? Junior students on their first clinical attachments undertook a weekly same-level, reciprocal PAL activity. Qualitative data was collected after each session, and focus groups (n = 3) were held on completion. Data was analysed using ASA. ASA revealed two competing activity systems on clinical attachment; Learning from Experts, which students saw as the primary function of the attachment and Learning with Peers, the PAL intervention. The latter took time from the first and was in tension with it. Tensions arose from student beliefs about how learning takes place in clinical settings, and the importance of social relationships, leading to variable engagement with PAL. Differing perspectives within the group were opportunities for expansive learning. PAL in the clinical environment presents challenges specific to that context. Using ASA helped to describe student activity on clinical attachment and to highlight tensions and contradictions relating PAL in that setting. Planning learning opportunities on clinical placements, must take account of how students learn in workplaces, and the complexity of the multiple competing activity systems related to learning and social activities.",

As a result, characteristics of expert behaviour are often described as either cognitive or visual abilities. This study focuses on both aspects of expertise and analyses them along three overarching constructs: (1) encapsulations, (2) efficiency, and (3) hypothesis testing. This study was carried out among clinical pathologists performing an authentic task: diagnosing microscopic slides. Participants were 13 clinical pathologists (experts), 12 residents in pathology (intermediates), and 13 medical students (novices). They all diagnosed seven cases in a virtual microscope and gave post hoc explanations for their diagnoses. The collected data included eye movements, microscope navigation, and verbal protocols. Results showed that experts used lower magnifications and verbalized their findings as diagnoses. Also, their diagnostic paths were more efficient, including fewer microscope movements and shorter reasoning chains. Experts entered relevant areas later in their diagnostic process, and visited fewer of them. Intermediates used relatively high magnifications and based their diagnoses on specific abnormalities. Also, they took longer to reach their diagnosis and checked more relevant areas. Novices searched in detail, described findings by their appearances, and uttered long reasoning chains. These results indicate that overarching constructs can justly be identified: encapsulations and efficiency are apparent in both visual and cognitive aspects of expertise.",

    "abstract": "The importance of emotions within medical practice is well documented. Research suggests that how clinicians deal with negative emotions can affect clinical decision-making, health service delivery, clinician well-being, attentiveness to patient care and patient satisfaction. Previous research has identified the transition from student to junior doctor (intern) as a particularly challenging time. While many studies have highlighted the presence of emotions during this transition, how junior doctors manage emotions has rarely been considered. We conducted a secondary analysis of narrative data in which 34 junior doctors, within a few months of transitioning into practice, talked about situations for which they felt prepared or unprepared for practice (preparedness narratives) through audio diaries and interviews. We examined these data deductively (using Gross' theory of emotion regulation: ER) and inductively to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) what ER strategies do junior doctors describe in their preparedness narratives? and (RQ2) at what point in the clinical situation are these strategies narrated? We identified 406 personal incident narratives: 243 (60%) contained negative emotion, with 86 (21%) also containing ER. Overall, we identified 137 ER strategies, occurring prior to (n = 29, 21%), during (n = 74, 54%) and after (n = 34, 25%) the situation. Although Gross' theory captured many of the ER strategies used by junior doctors, we identify further ways in which this model can be adapted to fully capture the range of ER strategies participants employed. Further, from our analysis, we believe that raising medical students' awareness of how they can handle stressful situations might help smooth the transition to becoming a doctor and be important for later practice.",

    "abstract": "Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) are increasingly used for medical school selection. Scoring an SJT is more complicated than scoring a knowledge test, because there are no objectively correct answers. The scoring method of an SJT may influence the construct and concurrent validity and the adverse impact with respect to non-traditional students. Previous research has compared only a small number of scoring methods and has not studied the effect of scoring method on internal consistency reliability. This study compared 28 different scoring methods for a rating SJT on internal consistency reliability, adverse impact and correlation with personality. The scoring methods varied on four aspects: the way of controlling for systematic error, and the type of reference group, distance and central tendency statistic. All scoring methods were applied to a previously validated integrity-based SJT, administered to 931 medical school applicants. Internal consistency reliability varied between .33 and .73, which is likely explained by the dependence of coefficient alpha on the total score variance. All scoring methods led to significantly higher scores for the ethnic majority than for the non-Western minorities, with effect sizes ranging from 0.48 to 0.66. Eighteen scoring methods showed a significant small positive correlation with agreeableness. Four scoring methods showed a significant small positive correlation with conscientiousness. The way of controlling for systematic error was the most influential scoring method aspect. These results suggest that the increased use of SJTs for selection into medical school must be accompanied by a thorough examination of the scoring method to be used.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, the contributions of cognitive psychology to research and development of medical education are assessed. The cognitive psychology of learning consists of activation of prior knowledge while processing new information and elaboration on the resulting new knowledge to facilitate storing in long-term memory. This process is limited by the size of working memory. Six interventions based on cognitive theory that facilitate learning and expertise development are discussed: (1) Fostering self-explanation, (2) elaborative discussion, and (3) distributed practice; (4) help with decreasing cognitive load, (5) promoting retrieval practice, and (6) supporting interleaving practice. These interventions contribute in different measure to various instructional methods in use in medical education: problem-based learning, team-based learning, worked examples, mixed practice, serial-cue presentation, and deliberate reflection. The article concludes that systematic research into the applicability of these ideas to the practice of medical education presently is limited and should be intensified.",

    "abstract": "A pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China, and reported to the WHO Country Office in China on 31 December 2019.Labelled initially as a coronavirus, then latterly Covid-19, the outbreak was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11th March 2020.As Covid-19 swept around the globe, Health Professions' educators (HPEs) have had to adapt their campus-based and clinical educational provision in a context of rapidly changing circumstances and ongoing uncertainty.Different countries varied in the speed and nature of their responses to the spread of Covid-19.Our context of Singapore has well-developed protocols for outbreak preparation (MOH 2019) and on 7th February 2020 the Ministry of Health (MOH) risk assessed COVID-19 as \"DORSON Orange\" (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) (MOH 2020).This introduced precautionary measures to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus in the country (e.g., daily health checks, stringent contact tracing and quarantining, enhanced focus on hygiene and protection, and segregating groups to contain disease spread).The specific implications of these measures for medical education and teaching were that: students in Singapore's three medical schools were taken out of clinical environments; students could not be taught on a whole or even half class basis; there was reduced availability of clinicians to participate in educational activities, and clinicians who were available could not always attend campus in person because of infection control measures.Our particular responses to these constraints were multiple.These included: shifting our pedagogy from face-to-face Team-Based Learning (TBL: Rajalingam et al. 2018) to e-TBL delivered online; reducing face-to-face class sizes and running classes repeatedly; and introducing some novel simulations to prepare final year students for postgraduate training.While undoubtedly the pedagogic, technical and operational aspects of what we did will be of interest, particularly to those with a digital learning interest, the focus of this editorial is not to tell you of our adaptations, or ask others to consider how they responded in these uncertain and volatile times.Instead, we position our response to unanticipated disruption as problem-posing rather than problem-solving (Biesta et al. 2019), and a potentially positive driver within the educational research space-if considered appropriately.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Medical education is highly demanding and evidence shows that medical students are three times more susceptible to deteriorating physical and mental health than the average college student. While trait anxiety may further increase such risk, little is known about the role of trait mindfulness in mitigating these effects. Here we examine the protective role of specific mindfulness facets as mediators in pathways from trait anxiety to perceived stress, psychosomatic burden and sleep-wake quality in medical students, across repeated measurements throughout the first trimester of the school year. Preclinical medical students enrolled in the second year of the Medical School of University of Bologna completed self-report questionnaires examining personality traits as well as physical and psychological wellbeing. Data were collected at the beginning (Time 1: N = 349) and the end of the first trimester (Time 2: N = 305). As students approached the end of the trimester and upcoming exams, reported levels of perceived stress, psychosomatic problems and difficulties in wakefulness increased significantly compared to the beginning of the trimester. Mediation results showed that trait anxiety predicted such outcomes whereas the protective role of mindfulness facets in mitigating these effects was significant only at Time 2. Specific facets of Nonjudging of inner experience and Acting with awareness proved to be the most effective mediators. Findings highlight that the beneficial role of mindfulness facets in mitigating negative consequences of trait anxiety on medical student wellbeing is revealed in high-pressure periods and when self-regulation is needed the most. Cultivating awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of one’s inner experiences is a crucial self-regulation resource that can help medical students sustain their wellbeing as they learn and throughout their high-pressure education and professional careers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is increasing interest in the use of ethnography as a qualitative research approach to explore, in depth, issues of culture in health professions education (HPE). Our specific focus in this article is incorporating the digital into ethnography. Digital technologies are pervasively and increasingly shaping the way we interact, behave, think, and communicate as health professions educators and learners. Understanding the contemporary culture(s) of HPE thus means paying attention to what goes on in digital spaces. In this paper, we critically consider some of the potential issues when the field of ethnography exists outside the space time continuum, including the need to engage with theory in research about technology and digital spaces in HPE. After a very brief review of the few HPE studies that have used digital ethnography, we scrutinize what can be gained when ethnography encompasses the digital world, particularly in relation to untangling sociomaterial aspects of HPE. We chart the shifts inherent in conducting ethnographic research within the digital landscape, specifically those related to research field, the role of the researcher and ethical issues. We then use two examples to illustrate possible HPE research questions and potential strategies for using digital ethnography to answer those questions: using digital tools in the conduct of an ethnographic study and how to conduct an ethnography of a digital space. We conclude that acknowledging the pervasiveness of technologies in the design, delivery and experiences of HPE opens up new research questions which can be addressed by embracing the digital in ethnography.",

Theories help explain how learning is advanced and offer guidance for how faculty work with patients who become involved in curriculum delivery. We conducted a systematic review to synthesise how theory shapes our understanding of patient involvement in health and social care education. Three databases were systematically searched. Studies demonstrating explicit and high-quality application of theory to patient involvement in teaching and learning or involvement within a community of health and social care educators, were included. A narrative synthesis was undertaken using Activity Theory as an analytical lens to highlight the multifaceted components of patient involvement in professional education. Seven high-quality, theoretically underpinned studies were included. Four studies applied theory to pedagogy, showing how deep learning from patient involvement occurred. Despite a growing body of studies which attempt to use theory to explain learning, many were descriptive, lacked theoretical quality and were therefore excluded. Three studies applied theory to illuminate the complexity of involving patients in the educational system, showing how patients can be supported and valued in teaching roles. This review highlights that more work is required to identify the mechanisms through which patient involvement enhances learning and, to explore what involvement within the education community means for faculty and patients. Our understandings of patient-educator partnerships for learning could be progressed by further high-quality theory driven studies, which include the patient voice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stressors inherent to training and stemming from the learning environment are associated with high rates of burnout, depression, and mental health problems in health professions students (HPS). There is evidence that disadvantaged or stigmatized groups are particularly affected. These problems not only impact students after graduation but may also have detrimental effects on patient outcomes. Resilience, conceptualized as the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, has inspired an increasing number of interventions aimed at addressing those problems in HPS. These interventions have mostly targeted individual students and their psychological traits while ignoring social and structural factors that may enhance or undermine individual resilience. To address this gap in the literature, the authors reviewed the evidence for psychosocial determinants of resilience and proposed a model inspired by the social determinants of health literature and the “upstream–downstream” metaphor. In this theoretical paper, the authors propose that upstream determinants such adverse childhood experiences and socioeconomic and sociodemographic markers of disadvantage have a direct effect on psychological adjustment and an indirect effect mediated by resilience. Additionally, the authors propose that the institutional downstream drivers of learning environment, social support, and sense of belonging moderate the direct and indirect effects of the upstream determinants on psychological adjustment. Future research should test these hypotheses and gather evidence that may guide the development of interventions. The authors present their model as part of a comprehensive response to recent calls to action to address diversity, equity and inclusion in health professions education.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite extensive preparedness literature, existing studies fail to adequately explore healthcare graduates’ feelings of preparedness longitudinally across new graduate transition journeys, nor do they compare different healthcare professions to ascertain what opportunities exist for multiprofessional transition interventions. Therefore, this Australian study, underpinned by temporal theory, explores the preparedness transitions of medicine and pharmacy graduates. Our 6-month qualitative longitudinal study involved 12 medicine and 7 pharmacy learners after purposive sampling. They participated in an entrance interview before starting internship, longitudinal audio-diaries during their first three months of internship, and an exit interview. Framework analysis explored patterns in the data cross-sectionally and longitudinally for the whole cohort (thinking over time), with pen portraits illustrating individuals’ journeys (thinking through time). Preparedness and unpreparedness narratives involved practical skills and tasks, interpersonal skills, knowledge, and professional practice for medicine and pharmacy. However, narratives for practical skills and tasks, and professional practice were dominant amongst medicine graduates, while narratives for interpersonal skills and knowledge were dominant amongst pharmacy graduates. We found numerous cohort changes in feelings of preparedness over time, but the illustrative pen portraits demonstrated the complexities and nuances through time, including feelings of preparedness before internship becoming unpreparedness during internship (e.g., cannulas), improving preparedness through time (e.g., cover shifts), and persistent feelings of unpreparedness (e.g., patient interactions). While our cross-sectional findings are reasonably consistent with existing research, our comparative and longitudinal findings are novel. We recommend that educators build learners’ preparedness through uniprofessional transition interventions involving practical skills and tasks, and professional practice in medicine, and interpersonal skills and knowledge in pharmacy. More importantly, we recommend multiprofessional transition interventions for medicine and pharmacy learners before internship focusing on knowledge, and during internship focusing on practical skills and tasks.",

Incorporating such cases into clinical reasoning education (CRE) may enhance learning and diagnostic skills. However, they may also elicit anxiety among learners, potentially impacting learning. As a result, the optimal utilization of such cases in CRE remains uncertain. This study aims to investigate the effect of erroneous and malpractice claim case vignettes on anxiety and future diagnostic performance in CRE and explores possible underlying factors that may influence learning, including self-reported confidence in the final diagnosis, learners’ satisfaction, and retrospective impact of the cases. In this three-phase experiment, GP residents and supervisors were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: neutral (without reference to an error), erroneous (involving a diagnostic error), or malpractice claim (involving a diagnostic error along with a malpractice claim description). During the first session, participants reviewed six cases exclusively in the version of their assigned condition, with anxiety levels measured before and after. In the second session, participants solved six neutral clinical cases featuring the same diagnoses as those in the learning phase but presented in different scenarios, along with four filler cases. Diagnostic performance and self-reported confidence in the diagnosis were assessed. The third session measured learners’ satisfaction and longer-term impact on the participants. Case vignettes featuring diagnostic errors or malpractice claims did not lead to increased anxiety and resulted in similar future diagnostic performance compared to neutral vignettes. Additionally, self-reported confidence, learners’ satisfaction and long-term impact scores did not differ significantly between conditions. This suggests these cases can be integrated into CRE programs, offering a valuable source of diverse, context-rich examples that broaden case libraries without interfering with diagnostic performance or causing anxiety in learners.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When students learn with–and from–other students, it is called peer-assisted learning (PAL). How undergraduate medical students use their peers for their clinical-reasoning learning process remains unclear, although literature suggests that it is a promising learning strategy at this stage. This research therefore explores the question: ‘How is PAL manifested in the clinical learning environment of undergraduate medical students with regard to developing clinical-reasoning skills?’. A constructivist paradigm with a sociocultural theoretical framework was adopted for this research, using PAL and workplace learning as theoretical background. Focused ethnography and a combination of template and open coding was used to gather and analyze qualitative data. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine students, four residents, and seven clinical supervisors. A total number of 31.5 h were used for five clinical observations. Following categories were used to describe the data: (1) the role of PAL in the clinical-reasoning learning practice, in which PAL-theory was placed alongside clinical practice, (2) the role of different actors during PAL and (3) the PAL environment, in which contextual factors have been scrutinized. Students deploy various categories of PAL to advance their clinical-reasoning skills, although they were largely unaware of these processes, and facilitation of PAL is not consistently provided. Three topics of discussion are identified that need to be acknowledged: (1) the design of a PAL environment that is conducive to collaborative learning, (2) the shifting roles of peers when they enter clinical practice, and (3) the individualistic tendencies of students that can hamper PAL. Future research could focus on stimulating and facilitating PAL among the next generation of students and integrating PAL into the clinical practice workflow.",

We conducted a qualitative phenomenological study at King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the period from November 2007 to December 2008. We conducted semi-structured focus groups interviews with students and conducted individual interviews with teachers and students to explore students' and clinical teachers' perceptions and interpretations of factors influencing students' study strategies. Data collection was continued until saturation was reached. We used Atlas-ti Computer Software (Version 5.2) to analyse the data, apply the obtained themes to the whole dataset and rearrange the data according to the themes and sub-themes. Analysis of data from interviews with twenty-eight students and thirteen clinical supervisors yielded three major themes relating to factors affecting students' study strategies: \"clinical supervisors and supervision\", \"stress and anxiety\" and \"assessment\". The three themes we identified played a role in students' adoption of different study strategies in the \"community of clinical practice\". It appeared that teachers played a key role, particularly as assessors, clinical supervisors and as a source of stress to students.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to develop an automated, computer-based method to detect heuristics and biases as pathologists examine virtual slide cases, (2) to measure the frequency and distribution of heuristics and errors across three levels of training, and (3) to examine relationships of heuristics to biases, and biases to diagnostic errors. The authors conducted the study using a computer-based system to view and diagnose virtual slide cases. The software recorded participant responses throughout the diagnostic process, and automatically classified participant actions based on definitions of eight common heuristics and/or biases. The authors measured frequency of heuristic use and bias across three levels of training. Biases studied were detected at varying frequencies, with availability and search satisficing observed most frequently. There were few significant differences by level of training. For representativeness and anchoring, the heuristic was used appropriately as often or more often than it was used in biased judgment. Approximately half of the diagnostic errors were associated with one or more biases. We conclude that heuristic use and biases were observed among physicians at all levels of training using the virtual slide system, although their frequencies varied. The system can be employed to detect heuristic use and to test methods for decreasing diagnostic errors resulting from cognitive biases.",

    "abstract": "The drive to quality-manage medical education has created a need for valid measurement instruments. Validity evidence includes the theoretical and contextual origin of items, choice of response processes, internal structure, and interrelationship of a measure's variables. This research set out to explore the validity and potential utility of an 11-item measurement instrument, whose theoretical and empirical origins were in an Experience Based Learning model of how medical students learn in communities of practice (COPs), and whose contextual origins were in a community-oriented, horizontally integrated, undergraduate medical programme. The objectives were to examine the psychometric properties of the scale in both hospital and community COPs and provide validity evidence to support using it to measure the quality of placements. The instrument was administered twice to students learning in both hospital and community placements and analysed using exploratory factor analysis and a generalizability analysis. 754 of a possible 902 questionnaires were returned (84% response rate), representing 168 placements. Eight items loaded onto two factors, which accounted for 78% of variance in the hospital data and 82% of variance in the community data. One factor was the placement learning environment, whose five constituent items were how learners were received at the start of the placement, people's supportiveness, and the quality of organisation, leadership, and facilities. The other factor represented the quality of training-instruction in skills, observing students performing skills, and providing students with feedback. Alpha coefficients ranged between 0.89 and 0.93 and there were no redundant or ambiguous items. Generalisability analysis showed that between 7 and 11 raters would be needed to achieve acceptable reliability. There is validity evidence to support using the simple 8-item, mixed methods Manchester Clinical Placement Index to measure key conditions for undergraduate medical students' experience based learning: the quality of the learning environment and the training provided within it. Its conceptual orientation is towards Communities of Practice, which is a dominant contemporary theory in undergraduate medical education.",

    "abstract": "Research integrated into undergraduate education is important in order for medical students to understand and value research for later clinical practice. Therefore, attempts are being made to strengthen the integration of research into teaching from the first year onwards. First-year students may interpret attempts made to strengthen research integration differently than intended by teachers. This might be explained by student beliefs about learning and research as well as student perceptions of the learning environment. In general, student perceptions of the learning environment play a pivotal role in fostering student learning outcomes. This study aims to determine whether a curriculum change intended to promote research integration fosters student learning outcomes and student perceptions of research integrated into teaching. To serve this purpose, three subsequent cohorts of first-year students were compared, one before and two after a curriculum change. Learning outcomes of these students were measured using scores on a national progress test of 921 students and assessments of a sample of 100 research reports of a first-year student research project. 746 Students filled out the Student Perceptions of Research Integration Questionnaire. The findings suggest that learning outcomes of these students, that is, scores on research related test items of the progress test and the quality of research reports, were better than those of students before the curriculum change.",

    "abstract": "Comprehension of physiology is essential for development of clinical reasoning. However, medical students often struggle to understand physiological concepts. Interactive learning through Peer instruction (PI) is known to stimulate students' comprehension, but its relative efficacy and working mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated if and how PI could optimize comprehension of physiological concepts and transfer relative to Self-explanation (SE) which is considered a lower-order type of overt learning. First-year medical students (n = 317) were randomly assigned to either PI or SE in a pre-post test design, followed by a set of near and far transfer questions. In both PI and SE groups post-test scores were significantly improved (p < 0.0001) with PI outperforming SE (+ 35% vs. + 23%, p = 0.006). Interestingly, a substantial number of students with initial incorrect answers even had enhanced scores after discussion with an incorrect peer. Both methods showed higher transfer scores than control (p = 0.006), with a tendency for higher near transfer scores for PI. These findings support PI as a valuable method to enhance comprehension of physiological concepts. Moreover, by comparing the effects of interactive PI with constructive SE we have established new insights that complement educational theories on overt learning activities.",

    "abstract": "An optimal learning climate is crucial for the quality of residency training and may also improve residents' well-being and empathy. We investigated the associations of learning climate with residents' work-related well-being. A multicenter questionnaire study was performed among 271 surgery and gynaecology residents in 21 training programs from September 2012 to February 2013. Residents were asked to complete work-related well-being measurements: work engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale), job and specialty satisfaction (measures from Physician Worklife Study), and physician empathy (Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy). The Dutch Residency Educational Climate Test was used to evaluate learning climate. Multivariate adjusted linear regression analyses were used to estimate associations of learning climate with work-related well-being measures. Well-being measures were completed by 144 residents (53.1%). Learning climate was evaluated by 193 residents, yielding 9.2 evaluations per training program on average. Overall learning climate score was positively associated with work engagement [regression coefficient b = 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18–0.98; p = 0.004] and job satisfaction (b = 0.80; 95% CI 0.48–1.13; p < 0.001). No associations were found between learning climate and empathy and specialty satisfaction. Residents' work engagement and job satisfaction are positively related to the learning climate and may be further enhanced by improved learning climates of training programs.",

    "abstract": "Students feel insufficiently supported in clinical environments to engage in active learning and achieve a high level of self-regulation. As a result clinical learning is highly demanding for students. Because of large differences between students, supervisors may not know how to support them in their learning process. We explored patterns in undergraduate students' self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment, to improve tailored supervision, using Q-methodology. Q-methodology uses features of both qualitative and quantitative methods for the systematic investigation of subjective issues by having participants sort statements along a continuum to represent their opinion. We enrolled 74 students between December 2014 and April 2015 and had them characterize their learning behavior by sorting 52 statements about self-regulated learning behavior and explaining their response. The statements used for the sorting were extracted from a previous study. The data was analyzed using by-person factor analysis to identify clusters of individuals with similar sorts of the statements. The resulting factors and qualitative data were used to interpret and describe the patterns that emerged. Five resulting patterns were identified in students' self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment, which we labelled: Engaged, Critically opportunistic, Uncertain, Restrained and Effortful. The five patterns varied mostly regarding goals, metacognition, communication, effort, and dependence on external regulation for learning. These discrete patterns in students' self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment are part of a complex interaction between student and learning context. The results suggest that developing self-regulated learning behavior might best be supported regarding individual students' needs.",

    "abstract": "Insufficient professional development may lead to poor performance of healthcare professionals. Therefore, continuing education (CE) and continuing professional development (CPD) are needed to secure safe and good quality healthcare. The aim of the study was to investigate the hypothesized associations and their directions between pharmacists' basic psychological needs in CE, their academic motivation, well-being, learning outcomes. Self-determination theory was used as a theoretical framework for this study. Data were collected through four questionnaires measuring: academic motivation, basic psychological needs (BPN), vitality and lifelong learning adaptability of pharmacists in the CE/CPD learning context. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data. Demographic factors like gender and working environment influenced the observed scores for frustration of BPN and factors like training status and working experience influenced the observed scores for academic motivation. A good model fit could be found only for a part of the hypothesized pathway. Frustration of BPN is positively directly related to the less desirable type of academic motivation, controlled motivation (0.88) and negatively directly related to vitality (- 1.61) and negatively indirectly related to learning outcomes in CE. Fulfillment or frustration of BPN are important predictors for well-being and learning outcomes. Further research should be conducted to discover how we can prevent these needs from being frustrated in order to design a motivating, vitalizing and sustainable CE/CPD system for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. Basic psychological needs are very important predictors for well-being and learning outcomes. Further research should be conducted to discover how we can prevent these needs from being frustrated in order to design a motivating, vitalizing and sustainable CE/CPD system for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.",

    "abstract": "Workplace-Based Assessment (WBA) plays a pivotal role in present-day competency-based medical curricula. Validity in WBA mainly depends on how stakeholders (e.g. clinical supervisors and learners) use the assessments—rather than on the intrinsic qualities of instruments and methods. Current research on assessment in clinical contexts seems to imply that variable behaviours during performance assessment of both assessors and learners may well reflect their respective beliefs and perspectives towards WBA. We therefore performed a Q methodological study to explore perspectives underlying stakeholders' behaviours in WBA in a postgraduate medical training program. Five different perspectives on performance assessment were extracted: Agency, Mutuality, Objectivity, Adaptivity and Accountability. These perspectives reflect both differences and similarities in stakeholder perceptions and preferences regarding the utility of WBA. In comparing and contrasting the various perspectives, we identified two key areas of disagreement, specifically 'the locus of regulation of learning' (i.e., self-regulated versus externally regulated learning) and 'the extent to which assessment should be standardised' (i.e., tailored versus standardised assessment). Differing perspectives may variously affect stakeholders' acceptance, use—and, consequently, the effectiveness—of assessment programmes. Continuous interaction between all stakeholders is essential to monitor, adapt and improve assessment practices and to stimulate the development of a shared mental model. Better understanding of underlying stakeholder perspectives could be an important step in bridging the gap between psychometric and socio-constructivist approaches in WBA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Problem-based learning (PBL) is an innovative educational approach that dates back to the 1960s. However, the twenty-first century goal of sustainable education poses a challenge to PBL, especially as it relates to isolation. Here we discuss the underlying issue of isolation in three respects. First, the information-processing model of PBL depends on generalized skills, whereas real life problem-solving skills involve context-bound cognitive processes. Second, in all models of PBL, the focus on knowledge acquisition for a specific problem improves performance but separates education from the world at large. Third, the existing culture of measurement strengthens the aforementioned isolating effects. In response, we introduce a conceptual approach based on Hannah Arendt’s technical notion of ‘world’. We make suggestions to meet the criteria of sustainable education by reconnecting PBL to our shared world, and emphasizing a responsibility for this shared world.",

    "abstract": "The medical education (Med Ed) research community characterises itself as drawing on the insights, methods, and knowledge from multiple disciplines and research domains (e.g. Sociology, Anthropology, Education, Humanities, Psychology). This common view of Med Ed research is echoed and reinforced by the narrative used by leading Med Ed departments and research centres to describe their activities as \"interdisciplinary.\" Bibliometrics offers an effective method of investigating scholarly communication to determine what knowledge is valued, recognized, and utilized. By empirically examining whether knowledge production in Med Ed research draws from multiple disciplines and research areas, or whether it primarily draws on the knowledge generated internally within the field of Med Ed, this article explores whether the characterisation of Med Ed research as interdisciplinary is substantiated. A citation analysis of 1412 references from research articles published in 2017 in the top five Med Ed journals was undertaken. A typology of six knowledge clusters was inductively developed. Findings show that the field of Med Ed research draws predominantly from two knowledge clusters: the Applied Health Research cluster (made of clinical and health services research), which represents 41% of the references, and the Med Ed research cluster, which represents 40% of the references. These two clusters cover 81% of all references in our sample, leaving 19% distributed among the other knowledge clusters (i.e., Education, disciplinary, interdisciplinary and topic centered research). The quasi-hegemonic position held by the Applied Health and Med Ed research clusters confines the other sources of knowledge to a peripheral role within the Med Ed research field. Our findings suggest that the assumption that Med Ed research is an interdisciplinary field is not convincingly supported by empirical data and that the knowledge entering Med Ed comes mostly from the health research domain.",

A total of 124 students were recruited and then randomized to intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). A pre-and-post-intervention design measured students' knowledge in aging (using modified Palmore's Fact on Aging Quiz) and attitudes toward older adults (using Kogan's Old People Scale). A total of 103 students completed all the activities and questionnaires. After the intervention, there were significant differences between the IG and CG on Palmore's mental health (MH) (P = .04), Palmore's total score (P = .02) and Kogan's negative attitudes toward older adults (P = .001). All students increased their positive attitude toward older adults after the intervention. However, both the IG and CG showed a decrease in positive attitudes 1 month after the interventon, and such decrease varied, depending on the programme which students attended. The current study showed that the 10-week service learning activities significantly increased medical and nursing students' overall knowledge of aging and their understanding of mental health needs in old age, and reduced their negative attitudes toward older adults. However, the effect is not long-lasting. On the other hand, its effect on positive attitudes toward older adults cannot be concluded. Periodic contacts with older adults via service learning activities may be needed to sustain attitude change toward older adults.",

    "abstract": "Self-efficacy is thought to be important for resuscitation proficiency in that it influences the development of and access to the associated medical knowledge, procedural skills and crisis resource management (CRM) skills. Since performance assessment of CRM skills is challenging, self-efficacy is often used as a measure of competence in this area. While self-efficacy may influence performance, the true relationship between self-efficacy and performance in this setting has not been delineated. We developed an instrument to measure pediatric residents' self-efficacy in CRM skills and assessed its content validity, internal structure, and relationship to other variables. After administering the instrument to 125 pediatric residents, critical care fellows and faculty, we performed an exploratory factor analysis within a confirmatory factor analysis as well as a known group comparison. The analyses specified four factors that we defined as: situation awareness, team management, environment management, and decision making. Pediatric residents reported lower self-efficacy than fellows and faculty in each factor. We also examined the correlation between self-efficacy and performance scores for a subset of 30 residents who led video recorded simulated resuscitations and had their performances rated by three observers. We found a significant, positive correlation between residents' self-efficacy in situation awareness and environment management and their overall performance of CRM skills. Our findings suggest that in a specific context, self-efficacy as a form of self-assessment may be informative with regards to performance.",

    "abstract": "Lack of published studies on students' practice behaviour of physical examination skills outside timetabled training sessions inspired this study into what activities medical students undertake to improve their skills and factors influencing this. Six focus groups of a total of 52 students from Years 1–3 using a pre-established interview guide. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative methods. The interview guide was based on questionnaire results; overall response rate for Years 1–3 was 90% (n = 875). Students report a variety of activities to improve their physical examination skills. On average, students devote 20% of self-study time to skill training with Year 1 students practising significantly more than Year 3 students. Practice patterns shift from just-in-time learning to a longitudinal selfdirected approach. Factors influencing this change are assessment methods and simulated/real patients. Learning resources used include textbooks, examination guidelines, scientific articles, the Internet, videos/DVDs and scoring forms from previous OSCEs. Practising skills on fellow students happens at university rooms or at home. Also family and friends were mentioned to help. Simulated/real patients stimulated students to practise of physical examination skills, initially causing confusion and anxiety about skill performance but leading to increased feelings of competence. Difficult or enjoyable skills stimulate students to practise. The strategies students adopt to master physical examination skills outside timetabled training sessions are self-directed. OSCE assessment does have influence, but learning takes place also when there is no upcoming assessment. Simulated and real patients provide strong incentives to work on skills. Early patient contacts make students feel more prepared for clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Although there is extensive evidence confirming the predictive validity of situational judgement tests (SJTs) in medical education, there remains a shortage of evidence for their predictive validity for performance of postgraduate trainees in their first role in clinical practice. Moreover, to date few researchers have empirically examined the complementary roles of academic and non-academic selection methods in predicting in-role performance. This is an important area of enquiry as despite it being common practice to use both types of methods within a selection system, there is currently no evidence that this approach translates into increased predictive validity of the selection system as a whole, over that achieved by the use of a single selection method. In this preliminary study, the majority of the range of scores achieved by successful applicants to the UK Foundation Programme provided a unique opportunity to address both of these areas of enquiry. Sampling targeted high (>80th percentile) and low (<20th percentile) scorers on the SJT. Supervisors rated 391 trainees' in-role performance, and incidence of remedial action was collected. SJT and academic performance scores correlated with supervisor ratings (r = .31 and .28, respectively). The relationship was stronger between the SJT and in-role performance for the low scoring group (r = .33, high scoring group r = .11), and between academic performance and in-role performance for the high scoring group (r = .29, low scoring group r = .11). Trainees with low SJT scores were almost five times more likely to receive remedial action. Results indicate that an SJT for entry into trainee physicians' first role in clinical practice has good predictive validity of supervisor-rated performance and incidence of remedial action. In addition, an SJT and a measure of academic performance appeared to be complementary to each other. These initial findings suggest that SJTs may be more predictive at the lower end of a scoring distribution, and academic attainment more predictive at the higher end.",

    "abstract": "In UK medical schools, five-option single-best answer (SBA) questions are the most widely accepted format of summative knowledge assessment. However, writing SBA questions with four effective incorrect options is difficult and time consuming, and consequently, many SBAs contain a high frequency of implausible distractors. Previous research has suggested that fewer than five-options could hence be used for assessment, without deterioration in quality. Despite an existing body of empirical research in this area however, evidence from undergraduate medical education is sparse. The study investigated the frequency of non-functioning distractors in a sample of 480 summative SBA questions at Cardiff University. Distractor functionality was analysed, and then various question models were tested to investigate the impact of reducing the number of distractors per question on examination difficulty, reliability, discrimination and pass rates. A survey questionnaire was additionally administered to 108 students (33 % response rate) to gain insight into their perceptions of these models. The simulation of various exam models revealed that, for four and three-option SBA models, pass rates, reliability, and mean item discrimination remained relatively constant. The average percentage mark however consistently increased by 1-3 % with the four and three-option models, respectively. The questionnaire survey revealed that the student body had mixed views towards the proposed format change. This study is one of the first to comprehensively investigate distractor performance in SBA examinations in undergraduate medical education. It provides evidence to suggest that using three-option SBA questions would maximise efficiency whilst maintaining, or possibly improving, psychometric quality, through allowing a greater number of questions per exam paper.",

    "abstract": "Current theoretical thinking asserts that leadership should be distributed across many levels of healthcare organisations to improve the patient experience and staff morale. However, much healthcare leadership education focusses on the training and competence of individuals and little attention is paid to the interprofessional workplace and how its inherent complexities might contribute to the emergence of leadership. Underpinned by complexity theory, this research aimed to explore how interprofessional healthcare teams enact leadership at a micro-level through influential acts of organising. A whole (interprofessional) team workplace-based study utilising video-reflexive ethnography occurred in two UK clinical sites. Thematic framework analyses of the video data (video-observation and video-reflexivity sessions) were undertaken, followed by in-depth analyses of human-human and human-material interactions. Data analysis revealed a complex interprofessional environment where leadership is a dynamic process, negotiated and renegotiated in various ways throughout interactions (both formal and informal). Being able to \"see\" themselves at work gave participants the opportunity to discuss and analyse their everyday leadership practices and challenge some of their sometimes deeply entrenched values, beliefs, practices and assumptions about healthcare leadership. These study findings therefore indicate a need to redefine the way that medical and healthcare educators facilitate leadership development and argue for new approaches to research which shifts the focus from leaders to leadership.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Supervision matters: it serves educational, supportive and management functions. Despite a plethora of evidence on the effectiveness of supervision, scant evidence for the impact of supervision training exists. While three previous literature reviews have begun to examine the effectiveness of supervision training, they fail to explore the extent to which supervision training works, for whom, and why. We adopted a realist approach to answer the question: to what extent do supervision training interventions work (or not), for whom and in what circumstances, and why? We conducted a team-based realist synthesis of the supervision training literature focusing on Pawson’s five stages: (1) clarifying the scope; (2) determining the search strategy; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction; and (5) data synthesis. We extracted contexts (C), mechanisms (M) and outcomes (O) and CMO configurations from 29 outputs including short (n = 19) and extended-duration (n = 10) supervision training interventions. Irrespective of duration, interventions including mixed pedagogies involving active and/or experiential learning, social learning and protected time served as mechanisms triggering multiple positive supervisor outcomes. Short-duration interventions also led to positive outcomes through mechanisms such as supervisor characteristics, whereas facilitator characteristics was a key mechanism triggering positive and negative outcomes for extended-duration interventions. Disciplinary and organisational contexts were not especially influential. While our realist synthesis builds on previous non-realist literature reviews, our findings extend previous work considerably. Our realist synthesis presents a broader array of outcomes and mechanisms than have been previously identified, and provides novel insights into the causal pathways in which short and extended-duration supervision training interventions produce their effects. Future realist evaluation should explore further any differences between short and extended-duration interventions. Educators are encouraged to prioritize mixed pedagogies, social learning and protected time to maximize the positive supervisor outcomes from training.",

To address this at the point of selection, \"non-cognitive\" tests were included in the UK Clinical Aptitude Test, the most widely-used aptitude test in UK medical education (UKCAT: http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/ ). We examined the predictive validity of these non-cognitive traits with performance during and on exit from medical school. We sampled all students graduating in 2013 from the 30 UKCAT consortium medical schools. Analysis included: candidate demographics, UKCAT non-cognitive scores, medical school performance data-the Educational Performance Measure (EPM) and national exit situational judgement test (SJT) outcomes. We examined the relationships between these variables and SJT and EPM scores. Multilevel modelling was used to assess the relationships adjusting for confounders. The 3343 students who had taken the UKCAT non-cognitive tests and had both EPM and SJT data were entered into the analysis. There were four types of non-cognitive test: (1) libertariancommunitarian, (2) NACE-narcissism, aloofness, confidence and empathy, (3) MEARS-self-esteem, optimism, control, self-discipline, emotional-nondefensiveness (END) and faking, (4) an abridged version of 1 and 2 combined. Multilevel regression showed that, after correcting for demographic factors, END predicted SJT and EPM decile. Aloofness and empathy in NACE were predictive of SJT score. This is the first large-scale study examining the relationship between performance on non-cognitive selection tests and medical school exit assessments. The predictive validity of these tests was limited, and the relationships revealed do not fit neatly with theoretical expectations. This study does not support their use in selection.",

This study therefore aimed to explore what may be required in order for person-centred care programmes to be successful. The study used an ethnographic method of data collection. This consisted of closely following an implementation programme on a medical emergency ward in a Swedish hospital. Data consisted of participant observation and informal interviews with healthcare providers and their management leaders while they were in the process of training to use person-centred care. These interlocutors were using action learning methods under the guidance of facilitators. Our findings revealed that although the programme resulted in some of the processes that are central for person-centred care being developed, organisational factors and a lack of attention to ethics in the programme counteracted these positive effects. The study highlights the importance of facilitating mechanisms to produce desired results. These include management leaders' learning about the dynamic and collective nature of learning processes and change. They also include allowing for inter-professional dialogue to enable managers and professionals to reflect deeply on professional boundaries, disciplinary knowledge and power relations in their teams. Teamwork is essential for the development of person-centred care and documentation, in accordance with this specific implementation programme, is also indispensable. The space for inter-professional dialogue should also accommodate their various perspectives on the aims of care and organizational reality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Low-stakes assessments are theorised to stimulate and support self-regulated learning. They are feedback-, not decision-oriented, and should hold little consequences to a learner based on their performance. The use of low-stakes assessment as a learning opportunity requires an environment in which continuous improvement is encouraged. This may be hindered by learners’ perceptions of assessment as high-stakes. Teachers play a key role in learners’ assessment perceptions. By investigating assessment perceptions through an interpersonal theory-based perspective of teacher–learner relationships, we aim to better understand the mechanisms explaining the relationship between assessment and learning within medical education. First, twenty-six purposefully selected learners, ranging from undergraduates to postgraduates in five different settings of programmatic assessment, were interviewed about their assessment task perception. Next, we conducted a focussed analysis using sensitising concepts from interpersonal theory to elucidate the influence of the teacher–learner relationship on learners’ assessment perceptions. The study showed a strong relation between learners’ perceptions of the teacher–learner relationship and their assessment task perception. Two important sources for the perception of teachers’ agency emerged from the data: positional agency and expert agency. Together with teacher’s communion level, both types of teachers’ agency are important for understanding learners’ assessment perceptions. High levels of teacher communion had a positive impact on the perception of assessment for learning, in particular in relations in which teachers’ agency was less dominantly exercised. When teachers exercised these sources of agency dominantly, learners felt inferior to their teachers, which could hinder the learning opportunity. To utilise the learning potential of low-stakes assessment, teachers are required to stimulate learner agency in safe and trusting assessment relationships, while carefully considering the influence of their own agency on learners’ assessment perceptions. Interpersonal theory offers a useful lens for understanding assessment relationships. The Interpersonal Circumplex provides opportunities for faculty development that help teachers develop positive and productive relationships with learners in which the potential of low-stakes assessments for self-regulated learning is realised.",

    "abstract": "Medical schools seek ways to improve their admissions strategies, since the available methods prove to be suboptimal for selecting the best and most motivated students. In this multi-site cross-sectional questionnaire study, we examined the value of (different) selection procedures compared to a weighted lottery procedure, which includes direct admission based on top pre-university grade point averages (≥8 out of 10; top-pu-GPA). We also considered whether students had participated in selection, prior to being admitted through weighted lottery. Year-1 (pre-clinical) and Year-4 (clinical) students completed standard validated questionnaires measuring quality of motivation (Academic Self-regulation Questionnaire), strength of motivation (Strength of Motivation for Medical School-Revised) and engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-Student). Performance data comprised GPA and course credits in Year-1 and clerkship performance in Year-4. Regression analyses were performed. The response rate was 35% (387 Year-1 and 273 Year-4 students). Top-pu-GPA students outperformed selected students. Selected Year-1 students reported higher strength of motivation than top-pu-GPA students. Selected students did not outperform or show better quality of motivation and engagement than lottery-admitted students. Participation in selection was associated with higher engagement and better clerkship performance in Year-4. GPA, course credits and strength of motivation in Year-1 differed between students admitted through different selection procedures. Top-pu-GPA students perform best in the medical study. The few and small differences found raise questions about the added value of an extensive selection procedure compared to a weighted lottery procedure. Findings have to be interpreted with caution because of a low response rate and small group sizes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transitioning from student to doctor is notoriously challenging. Newly qualified doctors feel required to make decisions before owning their new identity. It is essential to understand how responsibility relates to identity formation to improve transitions for doctors and patients. This multiphase ethnographic study explores realities of transition through anticipatory, lived and reflective stages. We utilised Labov’s narrative framework (Labov in J Narrat Life Hist 7(1–4):395–415, 1997) to conduct in-depth analysis of complex relationships between changes in responsibility and development of professional identity. Our objective was to understand how these concepts interact. Newly qualified doctors acclimatise to their role requirements through participatory experience, perceived as a series of challenges, told as stories of adventure or quest. Rules of interaction within clinical teams were complex, context dependent and rarely explicit. Students, newly qualified and supervising doctors felt tensions around whether responsibility should be grasped or conferred. Perceived clinical necessity was a common determinant of responsibility rather than planned learning. Identity formation was chronologically mismatched to accepting responsibility. We provide a rich illumination of the complex relationship between responsibility and identity pre, during, and post-transition to qualified doctor: the two are inherently intertwined, each generating the other through successful actions in practice. This suggests successful transition requires a supported period of identity reconciliation during which responsibility may feel burdensome. During this, there is a fine line between too much and too little responsibility: seemingly innocuous assumptions can have a significant impact. More effort is needed to facilitate behaviours that delegate authority to the transitioning learner whilst maintaining true oversight.",

    "abstract": "Interprofessional teamwork between healthcare professionals is integral to the delivery of safe high-quality patient care in all settings. Recent reforms of medical education curricula incorporate specific educational opportunities that aim to foster successful interprofessional collaboration and teamwork. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of curriculum reform on medical students' perceptions of their interactions and team-working with nurses. We gathered data from 12 semi-structured individual narrative interviews with a purposive sample of male (n = 6) and female (n = 6) medical students from fourth year (n = 6 following an integrated curriculum) and fifth year (n = 6 following a traditional curriculum). Data were subject to narrative analysis which was undertaken using NVivo software. Overall, there was no notable difference in the responses of the participants on the traditional and integrated curricula about their interactions and team work with nurses. However, the introduction of an integrated medical curriculum was viewed positively but a lack of interprofessional education with nursing students, removal of a nursing placement and shorter clinical placements were perceived as lost opportunities for the development of educationally beneficial relationships. The participants reported that nurses play a number of roles in clinical practice which underpin patient safety including being medical educators who provide a valuable source of support for medical students. The participants highlighted different factors that could hinder or foster effective working relationships such as a lack of understanding of nurses' different professional roles and mutual respect. Medical education needs to provide students with more structured opportunities to work with and learn from nurses in clinical practice. Further research could explore how to foster positive relationships between medical students and nurses.",

As a result, medical trainees frequently encounter difficulties when applying communication skills acquired during training to medical practice. This paper reflects on how clinical communication research and courses can incorporate the growing need for context-bound communication skills training. This paper illustrates how concepts from the research field of language and social interaction can facilitate the description and analysis of communication in clinical encounters, drawing on a real-life example from an increasingly common clinical scenario: a consultation in the emergency department involving a patient who does not speak the same language as the clinician. The proposed way of looking at clinical communication can enrich clinical skills training as it provides a tool to study, analyze, visualize and discuss communication from a different perspective that simultaneously accounts for interactional and clinical reasoning aspects of medical consultations.",

We interviewed 17 graduates from two online Master's programmes to explore their perceptions of how postgraduate study had influenced their practice and professional identity. Our thematic analysis produced three main themes (academic voice, infectious curiosity, and expanding worldview) which reflected changes in the participants' confidence, attitude, perspective, and agency across professional and academic settings. We then conducted a secondary phase of analysis using Bourdieu's concepts of 'field', 'capital', and 'habitus'. While graduate attributes have been conceptualised as the context-independent acquisition of traits that can be employed by individuals, Bourdieu's framework highlights their relational qualities: they are caught up in the cultural history and context of the student/professional, the reputation of the awarding institution, and the graduate's location within a network of professional peers.",

The study was a non-inferior, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. After a 15-min introduction session on the ABCDE approach, all students were randomly allocated to practice ABCDE in groups of three for 20 min either in a fully immersive, interactive, multiplayer virtual reality application (the VR group) or with physical equipment (the TP group). The primary outcome was the number of students who documented all predefined observations in the correct order of the ABCDE approach on a practical test performed immediately after group practice. A total of 84% of all eligible students participated, with 146 students in the VR group and 143 in the TP group. On the primary outcome, 20% in the VR group and 21% in the TP group got everything correct (absolute difference 1% point, one-sided 95% confidence interval 1.0–8.8% points), showing non-inferiority of the virtual reality application. For other outcomes, the results were mostly similar between the groups. Group self-practice of the ABCDE approach in multiplayer, immersive, interactive virtual reality application was non-inferior to practice with physical equipment.",

No consensus exists on what reflection exactly entails; thus far, cross-comparing empirical findings has not resulted in definite evidence on how to foster reflection. The concept is as slippery as soap. This leaves the research field with the question, ‘how can research approach the conceptual indeterminacy of reflection to produce knowledge?’. The authors conducted a critical narrative umbrella review of research on reflection in medical education. Forty-seven review studies on reflection research from 2000 onwards were reviewed. The authors used the foundational literature on reflection from Dewey and Schön as an analytical lens to identify and critically juxtapose common approaches in reflection research that tackle the conceptual complexity. Research on reflection must deal with the paradox that every conceptualization of reflection is either too sharp or too broad because it is entrenched in practice. The key to conceptualizing reflection lies in its use and purpose, which can be provided by in situ research of reflective practices.",

    "abstract": "Transition to practice can be a turbulent time for new doctors. It has been proposed transition is experienced non-linearly in physical, psychological, cultural and social domains. What is less well known, however, is whether transition within these domains can contribute to the experience of moral injury in new doctors. Further, the lived experience of doctors as they transition to practice is underexplored. Given this, we asked; how do newly qualified doctors experience transition from medical school to practice? One-to-one phenomenological interviews with 7 recently qualified UK doctors were undertaken. Findings were analysed using Ajjawi and Higgs' framework of hermeneutic analysis. Following identification of secondary concepts, participant-voiced research poems were crafted by the research team, re-displaying participant words chronologically to convey meaning and deepen analysis. 4 themes were identified: (1) The nature of transition to practice; (2) The influence of community; (3) The influence of personal beliefs and values; and (4) The impact of unrealistic undergraduate experience. Transition to practice was viewed mostly negatively, with interpersonal support difficult to access given the 4-month nature of rotations. Participants describe relying on strong personal beliefs and values, often rooted in an 'ethic of caring' to cope. Yet, in the fraught landscape of the NHS, an ethic of caring can also prove troublesome and predispose to moral injury as trainees work within a fragmented system misaligned with personal values. The disjointed nature of postgraduate training requires review, with focus on individual resilience redirected to tackle systemic health-service issues.",

At the root of abduction lies a fundamental debate: How do we connect practice, which is always singular and unique, with theory, which describes the world in terms of rules, generalizations, and universals? While abduction was initially seen as the 'poor cousin' of deduction and induction, ultimately it has something important to tell us about the role of imagination and humility in theorizing Health Professions Education. It is that which makes theory possible, because it allows us to ask what might be the case and calls attention to the role of creative leaps in theory. Becoming aware of the abductive reasoning we already perform in our research allows us to take the role of imagination-something rarely associated with theory-seriously.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive expertise (AE) and reflective practice (RP), two influential and resonant theories of professional expertise and practice in their own right, may further benefit health professions education if carefully combined. The current societal and systemic context is primed for both AE and RP. Both bodies of work position practitioners as agentive, learning continually and thoughtfully throughout their careers, particularly in order to manage unprecedented situations well. Similar on the surface, the roots and practices of AE and RP diverge at key junctures and we will focus on RP's movement toward critically reflective practice. The roots of AE and RP, and how they relate to or diverge from present-day applications matter because in health professions education, as in all education, paradigmatic mixing should be undertaken purposefully. This paper will explore the need for AE and RP, their shared commitments, distinctive histories, pedagogical possibilities both individually and combined, and next steps for maximizing their potential to positively impact the field. We argue that this exploration is urgently needed because both AE and RP hold much promise for improving health care and yet employing them optimally-whether alone or together-requires understanding and intent. We build an interprofessional education case situated in long-term care, throughout the paper, to demonstrate the potential that AE and RP might offer to health professions education individually and combined. This exploration comes just in time. Within the realities of uncertain practice emphasized by the pandemic, practitioners were also called to act in response to complex and urgent social movements. A combined AE and RP approach, with focus on critically reflective practice in particular, would potentially prepare professionals to respond effectively, compassionately, and equitably to future health and social crises and challenges.",

    "abstract": "Critical reflection supports enactment of the social roles of care, like collaboration and advocacy. We require evidence that links critical teaching approaches to future critically reflective practice. We thus asked: does a theory-informed approach to teaching critical reflection influence what learners talk about (i.e. topics of discussion) and how they talk (i.e. whether they talk in critically reflective ways) during subsequent learning experiences? Pre-clinical students (n = 75) were randomized into control and intervention conditions (8 groups each, of up to 5 interprofessional students). Participants completed an online Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) module, followed by either: a SDoH discussion (control) or critically reflective dialogue (intervention). Participants then experienced a common learning session (homecare curriculum and debrief) as outcome assessment, and another similar session one-week later. Blinded coders coded transcripts for what (topics) was said and how (critically reflective or not). We constructed Bayesian regression models for the probability of meaning units (unique utterances) being coded as particular what codes and as critically reflective or not (how). Groups exposed to the intervention were more likely, in a subsequent learning experience, to talk in a critically reflective manner (how) (0.096 [0.04, 0.15]) about similar content (no meaningful differences in what was said). This difference waned at one-week follow up. We showed experimentally that a particular critical pedagogical approach can make learners' subsequent talk, ways of seeing, more critically reflective even when talking about similar topics. This study offers the field important new options for studying historically challenging-to-evaluate impacts and supports theoretical assertions about the potential of critical pedagogies.",

    "abstract": "Learning to adapt to new contexts is crucial in health professions education (HPE). Boundaries between and within contexts challenge continuity in students' learning processes. Little is known about how HPE students can make these \"boundary experiences\" productive for learning. We investigated how and what nursing students learn from boundary experiences while they are simultaneously growing into a community of practice (CoP). Using a boundary-crossing lens, experiences of discontinuity were identified in pre-placement and post-placement interviews and diary fragments with 14 nursing students during their placement in an academic hospital. We found that students experience discontinuity as a result of different approaches to nursing care and to learning, both between (academic and clinical) settings and within a setting. When students feel safe enough, they can convert boundary experiences into meaningful learning situations, such as critical discussions with staff. Successfully overcoming boundary experiences improves students' understanding of healthcare and professional development and helps them to develop a personal approach to learning. Students critically address boundary experiences when they are motivated to learn and when they perceive a violation of ethical standards but not when they are concerned that it will affect their assessment. Objects designed to bridge theory and practice can generate additional barriers. This study adds to the HPE literature by demonstrating the learning potential of boundaries and to the broader literature by showing how responses to boundary experiences are intertwined with the process of growing into a CoP. The findings can be used to design future boundary objects.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to examine the current literature related to interpersonal communication skill development within undergraduate paramedicine. Interpersonal communication is a vital paramedic skill, with evidence demonstrating it leads to improved patient outcomes and satisfaction and reduces medical errors. Interpersonal communication is a core capability set by paramedicine regulatory bodies, and it is the responsibility of accredited universities to ensure graduates are ready for industry and possess all required skills and attributes. In order to be included in this scoping review, all articles were required to meet a pre-determined 'population, concept, context' (PCC) framework. The population was undergraduate paramedic students within the context of their undergraduate paramedicine programs, and the concept was interpersonal communication education/teaching/training. In June 2021, a search was conducted using CINAHL, Medline, Emcare and ERIC. The articles had to be written in English and published between 2011 and 2021 and non-research sources were excluded. 176 articles were identified in this search and after screening for duplicates and relevancy, 15 articles were found to be eligible. The literature highlighted 4 key themes, including graduate perception of 'work readiness', and a variety of learning experiences including alternative work integrated learning (WIL), interactions with specific patient groups and professional learning experiences. The literature demonstrated that interpersonal communication skills are fostered through human interactions, WIL and simulation, within undergraduate paramedicine programs. Findings from the literature review indicate that practising communication through human interactions, afford an increase in confidence, awareness of ability and empathy, and an increased awareness of preconceived biases. Intraprofessional and interprofessional simulation teaching methods demonstrate the potential to build students confidence in communication and awareness of what is required to function well in a team.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many medical schools incorporate assessments of personal characteristics, including personality traits, in their selection process. However, little is known about whether changes in personality traits during medical training affect the predictive validity of personality assessments. The present study addressed this issue by examining the stability of personality traits and their predictive validity over a 6-year medical training course. Participants were two cohorts of Swiss medical students (N = 272, 72% of students admitted to Year 2) from whom we collected demographic data, Swiss medical studies aptitude test (EMS) scores, Big Five personality traits scores measured at three times and scores on the multiple-choice and objective structured clinical examination parts of the final medical examination. Our findings indicated that personality traits had medium-to-high rank-order stability ( r &gt; .60 over 3 years and r &gt; .50 over 6 years). Mean-level changes were moderate for agreeableness ( d = + 0.72) and small for neuroticism and conscientiousness ( d = -0.29, d = -0.25, respectively). Individual reliable change indices ranged from 4.5% for openness to 23.8% for neuroticism. The predictive validity was similar to that of the first three years of follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate changes in personality across undergraduate curriculum. Medical students’ personality traits were mostly stable across medical school and retain their predictive validity. Consequently, this study supports the use of tools measuring constructs underlying personality traits in selection. In addition, this study confirms that examination formats could favor students with certain personality traits.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty tolerance (UT) is integral to healthcare. Providers' responses to medical uncertainty has ramifications on the healthcare system, the healthcare provider and the patient. Understanding healthcare providers' UT, is important for improving patient-care outcomes. Understanding whether and to what extent it is possible to modulate individuals' perceptions and responses to medical uncertainty, can provide insights into mechanisms for support for training and education. The objectives of this review were to further characterize moderators of healthcare UT and explore moderator influences on the perceptions and responses to uncertainty experienced by healthcare professionals. Framework analysis of qualitative primary literature was conducted on 17 articles, focusing on the impacts of UT on healthcare providers. Three domains of moderators were identified and characterized relating to the healthcare provider's personal attributes, patient-derived uncertainty and the healthcare system. These domains were further categorized into themes and subthemes. Results suggest these moderators influence perceptions and responses to healthcare uncertainty across a spectrum ranging from positive to negative to uncertain. In this way, UT could be a state-based construct within healthcare settings and is contextually determined. Our findings further characterize the integrative model of uncertainty tolerance (IMUT) (Hillen Social Science and Medicine 180, 62-75, 2017) and provide evidence for the relationship between moderators and their influences on cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to uncertainty. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the complex nature of the UT construct, add to theory development, and provide groundwork for future research exploring appropriate support for training and education in healthcare fields.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Medical students’ efforts to learn person-centered thinking and behavior can fall short due to the dissonance between person-centered clinical ideals and the prevailing epistemological stereotypes of medicine, where physicians’ life events, relations, and emotions seem irrelevant to their professional competence. This paper explores how reflecting on personal life experiences and considering the relevance for one’s future professional practice can inform first-year medical students’ initial explorations of professional identities. In this narrative inquiry, we undertook a dialogical narrative analysis of 68 essays in which first-year medical students reflected on how personal experiences from before medical school may influence them as future doctors. Students wrote the texts at the end of a 6-month course involving 20 patient encounters, introduction to person-centered theory, peer group discussions, and reflective writing. The analysis targeted medical students’ processes of interweaving and delineating personal and professional identities. The analysis yielded four categories. (1) How medical students told their stories of illness, suffering, and relational struggles in an interplay with context that provided them with new perspectives on their own experiences. Students formed identities with a person-centered orientation to medical work by: (2) recognizing and identifying with patients’ vulnerability , (3) experiencing the healing function of sharing stories , and (4) transforming personal experiences into professional strength . Innovative approaches to medical education that encourage and support medical students to revisit, reflect on, and reinterpret their emotionally charged life experiences have the potential to shape professional identities in ways that support person-centered orientations to medical work.",

This has implications for how health professions educators might best introduce students to interprofessional collaboration and support their transition into interprofessional, collaborative workplaces. To address this, we engage in a conceptual analysis of published collaborative, interprofessional practices and conceptual understandings in theatre, as a highly collaborative art form and industry, to advance thinking in the health professions, specifically to inform interprofessional education. Our analysis advances a conceptualization of collaboration that takes place within a work culture of creativity and community, that includes four modes of collaboration, or the ways theatre practitioners collaborate, by: (1) paying attention to and traversing roles and hierarchies; (2) engaging in reciprocal listening and challenging of others; (3) developing trust and communication, and; (4) navigating uncertainty, risk and failure. We conclude by inviting those working in the health professions to consider what might be gleaned from our conceptualization, where the embodied and human-centred aspects of working together are attended to alongside structural and organizational aspects.",

    "abstract": "The development of a robust professional identity is a pivotal aspect of every healthcare professional's educational journey. Critical social perspectives are increasingly influencing the examination of professional identity formation within healthcare professions. While understanding how disabled students and practitioners integrate a disability identity into their professional identity is crucial, we have limited knowledge about the actual formation of their professional identity. This study aims to investigate how disabled students and clinicians in healthcare professions actively shape their professional identity during their educational and professional journeys. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 27 students and 29 clinicians, conducting up to three interviews per participant over a year, resulting in 124 interviews. Participants represented five healthcare professions: medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and social work. Employing a constructivist grounded theory approach, our data analysis revealed two prominent dimensions: (a) The contextualization of identity formation processes and (b) The identity navigation dimension in which the professional identity and disability identity are explored. This emerging model sheds light on the dynamic processes involved in identity formation, emphasizing the significance of a supportive environment for disabled students and practitioners. Such an environment fosters the negotiation of both professional and disability identities. Moreover, this study recognizes the importance of a re-examination of the concepts of professionalism and professional identity in healthcare professions. In conclusion, this research underscores the importance of understanding and supporting the multifaceted identity formation processes among disabled individuals within healthcare professions.",

Research on adaptive expertise and adaptive performance in healthcare has grown, and operationalisation and measurement of these concepts are crucial to meet professionals' evolving needs. This study provides an overview of measurement instruments for adaptive expertise and adaptive performance in (becoming) healthcare professionals, including an evaluation of their operationalisations and the amount of evidence supporting their quality. A scoping review was conducted, including an analysis of operationalisations and the amount of evidence supporting the quality of instruments, based on the criteria outlined in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014). Seventeen articles were included, comprising nineteen measurement instruments, three of which were specifically developed for the healthcare domain. The instruments, categorized into six types, varied in the nature and volume of evidence supporting their quality. Analysis of the operationalisations led to a clearer understanding of the concepts, with themes emerging around adaptive expertise and adaptive performance. The study reveals a dominance of self-evaluation and job requirement instruments, while other methods, such as design scenarios, mixed-methods instruments, and collegial verbalization, are underrepresented. Instruments developed specifically for healthcare need further validation and reliability testing. The categorization of subscales into 13 themes provides further clarification of the concepts and suggestions for future research. Instruments to measure adaptive expertise and adaptive performance are limited and vary in conceptualisation, operationalisation and quality. Further research is needed to improve the validity and reliability of healthcare-specific instruments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Medical students’ perceptions of their community learning experiences can provide valuable insights for evolving and improving healthcare professional education curricula to better respond to health needs. This study aims to explore the learning experiences of undergraduate medical students in a community health course at a Colombian University. Fifteen students who had completed the Family Medicine and Community Health course participated in this qualitative study, employing a phenomenographic approach and interview technique. The phenomenographic analysis, informed by the transformative service-learning theoretical framework, resulted in the construction of categories of description, organized hierarchically, based on levels of understanding. The findings revealed five main community health learning experiences: Fulfilling the requirements, Educating the community, Solving health problems, Joint construction, and Personal transformation. Students experienced learning in diverse hierarchical learning levels, with their understanding around community health evolving over time. Transformative learning experiences were identified among only some students, indicating the potential for everyone to reach such levels of complexity and depth. Educationally critical aspects for achieving more complex levels of learning include exposure to intense and major challenges in longer periods of community services, reflection guided by teacher in intentional pedagogical spaces, feedback, and meaningful relationships between key stakeholders. These findings hold significance for medical programs that offer community medicine or related courses, since they present pedagogical opportunities to create and improve similar learning contexts in other domains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The transition from being a medical student to working as a doctor is a pivotal phase, often marked by challenges in balancing learning with the demands of clinical practice. Despite extensive research on the struggles faced by junior doctors, there remains a gap in understanding how other key stakeholders perceive this transition and how it can be viewed as more than just a struggle. In this phenomenographic study, we used the Swedish medical internship as a proxy for the transition and explored internship programme directors’ (PDs) perceptions of the medical internship from a developmental point of view. A phenomenographic approach was chosen to capture the variation in how PDs conceptualise the meaning of the internship, offering a more nuanced understanding of the transition and its implications for educational practice. Interviews with twelve PDs gave rise to three perceptions: the internship as an education, as working as a doctor, and as a space for learning through work. These views highlighted the transition not merely as a preparatory phase but as a dynamic process in which learning and clinical work were intertwined. Our findings suggest that instead of focusing solely on better preparing students for work, empowering junior doctors to learn through work—supported by structured guidance—can turn this challenging period into an opportunity for professional and personal growth. This study offers a novel contribution by shedding light on the role of PDs in shaping the transition to clinical work and emphasising the need to view it as a learning-centred, reflective experience.",

    "abstract": "Online learning is integral to pre- and post-licensure training across health and allied health disciplines. This randomized controlled study examined the impact of incorporating self-reflection prompts into an online clinical skills training module. A total of 88 health and social science students were randomly assigned to either a control group (N = 44) or an experimental group (N = 44). Both groups completed a brief, asynchronous online training module adapted from the Triple P - Positive Parenting Program, featuring a recorded lecture on clinical consultation skills. The experimental group received additional self-reflection prompts and completed written reflections, while the control group completed the training without reflective exercises. Participants in both groups completed pre- and post-training self-assessment surveys measuring knowledge, self-efficacy, and confidence, alongside a simulated client interview assessed using a standardized competency checklist for interpersonal and procedural skills. Results showed that participants in the experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in knowledge acquisition, interpersonal skills, and procedural performance compared to the control group. These findings suggest that incorporating structured self-reflection activities in online training can enhance learning outcomes, promote deeper engagement, and improve self-awareness and clinical competence.",

    "abstract": "Psychologists, like many health professionals, must effectively self-assess their competencies across the career trajectory in order to practice ethically and within the bounds of their knowledge and skills. Given this, research is needed to explore the cognitive process of self-assessment, and the utility of a structured measure for psychologists. This study aimed to explore: 1) how psychologists self-assess their competencies, 2) what value a structured measure has for self-assessment, and 3) the barriers or limitations to using a structured measure for self-assessment. Twelve registered psychologists were interviewed, and reflexive thematic analysis was applied. Themes were identified in the following two broad areas: 1) metacognitive processes and helpful cognitive strategies that aid self-assessment and the use of a structured self-assessment measure, and 2) barriers to self-assessment including unhelpful metacognitions about both the process of self-assessment itself, and the self. One theme and three sub-themes were identified to explain the metacognitive processes and helpful cognitive strategies described by participants, and three themes were identified pertaining to barriers to self-assessment. The current research extends the existing literature through incorporating the voice of psychologists in understanding the metacognitive processes and barriers of self-assessment, including structured self-assessment. This research has implications for health science practitioners, supervisors, educators and research.",

    "abstract": "In health professions education, there is a call to rethink pedagogical practices and institutions that often perpetuate racism, colonialism, and other systems of oppression. Researchers have stressed the importance of integrating critical pedagogies, such as antiracist pedagogy, to help learners understand societal and structural factors behind health inequities and recognize power dynamics in health science and healthcare. Various antiracist pedagogical interventions have been designed, but their outcomes remain unclear. Based on Levac et al.'s framework, a scoping review was conducted to map the literature evaluating the outcomes of antiracist pedagogy in health professions education. A systematic database search was conducted between April and June 2022 for articles describing evaluation methods and outcomes of antiracist pedagogical interventions in health professions education. We included 41 articles in the final selection. The data was organized within the following themes: aim of intervention, type of intervention, evaluation tools, outcomes and indicators for each of Kirkpatrick's levels of training evaluation, theoretical frameworks, and authors' positionalities. The thematic analysis revealed that, in most cases, evaluations targeted participants' attitudes on systemic racism, their racial identity and critical awareness, as well as their satisfaction with the activities. The antiracist pedagogical interventions were rarely evaluated beyond learners' perceptions. Discrepancies were also raised between the principles of antiracist education and the use of antiracist pedagogy to design, implement and evaluate the outcomes of antiracist pedagogical interventions in health professions education. Although only a few interventions had transformative outcomes beyond individuals, we identified promising pedagogical strategies to foster engagement and motivation to transform professional practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of mind maps and Concept Maps on academic performance among undergraduate medical students in the preclinical stage. Methods Our protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024529458). We followed PRISMA guidelines in conducting our systematic review. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library from inception to June 2024. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved undergraduate medical students in the preclinical stage, evaluated mind mapping and Concept Maps as the intervention, and compared it to traditional methods or no intervention, with academic performance as the primary outcome. A qualitative synthesis of the results was conducted, and where possible, effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d) were calculated to quantify the impact of mind maps and concept maps on academic performance. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results A total of six RCTs were included. Four studies reported significantly higher assessment scores with the use of mind maps or concept maps. Teli et al. (Indian Journal of Clinical Anatomy and Physiology 7 (2):243–246, 2020) observed a significant improvement in knowledge retention in the intervention group (mean score: 82.4% vs. 69.8%, p &lt; 0.0001). Concept maps demonstrated moderate-to-large effect sizes, with Ho et al. (Medical Education 48(7):687–697, 2014) reporting Cohen’s d = 0.7–0.8 for improved test scores. Two studies found no significant differences in performance ( p &gt; 0.05), but students consistently expressed a preference for these methods due to their utility in understanding and summarizing information. Overall, mind maps and concept maps prove to be effective tools for enhancing academic performance, especially in terms of knowledge retention and comprehension. Conclusion This systematic review shows that mind maps and Concept Maps are effective methods in helping undergraduate preclinical medical students achieve better performance, especially in terms of knowledge retention and comprehension. While not all studies showed significant differences, the overall preference for these methods indicates their potential as valuable learning tools. We recommend integrating these tools into preclinical curricula and providing training sessions to enhance their effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Progress testing provides data on the growth of students' knowledge over the course of the curriculum obtained from the results of all students in the curriculum on periodical similar tests pitched at end-of-curriculum level. Since 2001, three medical schools have jointly constructed and administered four progress tests annually. All students in the 6-year undergraduate curricula of these schools take the same tests resulting in 24 distinct measurements per academic year (four tests for six student year groups), which may be used to compare performance between and within schools. Because single point measurements had proven unreliable, we devised a method to use cumulative information to compare schools' test performance. This cumulative deviation method involves calculation of the deviations of schools' scores from the cross-institutional average score for 24 measurement moments in 1 year. The current study shows that it appears to be feasible to use a combination of the cumulative deviation method and trend analysis for subdomains of medical knowledge to detect strengths and weaknesses in knowledge development in medical curricula. We illustrate the method by applying it to data from 16 consecutive progress tests administered to all students (4,300) of three medical schools in the academic years 2001/2002 through 2004/2005.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in contemporary research is how to connect medical education and cognitive neuroscience and achieve synergy between these domains. Based on this starting point we discuss how this may result in a common language about learning, more educationally focused scientific inquiry, and multidisciplinary research projects. As the topic of prior knowledge in understanding plays a strategic role in both medical education and cognitive neuroscience it is used as a central element in our discussion. A critical condition for the acquisition of new knowledge is the existence of prior knowledge, which can be built in a mental model or schema. Formation of schemas is a central event in student-centered active learning, by which mental models are constructed and reconstructed. These theoretical considerations from cognitive psychology foster scientific discussions that may lead to salient issues and questions for research with cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience attempts to understand how knowledge, insight and experience are established in the brain and to clarify their neural correlates. Recently, evidence has been obtained that new information processed by the hippocampus can be consolidated into a stable, neocortical network more rapidly if this new information fits readily into a schema. Opportunities for medical education and medical education research can be created in a fruitful dialogue within an educational multidisciplinary platform. In this synergetic setting many questions can be raised by educational scholars interested in evidence-based education that may be highly relevant for integrative research and the further development of medical education.",

In a performance-based assessment group students are provided with a preset list of performance-based assessment criteria, describing what students should do, for the task at hand. The performance-based group is compared to a competence-based assessment group in which students receive a preset list of competence-based assessment criteria, describing what students should be able to do. The test phase revealed that the performance-based group outperformed the competence-based group on test task performance. In addition, higher performance of the performance-based group was reached with lower reported mental effort during training, indicating a higher instructional efficiency for novice students.",

    "abstract": "Clinical teams are of growing importance to healthcare delivery, but little is known about how teams learn and change their clinical practice. We examined how teams in three US hospitals succeeded in making significant practice improvements in the area of antimicrobial resistance. This was a qualitative cross-case study employing Soft Knowledge Systems as a conceptual framework. The purpose was to describe how teams produced, obtained, and used knowledge and information to bring about successful change. A purposeful sampling strategy was used to maximize variation between cases. Data were collected through interviews, archival document review, and direct observation. Individual case data were analyzed through a two-phase coding process followed by the cross-case analysis. Project teams varied in size and were multidisciplinary. Each project had more than one champion, only some of whom were physicians. Team members obtained relevant knowledge and information from multiple sources including the scientific literature, experts, external organizations, and their own experience. The success of these projects hinged on the teams' ability to blend scientific evidence, practical knowledge, and clinical data. Practice change was a longitudinal, iterative learning process during which teams continued to acquire, produce, and synthesize relevant knowledge and information and test different strategies until they found a workable solution to their problem. This study adds to our understanding of how teams learn and change, showing that innovation can take the form of an iterative, ongoing process in which bits of K&I are assembled from multiple sources into potential solutions that are then tested. It suggests that existing approaches to assessing the impact of continuing education activities may overlook significant contributions and more attention should be given to the role that practical knowledge plays in the change process in addition to scientific knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Reliability estimations of workplace-based assessments with the mini-CEX are typically based on real-life data. Estimations are based on the assumption of local independence: the object of the measurement should not be influenced by the measurement itself and samples should be completely independent. This is difficult to achieve. Furthermore, the variance caused by the case/patient or by assessor is completely confounded. We have no idea how much each of these factors contribute to the noise in the measurement. The aim of this study was to use a controlled setup that overcomes these difficulties and to estimate the reproducibility of the mini-CEX. Three encounters were videotaped from 21 residents. The patients were the same for all residents. Each encounter was assessed by 3 assessors who assessed all encounters for all residents. This delivered a fully crossed (all random) two-facet generalizability design. A quarter of the total variance was associated with universe score variance (28%). The largest source of variance was the general error term (34%) followed by the main effect of assessors (18%). Generalizability coefficients indicated that an approximate sample of 9 encounters was needed assuming a single different assessor per encounter and assuming different cases per encounter (the usual situation in real practice), 4 encounters when 2 raters were used and 3 encounters when 3 raters are used. Unexplained general error and the leniency/stringency of assessors are the major causes for unreliability in mini-CEX. To optimize reliability rater training might have an effect.",

    "abstract": "Society expects physicians to always improve their competencies and to be up to date with developments in their field. Therefore, an important aim of medical schools is to educate future medical doctors to become self-regulated, lifelong learners. However, it is unclear if medical students become better self-regulated learners during the pre-clinical stage of medical school, and whether students develop self-regulated learning skills differently, dependent on the educational approach of their medical school. In a cross-sectional design, we investigated the development of 384 medical students' self-regulated learning skills with the use of the Self-Regulation of Learning Self-Report Scale. Next, we compared this development in students who enrolled in two distinct medical curricula: a problem-based curriculum and a lectured-based curriculum. Analysis showed that more skills decreased than increased during the pre-clinical stage of medical school, and that the difference between the curricula was mainly caused by a decrease in the skill evaluation in the lecture-based curriculum. These findings seem to suggest that, irrespective of the curriculum, self-regulated learning skills do not develop during medical school.",

Understanding the possible facilitators or barriers to sustainability may help to develop future interventions that are effective in maintaining gender health issues as a topic in medical curricula. The aim of this study is to provide a longitudinal evaluation of changes regarding gender health issues that occurred in the past decade and the factors that influenced this process. The coursebooks of eight theoretical courses of the Nijmegen medical curriculum were screened on the basis of criteria for an integrated gender perspective in medical education. To assess the sustainability of gender health issues, the screening results from 2014 were compared with those of a similar project in 2005. In addition, open interviews were conducted with eight coordinators to identify facilitators and barriers influencing the sustainability of gender health issues. Analysis showed that, over the past decade, the implementation of gender health issues was mainly sustained and additional changes were made, resulting in an ongoing gender perspective in the Nijmegen medical curriculum. The coordinators mentioned several factors that influenced the sustainability of implementation in medical education: coordinators' and teachers' gender-sensitive attitude, competing demands, the presence of sex and gender in learning objectives, examinations and evaluation, organizational support and curriculum revisions. Our findings suggest that, in implementing sex and gender in medical education, medical faculties need to focus on top-down support in incorporating sex and gender into core objectives and time spent on incorporating sex and gender into medicine, and on the continuous training of teaching staff.",

    "abstract": "Many medical universities offer educational development activities to support clinical teachers in their teaching role. Research has focused on the scope and effectiveness of such activities and on why individual teachers attend. However, systemic perspectives that go beyond a focus on individual participants are scarce in the existing literature. Employing activity theory, we explored how clinical teachers’ engagement in educational development was affected by the systems they act within. Three focus groups were held with clinical teachers from different professions. A thematic analysis was used to map the contradictions between the systems that the participants were part of and the manifestations of these contradictions in the system of education. In our model, clinical teachers were part of three activity systems directed by the objects of patient care, research and education respectively. Contradictions arose between these systems as their objects were not aligned. This manifested through the enacted values of the academic hospital, difficulties establishing educational discussions in the clinical workplace, the transient nature of educational employments, and impediments to developing a teacher identity. These findings offer insights into the complexities of engaging in educational development as clinical teachers’ priorities interact with the practices and values of the academic hospital, suggesting that attention needs to shift from individual teachers to developing the systems in which they work.",

Therefore, the authors further explored how residents experience their own well-being in relation to their professional and personal life. The authors conducted a qualitative study based on a phenomenological approach. From June to October 2013, 13 in-depth interviews were conducted with residents in various training programs using a semi-structured interview guide to explore participants' experience of their well-being in relation to their professional life. The data were collected and analyzed through an iterative process using the thematic network approach. Effort-reward balance and perceived autonomy were dominant overarching experiences in influencing residents' well-being. Experiencing sufficient autonomy was important in residents' roles as caregivers, as learners and in their personal lives. The experienced effort-reward balance could both positively and negatively influence well-being. We found two categories of ways that influence residents' experience of well-being; (1) professional lives: delivering patient care, participating in teamwork, learning at the workplace and dealing with the organization and (2) personal lives: dealing with personal characteristics and balancing work-life. In residents' well-being experiences, the effort-reward balance and perceived autonomy are crucial. Additionally, ways that influence residents' well-being are identified in both their professional and personal lives. These dominant experiences and ways that influence well-being could be key factors for interventions and residency training adaptations for enhancing residents' well-being.",

Formalizing this verification process with checklists, which highlight key variables involved in the diagnostic decision, is often advocated. However, the mechanisms by which a checklist might allow clinicians to improve their verification process have not been well studied. We hypothesize that using a checklist to verify diagnostic decisions enhances analytic scrutiny of key variables, thereby improving clinicians' ability to find and fix mistakes. We asked 16 participants to verify their interpretation of 12 electrocardiograms, randomly assigning half to be verified with a checklist and half with an analytic prompt. While participants were verifying their interpretation, we tracked their eye movements. We analyzed these eye movements using a series of eye tracking variables theoretically linked to analytic scrutiny of key variables. We found that more errors were corrected using a checklist compared to an analytic prompt (.27 ± .53 errors per ECG vs. .04 ± .43, F 1,15 = 8.1, p = .01, η 2 = .20). Checklist use was associated with enhanced analytic scrutiny in all eye tracking measures assessed (F 6,10 = 6.0, p = .02). In this experiment, using a key variable checklist to verify diagnostic decisions improved error detection. This benefit was associated with enhanced analytic scrutiny of those key variables as measured by eye tracking.",

    "abstract": "Formula scoring (FS) is the use of a don't know option (DKO) with subtraction of points for wrong answers. Its effect on construct validity and reliability of progress test scores, is subject of discussion. Choosing a DKO may not only be affected by knowledge level, but also by risk taking tendency, and may thus introduce construct-irrelevant variance into the knowledge measurement. On the other hand, FS may result in more reliable test scores. To evaluate the impact of FS on construct validity and reliability of progress test scores, a progress test for radiology residents was divided into two tests of 100 parallel items (A and B). Each test had a FS and a number-right (NR) version, A-FS, B-FS, A-NR, and B-NR. Participants (337) were randomly divided into two groups. One group took test A-FS followed by B-NR, and the second group test B-FS followed by A-NR. Evidence for impaired construct validity was sought in a hierarchical regression analysis by investigating how much of the participants' FS-score variance was explained by the DKO-score, compared to the contribution of the knowledge level (NR-score), while controlling for Group, Gender, and Training length. Cronbach's alpha was used to estimate NR and FS-score reliability per year group. NR score was found to explain 27 % of the variance of FS [F(1,332) = 219.2, p < 0.0005], DKO-score, and the interaction of DKO and Gender were found to explain 8 % [F(2,330) = 41.5, p < 0.0005], and the interaction of DKO and NR 1.6 % [F(1,329) = 16.6, p < 0.0005], supporting our hypothesis that FS introduces construct-irrelevant variance into the knowledge measurement. However, NR-scores showed considerably lower reliabilities than FS-scores (mean year-test group Cronbach's alphas were 0.62 and 0.74, respectively). Decisions about FS with progress tests should be a careful trade-off between systematic and random measurement error.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The globalization of problem-based learning (PBL) in health professions education has been both celebrated and criticized. Using a critical narrative review approach, underpinned by our archive of global PBL literature and a targeted literature search, we analyze these dominant global discourses of PBL in health professions education. More precisely, we explore what is missed when the globalization of PBL is theorized either as a positive consequence of standardization, or a problematic spread of Western educational ideals and values around the world. We make visible how two dominant global discourses, a universalist and culturalist discourse, have emerged in the global proliferation of PBL. We also discuss the limitations of the two discourses by demonstrating how they either ignore contextual and cultural diversity or see it as problematic. We then turn to a perspective that has been marginalized in the PBL literature that emphasizes the global origins of PBL, transcending the dichotomy between West and non-West. We make a case for relating to PBL as a plural construct in order to learn from the cultural and situational nuances of educational activities labeled PBL around the world. We argue that PBL as a singular and universal concept has no global future, yet versions of PBL may continue to thrive locally. Finally, we propose avenues for future research that may help elucidate the global and local values that underpin our curricula, as well as the socio-political factors that perpetuate neo-colonialist views and practices in the uptake and implementation of PBL approaches across the globe.",

    "abstract": "In the Netherlands, students are admitted to medical school through (1) selection, (2) direct access by high pre-university Grade Point Average (pu-GPA), (3) lottery after being rejected in the selection procedure, or (4) lottery. At Radboud University Medical Center, 2010 was the first year we selected applicants. We designed a procedure based on tasks mimicking the reality of early medical school. Applicants took an online course followed by an on-site exam, resembling courses and exams in early medical school. Based on the exam scores, applicants were selected or rejected. The aim of our study is to determine whether curriculum sample selection explains performance in medical school and is preferable compared to selection based on performance in secondary school. We gathered data on the performance of students of three consecutive cohorts (2010-2012, N = 954). We compared medical school performance (course credits and grade points) of selected students to the three groups admitted in other ways, especially lottery admissions. In regression analyses, we controlled for out of context cognitive performance by adjusting for pu-GPA. Selection-admitted students outperformed lottery-admitted students on most outcome measures, unadjusted as well as adjusted for pu-GPA (p ≤ 0.05). They had higher grade points than non-selected lottery students, both unadjusted and adjusted for pu-GPA (p ≤ 0.025). Adjusted for pu-GPA, selection-admitted students and high-pu-GPA students performed equally. We recommend this selection procedure as it adds to secondary school cognitive performance for the general population of students, is efficient for large numbers of applicants and not labour-intensive.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests that physicians perform multiple reasoning tasks beyond diagnosis during patient review. However, these remain largely theoretical. The purpose of this study was to explore reasoning tasks in clinical practice during patient admission review. The authors used a constant comparative approach—an iterative and inductive process of coding and recoding—to analyze transcripts from 38 audio-recorded case reviews between junior trainees and their senior residents or attendings. Using a previous list of reasoning tasks, analysis focused on what tasks were performed, when they occurred, and how they related to the other tasks. All 24 tasks were observed in at least one review with a mean of 17.9 (Min = 15, Max = 22) distinct tasks per review. Two new tasks—assess illness severity and patient decision-making capacity—were identified, thus 26 tasks were examined. Three overarching tasks were identified—assess priorities, determine and refine the most likely diagnosis and establish and refine management plans—that occurred throughout all stages of the case review starting from patient identification and continuing through to assessment and plan. A fourth possible overarching task—reflection—was also identified but only observed in four instances across three cases. The other 22 tasks appeared to be context dependent serving to support, expand, and refine one or more overarching tasks. Tasks were non-sequential and the same supporting task could serve more than one overarching task. The authors conclude that these findings provide insight into the 'what' and 'when' of physician reasoning during case review that can be used to support professional development, clinical training and patient care. In particular, they draw attention to the iterative way in which each task is addressed during a case review and how this finding may challenge conventional ways of teaching and assessing clinical communication and reasoning. They also suggest that further research is needed to explore how physicians decide why a supporting task is required in a particular context.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The potential of reflection for learning and development is broadly accepted across the medical curriculum. Our understanding of how exactly reflection yields its educational promise, however, is limited to broad hints at the relation between reflection and learning. Yet, such understanding is essential to the (re)design of reflection education for learning and development. In this qualitative study, we used participants’ video-stimulated comments on actual practice to identify features that do or do not make collaborative reflection valuable to participants. In doing so, we focus on aspects of the interactional process that constitute the educational activity of reflection. To identify valuable and less valuable features of collaborative reflection, we conducted one-on-one video-stimulated interviews with Dutch general practice residents about collaborative reflection sessions in their training program. Residents were invited to comment on any aspect of the session that they did or did not value. We synthesized all positively and negatively valued features and associated explanations put forward in residents’ narratives into shared normative orientations about collaborative reflection: what are the shared norms that residents display in telling about positive and negative experiences with collaborative reflection? These normative orientations display residents’ views on the aim of collaborative reflection (educational value for all) and the norms that allegedly contribute to realizing this aim (inclusivity and diversity, safety, and efficiency). These norms are also reflected in specific educational activities that ostensibly contribute to educational value. As such, the current synthesis of normative orientations displayed in residents’ narratives about valuable and less valuable elements of collaborative reflection deepen our understanding of reflection and its supposed connection with educational outcomes. Moreover, the current empirical endeavor illustrates the value of video-stimulated interviews as a tool to value features of educational processes for future educational enhancements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dyslexia is a Specific Learning Difficulty that impacts on reading and writing abilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical schools have been forced to undertake distance learning and assessment. The wider literature suggested that e-learning might pose additional challenges for dyslexic students. Here we explore their overall experiences of learning/studying during this time in a phenomenological study. Five medical students were interviewed in depth and the audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim. Transcripts then underwent an interpretive phenomenological analysis. Our results highlighted a largely positive experience, with an improved culture of togetherness, freedom and sense of control. They also revealed issues with a lack of clinical exposure, potential negative impacts on ranking positions for those with dyslexia, and possible cheating in exams. There are some surprising results—in particular the positive responses to how remote learning was delivered. These seemed to put our participants more on a par with their non-dyslexic colleagues—except in some examinations. It is our hope that medical educators may resist a return to ‘the way things have always been done’ when the pandemic has resolved, and by doing so, continue to foster this new, positive culture and paradigm shift.",

    "abstract": "It has become relatively common practice within health professional education to invite people who have used mental health and social care services (or service user educators) to share their stories with health professional learners and students. This paper reports on findings from a postcritical ethnographic study of the practice of service user involvement (SUI), in which we reflexively inquired into conceptualizations of service user educators' knowledge contributions to health professional education in the accounts of both service user- and health professional educators. This research was conducted in response to recent calls for greater scrutiny surrounding the risks, challenges, and complexities inherent in involving service users in health professional education spaces. 'Story/telling' was identified as a pronounced overarching construct in our analysis, which focuses on participants' reports of both the obvious and more subtle tensions and complexities they experience in relation to storytelling as a predominant tool or approach to SUI. Our findings are presented as three distinct, yet overlapping, themes related to these complexities or tensions: (a) performative expectations; (b) the invisible work of storytelling; and (c) broadening conceptualizations of service user educators' knowledge. Our findings and discussion contribute to a growing body of literature which problematizes the uncritical solicitation of service user educators' stories in health professional education and highlights the need for greater consideration of the emotional and epistemic labour expected of those who are invited to share their stories. This paper concludes with generative recommendations and reflexive prompts for health professional educators seeking to engage service user educators in health professional education through the practice of storytelling.",

    "abstract": "As a result of an increased understanding of culture's impact on health and healthcare, cultural competence and diversity curricula have been incorporated into many medical programs. However, little is known about how students develop their cultural competence during their training. This ethnographic case study combined participant observation with interviews and focus group to understand students' views and experiences in developing their cultural competence during clinical placements. The results show that students' development of cultural competence is an individually varied process via four distinctive yet interrelated learning avenues. Immersion in a diverse healthcare environment contributes to students' development of cultural awareness and knowledge. Observation of culturally appropriate or inappropriate practices allows students to enhance their practical skills and critical reflection. Interaction with other clinical professionals, patients, and their family members, enables students' engagement within the busy clinical practice. Reflection helps students to actively think about culture's impact on health and internalize the importance of cultural competence. Students' learning via each avenue is interrelated and constantly interacting with their learning environment, which collectively contributes to their development. Integrating the results allowed the authors to generate a theoretical model that conceptualizes medical students' cultural competence development in clinical placements, which unearths students' cultural learning within the informal and hidden curriculum. This study provides a rare view of students' development of cultural competence in clinical placements, which may inform the pedagogic development of cultural competence and diversity education in medicine and healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous literature has explored unconscious racial biases in clinical education and medicine, finding that people with darker skin tones can be underrepresented in learning resources and managed differently in a clinical setting. This study aimed to examine whether patient skin colour can affect the diagnostic ability and confidence of medical students, and their cognitive reasoning processes. We presented students with 12 different clinical presentations on both white skin (WS) and non-white skin (NWS). A think aloud (TA) study was conducted to explore students’ cognitive reasoning processes (n = 8). An online quiz was also conducted where students submitted a diagnosis and confidence level for each clinical presentation (n = 185). In the TA interviews, students used similar levels of information gathering and analytical reasoning for each skin type but appeared to display increased uncertainty and reduced non-analytical reasoning methods for the NWS images compared to the WS images. In the online quiz, students were significantly more likely to accurately diagnose five of the 12 clinical presentations (shingles, cellulitis, Lyme disease, eczema and meningococcal disease) on WS compared to NWS ( p &lt; 0.01). With regards to students’ confidence, they were significantly more confident diagnosing eight of the 12 clinical presentations (shingles, cellulitis, Lyme disease, eczema, meningococcal disease, urticaria, chickenpox and Kawasaki disease) on WS when compared to NWS ( p &lt; 0.01). These findings highlight the need to improve teaching resources to include a greater diversity of skin colours exhibiting clinical signs, to improve students’ knowledge and confidence, and ultimately, to avoid patients being misdiagnosed due to the colour of their skin.",

This study explores the key advantages and problems of heterogeneous PBL groups from the students' and teachers' opinions. Focus groups were conducted with a stratified sample of second year medical students and their PBL teachers. We found that students working in heterogeneous groupings interact with students with whom they don't normally interact with, learn a lot more from each other because of their differences in language and academic preparedness and become better prepared for their future professions in multicultural societies. On the other hand we found students segregating in the tutorials along racial lines and that status factors disempowered students and subsequently their productivity. Among the challenges was also that academic and language diversity hindered student learning. In light of these the recommendations were that teachers need special diversity training to deal with heterogeneous groups and the tensions that arise. Attention should be given to create 'the right mix' for group learning in diverse student populations. The findings demonstrate that collaborative heterogeneous learning has two sides that need to be balanced. On the positive end we have the 'ideology' behind mixing diverse students and on the negative the 'practice' behind mixing students. More research is needed to explore these variations and their efficacy in more detail.",

    "abstract": "Visuo-spatial ability is associated with a quality of performance in a variety of surgical and medical skills. However, visuo-spatial ability is typically assessed using Visualization tests only, which led to an incomplete understanding of the involvement of visuo-spatial ability in these skills. To remedy this situation, the current study investigated the role of a broad range of visuo-spatial factors in colonoscopy simulator training. Fifteen medical trainees (no clinical experience in colonoscopy) participated in two psycho-metric test sessions to assess four visuo-spatial ability factors. Next, participants trained flexible endoscope manipulation, and navigation to the cecum on the GI Mentor II simulator, for four sessions within 1 week. Visualization, and to a lesser degree Spatial relations were the only visuo-spatial ability factors to correlate with colonoscopy simulator performance. Visualization additionally covaried with learning rate for time on task on both simulator tasks. High Visualization ability indicated faster exercise completion. Similar to other endoscopic procedures, performance in colonoscopy is positively associated with Visualization, a visuo-spatial ability factor characterized by the ability to mentally manipulate complex visuo-spatial stimuli. The complexity of the visuo-spatial mental transformations required to successfully perform colonoscopy is likely responsible for the challenging nature of this technique, and should inform training- and assessment design. Long term training studies, as well as studies investigating the nature of visuo-spatial complexity in this domain are needed to better understand the role of visuo-spatial ability in colonoscopy, and other endoscopic techniques.",

But at the same time, not all students in PBL automatically contribute in a high quality manner, which might impede successful group functioning. This study investigated whether peer process feedback combined with goal setting can be used to improve the quality of students' individual contributions. A mixed-methods explanatory design, in which 74 second-year Health Sciences students participated, combined a pre- and posttest with a focus group. The results indicated that the quality of the contributions only increased for students with a below average score on the pre-test. The qualitative data confirmed that the impact of the feedback could be increased by combining individual reflection by means of goal setting with face-to-face discussion. Another suggestion is to investigate whether midterm peer process feedback is more effective for first year students, because they are still developing their tutorial behavior, as opposed to second year students.",

    "abstract": "The influence of problem-based learning (PBL) and open-book tests on long-term knowledge retention is unclear and subject of discussion. Hypotheses were that PBL as well as open-book tests positively affect long-term knowledge retention. Four progress test results of fifth and sixth-year medical students (n = 1,648) of three medical schools were analyzed. Two schools had PBL driven curricula, and the third one had a traditional curriculum (TC). One of the PBL schools (PBLob) used a combination of open-book (assessing backup knowledge) and closed-book tests (assessing core knowledge); the other two schools (TC and PBLcb) only used closed-book tests. The items of the progress tests were divided into core and backup knowledge. T tests (with Bonferroni correction) were used to analyze differences between curricula. PBL students performed significantly better than TC students on core knowledge (average effect size (av ES) = 0.37-0.74) and PBL students tested with open-book tests scored somewhat higher than PBL students tested without such tests (av ES = 0.23-0.30). Concerning backup knowledge, no differences were found between the scores of the three curricula. Students of the two PBL curricula showed a substantially better long-term knowledge retention than TC students. PBLob students performed somewhat better on core knowledge than PBLcb students. These outcomes suggest that a problem-based instructional approach in particular can stimulate long-term knowledge retention. Distinguishing knowledge into core and backup knowledge and using open-book tests alongside closed-book tests could enhance long-term core knowledge retention.",

It is, however, only one of many influences on what is actually discussed in feedback. The sociohistorical culture of medicine and individual supervisors' contexts, experiences and beliefs are also influential. Our aim was to find how CanMEDS roles are constructed in feedback in a postgraduate curriculum-in-action. We applied a set of discourse analytic tools to written feedback from 591 feedback forms from 7 hospitals, including 3150 feedback comments in which 126 supervisors provided feedback to 120 residents after observing their performance in authentic settings. The role of Collaborator was constructed in two different ways: a cooperative discourse of equality with other workers and patients; and a discourse, which gave residents positions of power-delegating, asserting and 'taking a firm stance'. Efficiency-being fast and to the point emerged as an important attribute of physicians. Patients were seldom part of the discourses and, when they were, they were constructed as objects of communication and collaboration rather than partners. Although some of the discourses are in line with what might be expected, others were in striking contrast to the spirit of CanMEDS. This study's findings suggest that it takes more than a competency framework, evaluation instruments, and supervisor training to change the culture of workplaces. The impact on residents of training in such demanding, efficiency-focused clinical environments is an important topic for future research.",

It is arguable, therefore, that selection should focus on non-cognitive aspects despite the predictive value of prior cognitive performance for early medical school performance. The aim of this study at Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands, is to determine the effects of admitting students through an autonomous non-cognitive procedure on early medical school performance. We compared their performance to the performance of students selected through an autonomous cognitive selection procedure, enrolling in the Bachelor's curriculum simultaneously. 574 students (2013 and 2014 cohorts), admitted through non-cognitive selection (based on portfolio, CASPer and MMI, n = 135) or cognitive selection (curriculum sample selection, n = 439) were included in the study. We compared dropout rates, course credits and grades, using logistic and linear regression. The dropout rate was the highest in the non-cognitive selection group (p < 0.001). Students admitted through non-cognitive selection more often obtained the highest grade for the nursing attachment (p = 0.02) and had a higher mean grade for the practical clinical course in year 3 (p = .04). No differences in course grades were found. The results indicate that students perform best on the elements of the curriculum that are represented most strongly in the selection procedure they had participated in.

    "abstract": "Prescribing tasks, which involve pharmacological knowledge, clinical decision-making and practical skill, take place within unpredictable social environments and involve interactions within and between endlessly changing health care teams. Despite this, curriculum designers commonly assume them to be simple to learn and perform. This research used mixed methods to explore how undergraduate medical students learn to prescribe in the 'real world'. It was informed by cognitive psychology, sociocultural theory, and systems thinking. We found that learning to prescribe occurs as a dynamic series of socially negotiated interactions within and between individuals, communities and environments. As well as a thematic analysis, we developed a framework of three conceptual spaces in which learning opportunities for prescribing occur. This illustrates a complex systems view of prescribing education and defines three major system components: the \"social space\", where the environmental conditions influence or bring about a learning experience; the \"process space\", describing what happens during the learning experience; and the intra-personal \"cognitive space\", where the learner may develop aspects of prescribing expertise. This conceptualisation broadens the scope of inquiry of prescribing education research by highlighting the complex interplay between individual and social dimensions of learning. This perspective is also likely to be relevant to students' learning of other clinical competencies.",

    "abstract": "Medical schools are increasingly faced with a more diverse student population. Generally, ethnic minority students are reported to underperform compared with those from the ethnic majority. However, there are inconsistencies in findings in different types of examinations. Additionally, little is known about the performance of first-generation university students and about performance differences across ethnic minority groups. This study aimed to investigate underperformance across ethnic minority groups and by first-generation university students in different types of written tests and clinical skills examinations during pre-clinical training. A longitudinal prospective cohort study of progress on a 3-year Dutch Bachelor of Medicine course was conducted. Participants included 2432 students who entered the course over a consecutive 6-year period (2008-2013). Compared with Dutch students, the three non-Western ethnic minority groups (Turkish/Moroccan/African, Surinamese/Antillean and Asian) underperformed in the clinical problem solving tests, the language test and the OSCEs. Findings on the theoretical end-of-block tests and writing skills tests, and results for Western minority students were less consistent. Age, gender, pre-university grade point average and additional socio-demographic variables (including first-generation university student, first language, and medical doctor parent) could explain the ethnicity-related differences in theoretical examinations, but not in language, clinical and writing skills examinations. First-generation university students only underperformed in the language test. Apparently, underperformance differs both across ethnic subgroups and between different types of written and clinical examinations. Medical schools should ensure their assessment strategies create a level playing field for all students and explore reasons for underperformance in the clinical and writing skills examinations.",

    "abstract": "Bedside teaching encounters (BTEs) involve doctor-patient-student interactions, providing opportunities for students to learn with, from and about patients. How the differing concerns of patient care and student education are balanced in situ remains largely unknown and undefined. This video ethnographic study explores patient involvement during a largely student-centric activity: 'feedback sequences' where students learn clinical and practical skills. Drawing on a data subset from a multi-site study, we used Conversation Analysis to investigate verbal and non-verbal interactional practices to examine patients' inclusion and exclusion from teaching activities across 25 BTEs in General Practice and General Surgery and Medicine with 50 participants. Through analysis, we identified two representations of the patient: the patient embodied (where patients are actively involved) and the patient as-a-body (when they are used primarily as a prop for learning). Overall, patients were excluded more during physical examination than talk-based activities. Exclusion occurred through physical positioning of doctor-patient-student, and through doctors and students talking about, rather than to, patients using medical jargon and online commentaries. Patients' exclusion was visibly noticeable through eye gaze: patients' middle-distance gaze coincided with medical terminology or complex wording. Inclusory activities maintained the patient embodied during teaching activities through doctors' skilful embedding of teaching within their care: including vocalising clinical reasoning processes through students, providing patients with a 'warrant to listen', allocating turns-at-talk for them and eye-contact. This study uniquely demonstrates the visible nature patient exclusion, providing firm evidence of how this affects patient empowerment and engagement within educational activities for tomorrow's doctors.",

Kaupapa Māori and Pacific research methodologies were used to conduct a quantitative analysis using data for 2686 health professional students [150 Māori, 257 Pacific, 2279, non-Māori non-Pacific (nMnP)]. The predictive effect of admission variables: school decile; attending school in Auckland; type of admission; bridging programme; and first-year bachelor results on academic outcomes: year 2–4 grade point average (GPA); graduating; graduating in the minimum time; and optimal completion for the three ethnic groupings and the full cohort was explored using multiple regression analyses. After adjusting for admission variables, for every point increase in first year bachelor GPA: year 2–4 GPA increased by an average of 0.46 points for Māori (p = 0.0002, 95% CI 0.22, 0.69), 0.70 points for Pacific (p < 0.0001, CI 0.52, 0.87), and 0.55 points for nMnP (p < 0.0001, CI 0.51, 0.58) students. For the total cohort, ethnic grouping was consistently the most significant predictor of academic outcomes. This study demonstrated clear differences in academic outcomes between both Māori and Pacific students when compared to nMnP students. Some (but not all) of the disparities between ethnic groupings could be explained by controlling for admission variables.",

    "abstract": "Underperformance among ethnic minority students has been reported in several studies. Autonomous motivation (acting out of true interest or personal endorsement) is associated with better learning and academic performance. This study examined whether study strategy (surface, achieving, and deep) was a mediator between the type of motivation (autonomous and controlled motivation) and academic performance (GPA and clerkship performance), and whether these relations are different for students from different ethnic groups to gain a better understanding about the needed intervention/support in the curriculum. Data was gathered from 947 students at VUmc School of Medical Sciences, Amsterdam. Structural Equation Modelling was performed to test the hypothesized model: a higher autonomous motivation has a positive association with academic performance through deep and achieving strategy, and has a negative association with performance through surface strategy. The model with the outcome variables GPA and clerkship performance had a good fit (n = 618; df = 1, RMSEA = 0.000, p = 0.43). The model for the ethnic majority and minority groups was significantly different (p < 0.025). In this study, autonomous motivation had a positive association with GPA through achieving strategy for the ethnic majority students only. It might be that the size of the minority groups was too small to detect differences or that other factors mediate these relations in ethnic minority students. Qualitative research is needed to identify other factors influencing the academic performance of ethnic minority students and what they experience during their education, in order to support their learning in the right manner.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of complex tasks integrating several competencies calls for a programmatic design approach. As single instruments do not provide the information required to reach a robust judgment of integral performance, 73 guidelines for programmatic assessment design were developed. When simultaneously applying these interrelated guidelines, it is challenging to keep a clear overview of all assessment activities. The goal of this study was to provide practical support for applying a programmatic approach to assessment design, not bound to any specific educational paradigm. The guidelines were first applied in a postgraduate medical training setting, and a process analysis was conducted. This resulted in the identification of four steps for programmatic assessment design: evaluation, contextualisation, prioritisation and justification. Firstly, the (re)design process starts with sufficiently detailing the assessment environment and formulating the principal purpose. Key stakeholders with sufficient (assessment) expertise need to be involved in the analysis of strengths and weaknesses and identification of developmental needs. Central governance is essential to balance efforts and stakes with the principal purpose and decide on prioritisation of design decisions and selection of relevant guidelines. Finally, justification of assessment design decisions, quality assurance and external accountability close the loop, to ensure sound underpinning and continuous improvement of the assessment programme.",

One AMC specializing in the care of incarcerated patients is the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB), which hosts the only dedicated prison hospital in the U.S. and supplies 80% of the medical care for the entire Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ). Nearly all medical students and residents at UTMB take part in the care of the incarcerated. This research, through qualitative exploration using focus group discussions, sets out to characterize the correctional care learning environment medical trainees enter. Participants outlined an institutional culture of low prioritization and neglect that dominated the learning environment in the prison hospital, resulting in treatment of the incarcerated as second-class patients. Medical learners pointed to delays in care, both within the prison hospital and within the TDCJ system, where diagnostic, laboratory, and medical procedures were delivered to incarcerated patients at a lower priority compared to free-world patients. Medical learners elaborated further on ethical issues that included the moral judgment of those who are incarcerated, bias in clinical decision making, and concerns for patient autonomy. Medical learners were left to grapple with complex challenges like the problem of dual loyalties without opportunities to critically reflect upon what they experienced. This study finds that, without specific vulnerable populations training for both trainees and correctional care faculty to address these institutional dynamics, AMCs risk replicating a system of exploitation and neglect of incarcerated patients and thereby exacerbating health inequities.",

The Medical Emotion Scale (MES) was previously developed to assess achievement emotions experienced by North American medical learners during learning activities. The goal of this study was to create and validate a Japanese version of the Medical Emotion Scale (J-MES). We translated the MES into Japanese and conducted two initial validation studies of the J-MES. In the first pilot study, we asked five, native-Japanese, second-year medical students to assess their emotions with the J-MES during a computer-based clinical reasoning activity. Each participant was then interviewed to assess the clarity and suitability of the items. In a second, larger study, 41 Japanese medical students were recruited to assess the psychometric properties of the J-MES. We also conducted individual, semi-structured interviews with ten of these participants to explore potential cultural features in the achievement emotions of Japanese students. The first pilot study demonstrated that the J-MES descriptions were clear, and that the scale captured an appropriate range of emotions. The second study revealed that the J-MES scale's profiles and internal structure were largely consistent with control-value theory. The achievement emotions of pride, compassion, and surprise in the J-MES were found to be susceptible to cultural differences between North American and Japanese contexts. Our findings clearly demonstrated the scoring capacity, generalizability, and extrapolability of the J-MES.",

There are two contrasting approaches in competence assessment: an analytic approach that aims to precisely measure observable constituents and facets of competence and a holistic approach that focuses on a comprehensive assessment of competences in complex real situations reflecting actual performance. We would like to contribute to the existing discourse about medical competence and its assessment by proposing an approach that can provide orientation for the development of competence-based assessment concepts in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. The approach follows Kane's framework of an \"argument-based approach\" to validity and is based on insights into task complexity, testing and learning theories as well as the importance of the learning environment. It describes a continuum from analytic to holistic approaches to assess the constituents and facets of competence to performance. We conclude that the complexity of a task should determine the selection of the assessment and suggest to use this approach to reorganize and adapt competence assessment.",

    "abstract": "Prior work experience in a relevant medical profession is an important admission criterion currently used at many German medical schools in addition to cognitive criteria. In other countries, work experience is often considered in later admission stages (e.g., interviews with pre-selected subgroups of applicants). However, evidence for its predictive validity for study success in addition to cognitive admission criteria is currently lacking. We therefore assessed whether completed vocational training in a relevant medical profession can predict study performance in the first two years of study in addition to cognitive admission criteria. Admission and study performance data of all currently enrolled medical students at two German medical schools (Göttingen and Heidelberg) beginning with the 2013/14 cohort were retrospectively analyzed. Cognitive admission criteria in our sample were GPA grades and a cognitive test (\"Test für Medizinische Studiengänge\", TMS). We defined the study outcome parameter as the mean percentile rank over all performance data points over the first two years of study for each location, respectively. A multi-level model with varying intercepts by location, GPA, TMS, vocational training, and sex as predictors accounted for 14.5% of the variance in study outcome. A positive predictive association with study outcome was found for vocational training (ß = 0.33, p = .008) beyond GPA (ß = 0.38, p < .001) and TMS (ß = 0.26, p < .001). Our results support the use of prior vocational training as a selection criterion for medical studies potentially adding predictive validity to cognitive criteria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Collaboration between healthcare providers helps tackle the increasing complexity of healthcare. When learning teamwork, interprofessional students are expected to work patient-centered; recognizing the patient’s expertise and partnering with them. Research on interprofessional education (IPE) for undergraduates has illuminated learning outcomes, organization of learning activities, change in attitudes, etc. But, we know little about the interaction between patients and interprofessional student teams. This study aimed to explore how interprofessional student teams and patients interact in interprofessional clinical placements. With a focused ethnographic approach, participant observation and qualitative interviews were conducted in two contexts; a physical and an online arrangement. Central ideas in Goffman’s dramaturgy constituted a theoretical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis generated three themes: (1) Preparing safe and comfortable encounters with patients, (2) Including and excluding the patient in the encounter, and (3) Adjusting to the patient's situation. We identified students’ intentions of patient-centeredness when preparing encounters, but patients did not always feel included and listened to in encounters. After encountering patients, student teams adjusted their teamwork, by changing the team composition or the planned clinical interventions to better meet the patients’ needs. Notably, team-based patient encounters led to a different view of the patient, their health issues, and how to collaborate. Our findings can inform educators of the importance of addressing patient-centered care in interprofessional learning arrangements. Today, clinical interprofessional placements may not exploit the potential for learning about patient-centeredness. A thematization of this, e.g., in supervision in future clinical placements can ensure an enhanced focus on this in interprofessional teamwork.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Variation in examiner stringency is a recognised problem in many standardised summative assessments of performance such as the OSCE. The stated strength of the OSCE is that such error might largely balance out over the exam as a whole. This study uses linear mixed models to estimate the impact of different factors (examiner, station, candidate and exam) on station-level total domain score and, separately, on a single global grade. The exam data is from 442 separate administrations of an 18 station OSCE for international medical graduates who want to work in the National Health Service in the UK. We find that variation due to examiner is approximately twice as large for domain scores as it is for grades (16% vs. 8%), with smaller residual variance in the former (67% vs. 76%). Combined estimates of exam-level (relative) reliability across all data are 0.75 and 0.69 for domains scores and grades respectively. The correlation between two separate estimates of stringency for individual examiners (one for grades and one for domain scores) is relatively high (r=0.76) implying that examiners are generally quite consistent in their stringency between these two assessments of performance. Cluster analysis indicates that examiners fall into two broad groups characterised as hawks or doves on both measures. At the exam level, correcting for examiner stringency produces systematically lower cut-scores under borderline regression standard setting than using the raw marks. In turn, such a correction would produce higher pass rates—although meaningful direct comparisons are challenging to make. As in other studies, this work shows that OSCEs and other standardised performance assessments are subject to substantial variation in examiner stringency, and require sufficient domain sampling to ensure quality of pass/fail decision-making is at least adequate. More, perhaps qualitative, work is needed to understand better how examiners might score similarly (or differently) between the awarding of station-level domain scores and global grades. The issue of the potential systematic bias of borderline regression evidenced for the first time here, with sources of error producing cut-scores higher than they should be, also needs more investigation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Automatic Item Generation (AIG) refers to the process of using cognitive models to generate test items using computer modules. It is a new but rapidly evolving research area where cognitive and psychometric theory are combined into digital framework. However, assessment of the item quality, usability and validity of AIG relative to traditional item development methods lacks clarification. This paper takes a top-down strong theory approach to evaluate AIG in medical education. Two studies were conducted: Study I—participants with different levels of clinical knowledge and item writing experience developed medical test items both manually and through AIG. Both item types were compared in terms of quality and usability (efficiency and learnability) ; Study II—Automatically generated items were included in a summative exam in the content area of surgery. A psychometric analysis based on Item Response Theory inspected the validity and quality of the AIG-items. Items generated by AIG presented quality, evidences of validity and were adequate for testing student’s knowledge. The time spent developing the contents for item generation (cognitive models) and the number of items generated did not vary considering the participants' item writing experience or clinical knowledge. AIG produces numerous high-quality items in a fast, economical and easy to learn process, even for inexperienced and without clinical training item writers. Medical schools may benefit from a substantial improvement in cost-efficiency in developing test items by using AIG. Item writing flaws can be significantly reduced thanks to the application of AIG's models, thus generating test items capable of accurately gauging students' knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Choosing a career pathway in medicine is a high stakes decision for both medical students and the field of medicine as a whole. While past research has examined how characteristics of the medical student or specialties influence this decision, we introduce temporal elements as novel variables influencing career selection decisions in medicine. Specifically, we investigate how timing and duration of residency options, based on a rotation schedule that medical students have limited control over, influence their career selection decisions. An archival study investigating 5 years of medical student rotation schedules (N = 115) reveals that clinical rotation options appearing earlier and more often in the schedule were more likely to be selected. Moreover, timing and duration of exposure interacted such that residency options appearing later in the schedules were more likely to be selected if they also appeared more often. Conditional logistic regressions using student fixed-effects to control for idiosyncratic medical student differences (i.e., gender, & debt, etc.), and residency fixed-effects to control for idiosyncratic residency differences (income, and lifestyle, etc.), revealed the rotation schedule had a significant impact on residency selection decisions even when controlling for factors typically influencing this decision. Medical students' career decisions are influenced by when and how long different choice options appear in their rotation schedule, especially when they have limited influence over this schedule. The results have implications for healthcare policy by highlighting a tool for adjusting physician workforce composition by broadening exposure to a greater array of career options.",

    "abstract": "Abstract How medical students, their teachers, and school administrators understand disability appears connected to ongoing, unequal access to medical education for disabled people. The stigmatization of disability within medical education affects students’ disability disclosures, yet few studies have explored how understandings of disability influence inclusion practices beyond individual student actions. This paper develops the concept of legibility , derived from a constructivist grounded theory study that examined disability inclusion at four U.S. medical schools through interviews with 19 disabled students and 27 school officials (faculty and administrators). With two dimensions (recognition and assessment of possibility), legibility demonstrates that knowing disability is relational, contextual, and equivocal. Drawing from the field of disability studies, the paper argues that the current paradigm of disability inclusion demands that students’ disability experiences be highly legible to themselves and others, yet increased legibility comes with potential risk due to prevalent ableism. While individual interactions can shift understandings of disability towards greater inclusivity, systemic action that embeds liberating discourses of disability into medical education is needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract China hosts around 68,000 international medical students (IMSs) primarily from lower income countries in Africa and Asia, who have the potential to contribute to international medical services. Understanding how these IMSs make career decisions can help better address the issue of global medical workforce shortage. However, such research is limited. Our study aims to explore the career decision-making process of China-educated IMSs, the challenges they experienced and the strategies they employed. In this exploratory qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with IMSs educated in China in 2022 using purposeful sampling. Twenty virtual one-on-one interviews were conducted, and data were analysed through directed qualitative content analysis. Cognitive Information Processing (CIP) theory was applied as the guiding framework for organising and analysing the data. The career decision-making process of the participants generally followed the stages of decision-making cycle in CIP theory, with a combination of urgent migration decisions and specialisation considerations adding layers of complexity to their career trajectories. Identified challenges encompassed lack of knowledge about oneself and career options, lack of decision-making skills, concerns of contextual complexities that limited the career decision-making process, low motivation and negative thoughts. Specific challenges due to their role as IMSs arose, which were related to career information access, self-capability evaluation, degree accreditation, employment competitiveness and mental states. Participants’ proposed strategies were categorised into personal and institutional aspects, providing insights into addressing these challenges. This study substantiates and expands the application of the CIP theory within the sphere of the particular cultural and educational context of IMSs educated in China. It highlights the significance of integrating migration decision-making into career guidance for IMSs, and contributes to the literature by proposing an evidence-based tiered career intervention programme for IMSs.",

Literature describes a variety of methods giving students opportunities and encouragement for reflection. Although the literature states that learning and working together in peer meetings fosters reflection, these findings are based on experienced professionals. We do not know whether participation in peer meetings also makes a positive contribution to the learning experiences of undergraduate students in terms of reflection.The aim of this study is to gain an understanding of the role of peer meetings in students' learning experiences regarding reflection.A phenomenographic qualitative study was undertaken. Students' learning experiences in peer meetings were analyzed by investigating the learning reports in students' portfolios. Data were coded using open coding.The results indicate that peer meetings created an interactive learning environment in which students learned about themselves, their skills and their abilities as novice professionals. Students also mentioned conditions for a well-functioning group.The findings indicate that peer meetings foster the development of reflection skills as part of professional behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to web-based learning although the advantages of computer-aided instruction over traditional teaching formats still need to be confirmed. This study examined whether participation in an online module on the differential diagnosis of dyspnoea impacts on student performance in a multiple choice examination of factual knowledge in cardiology and pneumology. A virtual problem-based learning environment for medical students supervised by postgraduate teachers was created. Seventy-four out of 183 fourth-year medical students volunteered to use the online module while attending a 6-week cardio-respiratory curriculum in summer 2007. Of these, 40 were randomly selected to be included (intervention group); the remaining 34 served as an internal control group. Analysis of all written exams taken during the preceding term showed that both groups were comparable (86.4 ± 1.1 vs. 85.9 ± 1.1%; p = 0.751). Students in the intervention group scored significantly higher in the final course assessment than students allocated to the control group (84.8 ± 1.3 vs. 79.5 ± 1.4%; p = 0.006; effect size 0.67). Thus, additional problem-based learning with an online module as part of an undergraduate cardio-respiratory curriculum lead to higher students' scores in an exam testing factual knowledge. Whether using this teaching format increases overall student motivation to engage in the learning process needs to be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Integrated curricula have been implemented in medical schools all over the world. However, among countries different relative numbers of schools with integrated curricula are found. This study aims to explore the possible correlation between the percentage of medical schools with integrated curricula in a country and that country's cultural characteristics. Curricula were defined as not integrated if in the first 2 years of the program at least two out of the three monodisciplinary courses Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry were identified. Culture was defined using Hofstede's dimensions Power distance, Uncertainty avoidance, Masculinity/Femininity, and Individualism/Collectivism. Consequently, this study had to be restricted to the 63 countries included in Hofstede's studies which harbored 1,195 medical schools. From each country we randomly sampled a maximum of 15 schools yielding 484 schools to be investigated. In total 91% (446) of the curricula were found. Correlation of percent integrated curricula and each dimension of culture was determined by calculating Spearman's Rho. A high score on the Power distance index and a high score on the Uncertainty avoidance index correlated with a low percent integrated curricula; a high score on the Individualism index correlated with a high percent integrated curricula. The percentage integrated curricula in a country did not correlate with its score on the Masculinity index. National culture is associated with the propensity of medical schools to adopt integrated medical curricula. Consequently, medical schools considering introduction of integrated and problem-based medical curricula should take into account dimensions of national culture which may hinder the innovation process.",

The five problem characteristics were: (1) problem clarity, (2) problem familiarity, (3) the extent to which the problem stimulated group discussion, (4) self-study, and (5) identification of learning goals. The results showed that problem clarity led to more group discussion, identification of learning goals, and self-study than problem familiarity. On the other hand, problem familiarity had a stronger and direct impact on academic achievement.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation of medical images is a primary task for radiologists. Besides two-dimensional (2D) images, current imaging technologies allow for volumetric display of medical images. Whereas current radiology practice increasingly uses volumetric images, the majority of studies on medical image interpretation is conducted on 2D images. The current study aimed to gain deeper insight into the volumetric image interpretation process by examining this process in twenty radiology trainees who all completed four volumetric image cases. Two types of data were obtained concerning scroll behaviors and think-aloud data. Types of scroll behavior concerned oscillations, half runs, full runs, image manipulations, and interruptions. Think-aloud data were coded by a framework of knowledge and skills in radiology including three cognitive processes: perception, analysis, and synthesis. Relating scroll behavior to cognitive processes showed that oscillations and half runs coincided more often with analysis and synthesis than full runs, whereas full runs coincided more often with perception than oscillations and half runs. Interruptions were characterized by synthesis and image manipulations by perception. In addition, we investigated relations between cognitive processes and found an overall bottom-up way of reasoning with dynamic interactions between cognitive processes, especially between perception and analysis. In sum, our results highlight the dynamic interactions between these processes and the grounding of cognitive processes in scroll behavior. It suggests, that the types of scroll behavior are relevant to describe how radiologists interact with and manipulate volumetric images.",

    "abstract": "Student participation in governance of education is of growing interest. However, it remains unclear what factors render this participation in institutional governance a success or a failure. Another question is: what are the perceived benefits for schools and students? We empirically explored experiences and perspectives of student representatives and program directors of all (8) medical and (1) veterinary schools in the Netherlands on factors that influence student participation in institutional governance and its values and challenges for schools and student representatives. A constructivist grounded theory study was performed. A theoretical sample of student representatives was invited to fill out an explorative, qualitative questionnaire. Next, focus groups with student representatives and interviews with all program directors were conducted. Data was analyzed using open, axial and selective coding by all authors. Experiences and perspectives of students and program directors were remarkably similar in both perceived influences and values. Four main categories of influences could be distinguished in student participation: (1) individual student characteristics, (2) individual staff characteristics, (3) the organization of student representatives and (4) the school's organization, including its culture and policy regarding student participation. A cohesive, well-organized and independent student organization has crucial impact on student participation in educational governance processes. For representatives, major benefits of participation are personal and career development. Challenges are low effectiveness and efficiency of their actions. A clear school policy on student participation and better introduction, feedback and coaching of representatives should be provided to improve student participation in governance processes.",

The predictive value of these different types of selection criteria has however never been investigated within the same curriculum while using a control group. We therefore set up a study that enabled us to compare the academic performance of three different admission groups, all composed of school-leaver entry students, and all enrolled in the same Bachelor curriculum: students selected on non-cognitive criteria, students selected on cognitive criteria and students admitted by lottery. First-year GPA and number of course credits (ECTS) at 52 weeks after enrollment of non-cognitive selected students (N = 102), cognitive selected students (N = 92) and lottery-admitted students (N = 356) were analyzed. In addition, chances of dropping out, probability of passing the third-year OSCE, and completing the Bachelor program in 3 years were compared. Although there were no significant differences between the admission groups in first-year GPA, cognitive selected students had obtained significantly more ECTS at 52 weeks and dropped out less often than lottery-admitted students. Probabilities of passing the OSCE and completing the bachelor program in 3 years did not significantly differ between the groups. These findings indicate that the use of only non-cognitive selection criteria is not sufficient to select the best academically performing students, most probably because a minimal cognitive basis is needed to succeed in medical school.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic reasoning is considered to be based on the interaction between analytical and non-analytical cognitive processes. Gut feelings, a specific form of non-analytical reasoning, play a substantial role in diagnostic reasoning by general practitioners (GPs) and may activate analytical reasoning. In GP traineeships in the Netherlands, trainees mostly see patients alone but regularly consult with their supervisors to discuss patients and problems, receive feedback, and improve their competencies. In the present study, we examined the discussions of supervisors and their trainees about diagnostic reasoning in these so-called tutorial dialogues and how gut feelings feature in these discussions. 17 tutorial dialogues focussing on diagnostic reasoning were video-recorded and transcribed and the protocols were analysed using a detailed bottom-up and iterative content analysis and coding procedure. The dialogues were segmented into quotes. Each quote received a content code and a participant code. The number of words per code was used as a unit of analysis to quantitatively compare the contributions to the dialogues made by supervisors and trainees, and the attention given to different topics. The dialogues were usually analytical reflections on a trainee's diagnostic reasoning. A hypothetico-deductive strategy was often used, by listing differential diagnoses and discussing what information guided the reasoning process and might confirm or exclude provisional hypotheses. Gut feelings were discussed in seven dialogues. They were used as a tool in diagnostic reasoning, inducing analytical reflection, sometimes on the entire diagnostic reasoning process. The emphasis in these tutorial dialogues was on analytical components of diagnostic reasoning. Discussing gut feelings in tutorial dialogues seems to be a good educational method to familiarize trainees with non-analytical reasoning. Supervisors need specialised knowledge about these aspects of diagnostic reasoning and how to deal with them in medical education.",

While the failure-to-fail literature suggests that emotion may be important, little is known about the role of emotion for educators. Secondary analyses were therefore conducted on data exploring 110 trainers' and trainees' feedback experiences. Group and individual narrative interviews were conducted across three UK sites. We analysed 333 narratives for emotional talk using textual analysis: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Furthermore, thematic framework analysis was conducted on the trainer narratives to explore aspects of feedback processes that are emotional. An additional in-depth little 'd' discourse analysis was conducted on selected trainer narratives to enable us to explore the complex relationship between the whats (reported events) and the hows (emotional talk). Trainer narratives did not differ significantly in positive or negative emotional talk from trainee narratives. By exploring the interplay of the whats and the hows, several aspects of feedback processes were identified as potentially emotional for trainers including trainers being concerned about upsetting learners and worried about patient safety. This was illustrated through numerous linguistic devices to establish emotional tone such as metaphoric talk and laughter. These findings suggest that feedback processes can be emotional for trainers. It highlights the need to better understand the 'filter' of emotion for trainers but also to better understand how emotion plays a role in feedback as a complex social process.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated that medical students and doctors rank specialties differently in terms of perceived status and prestige. At the same time some of the specialties have problems with recruiting and retaining staff. This study aimed to understand what constitutes status and prestige in the medical field and how it influences medical doctors' choice of specialty. By using a sociological perspective and applying Bourdieu's theoretical concepts of field, symbolic capital and perceived status, we analysed young doctors' journeys towards their chosen specialty. We conducted 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews. The data was analysed using content analysis. The findings suggest that medical specialties carry different social status. In the field of power, surgery is seen as the most prestigious of all specialties. However, in the future it might be a less attractive choice when young doctors tend to view their profession less as an identity and more like a job. For specialties perceived as low status, the challenge is to raise popularity by better describing to young doctors the characteristics and advantages of these specialties.",

    "abstract": "In postgraduate medical education, required competencies are described in detail in existing competency frameworks. This study proposes an alternative strategy for competency-based medical education design, which is supported by change management theories. We demonstrate the value of allowing room for re-invention and creative adaptation of innovations. This new strategy was explored for the development of a new generic competency framework for a harmonised European curriculum in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The generic competency framework was developed through action research. Data were collected by four European stakeholder groups (patients, nurses, midwives and hospital boards), using a variety of methods. Subsequently, the data were analysed further in consensus discussions with European specialists and trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. These discussions ensured that the framework provides guidance, is specialty-specific, and that implementation in all European countries could be feasible. The presented generic competency framework identifies four domains: 'Patient-centred care', 'Teamwork', 'System-based practice' and 'Personal and professional development'. For each of these four domains, guiding competencies were defined. The new generic competency framework is supported by European specialists and trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, as well as by their European stakeholders. According to change management theories, it seems vital to allow room for re-invention and creative adaptation of the competency framework by medical professionals. Therefore, the generic competency framework offers guidance rather than prescription. The presented strategy for competency framework development offers leads for implementation of competency-based medical education as well as for development of innovations in postgraduate medical education in general.",

    "abstract": "Open-book examinations (OBEs) will likely become increasingly important assessment tools. We investigated how access to open-book resources affected questions testing factual recall, which might be easy to look-up, versus questions testing higher-order cognitive domains. Few studies have investigated OBEs using modern Internet resources or as summative assessments. We compared performance on an examination conducted as a traditional closed-book exam (CBE) in 2019 (N = 320) and a remote OBE with free access to Internet resources in 2020 (N = 337) due to COVID-19. This summative, end-of-year assessment focused on basic science for second-year medical students. We categorized questions by Bloom's taxonomy ('Remember', versus 'Understand/Apply'). We predicted higher performance on the OBE, driven by higher performance on 'Remember' questions. We used an item-centric analysis by using performance per item over all examinees as the outcome variable in logistic regression, with terms 'Open-Book, 'Bloom Category' and their interaction. Performance was higher on OBE questions than CBE questions (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 2.14-2.39), and higher on 'Remember' than 'Understand/Apply' questions (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.09-1.19). The difference in performance between 'Remember' and 'Understand/Apply' questions was greater in the OBE than the CBE ('Open-Book' * 'Bloom Category' interaction: OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.19-1.37). Access to open-book resources had a greater effect on performance on factual recall questions than higher-order questions, though performance was higher in the OBE overall. OBE design must consider how searching for information affects performance, particularly on questions measuring different domains of knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice (IPECP) is a field of study suggested to improve team functioning and patient safety. However, even interprofessional teams are susceptible to group pressures which may inhibit speaking up (positive deviance). Obedience is one group pressure that can inhibit positive deviance leading to negative patient outcomes. To examine the influence of obedience to authority in an interprofessional setting, an experimental simulated clinical scenario was conducted with Respiratory Therapy (RT) (n = 40) and Advanced Care Paramedic (ACP) (n = 20) students. In an airway management scenario, it was necessary for students to challenge an authority, a senior anesthesiologist, to prevent patient harm. In a 2 × 2 design cognitive load and an interventional writing task designed to increase positive deviance were tested. The effect of individual characteristics, including Moral Foundations, and displacement of responsibility were also examined. There was a significant effect for profession and cognitive load: RT students demonstrated lower levels of positive deviance in the low cognitive load scenario than students in other conditions. The writing task did not have a significant effect on RT or ACP students’ behaviour. The influence of Moral Foundations differed from expectations, In Group Loyalty was selected as a negative predictor of positive deviance while Respect for Authority was not. Displacement of responsibility was influential for some participants thought not for all. Other individual variables were identified for further investigation. Observational analysis of the simulation videos was conducted to obtain further insight into student behaviour in a compliance scenario. Individual differences, including experience, should be considered when providing education and training for positive deviance. Simulation provides an ideal setting to use compliance scenarios to train for positive deviance and for experimentation to study interprofessional team behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Some educators have described clinical documentation as \"scut\". Research in medicine has focused on documentation's communicative value and not its function in learning. With time being an important commodity and electronic health records changing how we document, understanding the learning value of documentation is essential. The purpose of this study was to explore how trainee composing practices shape learning. Qualitative methods employing Rhetorical Genre Theory were used to explore clinical documentation practices among medical trainees. Data collection and analysis occurred in iterative cycles. Data included field notes and field interviews from 110 h of observing junior trainees and senior internal medicine residents participating in patient admission and follow-up visits. Analysis was focused on Paré and Smart's framework for studying documentation as composing. From a composing lens, documentation plays a vital role in learning in clinical settings. Junior trainees were observed to be reliant on using writing to support their thinking around patient care. Before patient encounters, writing helped trainees focus on what was already known and develop a preliminary understanding of the patient's problem(s). After encounters, writing helped trainees synthesize the data and develop an assessment and plan. Before and after the encounter, through writing, trainees also identified knowledge and data collection gaps. Our findings highlight clinical documentation as more than a communication task. Rather, the writing process itself appeared to play a pivotal role in supporting thinking. While some have proposed strategies for reducing trainee involvement, we argue that writing can be time well spent.",

While experiences of workplace learning have been extensively investigated, practices of workplace learning explored through field work have been less utilized. The theoretical framework of teaching and learning regimes acknowledges aspects of power and conflict in its consideration of what guides teachers and learners in their practice of workplace learning. This study aimed to explore practices of workplace learning in the two adjacent healthcare professions; medicine and nursing. We adopted an ethnographic qualitative design. Field observations and follow-up interviews were performed in three clinical departments and the data set comprised 12 full days of observations and 16 formal follow-up interviews. Thematic analysis was performed deductively according to the theoretical framework. Four teaching and learning regimes were found in the data. In the medical context, workplace learning was either practiced as reproduction of current practice or through stimulation of professional development. In the nursing context, workplace learning was either based on development of partnership between student and supervisor or on conditional membership in a professional community. The medical and nursing contexts demonstrated varying underpinnings and assumptions relating to teaching and learning. The respective practices of workplace learning in the medical and nursing context appear to hold substantial differences which might have implications for how we understand practices of workplace learning. We further conclude that the theoretical framework of teaching and learning regimes in this study proved useful in exploring workplace learning.",

Little is known about how different selection tools impact student diversity across programs using different combinations of traditional and broadened selection criteria. The present multi-site study examined the chances in selection of subgroups of applicants to HPE undergraduate programs with distinctive selection procedures, and their performance on corresponding selection tools. Probability of selection of subgroups (based on gender, migration background, prior education, parental education) of applicants (N = 1935) to five selection procedures of corresponding Dutch HPE undergraduate programs was estimated using multilevel logistic regression. Multilevel linear regression was used to analyze performance on four tools: prior-education grade point average (pe-GPA), biomedical knowledge test, curriculum-sampling test, and curriculum vitae (CV). First-generation Western immigrants and applicants with a foreign education background were significantly less likely to be selected than applicants without a migration background and with pre-university education. These effects did not vary across programs. More variability in effects was found between different selection tools. Compared to women, men performed significantly poorer on CVs, while they had higher scores on biomedical knowledge tests. Applicants with a non-Western migration background scored lower on curriculum-sampling tests. First-generation Western immigrants had lower CV-scores. First-generation university applicants had significantly lower pe-GPAs. There was a variety in effects for applicants with different alternative forms of prior education. For curriculum-sampling tests and CVs, effects varied across programs. Our findings highlight the need for continuous evaluation, identifying best practices within existing tools, and applying alternative tools.",

Whilst most students pass these placements, a small percentage of students will fail or be at risk of failing. Supporting students undergoing a failing experience is a time critical, time consuming, emotional and resource-heavy task which is often undertaken by key university staff and impacts all stakeholders. Whilst several studies have provided insight into this experience from the educator and/or university perspective, this scoping review aimed to identify the students’ experience of failing or nearly failing a professional practice experience. Following Arskey and O’Malley’s framework for scoping reviews, 24 papers were included in this review. This review generated six themes including the reasons for failure, how failure looks and feels, how supports, service and strategies influence the student experience of failure, the importance of communication, relationships and organisational culture, the impact infrastructure and policies have, and the consequences of failure. The outcomes of this scoping review highlighted three key characteristics of the research to date: (a) the student voice is still largely missing; (b) the student perspective is distinctly different to that of other stakeholders; and (c) the interventions used appear not to be student-informed or student-led. Better understanding this experience from the student’s perspective could create a more sustainable practice education environment by designing and implementing more effective supports, services or strategies that reduce the overall impact a failing experience has on students and key stakeholders.",

Through a sociomaterial perspective, we can better understand IPE and IPC practices by foregrounding the material aspect of learning and working together and examining its relationship with humans and their interactions. This article aimed to examine existing literature that discusses the application of sociomaterial perspectives in IPE and IPC. A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework to explore the extent within the current body of knowledge that discuss how sociomaterial perspective is applied in IPE and IPC practices. A systematic database search was performed in September 2021 to retrieve literature published from 2007 onwards, with forty-three papers meeting the inclusion criteria. These papers included research articles, book chapters, conference papers and commentaries, with the majority originating from Europe. The thematic analysis revealed the following themes: (1) power as a sociomaterial entity shaping IPE and IPC; (2) inclusion of non-health professionals in reimagining IPE and IPC practices, and (3) the critical understanding of sociomateriality. The findings suggest that a sociomaterial perspective can allow for the reimagination of the contemporary and future practices of interprofessionalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studying texts constitutes a significant part of student learning in health professions education. Key to learning from text is the ability to effectively monitor one’s own cognitive performance and take appropriate regulatory steps for improvement. Inferential cues generated during a learning experience typically guide this monitoring process. It has been shown that interventions to assist learners in using comprehension cues improve their monitoring accuracy. One such intervention is having learners to complete a diagram. Little is known, however, about how learners use cues to shape their monitoring judgments. In addition, previous research has not examined the difference in cue use between categories of learners, such as good and poor monitors. This study explored the types and patterns of cues used by participants after being subjected to a diagram completion task prior to their prediction of performance (PoP). Participants’ thought processes were studied by means of a think-aloud method during diagram completion and the subsequent PoP. Results suggest that relying on comprehension-specific cues may lead to a better PoP. Poor monitors relied on multiple cue types and failed to use available cues appropriately. They gave more incorrect responses and made commission errors in the diagram, which likely led to their overconfidence. Good monitors, on the other hand, utilized cues that are predictive of learning from the diagram completion task and seemed to have relied on comprehension cues for their PoP. However, they tended to be cautious in their judgement, which probably made them underestimate themselves. These observations contribute to the current understanding of the use and effectiveness of diagram completion as a cue-prompt intervention and provide direction for future research in enhancing monitoring accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The entrustment framework redirects assessment from considering only trainees’ competence to decision-making about their readiness to perform clinical tasks independently. Since trainees and supervisors both contribute to entrustment decisions, we examined the cognitive and affective factors that underly their negotiation of trust, and whether trainee demographic characteristics may bias them. Using a document analysis approach, we adapted large language models (LLMs) to examine feedback dialogs (N = 24,187, each with an associated entrustment rating) between medical student trainees and their clinical supervisors. We compared how trainees and supervisors differentially documented feedback dialogs about similar tasks by identifying qualitative themes and quantitatively assessing their correlation with entrustment ratings. Supervisors’ themes predominantly reflected skills related to patient presentations, while trainees’ themes were broader—including clinical performance and personal qualities. To examine affect, we trained an LLM to measure feedback sentiment. On average, trainees used more negative language (5.3% lower probability of positive sentiment, p &lt; 0.05) compared to supervisors, while documenting higher entrustment ratings (+ 0.08 on a 1–4 scale, p &lt; 0.05). We also found biases tied to demographic characteristics: trainees’ documentation reflected more positive sentiment in the case of male trainees (+ 1.3%, p &lt; 0.05) and of trainees underrepresented in medicine (UIM) (+ 1.3%, p &lt; 0.05). Entrustment ratings did not appear to reflect these biases, neither when documented by trainee nor supervisor. As such, bias appeared to influence the emotive language trainees used to document entrustment more than the degree of entrustment they experienced. Mitigating these biases is nonetheless important because they may affect trainees’ assimilation into their roles and formation of trusting relationships.",

Our study explores how the field of academic medicine is preparing for this digital future. Method Active strategic plans available in English were collected from faculties of medicine in Canada ( n = 14), departments in medical schools ( n = 17), academic health science centres ( n = 23) and associated research institutes ( n = 5). In total, 59 strategic plans were subjected to a practice-oriented form of document analysis, informed by the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries. Results On the one hand, digital health is discursively treated as a continuation of the academic medicine vision, with expansions of physician competencies and of research institutes contributions. These imaginaries do not necessarily disrupt the field of academic medicine as currently configured. On the other hand, there is a vision of digital health pursuing a robust sociotechnical future with transformative implications for how care is conducted, what forms of knowledge are prioritized, how patients and patienthood will be understood, and how data work will be distributed. This imaginary may destabilize existing distributions of knowledge and power. Conclusions Looking through the lens of sociotechnical imaginaries, this study illuminates strategic plans as framing desirable futures, directing attention towards specific ways of understanding problems of healthcare, and mobilizing the resources to knit together social and technical systems in ways that bring these visions to fruition. There are bound to be tensions as these sociotechnical imaginaries are translated into material realities. Many of those tensions and their attempted resolutions will have direct implications for the expectations of health professional graduates, the nature of clinical learning environments, and future relationships with patients. Sociology of digital health and science and technology studies can provide useful insights to guide leaders in academic medicine shaping these digital futures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Concept-based approaches to curriculum design have been proposed to solve content and curricula overload and promote conceptual learning. Few health professions have adopted this approach and little is known about how to support this educational change. We aimed to understand how nutrition and dietetics educators may navigate proposed education change towards concept-based curricula. We employed an interpretivist approach and in-depth interviews that explored the views of nutrition and dietetic educators towards using a concept-based approach to curriculum. Employing deductive thematic analysis based on the diffusion of innovation theory, data from twenty experienced dietetics educators were analysed. Three main themes were identified; the need for change champions, concerns about change, and the complexity of the education system. Diffusion of innovation theory highlighted that to enact change, the relative advantage and compatibility of the approach with current structures and systems, with evidence from trialling and observing the new approach in action, were needed. Developing education leaders and infiltrating the social system of education through existing communities of practice is critical to enacting educational change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background : Although interprofessional student led health clinics have been implemented worldwide, the impact of this model await confirmation. Objectives : To conduct a critical analysis of the literature on interprofessional student led clinics, and the views of stakeholders on feasibility and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. Design : A scoping review, evidence synthesis and quality appraisal were conducted using PRISMA Scr. Eight databases were searched from 2003 to 2023: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane, Scopus, ERIC, Web of Science and Informit Health Collection. A qualitative descriptive approach was used to analyse data from patients, students and educators and inductive thematic analysis identified emergent themes. Results : Forty-six studies were included from a yield of 3140 publications. A key theme to emerge was that patients perceived improvements in their health and wellbeing and valued gaining health information from student led clinics. Student experiences were mostly positive although some found it challenging to work in interprofessional teams and roles were not always clear. The clinics enabled students to improve communication skills and autonomy. Clinical educators reported that students benefited from experiential learning within an interprofessional context. The clinics were feasible, provided that sufficient funding, infrastructure, staff and resources were available. Barriers to implementation included lack of funding, excessive waiting times and non-aligned student timetables. Pre-clinic orientation and support from on-site clinical educators facilitated implementation. Conclusions : Despite some challenges with implementing interprofessional student led clinics, they can have a positive impact on student learning and patient experiences.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the stability of three distinct tutor behaviors (1) use of subject-matter expertise, (2) social congruence and (3) cognitive congruence, in a problem-based learning (PBL) environment. The data comprised the input from 16,047 different students to a survey of 762 tutors administered in three consecutive semesters. Over the three semesters each tutor taught two of the same course and one different course. A generalizability study was conducted to determine whether the tutor behaviors were generalizable across the three measurement occasions. The results indicate that three semesters are sufficient to make generalizations about all three tutor behaviors. In addition the results show that individual differences between tutors account for the greatest differences in levels of expertise, social congruence and cognitive congruence. The study concludes that tutor behaviors are fairly consistent in PBL and somewhat impervious to change. Implications of these findings for tutor training are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Until now, positive effects of assessment at a medical curriculum level have not been demonstrated. This study was performed to determine whether an interim assessment, taken during a small group work session of an ongoing biomedical course, results in students' increased performance at the formal course examination. A randomized controlled trial was set up, with an interim assessment without explicit feedback as intervention. It was performed during a regular biomedical Bachelor course of 4 weeks on General Pathology at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. Participants were 326 medical and 91 biomedical science students divided into three study arms: arm Intervention-1 (I-1) receiving one interim assessment; arm I-2 receiving two interim assessments, and control arm C, receiving no interim assessment. The study arms were stratified for gender and study discipline. The interim assessment consisted of seven multiple-choice questions on tumour pathology. Main outcome measures were overall score of the formal examination (scale 1–10), and the subscore of the questions on tumour pathology (scale 1–10). We found that students who underwent an interim assessment (arm I) had a 0.29-point (scale 1–10) higher score on the formal examination than the control group (p = 0.037). For the questions in the formal examination on tumour pathology the score amounted to 0.47 points higher (p = 0.007), whereas it was 0.17 points higher for the questions on topics related to the previous 3 weeks. No differences in formal examination score were found between arms I-1 and I-2 (p = 0.817). These findings suggest that an interim assessment during a small group work session in a randomized study setting stimulates students to increase their formal examination score.",

    "abstract": "Despite repeated calls for change, the problem of widening access (WA) to medicine persists globally. One factor which may be operating to maintain social exclusion is the language used in representing WA applicants and students by the gatekeepers and representatives of medical schools, Admissions Deans. We therefore examined the institutional discourse of UK Medical Admissions Deans in order to determine how values regarding WA are communicated and presented in this context. We conducted a linguistic analysis of qualitative interviews with Admissions Deans and/or Staff from 24 of 32 UK medical schools. Corpus Linguistics data analysis determined broad patterns of frequency and word lists. This informed a critical discourse analysis of the data using an “othering” lens to explore and understand the judgements made of WA students by Admissions Deans, and the practices to which these judgments give rise. Representations of WA students highlighted existing divides and preconceptions in relation to WA programmes and students. Through using discourse that can be considered othering and divisive, issues of social divide and lack of integration in medicine were highlighted. Language served to reinforce pre-existing stereotypes and a significant ‘us’ and ‘them’ rhetoric exists in medical education. Even with drivers to achieve diversity and equality in medical education, existing social structures and preconceptions still influence the representations of applicants and students from outside the ‘traditional’ medical education model in the UK. Acknowledging this is a crucial step for medical schools wishing to address barriers to the perceived challenges to diversity.",

Factors that influence faculty in making use of teaching policy incentives have remained underexplored. Knowledge of these factors is needed to develop theory on the successful implementation of medical teaching policy in university hospitals. To explore factors that influence faculty in making use of teaching policy incentives and to develop a conceptual model for implementation of medical teaching policy in university hospitals. We used the grounded theory methodology. We applied constant comparative analysis to qualitative data obtained from 12 semi-structured interviews conducted at the Radboud University Medical Center. We used a constructivist approach, in which data and theories are co-created through interaction between the researcher and the field and its participants. We constructed a model for the implementation of medical teaching policy in university hospitals, including five factors that were perceived to promote or inhibit faculty in a university hospital to make use of teaching policy incentives: Executive Board Strategy, Departmental Strategy, Departmental Structure, Departmental Culture, and Individual Strategy. Most factors we found to affect individual teachers' strategies and their use of medical teaching policy lie at the departmental level. If an individual teacher's strategy is focused on medical teaching and a medical teaching career, and the departmental context offers support and opportunity for his/her development, this promotes faculty's use of teaching policy incentives.",

    "abstract": "The objective of scientific, or more broadly, academic knowledge is to provide an understanding of the social and natural world that lies beyond common sense and everyday thinking. Academics use an array of techniques, methods and conceptual apparatuses to achieve this goal. The question we explore in this essay is the following: Does the grounded theory approach, in the constructivist version developed by Kathy Charmaz, provide the necessary methodological tools for the creation of knowledge and theories beyond everyday thinking? To conduct our analysis, we have drawn on the rationalist epistemology originally developed by Gaston Bachelard and taken up a few decades later by Pierre Bourdieu and colleagues to look at the epistemological foundation of the CGT methods as defined by Charmaz. We focussed on two distinctive epistemological features characterising constructivist grounded theory (CGT): the use of inductive reasoning to generate interpretative theory; and the primacy of subjectivity over objectivity as the preferred path to knowledge making. While the usefulness of CGT for conducting qualitative research and understanding the perspective of social actors has been acknowledged by scholars in health professions education research and other research areas, the inductivist logic on which it draws raises questions concerning the nature of the knowledge yielded by this approach. As we argue in this article, it is still unclear in what way the interpretative theory generated by CGT is not a duplication of everyday thinking expressed through meta-narratives. It is also unclear how the understanding of social phenomena can be refined if the use of inductive procedures logically implies the creation of a new theory each time a study is conducted. We engage with these questions to broaden the epistemological conversation within the health professions education research community. It is our hope that scholars in the field will engage in this epistemological conversation and advance it in new directions.",

    "abstract": "Continuity is critical for safe patient care and its absence is associated with adverse outcomes. Continuity requires handoffs between physicians, but most published studies of educational interventions to improve handoffs have focused primarily on residents, despite interns expected to being proficient. The AAMC core entrustable activities for graduating medical students includes handoffs as a milestone, but no controlled studies with students have assessed the impact of training in handoff skills. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an educational intervention to improve third-year medical student handoff skills, the durability of learned skills into the fourth year, and the transfer of skills from the simulated setting to the clinical environment. Trained evaluators used standardized patient cases and an observation tool to assess verbal handoff skills immediately post intervention and during the student's fourth-year acting internship. Students were also observed doing real time sign-outs during their acting internship. Evaluators assessed untrained control students using a standardized case and performing a real-time sign-out. Intervention students mean score demonstrated improvement in handoff skills immediately after the workshop (2.6-3.8; p < 0.0001) that persisted into their fourth year acting internship when compared to baseline performance (3.9-3.5; p = 0.06) and to untrained control students (3.5 vs. 2.5; p < 0.001, d = 1.2). Intervention students evaluated in the clinical setting also scored higher than control students when assessed doing real-time handoffs (3.8 vs. 3.3; p = 0.032, d = 0.71). These findings should be useful to others considering introducing handoff teaching in the undergraduate medical curriculum in preparation for post-graduate medical training.

    "abstract": "Interprofessional practice is commonly discussed in the literature in terms of competencies. In this study we move away from the theoretical notions of criteria, concepts and guidelines to adopt an ontological approach which seeks to stay as close to the lived experience as possible. Our research asked 12 participants from a variety of health disciplines to tell their stories of working interprofessionally. We sought to glean meaning from the lived experience. Our phenomenological hermeneutic approach and interpretation were informed by Heidegger and Gadamer. Rather than offering a thematic overview, in this article we share three stories from the research that were congruent with other stories. The first, told by a doctor, is of a resuscitation in an emergency department. It shows how the effective working together of the interprofessional team was more than each member following a resuscitation protocol. There was 'something' about how they worked together that made this story stand out, even though the patient died. The second story showcases how 'who' the person is makes a difference. This nurse makes an effort to get to know other staff as people, to find common interests. In such a way interprofessional practice comes to flourish. The third story shows how a physiotherapist and a psychologist joined in conversation to seek innovative possibilities for a challenging situation. In such a way each built on the others expertise and were excited at the success they achieved for the patient. From these ontological accounts we have come to see that interprofessional practice flourishes when practitioners are their authentic, caring selves. Who the person is matters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Low stakes assessment without grading the performance of students in educational systems has received increasing attention in recent years. It is used in formative assessments to guide the learning process as well as in large-scales assessments to monitor educational programs. Yet, such assessments suffer from high variation in students’ test-taking effort. We aimed to identify institutional strategies related to serious test-taking behavior in low stakes assessment to provide medical schools with practical recommendations on how test-taking effort might be increased. First, we identified strategies that were already used by medical schools to increase the serious test-taking behavior on the low stakes Berlin Progress Test (BPT). Strategies which could be assigned to self-determination theory of Ryan and Deci were chosen for analysis. We conducted the study at nine medical schools in Germany and Austria with a total of 108,140 observations in an established low stakes assessment. A generalized linear-mixed effects model was used to assess the association between institutional strategies and the odds that students will take the BPT seriously. Overall, two institutional strategies were found to be positively related to more serious test-taking behavior: discussing low test performance with the mentor and consequences for not participating. Giving choice was negatively related to more serious test-taking behavior. At medical schools that presented the BPT as evaluation, this effect was larger in comparison to medical schools that presented the BPT as assessment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In dental medicine, interpreting radiographs (i.e., orthopantomograms, OPTs) is an error-prone process, even in experts. Effective intervention methods are therefore needed to support students in improving their image reading skills for OPTs. To this end, we developed a compare-and-contrast intervention, which aimed at supporting students in achieving full coverage when visually inspecting OPTs and, consequently, obtaining a better diagnostic performance. The comparison entailed a static eye movement visualization (heat map) on an OPT showing full gaze coverage from a peer-model (other student) and another heat map showing a student’s own gaze behavior. The intervention group ( N = 38) compared five such heat map combinations, whereas the control group ( N = 23) diagnosed five OPTs. Prior to the experimental variation (pre-test) and after it (post-test), students in both conditions searched for anomalies in OPTs while their gaze was recorded. Results showed that students in the intervention group covered more areas of the OPTs and looked less often and for a shorter amount of time at anomalies after the intervention. Furthermore, they fixated on low-prevalence anomalies earlier and high-prevalence anomalies later during the inspection. However, the students in the intervention group did not show any meaningful improvement in detection rate and made more false positive errors compared to the control group. Thus, the intervention guided visual attention but did not improve diagnostic performance substantially. Exploratory analyses indicated that further interventions should teach knowledge about anomalies rather than focusing on full coverage of radiographs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Off-the-job faculty development for clinical teachers has been blighted by poor attendance, unsatisfactory sustainability, and weak impact. The faculty development literature has attributed these problems to the marginalisation of the clinical teacher role in host institutions. By focusing on macro-organisational factors, faculty development is ignoring the how clinical teachers are shaped by their everyday participation in micro-organisations such as clinical teams. We set out to explore how the roles of clinical teacher and graduate learner are co-constructed in the context of everyday work in clinical teams. Using an ethnographic study design we carried out marginal participant observation of four different hospital clinical teams. We assembled a dataset comprising field notes, participant interviews, images, and video, which captured day-to-day working and learning encounters between team members. We applied the dramaturgical sensitising concepts of impression management and face work to a thematic analysis of the dataset. We found that learning in clinical teams was largely informal. Clinical teachers modelled, but rarely articulated, an implicit curriculum of norms, standards and expectations. Trainees sought to establish legitimacy and credibility for themselves by creating impressions of being able to recognise and reproduce lead clinicians’ standards. Teachers and trainees colluded in using face work strategies to sustain favourable impressions but, in so doing, diminished learning opportunities and undermined educational dialogue. These finding suggest that there is a complex interrelationship between membership of clinical teams and clinical learning. The implication for faculty development is that it needs to move beyond its current emphasis on the structuring effects of institutional context to a deeper consideration of how teacher and learner roles are co-constructed in clinical teams.",

However, the directions that guide institutions from quality culture theory to educational practice have been missing so far. A prospective qualitative case study of three health professions education programmes was conducted to explore how a quality culture can be enhanced according to the experiences and perspectives of educational leaders. The data collection was structured by an appreciative inquiry approach, supported with vignette-based interviews. A total of 25 participants (a selection of course coordinators, bachelor coordinators and directors of education) reflected on quality culture themes to learn about the best of what is (Discover), envision positive future developments (Dream), identify actions to reach the desired future (Design), and determine how to support and sustain improvement actions (Destiny) within their own educational setting. The results are presented as themes subsumed under these four phases. The experiences and perspectives of educational leaders reveal that peer learning in teams and communities, attention to professional development, and embedding support- and innovation networks, are at the heart of quality culture enhancement. An emphasis on human resources, (inter)relations and contextual awareness of leaders stood out as quality culture catalysts. Educational leaders are therefore encouraged to especially fuel their networking, communication, coalition building, and reflection competencies.",

The relationship between student and patient, with a supportive preceptor as a resource, can influence the progression and development of an authentic person-centred approach to care among students. The purpose of this study was to analyse the congruence between nursing students' and patients' views of their relationship during students' clinical placement. The study compared data from cross-sectional matched cohort pairs of nursing students (n = 187) and patients (n = 187) in Finland. The data were collected between March 2015 and May 2016 using corresponding questionnaires and procedures in both cases. Both students' and patients' views were moderately or weakly congruent in terms of facilitative relationship, characterised as a mutually enriching relationship for both students and patients through dialogue. Patients, however, tended to see the relationship significantly more often as mechanistic, focusing on students learning practical skills, compared to students who saw the relationship more often as facilitative. Patients' age and the reasons for care were the only background variables that predicted the congruence between students' and patients' views of their relationships. These findings suggest ways in which student-patient relationships can be made more meaningful in supporting learning in clinical education.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When physicians are asked to determine the positive predictive value from the a priori probability of a disease and the sensitivity and false positive rate of a medical test (Bayesian reasoning), it often comes to misjudgments with serious consequences. In daily clinical practice, however, it is not only important that doctors receive a tool with which they can correctly judge—the speed of these judgments is also a crucial factor. In this study, we analyzed accuracy and efficiency in medical Bayesian inferences. In an empirical study we varied information format (probabilities vs. natural frequencies) and visualization (text only vs. tree only) for four contexts. 111 medical students participated in this study by working on four Bayesian tasks with common medical problems. The correctness of their answers was coded and the time spent on task was recorded. The median time for a correct Bayesian inference is fastest in the version with a frequency tree (2:55 min) compared to the version with a probability tree (5:47 min) or to the text only versions based on natural frequencies (4:13 min) or probabilities (9:59 min).The score diagnostic efficiency (calculated by: median time divided by percentage of correct inferences) is best in the version with a frequency tree (4:53 min). Frequency trees allow more accurate and faster judgments. Improving correctness and efficiency in Bayesian tasks might help to decrease overdiagnosis in daily clinical practice, which on the one hand cause cost and on the other hand might endanger patients’ safety.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Clinical reasoning is the thought process that guides practice. Although a plethora of clinical reasoning studies in healthcare professionals exists, the majority appear to originate from Western cultures. A scoping review was undertaken to examine clinical reasoning related research across Asian cultures. PubMed, SciVerse Scopus, Web of Science and Airiti Library databases were searched. Inclusion criteria included full-text articles published in Asian countries (2007 to 2019). Search terms included clinical reasoning, thinking process, differential diagnosis, decision making, problem-based learning, critical thinking, healthcare profession, institution, medical students and nursing students. After applying exclusion criteria, n = 240 were included in the review. The number of publications increased in 2012 (from 5%, n = 13 in 2011 to 9%, n = 22) with a steady increase onwards to 12% (n = 29) in 2016. South Korea published the most articles (19%, n = 46) followed by Iran (17%, n = 41). Nurse Education Today published 11% of the articles (n = 26), followed by BMC Medical Education (5%, n = 13). Nursing and Medical students account for the largest population groups studied. Analysis of the articles resulted in seven themes: Evaluation of existing courses (30%, n = 73) being the most frequently identified theme. Only seven comparative articles showed cultural implications, but none provided direct evidence of the impact of culture on clinical reasoning. We illuminate the potential necessity of further research in clinical reasoning, specifically with a focus on how clinical reasoning is affected by national culture. A better understanding of current clinical reasoning research in Asian cultures may assist curricula developers in establishing a culturally appropriate learning environment.",

    "abstract": "In the midst of continuous health professions curriculum reforms, critical questions arise about the extent to which conceptual ideas are actually put into practice. Curricula are often not implemented as intended. An under-explored aspect that might play a role is governance. In light of major curriculum changes, we explored educators' perspectives of the role of governance in the process of translating curriculum goals and concepts into institutionalized curriculum change at micro-level (teacher-student). In three Dutch medical schools, 19 educators with a dual role (teacher and coordinator) were interviewed between March and May 2018, using the rich pictures method. We employed qualitative content analysis with inductive coding. Data collection occurred concurrently with data analysis. Different governance processes were mentioned, each with its own effects on the curriculum and organizational responses. In Institute 1, participants described an unclear governance structure, resulting in implementation chaos in which an abstract educational concept could not be fully realized. In Institute 2, participants described a top-down and strict governance structure contributing to relatively successful implementation of the educational concept. However it also led to demotivation of educators, who started rebelling to recover their perceived loss of freedom. In Institute 3, participants described a relatively fragmentized process granting a lot of freedom, which contributed to contentment and motivation but did not fully produce the intended changes. Our paper empirically illustrates the importance of governance in curriculum change. To advance curriculum change processes and improve their desired outcomes it seems important to define and explicate both hard and soft governance processes.",

    "abstract": "The under-representation of minoritized or previously oppressed groups in research challenges the current universal understanding of professional identity formation (PIF). To date, there has been no recognition of an African influence on PIF, which is crucial for understanding this phenomenon in places like South Africa, a society in which the inequity of the apartheid era still prevails. In addition, there is little data examining how social upheaval could impact PIF. This study uses interviews with medical students to explore PIF within the context of social upheaval during the 2015-2016 protests that rocked South Africa when students challenged asymmetries of power and privilege that persisted long after the country's democratic transition. The combination of the primary author's autoethnographic story, weaved into the South African sociohistorical context and ubuntu philosophy, contributes to this study of PIF in the South African context. The use of an African metaphor allowed the reorientation of PIF to reflect the influence of an ubuntu-based value system. Using the calabash as a metaphor, participants' experiences were framed and organized in two ways: a calabash worldview and the campus calabash. The calabash worldview is a multidimensional mixture of values that include ubuntu, reflections of traditional childhoods, and the image of women as igneous rocks, which recognizes the power and influence on PIF of the women who raised the participants. Introducing an African ubuntu-based perspective into the PIF discourse may redirect the acknowledgement of context and local reality in developing professional identity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In pursuing assessment excellence, clinician-educators who design and implement assessment are pivotal. The influence of their assessment practice in university-run licensure exams on student learning has direct implications for future patient care. While teaching practice has been shown to parallel conceptions of teaching, we know too little about conceptions of assessment in medical education to know if this is the case for assessment practice and conceptions of assessment. To explore clinician-educators’ conceptions of assessment, a phenomenographic study was undertaken. Phenomenography explores conceptions, the qualitatively different ways of understanding a phenomenon. Data analysis identifies a range of hierarchically inclusive categories of understanding, from simple to more complex, and the dimensions that distinguish each category or conception. Thirty-one clerkship convenors in three diverse Southern settings were interviewed in three cycles of iterative data collection and analysis. Four conceptions of assessment were identified: passive operator, awakening enquirer, active owner and scholarly assessor. Six dimensions were elucidated to describe and distinguish each conception: purpose of assessment; temporal perspective; role and responsibility; accountability; reflexivity and emotional valence. Additionally, three characteristics that appeared to track the progressive nature of the conceptions were identified: professional identity, assessment literacy and self-efficacy. These conceptions encompass and extend previously described conceptions across different educational levels, disciplines and contexts, suggesting applicability to other settings. There is some evidence of a relationship between conceptions and practice, suggesting, together with the hierarchical nature of these conceptions, that targeting conceptions during faculty development may be an effective approach to enhance assessment practice.",

Many construct self-presentations intended to appeal to medical-school admissions committees from the raw materials of work and volunteer experiences, in order to demonstrate that they will succeed in a demanding profession to which access is tightly controlled. Borrowing from the field of architecture the lens of construction ecology, which considers buildings in relation to the global effects of the resources required for their construction, we reframe medical-school admissions as a social phenomenon that has far-reaching harmful unintended consequences, not just for medicine but for the broader world. Illustrating with discussion of three common pathways to experiences that applicants widely believe will help them gain admission, we describe how the construction ecology of medical school admissions can recast privilege as merit, reinforce colonizing narratives, and lead to exploitation of people who are already disadvantaged.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Therapeutic reasoning is when the purpose, task, or goal for engaging in reasoning is to determine the patient’s management plan. As the field’s understanding of the process of therapeutic reasoning is less well understood, we focused on studies that collected data on the process of therapeutic reasoning. To synthesize previous studies of therapeutic reasoning characteristics, methodological approaches, theoretical underpinnings, and results. We conducted a scoping review with systematic searching for English language articles with no date limits. Databases included MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, Embase, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and ERIC. Search terms captured therapeutic reasoning in health professions education research. Initial search yielded 5450 articles. The title and abstract screening yielded 180 articles. After full-text review, 87 studies were included in this review. Articles were excluded if they were outside health professions education, did not collect data on the process of therapeutic reasoning, were not empirical studies, or not focused on therapeutic reasoning. We analyzed the included articles according to scoping questions using qualitative content analysis. 87 articles dated from 1987 to 2019 were included. Several study designs were employed including think-aloud protocol, interview and written documentation. More than half of the articles analyzed the data using qualitative coding. Authors often utilized several middle-range theories to explain therapeutic reasoning processes. The hypothetico-deductive model was most frequently mentioned. The included articles rarely built off the results from previous studies. Six key result categories were found: identifying themes, characterizing and testing previous local theory, exploring factors, developing new local theory, testing tools, and testing hypothesis. Despite the cast body of therapeutic reasoning research, individual study results remain isolated from previous studies. Our future recommendations include synthesizing pre-existing models, developing novel methodologies, and investigating other aspects of therapeutic reasoning.",

A systematic search of seven databases in November 2022 which were screened according to predefined inclusion criteria. The Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale-Education (NOS-E) were used to critically appraise eligible articles. A summary of interventional variables includes article content type, strategy type, assessment type and delay and statistical significance. Of 1818 records retrieved, 56 were eligible for inclusion and included a total of 63 experiments. Of these studies, 43 demonstrated significant benefits of distributed practice and/or retrieval practice over control and comparison groups. Included studies averaged 12.23 out of 18 on the MERSQI and averaged 4.55 out of 6 on the NOS-E. Study designs were heterogeneous with a variety of interventions, comparison groups and assessment types. Distributed practice and retrieval practice are effective at improving academic grades in health professions education. Future study quality can be improved by validating the assessment instruments, to demonstrate the reliability of outcome measures. Increasing the number of institutions included in future studies may improve the diversity of represented study participants and may enhance study quality. Future studies should consider measuring and reporting time on task which may clarify the effectiveness of distributed practice and retrieval practice. The stakes of the assessments, which may affect student motivation and therefore outcomes, should also be considered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in automated scoring technology have made it practical to replace multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with short-answer questions (SAQs) in large-scale, high-stakes assessments. However, most previous research comparing these formats has used small examinee samples testing under low-stakes conditions. Additionally, previous studies have not reported on the time required to respond to the two item types. This study compares the difficulty, discrimination, and time requirements for the two formats when examinees responded as part of a large-scale, high-stakes assessment. Seventy-one MCQs were converted to SAQs. These matched items were randomly assigned to examinees completing a high-stakes assessment of internal medicine. No examinee saw the same item in both formats. Items administered in the SAQ format were generally more difficult than items in the MCQ format. The discrimination index for SAQs was modestly higher than that for MCQs and response times were substantially higher for SAQs. These results support the interchangeability of MCQs and SAQs. When it is important that the examinee generate the response rather than selecting it, SAQs may be preferred. The results relating to difficulty and discrimination reported in this paper are consistent with those of previous studies. The results on the relative time requirements for the two formats suggest that with a fixed testing time fewer SAQs can be administered, this limitation more than makes up for the higher discrimination that has been reported for SAQs. We additionally examine the extent to which increased difficulty may directly impact the discrimination of SAQs.",

    "abstract": "This article critically examines three assumptions underlying recent efforts to advance interdisciplinary research-defined in this article as communication and collaboration between researchers across academic disciplines (e.g. Sociology, Psychology, Biology)-and examines these assumptions' implications for health professions education research (HPER). These assumptions are: (1) disciplines are silos that inhibit the free flowing of knowledge across fields and stifle innovative thinking; (2) interdisciplinary research generates a better understanding of the world as it brings together researchers from various fields of expertise capable of tackling complex problems; and (3) interdisciplinary research reduces fragmentation across groups of researchers by eliminating boundaries. These assumptions are among the new beliefs shaping the contemporary academic arena; they orient academics' and university administrators' decisions toward expanding interdisciplinary research and training, but without solid empirical evidence. This article argues that the field of HPER has largely adopted the premises of interdisciplinary research but has not yet debated the potential effects of organizing around these premises. The authors hope to inspire members of the HPER community to critically examine the ubiquitous discourse promoting interdisciplinarity, and engage in reflection about the future of the field informed by evidence rather than by unsubstantiated assumptions. For example: Should research centres and graduate programs in HPER encourage the development of interdisciplinary or disciplinary-trained researchers? Should training predominantly focus on methods and methodologies or draw more on disciplinary-based knowledge? What is the best route toward increasing the field's profile within academia and attracting the best students and researchers to engage in HPER? These are questions that merit attention at the current juncture as the future of the HPER field relies on decisions made in the present time.",

This study assessed the validity of the MCAT in predicting training performance measures and career outcomes for MD-PhD students at a single institution. The study population consisted of 153 graduates of the Vanderbilt Medical Scientist Training Program (combined MD-PhD program) who matriculated between 1963 and 2003 and completed dual-degree training. This population was divided into three cohorts corresponding to the version of the MCAT taken at the time of application. Multivariable regression (logistic for binary outcomes and linear for continuous outcomes) was used to analyze factors associated with outcome measures. The MCAT score and undergraduate GPA (uGPA) were treated as independent variables; medical and graduate school grades, time-to-PhD defense, USMLE scores, publication number, and career outcome were dependent variables. For cohort 1 (1963-1977), MCAT score was not associated with any assessed outcome, although uGPA was associated with medical school preclinical GPA and graduate school GPA (gsGPA). For cohort 2 (1978-1991), MCAT score was associated with USMLE Step II score and inversely correlated with publication number, and uGPA was associated with preclinical GPA (mspGPA) and clinical GPA (mscGPA). For cohort 3 (1992-2003), the MCAT score was associated with mscGPA, and uGPA was associated with gsGPA. Overall, MCAT score and uGPA were inconsistent or weak predictors of training metrics and career outcomes for this population of MD-PhD students.",

This study explored the metacognitive judgments of 157 first-year medical students; in particular, the study examined students' self-assessments or calibration as they engaged in a virtual-patient simulation targeting clinical reasoning practices. Examining two key subtasks of a patient encounter, history (Hx) and physical exam (PE), the authors assessed the level of variation in students' behavioral performance (i.e., effectiveness and efficiency) and judgments of performance (i.e., calibration bias and accuracy) across the two subtasks. Paired t tests revealed that the Hx subtask was deemed to be more challenging than the PE subtask when viewed in terms of both actual and perceived performance. In addition to students performing worse on the Hx subtask than PE, they also perceived that they performed less well for Hx. Interestingly, across both subtasks, the majority of participants overestimated their performance (98% of participants for Hx and 95% for PE). Correlation analyses revealed that the participants' overall level of accuracy in metacognitive judgments was moderately stable across the Hx and PE subtasks. Taken together, findings underscore the importance of assessing medical students' metacognitive judgments at different points during a clinical encounter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For nearly four decades, researchers have explored the integration of arts and humanities content into health professions education (HPE). However, enduring controversies regarding the purpose, efficacy, and implementation of humanities initiatives suggest that the timing and context of trainees’ exposure to such content is a key, but seldom considered, factor. To better understand the affordances of introducing humanities-based health curriculum prior to the HPE admissions gateway, we conducted a qualitative instrumental case study with participants from Canada’s first Health Humanities baccalaureate program. Fully anonymized transcripts from semi-structured interviews (n = 11) and focus groups (n = 14) underwent an open-coding procedure for thematic narrative analysis to reveal three major temporal domains of described experience (i.e., prior to, during , and following their participation in a 12-week semester-long “Introduction to Health Humanities” course). Our findings demonstrate that perceptions of arts- and humanities content in health education are generated well in advance of HPE admission. Among other findings, we define a new concept—epistemological multicompetence—to describe participants’ emergent capability to toggle between (and advocate for the role of) multiple disciplines, arts and humanities particularly, in health-related teaching and learning at the pre-professional level. Improved coordination of baccalaureate and HPE curricula may therefore enhance the development of capabilities associated with arts and humanities, including: epistemological multicompetence, aesthetic sensibility, and other sought-after qualities in HPE candidates. In conclusion, attending to the pre-professional admissions gateway presents a new, capabilities-driven approach to enhancing both the implementation and critical understanding of arts and humanities’ purpose, role, and effects across the “life course” of health professions education.",

    "abstract": "To determine the content of integrated curricula, clinical concepts and the underlying basic science concepts need to be made explicit. Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula.",

    "abstract": "Dyspraxia, otherwise known as Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), is a specific learning difficulty (SpLD). Its main difficulties manifest as problems with motor coordination, organisation, academic and social difficulties. There are now more students arriving at university with SpLDs, and, therefore, a similar rise may be expected within medical education. There has been no previous research focusing on dyspraxia in doctors. An interpretive phenomenological approach was used. Six UK foundation schools disseminated the announcements. Three participants took part in loosely structured telephone interviews regarding their experiences of undertaking medical school and foundation school with dyspraxia. These were transcribed verbatim and then thematically analysed. The themes could be split into two main categories: \"Weakness and Coping Strategies\" and \"Perspectives of Dyspraxia\". \"Weakness\" included: clumsiness, organisation and needing extra time. The participants focused on their \"Coping Strategies\" that included: Ensuring safety, adapted learning preferences and external support. \"Perspectives of Dyspraxia\" included: diagnosis, career choice, stigma, \"normalisation\" and the \"difference view\" or \"medical deficit\" view of dyspraxia. Doctors with dyspraxia often mask their difficulties through sophisticated coping strategies. These were determined and hardworking individuals who believe that their dyspraxia was a positive aspect of their identity, adopting a \"difference view\". They felt further education is needed about dyspraxia to change the perceived stigma. There is now a need for further research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Criticisms about psychometric paradigms currently used in healthcare professions education include claims of reductionism, objectification, and poor compliance with assumptions. Nevertheless, perhaps the most crucial criticism comes from learners' difficulty in interpreting and making meaningful use of summative scores and the potentially detrimental impact these scores have on learners. The term \"post-psychometric era\" has become popular, despite persisting calls for the sensible use of modern psychometrics. In recent years, cognitive diagnostic modelling has emerged as a new psychometric paradigm capable of providing meaningful diagnostic feedback. Cognitive diagnostic modelling allows the classification of examinees in multiple cognitive attributes. This measurement is obtained by modelling these attributes as categorical, discrete latent variables. Furthermore, items can reflect more than one latent variable simultaneously. The interactions between latent variables can be modelled with flexibility, allowing a unique perspective on complex cognitive processes. These characteristic features of cognitive diagnostic modelling enable diagnostic classification over a large number of constructs of interest, preventing the necessity of providing numerical scores as feedback to test takers. This paper provides an overview of cognitive diagnostic modelling, including an introduction to its foundations and illustrating potential applications, to help teachers be involved in developing and evaluating assessment tools used in healthcare professions education. Cognitive diagnosis may represent a revolutionary new psychometric paradigm, overcoming the known limitations found in frequently used psychometric approaches, offering the possibility of robust qualitative feedback and better alignment with competency-based curricula and modern programmatic assessment frameworks.",

Studies of the related construct of empathy have suggested that medical students report declines with increasing clinical experience. In contrast, when comparing physicians with medical students, increased clinical experience predicts lower barriers to compassion. Whether-and how-a similar experience-related decline in the factors that interfere with compassion occurs across medical training remains unknown.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Medical training has become a global phenomenon, and the Physician’s Charter (PC), as a missionary document, is key to training those outside the Global North. Undergraduate and postgraduate students in the medical profession are sometimes trained in contexts foreign to their social and ontological backgrounds. This might lead to confusion and blunders, creating an impression of what might look and feel unprofessional to those unfamiliar with the local context. Understanding the cultural backgrounds of the trainees is crucial, and the reverse is also as important. It is essential for clinicians and trainees to understand the cultural backgrounds of their patients to avoid miscommunication. In this phenomenological study, we recruited participants in 2020 who were in their first to fourth year of study of medical training during the #FeesMustFall protests. We used data from this extensive study looking at students’ experiences during their training amidst protest and social upheavals in a South African tertiary institution. For this paper, we examined what professionalism means to the student participants using an African Ubuntu lens. Ubuntu and the Collective Finger theory were used to investigate what professionalism means to participants. The Ubuntu philosophy was compared to the PC. In the findings, the clinical space is hierarchical, silencing and the opposite of what Ubuntu means. In comparison to the PC, respect is overarching while compassion and responsibility are the most comparable to the Charter. This study adds an African voice to the professionalism discourse while showing African elements that could be aligned to the PC to challenge the current global discourses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Health sciences students face many challenges in regard to clinical practical learning. A better understanding of student learning is required to address student needs in this crucial phase. The theory of self-regulated learning provides a comprehensive view of learning and could serve as a basis for further research. There are instruments to assess self-regulated learning in preclinical academic learning. However, there are no such instruments for workplace learning. The aim of the present study is to provide a comprehensive inventory from which researchers can select those scales that are relevant to their research questions in the investigation of workplace learning. Hence, the aim is to develop and validate a set of scales to assess undergraduates’ workplace learning in health sciences education in four areas (cognition, motivation, emotion, and context) on two levels (the learning process level and the metalevel). Study 1 is a qualitative multimethod study to identify indicators and develop items. It integrates the perspectives of students, teachers, and researchers and includes six steps: literature review, interviews, synthesis, item development, expert review, and cognitive pretesting. This study yields a set of scales for each area on both levels. Study 2 is a quantitative study to assess the psychometric properties. The results show acceptable values in terms of unidimensionality, reliability and validity for each of the 31 scales. The newly developed Workplace Learning Inventory is comprehensive; the scales are relevant to workplace learning and short enough that their administration is feasible in the workplace setting. The rigorous process of questionnaire development contributes to the validity of scales. By providing the Workplace Learning Inventory, we hope to encourage research on workplace learning in health sciences education from an educational psychology perspective.",

In this paper I show that robustness mainly refers to α, the type-I error. If the underlying distribution of data is ignored there can be a major penalty in terms of the β, the type-II error, representing a large increase in false negative rate or, equivalently, a severe loss of power of the test.",

    "abstract": "Situational Judgement Tests (SJTs) are increasingly implemented in medical school admissions. In this paper, we investigate the effects of vocational interests, previous academic experience, gender and age on SJT performance. The SJT was part of the selection process for the Bachelor's degree programme in Medicine at University of Groningen, the Netherlands. All applicants for the academic year 2015-2016 were included and had to choose between learning communities Global Health (n = 126), Sustainable Care (n = 149), Intramural Care (n = 225), or Molecular Medicine (n = 116). This choice was used as a proxy for vocational interest. In addition, all graduate-entry applicants for academic year 2015-2016 (n = 213) were included to examine the effect of previous academic experience on performance. We used MANCOVA analyses with Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparisons tests for applicant performance on a six-scenario SJT. The MANCOVA analyses showed that for all scenarios, the independent variables were significantly related to performance (Pillai's Trace: 0.02-0.47, p < .01). Vocational interest was related to performance on three scenarios (p < .01). Graduate-entry applicants outperformed all other groups on three scenarios (p < .01) and at least one other group on the other three scenarios (p < .01). Female applicants outperformed male applicants on three scenarios (p < .01) and age was positively related to performance on two scenarios (p < .05). A good fit between applicants' vocational interests and SJT scenario was related to better performance, as was previous academic experience. Gender and age were related to performance on SJT scenarios in different settings. Especially the first effect might be helpful in selecting appropriate candidates for areas of health care in which more professionals are needed.",

    "abstract": "Studies have continuously shown that fewer women than men achieve leadership positions in academic medicine. In the current study we explored gender differences in clinical position among academic physicians at three university hospitals, each in a different European country. These countries, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria, differ in terms of gender equality. We analyzed whether the number of children, working hours or publications could explain gender differences in physicians' clinical position. In this cross-sectional questionnaire study 1333 (54% female) physicians participated. Physicians were asked about their gender, age, number of children, working hours and clinical position. We used structural equation models to explore the influence of gender on the physicians' clinical position in each of the three countries. We explored whether the association between gender and clinical position could be explained by number of children, working hours or publication activity. The analyses revealed that at all three university hospitals gender influenced clinical position. These gender differences in clinical position could be partly explained by gender differences in publication activity. Female physicians as compared to male physicians were likely to publish fewer articles, and in turn these lower publication numbers were associated with lower clinical positions. The number of children or working hours did not explain gender differences in publication activity or clinical position. Therefore, factors other than unequal allocation of household labor, such as the academic working environment, may still disproportionately disadvantage women's progress, even at universities in countries with high rates of gender equality such as Sweden.",

    "abstract": "Feedback on clinical performance of residents is seen as a fundamental element in postgraduate medical education. Although literature on feedback in medical education is abundant, many supervisors struggle with providing this feedback and residents experience feedback as insufficiently constructive. With a detailed analysis of real-world feedback conversations, this study aims to contribute to the current literature by deepening the understanding of how feedback on residents' performance is provided, and to formulate recommendations for improvement of feedback practice. Eight evaluation meetings between program directors and residents were recorded in 2015-2016. These meetings were analyzed using conversation analysis. This is an ethno-methodological approach that uses a data-driven, iterative procedure to uncover interactional patterns that structure naturally occurring, spoken interaction. Feedback in our data took two forms: feedback as a unidirectional activity and feedback as a dialogic activity. The unidirectional feedback activities prevailed over the dialogic activities. The two different formats elicit different types of resident responses and have different implications for the progress of the interaction. Both feedback formats concerned positive as well as negative feedback and both were often mitigated by the participants. Unidirectional feedback and mitigating or downplaying feedback is at odds with the aim of feedback in medical education. Dialogic feedback avoids the pitfall of a program director-dominated conversation and gives residents the opportunity to take ownership of their strengths and weaknesses, which increases chances to change resident behavior. On the basis of linguistic analysis of our real-life data we suggest implications for feedback conversations.",

    "abstract": "Standardized narratives or profiles can facilitate identification of poor professional behaviour of medical students. If unprofessional behaviour is identified, educators can help the student to improve their professional performance. In an earlier study, based on opinions of frontline teachers from one institution, the authors identified three profiles of medical students' unprofessional behaviour: (1) Poor reliability, (2) Poor reliability and poor insight, and (3) Poor reliability, poor insight and poor adaptability. The distinguishing variable was Capacity for self-reflection and adaptability. The current study used Nominal Group Technique and thematic analysis to refine these findings by synthesizing experts' opinions from different medical schools, aiming to develop a model of unprofessional behaviour profiles in medical students. Thirty-one experienced faculty, purposively sampled for knowledge and experience in teaching and evaluation of professionalism, participated in five meetings at five medical schools in the Netherlands. In each group, participants generated ideas, discussed them, and independently ranked these ideas by allocating points to them. Experts suggested ten different ideas, from which the top 3 received 60% of all ranking points: (1) Reflectiveness and adaptability are two distinct distinguishing variables (25%), (2) The term reliability is too narrow to describe unprofessional behaviour (22%), and (3) Profiles are dynamic over time (12%). Incorporating these ideas yielded a model consisting of four profiles of medical students' unprofessional behaviour (accidental behaviour, struggling behaviour, gaming-the-system behaviour and disavowing behaviour) and two distinguishing variables (reflectiveness and adaptability). The findings could advance educators' insight into students' unprofessional behaviour, and provide information for future research on professionalism remediation.",

    "abstract": "The mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) is a well-established method of assessing trainees' clinical competence in the workplace. In order to improve the quality of clinical learning, factors that influence the provision of feedback are worthy of further investigation. A retrospective data analysis of documented feedback provided by assessors using the mini-CEX in a busy emergency department (ED) was conducted. The assessors comprised emergency physicians (EPs) and trauma surgeons. The trainees were all postgraduate year one (PGY1) residents. The completion rate and word count for each of three feedback components (positive feedback, suggestions for development, and an agreed action plan) were recorded. Other variables included observation time, feedback time, the format used (paper versus computer-based), the seniority of the assessor, the gender of the assessor and the specialty of the assessor. The components of feedback provided by the assessors and the influence of these contextual and demographic factors were also analyzed. During a 26-month study period, 1101 mini-CEX assessments (from 273 PGY1 residents and 67 assessors) were collected. The overall completion rate for the feedback components was 85.3 % (positive feedback), 54.8 % (suggestions for development), and 29.5 % (agreed action plan). In only 22.9 % of the total mini-CEX assessments were all three aspects of feedback completed, and 7.4 % contained no feedback. In the univariate analysis, the mini-CEX format, the seniority of the assessor and the specialty of the assessor were identified as influencing the completion of all three components of feedback. In the multivariate analysis, only the mini-CEX format and the seniority of the assessor were statistically significant. In a subgroup analysis, the feedback-facilitating effect of the computer-based format was uneven across junior and senior EPs. In addition, feedback provision showed a primacy effect: assessors tended to provide only the first or second feedback components in a busy ED setting. In summary, the authors explored the influence of gender, seniority and specialty on paper and computer-based feedback provision during mini-CEX assessments for PGY1 residency training in a busy ED. It was shown that junior assessors were more likely to provide all three aspects of written feedback in the mini-CEX than were senior assessors. The computer-based format facilitated the completion of feedback among EPs.",

However, what comprises professional identities is rarely interrogated. This research tackles this relatively understudied component of professional identities research by understanding emergency medicine physicians’ perspectives on the important elements that comprise their professional identities. Q-methodology was used to identify different clusters of viewpoints on professional identities; by extension, the core components that comprise emergency medicine physicians’ professional identities are disclosed. Thirty-three emergency medicine physicians were recruited, through purposive sampling, from five hospitals across Taiwan. R software was used to analyse the Q-sorts, determine loadings on each viewpoint and formulate the viewpoint array. Analysis of interview data enhanced our understanding of these viewpoints. In total, twenty-five emergency medicine physicians loaded onto four distinct viewpoints, reflecting dominant perspectives of emergency medicine physicians’ understanding of their professional identities. These distinct viewpoints demonstrated what emergency medicine physicians deemed significant in how they understood themselves. The viewpoints comprised: skills acquisition, capabilities and practical wisdom; coping ability and resilience; professional recognition and self-esteem; and wellbeing and quality of life. All viewpoints stressed the importance of trust between colleagues. These findings demonstrate the multitude of ways in which seemingly unified professional identities diverge across groups of individuals. An enhanced understanding of speciality work culture is gained. By understanding facets of professional identities, the development of future educational interventions and departmental initiatives, which might support key components of professional identities, can be explored.",

    "abstract": "This study examined conscientiousness and the perceived educational environment as independent and interactive predictors of medical students' performance within Biggs' theoretical model of learning. Conscientiousness, the perceived educational environment, and learning approaches were assessed at the beginning of the third year in 268 medical students at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Performance was examined at the end of the third year via a computer-based assessment (CBA) and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Path analysis was used to test the proposed model, whereby conscientiousness and the perceived educational environment predicted performance directly and indirectly via students' learning approaches. A second model included interaction effects. The proposed model provided the best fit and explained 45% of the variance in CBA performance, and 23% of the variance in OSCE performance. Conscientiousness positively predicted CBA performance directly (β = 0.19, p < 0.001) and indirectly via a deep learning approach (β = 0.05, p = 0.012). The perceived educational environment positively predicted CBA performance indirectly only (β = 0.02, p = 0.011). Neither conscientiousness nor the perceived educational environment predicted OSCE performance. Model 2 had acceptable, but less optimal fit. In this model, there was a significant cross-over interaction effect (β = 0.16, p < 0.01): conscientiousness positively predicted OSCE performance when perceptions of the educational environment were the most positive, but negatively predicted performance when perceptions were the least positive. The findings suggest that both conscientiousness and perceptions of the educational environment predict CBA performance. Research should further examine interactions between personality traits and the medical school environment to inform strategies aimed at improving OSCE performance.",

However, the exact contributions of these components of clinical reasoning to diagnostic success remain unclear. This is particularly the case when operationalizing the diagnostic process with diagnostic activities (i.e., teachable practices that generate knowledge). Therefore, we conducted a study investigating to what extent knowledge and diagnostic activities uniquely explain variance in diagnostic success with virtual patients among medical students. The sample consisted of N = 106 medical students in their third to fifth year of university studies in Germany (6-years curriculum). Participants completed professional knowledge tests before diagnosing virtual patients. Diagnostic success with the virtual patients was assessed with diagnostic accuracy as well as a comprehensive diagnostic score to answer the call for more extensive measurement of clinical reasoning outcomes. The three diagnostic activities hypothesis generation, evidence generation, and evidence evaluation were tracked. Professional knowledge predicted performance in terms of the comprehensive diagnostic score and displayed a small association with diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic activities predicted comprehensive diagnostic score and diagnostic accuracy. Hierarchical regressions showed that the diagnostic activities made a unique contribution to diagnostic success, even when knowledge was taken into account. Our results support the argument that the diagnostic process is more than an embodiment of knowledge and explains variance in diagnostic success over and above knowledge. We discuss possible mechanisms explaining this finding.",

    "abstract": "Abstract By virtue of their teaching role and contact with students, health professions (HP) educators are often the first point of connection for students who are experiencing mental health difficulties. Educators are increasingly expected to include some form of pastoral care in their role. Mental health-related interactions with students may have a negative emotional impact on educators, particularly when roles and expectations are not clearly defined and where boundaries are not managed effectively. Using positioning theory as a lens, this study explored how educators experienced such interactions and how this manifested in positions, storylines, and speech acts. Interviews were conducted with 27 HP educators at a faculty of medicine and health sciences. Reflexive thematic analysis using inductive coding identified themes corresponding to the nearing, weighted, ambivalent, and distancing positions participants adopted in relation to students with mental health difficulties. There was fluidity in and between positions, and more than one position could be occupied simultaneously; participants each moved through different positions in response to different relational situations. Multiple storylines informed these positions, representing how moral- and care-informed responsibility intersected with responsiveness to make certain actions possible or impossible. Normative and personal value narratives were evident in storylines, in many cases underscored by care or justice ethics. The value of positioning theory in facilitating reflective faculty development initiatives for educators engaged in these interactions is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Self-monitoring is essential for effectively regulating learning, but difficult in visual diagnostic tasks such as radiograph interpretation. Eye-tracking technology can visualize viewing behavior in gaze displays, thereby providing information about visual search and decision-making. We hypothesized that individually adaptive gaze-display feedback improves posttest performance and self-monitoring of medical students who learn to detect nodules in radiographs. We investigated the effects of: (1) Search displays, showing which part of the image was searched by the participant; and (2) Decision displays, showing which parts of the image received prolonged attention in 78 medical students. After a pretest and instruction, participants practiced identifying nodules in 16 cases under search-display, decision-display, or no feedback conditions ( n = 26 per condition). A 10-case posttest, without feedback, was administered to assess learning outcomes. After each case, participants provided self-monitoring and confidence judgments. Afterward, participants reported on self-efficacy, perceived competence, feedback use, and perceived usefulness of the feedback. Bayesian analyses showed no benefits of gaze displays for post-test performance, monitoring accuracy (absolute difference between participants’ estimated and their actual test performance), completeness of viewing behavior, self-efficacy, and perceived competence. Participants receiving search-displays reported greater feedback utilization than participants receiving decision-displays, and also found the feedback more useful when the gaze data displayed was precise and accurate. As the completeness of search was not related to posttest performance, search displays might not have been sufficiently informative to improve self-monitoring. Information from decision displays was rarely used to inform self-monitoring. Further research should address if and when gaze displays can support learning.",

In recognition of this, multiple health profession governing bodies identify uncertainty tolerance as a healthcare graduate attribute and evaluate uncertainty tolerance within new graduate cohorts. While it is clear that uncertainty tolerance development for healthcare learners is valued, gaps remain for practically addressing this within healthcare curricula. Guiding frameworks for practical approaches supporting uncertainty tolerance development in healthcare learners remains sparse, particularly outside of medicine and in certain geographical locations. As uncertainty tolerance is increasingly recognised as being, at least in part, state-based (e.g. contextually changeable)– a broader understanding of teaching practices supporting uncertainty tolerance development in diverse health professions is warranted. This study explored educators’ teaching practices for purposefully stimulating learners’ uncertainty tolerance. Semi-structured interviews investigated how academics at a single institution, from diverse fields and health professions, stimulate uncertainty across multiple learning contexts. Framework analysis identified three themes for stimulating uncertainty: Purposeful questioning , Forecasting uncertainty , and Placing learners in unfamiliar environments , with characterisation of these themes (and related subthemes) also described. Many of the identified themes align with aspects of existing learning theories suggesting that curricular frameworks supporting learner uncertainty tolerance development may be informed by theories beyond the boundaries of health professions education research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Clinical reasoning is a crucial skill for physicians, enabling them to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application. The gap between basic sciences and clinical practice persists as a challenge, with traditional teaching methods yet to effectively bridge it. Concept maps (CMs), visual tools for organizing and connecting knowledge, hold promise for enhancing clinical reasoning in the undergraduate medical curriculum. However, further research is required to ascertain if CMs facilitate clinical reasoning development in medical students transitioning from basic sciences to clinical practice. This study aims to delineate how CMs can facilitate clinical reasoning in patients with multimorbidity within undergraduate Family Medicine curricula, as perceived by students and tutors, and to understand the implementation process and resources required. This exploratory qualitative study formed a part of an action research project. While introducing an educational intervention to 5th-year medical students, we conducted a qualitative evaluation. Subsequently, semi-structured group interviews were conducted with students, and a focus group was conducted with tutors. Three main educational impacts were identified: integration of clinical information, support for patient management and care plan, and collaborative learning. Key aspects for successful CM implementation included clear instructions for map construction, using user-friendly software, allocating sufficient time for the task, encouraging group discussion of CMs, and incorporating tutor feedback. CMs are pedagogical tools that facilitate clinical information integration and support management and treatment plans, helping students better understand multimorbidity patients and promoting some components of clinical reasoning in undergraduate medical education.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a long-standing lack of learner satisfaction with quality and quantity of feedback in health professions education (HPE) and training. To address this, university and training programmes are increasingly using technological advancements and data analytic tools to provide feedback. One such educational technology is the Learning Analytic Dashboard (LAD), which holds the promise of a comprehensive view of student performance via partial or fully automated feedback delivered to learners in real time. The possibility of displaying performance data visually, on a single platform, so users can access and process feedback efficiently and constantly, and use this to improve their performance, is very attractive to users, educators and institutions. However, the mainstream literature tends to take an atheoretical and instrumentalist view of LADs, a view that uncritically celebrates the promise of LAD’s capacity to provide a ‘technical fix’ to the ‘wicked problem’ of feedback in health professions education. This paper seeks to recast the discussion of LADs as something other than a benign material technology using the lenses of Miller and Rose’s technologies of government and Barry’s theory of Technological Societies, where such technical devices are also inherently agentic and political. An examination of the purpose, design and deployment of LADs from these theoretical perspectives can reveal how these educational devices shape and govern the HPE learner body in different ways, which in turn, may produce a myriad of unintended– and ironic– effects on the feedback process. In this Reflections article we wish to encourage health professions education scholars to examine the practices and consequences thereof of the ever-expanding use of LADs more deeply and with a sense of urgency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Health professional organisations are increasingly promoting the use of self-directed learning. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving field of healthcare has meant that there is greater emphasis within tertiary education for students to become self-directed learners and possess the skills to engage in life-long learning. The aim of this scoping review was to explore the drivers that improve the student learning experience, in undergraduate clinical science programs that utilise self-directed learning. The Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology guided this study. The electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, Scopus and ERIC were comprehensively searched in April 2022 and re-run August 2023, for peer-reviewed research articles published in English. The original search was developed in MEDLINE and then adapted to each database. Following the Joanna Briggs Scoping Review methodology, articles were screened first by title and abstract and then by full text. Included articles were assessment for methodological quality. The search strategy yielded 2209 articles for screening. 19 met the inclusion criteria. Five key factors were identified which improve the student learning experience in self-directed learning: (i) curricular elements; (ii) educator influence; (iii) impact of peers, (iv) environment; and (v) clinical placement experiences. There are many curricular, environmental, and external factors which can improve the student learning experience in programs that utilise self-directed learning. Greater understanding of these factors will allow educators within clinical science programs to implement self-directed learning strategies more effectively within curriculum.",

Five other studies report on factors influencing students’ learning in PBL: the PBL problem, the tutor, and two other scaffolds, worksheets and a reflection journal. The studies were conducted in a setting in which a specific approach to PBL was used, the so called-one-day-one-problem approach to PBL. In this reflection on the studies reported in this special issue, first of all the unique one-day-one-problem approach to PBL will be explained. Thereafter the findings of the studies reported in this special issue will be summarized, after which the strengths and weaknesses of the studies are reported, as well as suggestions for further research and educational practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When physicians do not estimate their diagnostic accuracy correctly, i.e. show inaccurate diagnostic calibration , diagnostic errors or overtesting can occur. A previous study showed that physicians’ diagnostic calibration for easy cases improved, after they received feedback on their previous diagnoses. We investigated whether diagnostic calibration would also improve from this feedback when cases were more difficult. Sixty-nine general-practice residents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the feedback condition, they diagnosed a case, rated their confidence in their diagnosis, their invested mental effort, and case complexity, and then were shown the correct diagnosis (feedback). This was repeated for 12 cases. Participants in the control condition did the same without receiving feedback. We analysed calibration in terms of (1) absolute accuracy (absolute difference between diagnostic accuracy and confidence), and (2) bias (confidence minus diagnostic calibration). There was no difference between the conditions in the measurements of calibration (absolute accuracy, p = .204; bias, p = .176). Post-hoc analyses showed that on correctly diagnosed cases (on which participants are either accurate or underconfident), calibration in the feedback condition was less accurate than in the control condition, p = .013. This study shows that feedback on diagnostic performance did not improve physicians’ calibration for more difficult cases. One explanation could be that participants were confronted with their mistakes and thereafter lowered their confidence ratings even if cases were diagnosed correctly. This shows how difficult it is to improve diagnostic calibration, which is important to prevent diagnostic errors or maltreatment.",

Shockingly, according to the World Health Organisation, no European member state has achieved full gender equity in regard to health outcomes. Further, contemporary curricula have not evolved to reflect the realities of a diverse society that remains riddled with inequity. This paper outlines the history of feminist theory, and applies it to health professions education research and teaching, in order to advocate for its continued relevance within contemporary healthcare.",

    "abstract": "International students who speak English as an additional language report experiencing communication issues while completing their studies and work-integrated learning placements in a range of Anglophone countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia. To address this issue, accreditation and registration bodies for a number of health professions, such as social work and nursing, have advocated for increasing the test score requirements for university English language entry. However, from a sociolinguistic perspective, decisions concerning ways to address communication challenges need to take into account the unique communication skills required for functioning in specific workplace settings. It is therefore essential to identify the types of communication issues occurring during work-integrated learning opportunities (e.g. placement) and to then assess whether these should be addressed by raising general English proficiency or providing structured learning opportunities for profession-specific communication development within the course content. The present study uses sociolinguistic theory to examine placement educators' perspectives on international students' communication issues using the context of social work placement. It draws on the thematic analysis of interviews with 15 placement educators in Australia. One major finding is that international students' general proficiency or ability to use specific linguistic tools (pragmalinguistic competence) is not a key area of concern for educators. The main challenge seems to involve the students' understanding of sociocultural norms underlying workplace communication (sociopragmatic competence). This finding suggests that, rather than increasing English language entry requirements, universities need to provide international students opportunities to develop their sociopragmatic competence both before and during placement. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations aimed at supporting international students who speak English as an additional language to develop their workplace communication during their studies.",

    "abstract": "There is a wide range of literature suggesting that implicit learning is more effective than explicit learning when acquiring motor skills. However, the acquisition of nursing skills in educational settings continues to rely heavily on detailed protocols and explicit instructions. This study aimed to examine the necessity for comprehensive protocols in the acquisition of nursing skills. In the context of bandaging techniques, three studies were conducted to investigate whether students who practiced with an instruction card containing minimal instructions (implicit group) performed comparably to the students who practiced with a protocol containing step-by-step instructions (explicit group). Study 1 was designed to determine whether both groups performed equally well in applying a bandage during training. Study 2 and 3 were designed to determine if both groups performed equally well during a retention and transfer (multitasking) test, administered after a series of three training sessions. In comparison with the explicit group, the implicit group demonstrated comparable performance with their practice attempts in Study 1 and performed equally well during the retention and transfer test in Study 2. Furthermore, several results from Study 3 indicated better performance of the implicit group. In conclusion, the use of protocols with explicit step-by-step instructions may not be essential for the acquisition of nursing skills. Instead, instructional methods that facilitate implicit learning may be preferable, as students in the implicit group demonstrated at least comparable performance in all studies and tended towards greater consistency when multitasking.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Exploring students’ interprofessional education experiences highlights the occurrence of hierarchy as a barrier to collaborative practice. Individuals are however influenced by the multiple social identities of themselves and others and not just professional hierarchy. Intersectionality offers a useful lens through which to understand the complex influences of students’ learning experiences. Using poetic inquiry, this paper explores the influence of intersectionality on health professional students’ interprofessional learning experiences on two rural training platforms in South Africa. Sixteen individual interviews with final-year undergraduate students from five different healthcare professions were conducted in 2022. An inductive narrative analysis of the data was undertaken and represented using ‘found poems’. Reflexive analysis of the data presented in poems was conducted with student participants, co-authors, and an independent qualitative researcher. Themes related to the intersection of language and ethnicity, religion and profession, culture and profession as well as professional discipline and being a student were extracted from the data. Participants demonstrated disorienting learning experiences in both the clinical and social context. Using intersectionality as a lens, we have gained insight into the sometimes-disorienting influence of students’ intersecting social identities during interprofessional learning on two rural training platforms. A nuanced understanding of how multiple social identities intersect to influence experiences could help educators mitigate student and educator biases and understand structural power dynamics in training environments. Transformative learning may be a way to introduce intersectionality into both interprofessional education and health professions education in general.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inequality of healthcare provision between metropolitan and rural communities is an enduring international concern. Geographical narcissism (GN) in medicine is a belief that the best healthcare provision only occurs in the big cities. In healthcare education and workforce development, there is a growing sentiment that GN exists, and is likely contributing to access inequalities and rural workforce shortages. This qualitative study aimed to explore if and understand how, where, when and why GN was experienced by medical students and prevocational doctors during their medical education and training. A constructivism research paradigm was applied, and reflexive thematic analysis was utilised for inductive coding of the different experiences and perceptions of GN. Semi-structured interviews with 29 Australian medical students and prevocational doctors were undertaken. Four key themes, with ten subthemes, were identified. First, GN is part of the hidden curriculum of medical education and training. Second, GN occurs across the continuum of medical education and training. Third, GN occurs with medical career advice. Fourth, GN is demonstrated by models of healthcare and health systems. This exploratory study confirmed previous anecdotal evidence that GN exists in healthcare and has outlined how, where, when and why it is experienced during medical education and training. Ignoring the potential damage and consequences of GN perpetuates the established metrocentric models of medical education, training, workplace culture, healthcare service provision and investment. The cycle of inequality will persist for rural populations, including poorer health outcomes and the rural medical workforce shortfall will continue – in part due to GN.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aligning examiners judgements to a shared standard is desirable within Objective Structured Clinical Exams (OSCEs) because it accords with OSCEs’ epistemic assumptions and purpose. Video-based benchmarking (VBB) involves examiners scoring station specific videos and comparing their judgements against an agreed score. Despite promising potential to enhance examiner alignment, VBB has been little researched. As the intervention’s efficacy is likely influenced by context, we used Realist Evaluation to study how, why and under what circumstances VBB may aid examiner alignment. Within stimulated interviews, examiners viewed videos of year-3 student OSCE performances and received expert-panel derived benchmark information. Different participants experienced adaptations of VBB, including varying benchmark performance standards, and different timings of receiving the benchmark information. Our resulting middle range theory suggests that despite conscientious preparation with written material, examiners’ expectations remain uncertain until encountering concrete performance examples. Judging a video serves this role, whilst comparison to a standard allows examiners to locate their judgement. Examiners experience dissonance when their scores are discrepant, and several contextual factors mediate whether they dismiss the suggested standard or adjust their perspectives. Examiners’ degree of engagement with video observation and score reflection is critical to VBB’s efficacy, and is influenced by examiner factors and other procedural contexts. These procedural contexts underpin tentative recommendations for practice which may enhance the likelihood of VBB’s effectiveness. When conscientious examiners engage effectively with well-constructed benchmarks, they perceive themselves as more prepared and aligned in their judgements because comparative reflection produces adjustment to their frame of reference.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intensification of resource scarcity in health professions education (HPE) requires careful consideration of educational costs. Educators play a significant role in this process, as they make resource allocation decisions when designing, developing, organizing and overseeing education, yet little is known about how educators view the idea of incorporating information on educational costs into decision-making. Therefore, this study maps educator views on cost-conscious decision-making in HPE. Using Q-Methodology, we explored how HPE educators perceive costs and cost-conscious decision-making. Participants ranked 34 statements and engaged in semi-structured interviews. By-person inverted factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to extract factors representing distinct patterns of thinking held by three or more educators. These patterns were interpreted using factor arrays, distinguishing and consensus statements, and interview transcripts, yielding narrative descriptions of unique educator perspectives. Twenty-five educators holding diverse educational responsibilities and 1–29 years of experience were classified into four distinct perspectives. Unaware Doubters (n = 3) are unexposed to educational cost considerations and lack motivation for involvement. Cautious Realists (n = 8) are personally impacted by resource constraints, yet hesitant about cost-conscious decision-making. Pragmatic Supporters (n = 8) hold implicit awareness of resource scarcity but remain open to participation in cost-conscious decision-making. Empowered Agents (n = 6) are aware, active and engaged in cost-conscious decision-making, yet seek a unifying vision and transparent communication from leadership. These four distinct educator perspectives on costs and cost-conscious decision-making in education illustrate varying levels of awareness, motivation and engagement, which indicates the need for tailored strategies to improve cost-conscious decision-making in HPE. This information can be used by educational institutes to develop a vision, policy and strategy to involve educators in considerations concerning educational costs in view of the increasing resource scarcity in HPE. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies targeted to these perspectives and explore how perspectives vary across settings and contexts.",

    "abstract": "Learner Handover (LH) involves sharing information about learners between faculty supervisors, aligning with a growth mindset. Previous studies, however, demonstrate LH can bias subsequent ratings. Most of these studies collect ratings after a single encounter but faculty often have multiple interactions with learners potentially mitigating LH-related bias. This study explored if LH influences faculty ratings, entrustment decisions and feedback after observing several encounters of the same learner. Internal medicine faculty (n = 57) from five medical schools were randomly assigned to one of three study groups. Each group received either positive, negative or no LH prior to watching five simulated resident-patient encounter videos of the same white male resident. Participants rated each video using an entrustment scale, the Mini-CEX and provided written feedback. Feedback was assigned a valence score (-3 to + 3). There were no statistically significant differences between the mean ratings across the LH conditions (positive, control, negative) for entrustment [3.42, 3.26, 3.62], Mini-CEX [6.00, 5.90, 6.28] or feedback valence ratings [-0.34, -0.99, -0.74]. In the post-study questionnaire, most raters reported the LH had minimal effect on their decisions. Only 29% of raters guessed the true purpose of the study. Unlike previous studies, LH had no effect on ratings, entrustment decisions, or feedback after one encounter, nor over subsequent encounters with the same resident. These findings suggest LH's influence may vary and highlight the need for replication under different conditions, including diverse genders and equity-deserving groups, to identify factors that contribute to or mitigate bias.",

Through conceptualising emotions as embodied, social and complex, we seek to better understand how feelings work within feedback in clinical education, beyond an individual ‘managing’ their emotions. In this post-qualitative study, we ask: How does the interplay between feelings and feedback unfold in specialty medical training? To this end, we conducted a focussed ethnography of feedback in intensive care medicine and surgical training in Australian tertiary-care hospitals. Thinking with theory, we traced how trainees’ feelings move within and between feedback encounters through observation-based field notes and interview transcripts. We provide thick description of how feedback is saturated with feeling, integrating our findings with discussion. Supervisors expressed their judgements about trainee performance as feelings, through feelings and about feelings. And trainees responded with feelings of their own. Formal feedback particularly intensified feelings, which ‘stuck with’ trainees, leading to action, including avoidance. Feelings served to strengthen relationships and reinforce social hierarchies both within and beyond the supervisor-trainee dyad. We infer that the judgements made in and around feedback – such as appraisal of source credibility, assessment of performance quality, and deciding future actions – are themselves fundamentally entangled with feelings. A first step to remedy the desire to ‘manage’ emotions through ‘putting them away’ is to acknowledge their presence in clinical learning environments.",

    "abstract": "Professional identity formation is central to developing resilient, ethical, and practice-ready healthcare professionals. While well-studied in medicine, professional identity formation in pharmacy remains underexplored. Recognising some of the unique challenges of the pharmacy profession, there is a need for empirically grounded studies that examine how pharmacy learners actively construct professional identities in real-world contexts. This nuanced perspective also adds depth and contextual relevance to the wider discourse on professional identity formation. This study examines how trainee pharmacists construct professional identities through narratives of challenging workplace experiences. Using Bamberg's positioning analysis, we conducted a narrative inquiry into 13 micro-narratives derived from semi-structured interviews with trainee pharmacists in Scotland. Each narrative was analysed through three levels of positioning: self within the story, self in relation to the audience, and self in relation to broader cultural master narratives. We identified five core identity positions: the transforming practitioner (creative, value-adding problem-solver), the shield-bearer (protector of patient safety in the face of structural risk), the quiet subversive (agent of resistance), the compassionate witness (emotionally attuned and morally engaged observer), and the shadow contributor (invisible yet operationally essential team member). The findings highlight the emotional, relational, and narrative work underpinning identity formation. They call for educational practices that legitimise uncertainty, acknowledge and support emotional labour, and openly discuss the dissonance and complexity inherent in becoming a professional. Recognising and engaging with the identities learners inhabit, and indeed those that they resist, can foster more inclusive, authentic, and supportive environments for professional growth.",

    "abstract": "Use of dual-processing has been widely touted as a strategy to reduce diagnostic error in clinical medicine. However, this strategy has not been tested among medical trainees with complex diagnostic problems. We sought to determine whether dual-processing instruction could reduce diagnostic error across a spectrum of experience with trainees undertaking cardiac physical exam. Three experiments were conducted using a similar design to teach cardiac physical exam using a cardiopulmonary simulator. One experiment was conducted in each of three groups: experienced, intermediate and novice trainees. In all three experiments, participants were randomized to receive undirected or dual-processing verbal instruction during teaching, practice and testing phases. When tested, dual-processing instruction did not change the probability assigned to the correct diagnosis in any of the three experiments. Among intermediates, there was an apparent interaction between the diagnosis tested and the effect of dual-processing instruction. Among relative novices, dual processing instruction may have dampened the harmful effect of a bias away from the correct diagnosis. Further work is needed to define the role of dual-processing instruction to reduce cognitive error. This study suggests that it cannot be blindly applied to complex diagnostic problems such as cardiac physical exam.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we will first discuss two current meta-theories dealing with different, aspects of \"truth\". The first metatheory conceives of truth in terms of coherence (rationality, consistency): a body of knowledge is true when it contains no inconsistencies and has at least some credibility. The second metatheory conceives of truth as correspondence, i.e., empirical accuracy. The two metatheories supplement each other, but are also incommensurable, i.e., they cannot be expressed in each other's terms, for they employ completely different criteria to establish truth (Englebretsen in Bare facts and naked truths: a new correspondence theory of truth, Routledge, London, 2005). We will discuss both the role of both metatheories in medicine, in particular in medical education in a clinical context. In line with Hammond's view (Med Decis Mak 16(3):281-287, 1996a; Human judgment and social policy: irreducible uncertainty, inevitable error, unavoidable injustice, Oxford University Press, New York, 1996b), we will extend the two metatheories to two forms of competence: coherence competence and correspondence competence, and demonstrate that distinguishing these two forms of competence increases our insights as to the best way to teach undergraduate students clinical problem solving.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The diversity of modern society is often not represented in the medical workforce. This might be partly due to selection practices. We need to better understand decision-making processes by selection committees in order to improve selection procedures with regard to diversity. This paper reports on a qualitative study with a socio-constructivist perspective conducted in 2015 that explored how residency selection decision-making occurred within four specialties in two regions in the Netherlands. Data included transcripts of the decision-making meetings and of one-on-one interviews with committee members before and after the group decision-making meetings. Candidates struggled to portray themselves favorably as they had to balance playing by the rules and being authentic; between fitting in and standing out. Although admissions committees had a welcoming stance to diversity, their practices were unintentionally preventing them from hiring underrepresented minority (URM) candidates. While negotiating admissions is difficult for all candidates, it is presumably even more complicated for URM candidates. This seems to be having a negative influence on attaining workforce diversity. Current beliefs, which make committees mistakenly feel they are acting fairly, might actually justify biased practices. Awareness of the role of committee members in these processes is an essential first step.",

By now, most agree that the original claims promising direct translations to teaching and learning were too strong. I argue here that research questions in (health professions) education require multi-methodological approaches, including neuroscience, while carefully weighing what (combination of) approaches are most suitable given a research question. Only through a multi-methodological approach will convergence of evidence emerge, which is so desperately needed for improving teaching and learning in the classroom. However, both researchers and teachers should become aware of the so-called ‘seductive allure’ of EN; that is, the demonstrable physical location and apparent objectivity of the measurements can be interpreted as yielding more powerful evidence and warranting stronger conclusions than, e.g., behavioral experiments, where in fact oftentimes the reverse is the case. I conclude that our tendency as researchers to commit ourselves to one methodological approach and to addressing educational research questions from a single methodological perspective is limiting progress in educational science and in translation to education.",

A randomised controlled trial with three measurement points (baseline, post-intervention, and 4 months post-intervention) was conducted among undergraduate students of medicine, dentistry, psychology, and logopaedics at the University of Helsinki. The participants were randomly assigned into three groups: (1) face-to-face mindfulness training based on the Mindfulness Skills for Students course (n = 40), (2) a web-based Student Compass program using Mindfulness and Acceptance and Commitment therapy (n = 22), and (3) a control group that received mental health support as usual (n = 40). The primary outcome was psychological distress measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM). Secondary outcomes included hair cortisol concentrations and a wide range of well-being indicators. Psychological distress increased in all the groups from baseline to post-intervention, but significantly less so in the intervention groups than in the control group. At 4-month follow-up, were found no differences between the primary outcomes of the control and intervention groups, but the participants who continued practising mindfulness at least twice a week were less stressed than the others. Our results suggest that participating in a mindfulness course may mitigate health care students’ psychological distress during the academic year, but only if the participants continue practising mindfulness at least twice a week.",

Previous authors have recommended eye-tracking technology as a useful approach for collecting data on the processes test taker’s use to respond to test questions. This study proposes a new method for evaluating alternative score interpretations by using eye-tracking data and machine learning. We collect eye-tracking data from 26 students responding to clinical MCQs. Analysis is performed by providing 119 eye-tracking features as input for a machine-learning model aiming to classify correct and incorrect responses. The predictive power of various combinations of features within the model is evaluated to understand how different feature interactions contribute to the predictions. The emerging eye-movement patterns indicate that incorrect responses are associated with working from the options to the stem. By contrast, correct responses are associated with working from the stem to the options, spending more time on reading the problem carefully, and a more decisive selection of a response option. The results suggest that the behaviours associated with correct responses are aligned with the real-world model used for score interpretation, while those associated with incorrect responses are not. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform data-driven, machine-learning experiments with eye-tracking data for the purpose of evaluating score interpretation validity.",

In our results, we describe three types of 'work'-standardising work, defensibility work and accountability work-summarising these in the discussion as an Accountability Circuit, which shows the organising role of texts on people's work processes. We show how this form of governance mandates a shift towards accountability-centred practices, away from practices which are person-centred; this lens on accountability-centring during high-stakes assessments invites critique of the often-unquestioned emphasis of new public management in health professions education.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates pharmacy students’ reasoning while solving a case task concerning an acute patient counselling situation in a pharmacy. Participants’ ( N = 34) reasoning processes were investigated with written tasks utilizing eye-tracking in combination with verbal protocols. The case was presented in three pages, each page being followed by written questions. Eye movements were recorded during case processing. Success in the task required differentiating the relevant information from the task redundant information, and initial activation of several scripts and verification of the most likely one, when additional information became available. 2nd ( n = 16) and 3rd ( n = 18)-year students’ and better and worse succeeding students’ processes were compared. The results showed that only a few 2nd-year students solved the case correctly, whereas almost all of the 3rd-year students were successful. Generally, the average total processing times of the case material did not differ between the groups. However, better-succeeding and 3rd-year students processed the very first task-relevant sentences longer, indicating that they were able to focus on relevant information. Differences in the written answers to the 2nd and 3rd question were significant, whereas differences regarding the first question were not. Thus, eye-tracking seems to be able to capture illness script activation during case processing, but other methods are needed to depict the script verification process. Based on the results, pedagogical suggestions for advancing pharmacy education are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent statistics found the prevalence of dyslexia in UK medical schools to be 7%, sitting below the national prevalence of 10%. The factors contributing to this discrepancy are currently unknown, but may result from an interplay of individual and systemic barriers to entering medicine. This collaborative, analytic autoethnography aimed to use the experiences of ‘Meg’, a fourth-year medical student who was diagnosed as dyslexic whilst at medical school, to explore how the lack of a diagnosis during the admissions process may have impacted her journey into medicine. The data were collected using reflective writing and an interview before conducting a thematic analysis. Our analysis resulted in the construction of two meta-themes, relating to the negative emotional impact of not having a diagnosis and feelings of inferiority. Seven themes were also constructed. Some explored how Meg’s personal experience of undiagnosed dyslexia acted as a barrier to entering medicine. Others explored the impact of external factors, such as socio-economic background and the provision of support, on an individual’s chance of successfully applying to medical school. Finally, we explored the inadvertent impact undiagnosed (and unrecognised) dyslexia had on Meg’s life course, including how medicine-specific aptitude tests, such as the BMAT and UKCAT, may have contributed to this. These results provide a unique window into the culture of applying to medical school as an undiagnosed dyslexic person, whilst discussing the need for medical schools to consider how their admissions processes may inadvertently disadvantage undiagnosed dyslexic applicants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantitative measures of systematic differences in OSCE scoring across examiners (often termed examiner stringency) can threaten the validity of examination outcomes. Such effects are usually conceptualised and operationalised based solely on checklist/domain scores in a station, and global grades are not often used in this type of analysis. In this work, a large candidate-level exam dataset is analysed to develop a more sophisticated understanding of examiner stringency. Station scores are modelled based on global grades—with each candidate, station and examiner allowed to vary in their ability/stringency/difficulty in the modelling. In addition, examiners are also allowed to vary in how they discriminate across grades—to our knowledge, this is the first time this has been investigated. Results show that examiners contribute strongly to variance in scoring in two distinct ways—via the traditional conception of score stringency (34% of score variance), but also in how they discriminate in scoring across grades (7%). As one might expect, candidate and station account only for a small amount of score variance at the station-level once candidate grades are accounted for (3% and 2% respectively) with the remainder being residual (54%). Investigation of impacts on station-level candidate pass/fail decisions suggest that examiner differential stringency effects combine to give false positive (candidates passing in error) and false negative (failing in error) rates in stations of around 5% each but at the exam-level this reduces to 0.4% and 3.3% respectively. This work adds to our understanding of examiner behaviour by demonstrating that examiners can vary in qualitatively different ways in their judgments. For institutions, it emphasises the key message that it is important to sample widely from the examiner pool via sufficient stations to ensure OSCE-level decisions are sufficiently defensible. It also suggests that examiner training should include discussion of global grading, and the combined effect of scoring and grading on candidate outcomes.",

Between fall 2010 and spring 2019, we assessed empathy longitudinally among six student cohorts (N = 493) at a U.S. medical school, where patient interaction occurs early and throughout an integrated curriculum. Empathy levels of students in each cohort were assessed at five time points utilizing the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student version. We hypothesized empathy levels will not degrade by program end, and trajectories will not show patterns of decline in Years Three and Four. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Linear Mixed Model (LMM) analyses were used to analyze differences at baseline and changes in empathy trajectories. ANOVA analyses revealed statistically significant differences at baseline by class cohort ( F (5, 487) = [23.28], p &lt; 0.001). LMM analyses indicated empathy was either significantly higher or not different at the end of the program ( F (19, 1676) = [13.97], p &lt; 0.001). Empathy trajectories varied among cohorts; yet, none resulted in an overall empathy decline by the end of the program. Findings demonstrate empathy in U.S. medical students can be unchanged or higher by the end of medical education. Outcomes are consistent with reports of non-declining medical student empathy outside the U.S. and support the notion of context-specificity. Results further support recent research, suggesting decreases in empathy during training can stabilize or increase by program end. These findings have important implications for future empathy research context and design considerations, as well as program planning.",

    "abstract": "Background Currently no guidelines exist for the development of surgical handover educational curricula. This critical review synthesises the relevant literature to identify best approaches to handover education and develop an evidence-based framework for teaching and assessing surgical handover skills. Methods The following resources were critically reviewed by two independent researchers to identify key educational components; (1) all published studies primarily utilising an educational intervention to improve surgical handover up to May 2023, (2) key international guidelines and (3) reviews of all handover interventions published within the last 10 years. Results A total of eight comparative studies, two systematic reviews, and four handover guidelines were included. Findings were reported across eight domains; including educational setting, approach, format, content, resources used, assessment, student feedback, and follow-up training. A framework for developing surgical handover curricula was also reported. Conclusion The reported educational framework or 'blueprint' aims to assist educators across multiple settings to develop evidence-based surgical handover curricula for undergraduate and postgraduate learners. Future studies need to achieve higher Kirkpatrick levels to demonstrate both effectiveness and sustainability of educational interventions, ensuring safer patient care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent studies on handover communication highlight the role of the incoming physician in preventing misunderstandings that contribute to medical errors. However, existing research often only provides abstract recommendations for increasing their participation, without specifying where and how this should occur. This paper applies discourse theory and methods to identify where the incoming physician’s active involvement is interactionally appropriate and can be integrated naturally and effectively. Twelve handovers between six pairs of resident physicians were recorded in a simulated ICU setting at a teaching hospital and analyzed using a combination of genre theory and conversation analysis. By first identifying the \"moves\" that constitute the handover genre, we pinpointed places where active participation by the incoming physician is expected and facilitates effective communication. While the tasks and focus points and the questions and consultation moves clearly invite such participation, the clinical situation move requires more negotiation, as the outgoing physician maintains control over the conversational floor, making it less immediately accessible for the incoming physician to contribute. The four remaining moves exhibit a more monologic pattern, where both participants display interactional behavior signaling that active input from the incoming physician is not anticipated. Our findings suggest that medical professionals share an implicit understanding of when participation is appropriate, shaped by conventions of the handover genre itself. By reconstructing these tacit rules through genre theory and conversation analysis, we provide insights that can inform training methods, ensuring that recommendations for active participation by the incoming physician align with the structured expectations of clinical practice.",

Partnerships between educators and people with lived experience ensures simulation authentically represents the needs of people accessing healthcare. To map available literature on how lived experiences are incorporated into health professions simulation-based education a scoping review was conducted. In April 2024 CINAHL Complete, Scopus, ERIC, Medline, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global Database were searched. Studies were screened against the inclusion criteria, and data was extracted from 45 studies using a purposively developed and piloted extraction tool, and organised according to four research questions. Medicine and nursing most commonly include lived experiences in simulation-based education and cultural and linguistic diversity is the lived experience most often harnessed. Lived experience involvement across the entire six phases of simulation design and delivery was not common, however active and meaningful involvement was represented at each stage. Lived experience involvement enhances simulation-based education and provides an additional opportunity for people with lived experience to be involved in health professions education. There is an urgent need for guidelines describing how educators can harness lived experiences in simulation-based education. Further research, in partnership with people with lived experience, is required to determine how to more authentically represent lived experience in simulation-based education.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Interprofessional identity (IPI) is crucial in shaping the perceptions, knowledge, and collaborative skills of health professions learners. Its development is influenced by external factors (educational and practice contexts) and internal factors (motivational beliefs and confidence). Despite its importance, a comprehensive understanding of IPI formation is limited. This study proposed a theoretical model to clarify how professional self-efficacy and motivational beliefs contribute to IPI development, moderated by learning gains and satisfaction within interprofessional education (IPE). A longitudinal study with 473 health professions students was conducted during a 3-week IPE simulation course. Data were collected at the start and end of an IPE simulation course through questionnaires assessing professional self-efficacy, motivational beliefs, IPI, and program learning gains and satisfaction at two time points in 2023. A bootstrapped moderated mediation analysis using PROCESS Macro was employed to examine the mediating role of motivational beliefs between professional self-efficacy and IPI. Additionally, the study explored whether learning gains and satisfaction moderated the link between motivational beliefs and IPI. Professional self-efficacy significantly predicted IPI, with motivational beliefs mediating this relationship. The mediation effect was strengthened by students’ perceived learning gains and satisfaction with the IPE program, indicating a significant index of moderated mediation (B = 0.073, BootSE = 0.026, 95% BootCI [0.020, 0.120]). Effective IPE initiatives should enhance professional self-efficacy and motivational beliefs to develop IPI among health professions students. Creating a supportive interprofessional learning environment is essential, fostering engagement and satisfaction to build a resilient IPI, ultimately enhancing collaborative practices and patient care quality.",

    "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a vital tool for diagnosis of life-threatening conditions, with broad consensus supporting its integration into medical curricula. Despite evidence of effectiveness of POCUS training, many clinicians do not utilise skills in practice, resulting in missed patient benefits. Research on the barriers to POCUS utilisation remains limited. To address this, we conducted a theory-informed exploratory qualitative case study to investigate the utilisation of Focused Intensive Care Echo (FICE) in a specialist heart and lung hospital. The investigation was framed using situated learning and activity theory. We undertook 28 interviews, three focus groups (N = 27) and two expert discussions. Thematic analysis identified barriers while difference-within-similarity-analysis (Hofmann, 2020) uncovered how these interact to hinder POCUS-utilisation. We demonstrate how barriers preventing trainees from using POCUS interacted with the wider activity system, forming vicious cycles to further hinder use. These vicious cycles related to enthusiasm, opportunity, support, participation, communication and norms that hindered POCUS-use, and manifest as an underlying tension between competing priorities of POCUS training and patient care. We discuss how theoretically re-framing the findings suggests low/medium-resource mechanisms which helped mitigate this tension and overcome the vicious cycles. These facilitative mechanisms could generate scalable and sustainable solutions to support POCUS-training and utilisation.",

    "abstract": "Clinical reasoning skills develop through increased knowledge acquisition, greater clinical experience, and continued practice over time. Yet, across undergraduate and graduate medical education, it is inconsistently taught. As progressive clinical reasoning curricula emerge, research is needed to help inform the content and activities appropriate for different learner levels. While much is understood about the clinical reasoning skills of novices and experts, less has been theorized about students in between those two extremes. Our study explores the clinical reasoning skills of medical students in their final year of medical school, informed by clinical reasoning models and information processing theories. We conducted think-aloud interviews with 18 4th-year medical students tasked with completing a novel web-based assessment. Students reviewed simulated patient charts, answered clinically relevant questions, and justified their thinking and responses. Using a qualitative data collection and analysis framework, we coded interviews for clinical reasoning elements and emergent themes. Our findings present an initial framework for understanding the clinical reasoning skills of 4th-year medical students. The framework includes four high-level skills that we defined as interpreting, framing, generating, and justifying. These skills reflect elements of nonanalytic and analytic thinking in that students used semantic qualifiers, partially activated illness scripts, and engaged in aspects of hypothetical-deductive reasoning. Our framework can help shape how best to structure clinical reasoning instruction in medical education across the novice-to-expert continuum, as well as aid in the development of clinical reasoning theories that incorporate a range of learner levels.",

Limited empirical knowledge exists about the determinants of clinical performance. Contemporary thought is that clinical performance is determined by multiple cognitive, environmental, psychological and social factors. Accordingly, we examined which individual differences and self-regulatory factors are credible determinants of undergraduate physiotherapy student performance within clinical placements. Utilising a measurement burst design, we captured weekly self-reported survey data amongst two cohorts (2019 and 2020) of final year, undergraduate students as they progressed through four 5-week physiotherapy clinical placements. In total, 97 of the 181 consenting students met the data inclusion criteria by completing more than three surveys in a minimum of two clinical placements. For these students, we collated their clinical placement results and utilised multilevel structural equation modelling to examine intra-individual dynamics of diverse psychosocial factors and their association with clinical performance data. Study findings supported stable individual differences, contextual experiences, and self-regulatory factors as meaningful determinants of physiotherapy entry-level performance. Knowledge of salient psychosocial determinants associated with clinical performance can inform curriculum design. Doing so includes practical strategies for early identification of students who may struggle in clinical placement settings, and ways to foster salient student skills and abilities before and during placements to optimise clinical placement performance outcomes.",

Focusing on the experiences of CS teachers in Sweden, this study aims to explore the challenges they identify in teaching CS and how they adapt their practice accordingly. Individual interviews were conducted with 16 CS teachers, guided by a semi-structured interview guide. Data collection and analysis were iterative, aligning with constructivist Grounded Theory methodology. The teachers experienced a conflict between an idealized view of patient-centered communication taught during CS courses and the actual communication practiced in the clinical context, as well as students' attitudes. This conflict permeated participants' perceptions of their teaching goals, the challenges they faced, and the teaching strategies they employed. The teachers' goals were to convey the purpose of CS, aiming for progress rather than expecting students to reach fixed goals and to promote student ownership in classroom practice. Challenges included students' negative attitudes towards CS courses, their focus on succeeding rather than developing, and having to teach and examine simultaneously. Strategies focused on supporting learning by transforming negative attitudes towards CS teaching, providing a safe group climate, and offering constructive feedback to reduce defensiveness. This study highlights the need to bridge the gap between idealized CS teaching and clinical practice through institutional support, including curriculum integration, clear assessment frameworks, and recognition of emotional demands on CS teachers.",

    "abstract": "Video-Based Learning (VBL) is growing in popularity across various industries, specifically healthcare, for learning procedural skills. Videos offer benefits by providing captivating learning experiences and minimizing the necessity for lengthy in-class explanations. Nevertheless, conventional videos frequently lack crucial information for students to execute processes proficiently. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of studies on using segmented interactive videos to educate procedural abilities. Hence, this study examines the effect of segmented-interactive video displays on students' technical skills, communication, and competency. The study investigates the disparities in learner performance following exposure to various video formats and investigates the relationship between competency and the specific type of video employed. The study utilizes a quasi-experimental method, collecting pre-test and post-test data from 127 students using the Integrated Procedure Performance Instruments (IPPI) rating checklist. The differences before and after intervention, as well as across groups, were analyzed using non-parametric tests such as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Mann-Whitney U test. The results demonstrate an enhancement in students' technical proficiency, communication abilities, and competence in executing procedures such as venipuncture. A significant relationship was observed between VBL and both technical proficiency and communication skills. Nevertheless, no significant relationship was observed between overall competency and the utilization of segmented interactive videos. The study's findings indicate that segmented interactive videos are associated with better technical, competency, and communication skills in procedural training. The study suggests that future research should explore the impact of segmented-interactive videos on a broader range of abilities, conduct longitudinal studies, and investigate other specialties within healthcare education.",

    "abstract": "South African medical education confronts systemic challenges rooted in colonial legacies, demanding transformative pedagogies that redress inequities and integrate community health through culturally responsive frameworks. This convergent mixed-methods study, guided by a transformative paradigm emphasizing ethical engagement and social justice, evaluated the implementation of the AfriMEDS framework, a local adaptation of CanMEDS incorporating community-based education (CBE) and community-oriented primary care (COPC) at the University of the Free State (UFS). Methods included curriculum mapping, document analysis, 15 educator interviews, and surveys of 71 medical interns. Document review revealed that health advocate, leader and manager, and scholar roles were minimally featured in phase guides and that existing assessment tools diverged from CanMEDS recommendations. Educator interviews identified three principal barriers: insufficient faculty development (87% of participants), resource constraints, and misaligned assessment practices. Intern surveys showed only 63% felt leadership training was adequate, 71% felt prepared for CBE, and 72% felt competent in collaboration. These findings expose critical gaps in embedding AfriMEDS competencies, particularly intrinsic roles, within undergraduate training. Our methodological framework highlights how CBE and COPC can serve as catalysts for meaningful curricular reform by fostering sustained collaboration between learners, educators, and communities. We recommend systemic reforms including decolonial pedagogical strategies, robust faculty development in cultural competency, alignment of curricula with national health priorities, and the creation of benchmarked assessment tools that reflect African healthcare contexts and community needs. Failure to implement these reforms risks perpetuating inequity and undermining South Africa's health transformation agenda. Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Undergraduate interprofessional education aims to prepare health professions students for a future work field characterised by wicked problems demanding interprofessional collaboration (IPC). Interprofessional identity (IPI) has been suggested as key to IPC, but how to foster its formation remains underdeveloped. Therefore, we aimed to identify (1) the main characteristics of IPI and (2) guidelines for educational design fostering interprofessional identity formation (IPIF). Per critical review methodology, we analysed educational sciences, health professions education and management sciences literature. The results of two iterative, non-exhaustive literature searches were analysed through reflexive thematic analysis. The first search focused on conceptualisations of IPI to identify its main characteristics and theories explaining IPIF, the second on the mechanisms of these theories fostering IPIF to derive guidelines for educational design. Analysis of the first search yielded five themes characterising IPI: (1) sense of belonging to an interprofessional team; (2) commitment to working interprofessionally; (3) values, attitudes, beliefs, and ethics related to IPC; (4) knowledge and understanding of roles, responsibilities, and expertise; and (5) IPC skills. We identified five prevalent theories explaining IPIF. Analysis of the second search resulted in guidelines for educational design fostering IPIF targeting the student, interprofessional team, faculty, and curriculum. Fostering IPI alongside IPC competencies is crucial for preparing students for IPC. This critical review highlighted key characteristics of IPI and proposes ED-IPIF, a theory-based framework for fostering IPIF through integrated educational design. Future research should address existing gaps and empirically test the ED-IPIF through longitudinal studies and robust tools for measuring IPI.",

    "abstract": "Although other web-based approaches to assessment of professional behaviour have been studied, no publications studying the potential advantages of a web-based instrument versus a classic, paper-based method have been published to date. This study has two research goals: it focuses on the quantity and quality of comments provided by students and their peers (two researchers independently scoring comments as correct and incorrect in relation to five commonly used feedback rules (and resulting in an aggregated score of the five scores) on the one, and on the feasibility, acceptability and perceived usefulness of the two approaches on the other hand (using a survey). The amount of feedback was significantly higher in the web-based group than in the paper based group for all three categories (dealing with work, others and oneself). Regarding the quality of feedback, the aggregated score for each of the three categories was not significantly different between the two groups, neither for the interim, nor for the final assessment. Some, not statistically significant, but nevertheless noteworthy trends were nevertheless noted. Feedback in the web-based group was more often unrelated to observed behaviour for several categories for both the interim and final assessment. Furthermore, most comments relating to the category 'Dealing with oneself' consisted of descriptions of a student's attendance, thereby neglecting other aspects of personal functioning. The survey identified significant differences between the groups for all questionnaire items regarding feasibility, acceptability and perceived usefulness in favour of the paper-based form. The use of a web-based instrument for professional behaviour assessment yielded a significantly higher number of comments compared to the traditional paper-based assessment. Unfortunately, the quality of the feedback obtained by the web-based instrument as measured by several generally accepted feedback criteria did not parallel this increase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract That idea that problem-based learning (PBL) is more motivating that traditional education has been prevalent since the inception of PBL at McMaster University in the late 1960s. Evidencing this through empirical research, however, has proven to be a lot more problematic. This paper retraces how the discourse on motivation started from a laymen’s conception in the early days of PBL, and slowly evolved into a field of scientific inquiry in the 1980s and 1990s. However, looking at the evolution of motivation theory over the same period, we show that motivation discourse in the burgeoning literature on motivation and PBL remained largely wedded to the laymen’s approach, and failed to catch up with the new achievement-goal theory and self-determination theory approaches. This paper proceeds to analyse the explosion of studies on PBL and motivation after 2000, acknowledging efforts to move away from anecdotal accounts and provide theoretical grounding to the research. However, once again, we show that the majority of the research employed outdated motivational measures that do not fully grasp the complexity of contemporary motivation theory. The paper concludes on the observation that single-course and curriculum-wide research interventions have yielded no conclusive results on the effect of PBL on intrinsic motivation, and that future research should therefore seek to use up-to-date motivational constructs in more targeted interventions.",

Feedback that coaches using a feedforward approach, is considered to be more personal and emotionally literate Bussey (Bull R Coll Surg Engl 99: 180-182, 2017), Hattie (Rev Educ Res 77: 81-112, 2007). Many modes of feedback are employed in clinical teaching environments, however, written feedback is particularly important, as a component of feedback discourse, as significant time may elapse before a similar clinical situation is encountered. In practice, time constraints often result in brief or descriptive written feedback rather than longer coaching feedback. This study aimed to explore whether a change in ethos and staff development would encourage clinical dental tutors to utilise a coaching approach in their written feedback. Across two time-points, written feedback was categorised into either descriptive, evaluative or coaching approaches. Cross-sections of data from 2017 to 2019 were examined to determine whether changes in practice were noted and whether there were any alterations in the affective nature of the language used. Feedback moved significantly towards coaching and away from a descriptive approach. A shift towards the use of more positive language was seen overall, although this was solely driven by a change in the evaluative feedback category. Descriptive feedback generally used neutral language with coaching feedback using marginally more positive language. Both categories employed significantly lower levels of affective language than evaluative feedback. These data indicate a move towards feedback approaches and language that may support increased uptake and utilisation of feedback.",

    "abstract": "The importance of team communication, or more specifically speaking up, for safeguarding quality of patient care is increasingly being endorsed in research findings. However, little is known about speaking up of clinical teachers in postgraduate medical training. In order to determine how clinical teachers demonstrate speaking up in formal teaching team meetings and what factors influence this, the authors carried out an exploratory study based on ethnographic principles. The authors selected 12 teaching teams and observed, audio recorded and analysed the data. Subsequently, during an interview, the program directors reflected on speaking up of those clinical teachers present during the meeting. Finally, the authors analysed iteratively all data, using a template analysis, based on Edmondson’s behaviours of speaking up. The study was conducted from October 2013 to July 2014 and ten teams participated. During the teaching team meetings, the clinical teachers exhibited most of the behaviours of speaking up. “Sharing information” strongly resembles providing information and “talking about mistakes” occurs in a general sense and without commitment of improvement activities. “Asking questions” was often displayed by closed questions and at times several questions simultaneously. The authors identified factors that influence speaking up by clinical teachers: relational, cultural, and professional. The clinical teachers exhibit speaking up, but there is only limited awareness to discuss problems or mistakes and the discussion centred mainly on the question of blame. It is important to take into account the factors that influence speaking up, in order to stimulate open communication during the teaching team meetings.",

This study aims to measure the effect of students’ attitude towards risk and ambiguity on their number of correct, wrong, and blank answers. In October 2018, 233 3rd year medical students from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, in Porto, Portugal, completed a questionnaire which assessed the student’s attitudes towards risk and ambiguity, and aversion to ambiguity in medicine. Simple and multiple regression models and the respective regression coefficients were used to measure the association between the students’ attitudes, and their answers in two examinations that they had taken in June 2018. Having an intermediate level of ambiguity aversion in medicine (as opposed to a very high or low level) was associated with a significant increase in the number of correct answers and decrease in the number of blank answers in the first examination. In the second examination, high levels of ambiguity aversion in medicine were associated with a decrease in the number of wrong answers. Attitude towards risk, tolerance for ambiguity, and gender did not show significant association with the number of correct, wrong, and blank answers for either examination. Students’ ambiguity aversion in medicine is correlated with their performance in multiple-choice examinations with negative marking. Therefore, it is suggested the planning and implementation of counselling sessions with medical students regarding the possible impact of ambiguity aversion on their performance in multiple-choice questions with negative marking.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The promotion of healthy aging has become a priority in most parts of the world and should be promoted at all ages. However, the baseline training of health and social professionals is currently not adequately tailored to these challenges. This paper reports the results of a Delphi study conducted to reach expert agreement about health and social professionals’ competencies to promote healthy aging throughout the lifespan within the SIENHA project. Materials and methods: This study was developed following the CREDES standards. The initial version of the competence framework was based on the results of a scoping review and following the CanMEDS model. The expert panel consisted of a purposive sample of twenty-two experts in healthy aging with diverse academic and clinical backgrounds, fields and years of expertise from seven European countries. Agreement was reached after three rounds. The final framework consisted of a set of 18 key competencies and 80 enabling competencies distributed across six domains. The SIENHA competence framework for healthy aging may help students and educators enrich their learning and the academic content of their subjects and/or programs and incentivize innovation.",

However, there is a need to better understand the complex interplay between institutional guidelines and how teachers decode those guidelines and assign value to teaching merits. To gain a deeper understanding of this dynamic, this study employed a sociological analysis to understand how medical educators aspiring to professorships use MEPs to display their teaching merits and how cultural capital is reflected in these artefacts. We collected 36 medical educator portfolios for promotion from a large research-intensive university and conducted a deductive content analysis using institutional guidelines that distinguished between mandatory (accounting for the total body of teaching conducted) and optional content (arguing for pedagogical choices and evidencing the quality, respectively). Our analysis showed that the portfolios primarily included quantifiable data about teaching activities, e.g., numbers of students, topics and classes taught. Notably, they often lacked evidence of quality and scholarship of teaching. Looking at these findings through a Bourdieusian lens revealed that teachers in this social field exchange objectified evidence of hours spent on teaching into teaching capital recognized by their institution. Our findings highlight how institutional guidelines for MEPs construct a pedagogical battlefield, where educators try to decode and exchange the “right” and recognized teaching capital. This indicates that MEPs reflect the norms and practices of the academic field more than individual teaching quality.",

    "abstract": "Medical sciences education emphasizes basic science learning as a prerequisite to clinical learning. Studies exploring relationships between achievement in the basic sciences and subsequent achievement in the clinical sciences generally suggest a significant positive relationship. Basic science knowledge and clinical experience are theorized to combine to form encapsulated knowledge- a dynamic mix of information that is useful for solving clinical problems. This study explores the relationship between basic science knowledge (BSK), clinical science knowledge (CSK), and clinical problem-solving ability, as measured within the context of four veterinary colleges using both college-specific measures and professionally validated, standardized measures of basic and clinical science knowledge and problem-solving ability. Significant correlations existed among all variables. Structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis were used to produce models showing that newly acquired BSK directly and significantly predicted BSK retained over time and newly acquired CSK, as well as indirectly predicted clinical problem-solving ability (mediated by newly acquired CSK and BSK retained over time). These findings likely suggest a gradual development of schema (encapsulated knowledge) and not an isolated development of biomedical versus clinical knowledge over time. A broader implication of these results is that explicitly teaching basic science knowledge positively and durably affects subsequent clinical knowledge and problem-solving ability independent of instructional strategy or curricular approach. Furthermore, for veterinary colleges specifically, student performance as measured by both course-level and standardized tests are likely to prove useful for predicting subsequent academic achievement in classroom and clinical settings, licensing examination performance, and/or for identifying students likely in need of remediation in clinical knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since 2020, brought to the forefront by movements such as Black Lives Matter and Idle No More, it has been widely acknowledged that systemic racism contributes to racially differentiated health outcomes. Health professional educators have been called to address such disparities within healthcare, policy, and practice. To tackle structural racism within healthcare, one avenue that has emerged is the creation of medical education interventions within postgraduate residency medical programming. The objective of this scoping review is to examine the current literature on anti-racist educational interventions, that integrate a systemic or structural view of racism, within postgraduate medical education. Through the identification and analysis of 23 papers, this review identified three major components of interest across medical interventions, including (a) conceptualization, (b) pedagogical issues, and (c) outcomes &amp; evaluation. There were overlapping points of discussion and analysis within each of these components. Conceptualization addressed how researchers conceptualized racism in different ways, the range of curricular content educators chose to challenge racism, and the absence of community’s role in curricular development. Pedagogical issues addressed knowledge vs. skills-based teaching, and tensions between one-time workshops and integrative curriculum. Outcomes and evaluation highlighted self-reported Likert scales as dominant types of evaluation, self-evaluation in educational interventions, and misalignments between intervention outcomes and learning objectives. The findings are unique in their in-depth exploration of anti-racist medical interventions within postgraduate medical education programming, specifically in relation to efforts to address systemic and structural racism. The findings contribute a meaningful review of the current state of the field of medical education and generate new conversations about future possibilities for a broader anti-racist health professions curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Doctors’ interactional competencies play a crucial role in patient satisfaction, well-being, and compliance. Accordingly, it is in medical schools’ interest to select candidates with strong interactional abilities. While Multiple Mini Interviews (MMIs) provide a useful context to assess such abilities, the evaluation of candidate performance during MMIs is not always based on a solid theoretical framework. The newly developed selection procedure “Interactional Competencies – Medical Doctors (IC-MD)” uses an MMI circuit with five simulation patient scenarios and is rated based on the theoretically and empirically grounded construct of emotional availability. A first validation study with N = 70 first-semester medical students took place in 2021. In terms of convergent validity, IC-MD ratings showed strong correlations with simulation patients’ satisfaction with the encounter ( r =.57) but no association with emotional intelligence measures. IC-MD ratings were not related to high school performance or a cognitive student aptitude test, indicating divergent validity. Inter-rater reliability ( ICC = 0.63) and generalizability ( Eρ 2 = 0.64) were satisfactory. The IC-MD proved to be fair regarding participants’ age and gender. Participants with prior work experience in healthcare outperformed those without such experience. Participant acceptance of the procedure were good. The IC-MD is a promising selection procedure capable of assessing interactional competencies relevant to the medical setting. Measures of interactional competencies can complement the use of cognitive selection criteria in medical student admission. The predictive validity of the IC-MD needs to be addressed in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Health professional education stands to gain substantially from collective efforts toward building video databases of skill performances in both real and simulated settings. An accessible resource of videos that demonstrate an array of performances – both good and bad—provides an opportunity for interdisciplinary research collaborations that can advance our understanding of movement that reflects technical expertise, support educational tool development, and facilitate assessment practices. In this paper we raise important ethical and legal considerations when building and sharing health professions education data. Collective data sharing may produce new knowledge and tools to support healthcare professional education. We demonstrate the utility of a data-sharing culture by providing and leveraging a database of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performances that vary in quality. The CPR skills performance database (collected for the purpose of this research, hosted at UK Data Service’s ReShare Repository) contains videos from 40 participants recorded from 6 different angles, allowing for 3D reconstruction for movement analysis. The video footage is accompanied by quality ratings from 2 experts, participants’ self-reported confidence and frequency of performing CPR, and the demographics of the participants. From this data, we present an Automatic Clinical Assessment tool for Basic Life Support that uses pose estimation to determine the spatial location of the participant’s movements during CPR and a deep learning network that assesses the performance quality.",

There is a concern over whether their preparation is aligned with the expectations of the role. This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the competencies needed for legitimate practice as junior doctors and explores their perceived preparedness for practice. A qualitative, descriptive study using focus groups was undertaken with first year internship doctors. Thirty-two junior doctors in their first year of internship took part in five focus groups. The data were analysed using a reflective thematic analysis approach with a subsequent analysis using the Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) specialisation dimension coding framework to aid interpretation. Personal attributes including adaptability, organisation and proactivity form the basis of achievement in internship. While graduates felt ready in some ways, it was not in the ways that counted. Participants felt well prepared in terms of their clinical knowledge and skills, but legitimacy came from being able to take responsibility, communicate effectively and apply knowledge confidently and efficiently to all aspects of patient care, something that they did not feel ready to do. Using LCT has revealed a shift in the basis of achievement between medical school, where individual academic performance is rewarded, and internship, where personal and social competencies are legitimised. There is a clash between what graduates feel well prepared for and the expectations and demands of the internship role, resulting in a difficult and stressful transition from student to doctor.",

In this study, we draw on Goffman’s seminal work on stigma to explore supervisors’ accounts of judging performance and managing remediation in specialty anesthesia training in Australia and New Zealand. In doing so, we focus on what Goffman calls a “stigma theory” to explain the supervisors’ reported practices. We performed a secondary analysis of nineteen interviews originally gathered using purposive sampling to explore how assessment decisions were made. We conducted a theory-informed thematic analysis of the supervisors’ accounts to identify signifiers of stigma and underlying structures and beliefs. From both deductive and inductive analysis, we developed themes that demonstrate how the stigma of underperformance influences and is induced by supervisors’ reticence to discuss underperformance, their desire to conceal remediation, and their differential treatment of trainees. We also found that accounts of trainees ‘lacking insight’ resembled stigma-induced stereotyping. We argue from our data that our cultural expectations of perfectionism propagate a stigma that undermines our efforts to remediate underperformance and that our remediation practices inadvertently induce stigma. We suggest that a multifaceted approach using both individual and collective action is necessary to change both culture and practice and encourage the normalisation of remediation.",

The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between engagement to human rights and stigma towards people with mental disorders, as well as attitudes towards mental illness in medical and social work students of a Latin American context. An analytical, cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 243 students in the last two years of study. Community Attitudes Towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI), Mental Illness Clinicians’ Attitude Scale (MICA), Human Rights Exposure in Social Work (HRXSW) and Human Rights Engagement in Social Work (HRESW) were used as instruments. To determine how the explanatory variables are related to the engagement to human rights (dependent variable) a binary logistic regression model was used. Correlations were found between the scales and their components. Economic condition, intersectional approach, authoritarianism, benevolence and mental health ideology explained 55.11% of the variance for commitment to the engagement of human rights. Some factors related to the stigma of mental disorders and the focus on human rights in future mental health professionals are highlighted that should be more visible in the training practices of these professions.",

This cross-sectional study involved 596 health professions students enrolled in different majors at a university in Shenyang, China. Data were collected through a questionnaire assessing basic demographic information, social support, academic procrastination, intrinsic learning motivation, and academic self-efficacy. Social support was found to be negatively correlated with academic procrastination. Intrinsic learning motivation and academic self-efficacy were both mediators that partially and jointly mediated the relationship between social support and academic procrastination.

Our focus is on differential attainment (DA) in postgraduate College (Board) examinations. We asked: Are candidates' sociodemographic characteristics associated with performance on the UK's Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) Part 1 after adjusting for medical school performance (MSP) and type of medical programme? This was a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 6040 medical graduates with linked sociodemographic data in the UK Medical Education Database qualifying from a UK medical school (2012-2014) and sitting MRCP Part 1 before October 2019. Chi-squared tests established univariable associations with MRCP performance (pass/fail first sitting MRCP Part 1). Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression identified independent explanatory factors of success, adjusted for medical school. The odds (95% CI) of passing MRCP Part 1 exams on first sitting were greater for men (OR = 1.61, CI 1.42-1.81, p < 0.001) and those on a graduate entry programme (OR = 1.44, 1.05-1.99, p < 0.001). The odds of passing were lower as age increases (OR = 0.87, 0.85-0.90, p < 0.001), for minority ethnic (OR = 0.61, CI 0.53-0.7, p < 0.001), and gateway to medicine (OR = 0.49, CI 0.27-0.90, p = 0.02) candidates. After adjusting for MSP, odds were greater for passing in men (OR = 1.62, CI 1.24-2.11, p < 0.001) and candidates with higher MSP (OR = 4.12, CI 3.40-4.96, p < 0.001). Our findings illustrate how performance on MRCP part 1 is associated with group-level social and educational factors. This DA may be due to aspects of the assessment itself, and/or the persistent nature of social and educational disadvantage.",

    "abstract": "Medical school selection is currently in the paradoxical situation in which selection tools may predict study outcomes, but which constructs are actually doing the predicting is unknown (the 'black box of selection'). Therefore, our research focused on those constructs, answering the question: do the internal structures of the tests in an outcome-based selection procedure reflect the content that was intended to be measured? Downing's validity framework was applied to organize evidence for construct validity, focusing on evidence related to content and internal structure. The applied selection procedure was a multi-tool, CanMEDS-based procedure comprised of a video-based situational judgement test (focused on (inter)personal competencies), and a written aptitude test (reflecting a broader array of CanMEDS competencies). First, we examined content-related evidence pertaining to the creation and application of the competency-based selection blueprint and found that the set-up of the selection procedure was a robust, transparent and replicable process. Second, the internal structure of the selection tests was investigated by connecting applicants' performance on the selection tests to the predetermined blueprint using cognitive diagnostic modeling. The data indicate 89% overlap between the expected and measured constructs. Our results support the notion that the focus placed on creating the right content and following a competency-blueprint was effective in terms of internal structure: most items measured what they were intended to measure. This way of linking a predetermined blueprint to the applicants' results sheds light into the 'black box of selection' and can be used to support the construct validity of selection procedures.",

    "abstract": "It was recently shown that novice medical students could be trained to demonstrate the speed-to-diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy typical of System-1-type reasoning. However, the effectiveness of this training can only be fully evaluated when considering the extent to which knowledge transfer and long-term retention occur as a result, the former of which is known to be notoriously difficult to achieve. This study aimed to investigate whether knowledge learned during an online training exercise for chest X-ray diagnosis promoted either knowledge transfer or retention, or both. Second year medical students were presented with, and trained to recognise the features of four chest X-ray conditions. Subsequently, they were shown the four trained-for cases again as well as different representations of the same conditions varying in the number of common elements and asked to provide a diagnosis, to test for near-transfer (four cases) and far-transfer (four cases) of knowledge. They were also shown four completely new conditions to diagnose. Two weeks later they were asked to diagnose the 16 aforementioned cases again to assess for knowledge retention. Dependent variables were diagnostic accuracy and time-to-diagnosis. Thirty-six students volunteered. Trained-for cases were diagnosed most accurately and with most speed (mean score = 3.75/4, mean time = 4.95 s). When assessing knowledge transfer, participants were able to diagnose near-transfer cases more accurately (mean score = 2.08/4, mean time = 15.77 s) than far-transfer cases (mean score = 1.31/4, mean time = 18.80 s), which showed similar results to those conditions previously unseen (mean score = 0.72/4, mean time = 19.46 s). Retention tests showed a similar pattern but accuracy scores were lower overall. This study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully promote knowledge transfer and retention in Year 2 medical students, using an online training exercise involving diagnosis of chest X-rays, and is one of the few studies to provide evidence of actual knowledge transfer.",

    "abstract": "Direct observation (DO) of residents by supervisors is a highly recommended educational tool in postgraduate medical education, yet its uptake is poor. Residents and supervisors report various reasons for not engaging in DO. Some of these relate to their interaction with patients during DO. We do not know the patient perspectives on these interactions, nor, more broadly, what it is like to be a patient in a DO situation. Understanding the patient perspective may lead to a more complete understanding of the dynamics in DO situations, which may benefit patient wellbeing and improve the use of DO as an educational tool. We conducted a phenomenological interview study to investigate the experience of being a patient in a DO situation. Our analysis included multiple rounds of coding and identifying themes, and a final phase of phenomenological reduction to arrive at the essential elements of the experience. Constant reflexivity was at the heart of this process. Our results provide a new perspective on the role of the supervisor in DO situations. Patients were willing to address the resident, but sought moments of contact with, and some participation by, the supervisor. Consequently, conceptions of DO in which the supervisor thinks she is a fly on the wall rather than a part of the interaction, should be critically reviewed. To that end, we propose the concept of participative direct observation in workplace learning, which also acknowledges the observer's role as participant. Embracing this concept may benefit both patients' wellbeing and residents' learning.",

In this article, we report on an experimental study in which we address the question of how much list-type selected response formats and short-essay type constructed response formats are related to differences in how test takers approach clinical reasoning tasks. The design of this study was informed by a framework developed within cognitive psychology which stresses the importance of the interplay between two components of reasoning-self-monitoring and response inhibition-while solving a task or case. The results presented support the argument that different response formats are related to different processing behavior. Importantly, the pattern of how different factors are related to a correct response in both situations seem to be well in line with contemporary accounts of reasoning. Consequently, we argue that when designing assessments of clinical reasoning, it is crucial to tap into the different facets of this complex and important medical process.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic reasoning is an important topic in General Practitioners' (GPs) vocational training. Interestingly, research has paid little attention to the content of the cases used in clinical reasoning education. Malpractice claims of diagnostic errors represent cases that impact patients and that reflect potential knowledge gaps and contextual factors. With this study, we aimed to identify and prioritize educational content from a malpractice claims database in order to improve clinical reasoning education in GP training. With input from various experts in clinical reasoning and diagnostic error, we defined five priority criteria that reflect educational relevance. Fifty unique medical conditions from a malpractice claims database were scored on those priority criteria by stakeholders in clinical reasoning education in 2021. Subsequently, we calculated the mean total priority score for each condition. Mean total priority score (min 5-max 25) for all fifty diagnoses was 17,11 with a range from 13,89 to 19,61. We identified and described the fifteen highest scoring diseases (with priority scores ranging from 18,17 to 19,61). The prioritized conditions involved complex common (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, renal insufficiency and cancer), complex rare (e.g., endocarditis, ectopic pregnancy, testicular torsion) and more straightforward common conditions (e.g., tendon rupture/injury, eye infection). The claim cases often demonstrated atypical presentations or complex contextual factors. Including those malpractice cases in GP vocational training could enrich the illness scripts of diseases that are at high risk of errors, which may reduce diagnostic error and related patient harm.",

    "abstract": "This article explores experiences of teaching qualitative research (QR) broadly, and qualitative methods (QM) more specifically in medicine, highlighting the challenges faced, and offering recommendations for overcoming them. Using collective online interviews, collaborative autoethnography (CAE) was employed to generate data comprising educator's reflective accounts of teaching QM in medical schools across two continents. Three main themes were identified through collaborative thematic analysis: making meaningful contributions from a marginalized position; finding our pedagogical feet; and recognizing the translational applicability and value of QR. We reflected on the marginalized positioning of QM in medical curricula and the underestimation of the value of QR to understanding pressing health issues. Analysis of these reflections pointed to a lack of formal training for educators and curriculum space for qualitative approaches. Our teaching pedagogies, developed through our own research experiences, self-reflection and student feedback, were primarily student-centered employing a range of novel approaches designed to foster skills and interest in the craft of QR, and introduce a greater appreciation of the significance of QR approaches to medicine. CAE further allowed us to identify some key recommendations that could help medical educators plan for teaching QM and other research methods more effectively in medicine. Future curriculum development should consider the benefits of exposing learners to a range of methods and approaches from across the qualitative-quantitative spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) and Work Based Assessments (WBAs) are the mainstays of assessing clinical competency in health professions’ education. Underpinned by the extrapolation inference in Kane’s Validity Framework, the purpose of this study is to determine whether OSCEs translate to real life performance by comparing students’ OSCE performance to their performance in real-life (as a WBA) using the same clinical scenario, and to understand factors that affect students’ performance. A sequential explanatory mixed methods approach where a grade comparison between students’ performance in their OSCE and WBA was performed. Students were third year pharmacy undergraduates on placement at a community pharmacy in 2022. The WBA was conducted by a simulated patient, unbeknownst to students and indistinguishable from a genuine patient, visiting the pharmacy asking for health advice. The simulated patient was referred to as a ‘mystery shopper’ and the process to ‘mystery shopping’ in this manuscript. Community pharmacy is an ideal setting for real-time observation and mystery shopping as staff can be accessed without appointment. The students’ provision of care and clinical knowledge was assessed by the mystery shopper using the same clinical checklist the student was assessed from in the OSCE. Students who had the WBA conducted were then invited to participate in semi-structured interviews to discuss their experiences in both settings. Overall, 92 mystery shopper (WBA) visits with students were conducted and 36 follow-up interviews were completed. The median WBA score was 41.7% [IQR 28.3] and significantly lower compared to the OSCE score 80.9% [IQR 19.0] in all participants (p &lt; 0.001). Interviews revealed students knew they did not perform as well in the WBA compared to their OSCE, but reflected that they still need OSCEs to prepare them to manage real-life patients. Many students related their performance to how they perceived their role in OSCEs versus WBAs, and that OSCEs allowed them more autonomy to manage the patient as opposed to an unfamiliar workplace. As suggested by the activity theory, the performance of the student can be driven by their motivation which differed in the two contexts.",

The research question was systematized according to the PCC (Population, Concept, and Context) format. A scoping review was performed. A search of multiple bibliographic databases identified 407 papers, of which 21 met the inclusion criteria. The populations of the 21 studies reviewed were composed of professionals in the fields of medicine, nursing, psychology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and social work, among others. The study contexts were both academic and nonacademic hospitals, mental health institutions, and community settings, and the topics examined were organizational climate, organizational culture, organizational attachment and job satisfaction. The findings from the reviewed studies showed positive effects of IPE interventions on organizational climate and culture, but the results on job satisfaction and organizational attachment were mixed (i.e., positive and no effects following IPE interventions). Research on IPE is worth more attention as IPE could be an effective alternative for the fulfillment of the Quadruple Aim and achieving the third of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, aimed at improving health and well-being. It seems critical for IPE to be positioned as a trend in global health, aiming at boosting human health resources as one of its building blocks and calling the attention of health decision-makers.",

    "abstract": "Many different medical school selection processes are used worldwide. In this paper, we examine the effect of (1) participation, and (2) selection in a voluntary selection process on study performance. We included data from two cohorts of medical students admitted to Erasmus MC, Rotterdam and VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and compared them to previously published data from Groningen medical school, The Netherlands. All included students were admitted based on either (1) a top pre-university grade point average, or (2) a voluntary selection process, or (3) weighted lottery. We distinguished between lottery-admitted students who had participated in the voluntary selection process and had been rejected, and lottery-admitted students who had not participated. Knowledge test scores, study progress, and professionalism scores were examined using ANCOVA modelling, logistic regression, and Bonferroni post hoc multiple-comparison tests, controlling for gender and cohort. For written test grades, results showed a participation effect at Groningen medical school and Erasmus MC (p < 0.001), and a selection effect at VUmc (p < 0.05). For obtained course credits, results showed a participation effect at all universities (p < 0.01) and a selection effect at Groningen medical school (p < 0.005). At Groningen medical school, a participation effect seemed apparent in on time first-year completion (p < 0.05). Earlier reported selection and participation effects in professionalism scores at Groningen medical school were not apparent at VUmc. Top pre-university students performed well on all outcome measures. For both the participation effect and the selection effect, results differed between universities. Institutional differences in curricula and in the design of the selection process seem to mediate relations between the different admissions processes and performance. Further research is needed for a deeper understanding of the influence of institutional differences on selection outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Models for diagnostic reasoning in radiology have been based on the observed behaviors of experienced radiologists but have not directly focused on the thought processes of novices as they improve their accuracy of image interpretation. By collecting think-aloud verbal reports, the current study was designed to investigate differences in specific thought processes between medical students (novices) as they learn and radiologists (experts), so that we can better design future instructional environments. Seven medical students and four physicians with radiology training were asked to interpret and diagnose pediatric elbow radiographs where fracture is suspected. After reporting their diagnosis of a case, they were given immediate feedback. Participants were asked to verbalize their thoughts while completing the diagnosis and while they reflected on the provided feedback. The protocol analysis of their verbalizations showed that participants used some combination of four processes to interpret the case: gestalt interpretation, purposeful search, rule application, and reasoning from a prior case. All types of processes except reasoning from a prior case were applied significantly more frequently by experts. Further, gestalt interpretation was used with higher frequency in abnormal cases while purposeful search was used more often for normal cases. Our assessment of processes could help guide the design of instructional environments with well-curated image banks and analytics to facilitate the novice’s journey to expertise in image interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Deliberate reflection has been found to foster diagnostic accuracy on complex cases or under circumstances that tend to induce cognitive bias. However, it is unclear whether the procedure can also be learned and thereby autonomously applied when diagnosing future cases without instructions to reflect. We investigated whether general practice residents would learn the deliberate reflection procedure through 'learning-by-teaching' and apply it to diagnose new cases. The study was a two-phase experiment. In the learning phase, 56 general-practice residents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. They either (1) studied examples of deliberate reflection and then explained the procedure to a fictitious peer on video; or (2) solved cases without reflection (control). In the test phase, one to three weeks later, all participants diagnosed new cases while thinking aloud. The analysis of the test phase showed no significant differences between the conditions on any of the outcome measures (diagnostic accuracy, p = .263; time to diagnose, p = .598; mental effort ratings, p = .544; confidence ratings, p = .710; proportion of contradiction units (i.e. measure of deliberate reflection), p = .544). In contrast to findings on learning-by-teaching from other domains, teaching deliberate reflection to a fictitious peer, did not increase reflective reasoning when diagnosing future cases. Potential explanations that future research might address are that either residents in the experimental condition did not apply the learned deliberate reflection procedure in the test phase, or residents in the control condition also engaged in reflection.",

To contribute to the understanding of HPE-students' workplace learning, the focus of this study is to identify affordances and characterise student's participation during placements. We applied a research design based on observations. Three student-physiotherapists and four student-nurses were shadowed during two of their placement days. A categorisation of affordances is provided, in terms of students' participation in activities, direct interactions and indirect interactions.

    "abstract": "Abstract Examiners’ judgements play a critical role in competency-based assessments such as objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). The standardised nature of OSCEs and their alignment with regulatory accountability assure their wide use as high-stakes assessment in medical education. Research into examiner behaviours has predominantly explored the desirable psychometric characteristics of OSCEs, or investigated examiners’ judgements from a cognitive rather than a sociocultural perspective. This study applies cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) to address this gap in exploring examiners’ judgements in a high-stakes OSCE. Based on the idea that OSCE examiners’ judgements are socially constructed and mediated by their clinical roles, the objective was to explore the sociocultural factors that influenced examiners’ judgements of student competence and use the findings to inform examiner training to enhance assessment practice. Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with examiners who assessed medical student competence in progressing to the next stage of training in a large-scale OSCE at one Australian university. The initial thematic analysis provided a basis for applying CHAT iteratively to explore the sociocultural factors and, specifically, the contradictions created by interactions between different elements such as examiners and rules, thus highlighting the factors influencing examiners’ judgements. The findings indicated four key factors that influenced examiners’ judgements: examiners’ contrasting beliefs about the purpose of the OSCE; their varying perceptions of the marking criteria; divergent expectations of student competence; and idiosyncratic judgement practices. These factors were interrelated with the activity systems of the medical school’s assessment practices and the examiners’ clinical work contexts. Contradictions were identified through the guiding principles of multi-voicedness and historicity. The exploration of the sociocultural factors that may influence the consistency of examiners’ judgements was facilitated by applying CHAT as an analytical framework. Reflecting upon these factors at organisational and system levels generated insights for creating fit-for-purpose examiner training to enhance assessment practice.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians develop as teachers via many activities, from on-the-job training to formal academic programmes. Yet, understanding how clinicians develop the sensibilities of an educator and an appreciation of the complexity of educational environments is challenging. Studies of teacher development have maintained a relatively narrow definition of educational practice. A more expansive view encompasses clinical teachers' roles in relation to elements beyond learners or content, such as the cultures and other structures of healthcare institutions. In our online Postgraduate Certificate in Clinical Education, space and structure are intentionally created for teachers to think and talk about education with colleagues in other disciplinary contexts. We interviewed 17 students about how their approaches to teaching had changed over a year of part-time study, using their teaching philosophies, written at the start of the programme, as points of contrast. We took an abductive approach to data analysis, drawing on the literature and, unavoidably, our own reflexive interpretations of our practice outside of the research context, such as conversations with students and colleagues; our experiences of teaching and our concurrent research and scholarship. Our themes of repertoire building, perspective shifting, embodied practice, and appreciation of context, describe the increasing complexity of individuals' considerations of teaching. We use our analysis as the basis for a discussion of the blurring of boundaries between staff and students on such programmes as both groups are engaged in an ongoing continuum of development as all teachers, continue to be learners of educational practice. These insights can inform the ways in which postgraduate programmes can make space for clinical teachers to share and reflect on practices, perspectives and contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the context of medical device training, e-Learning can address problems like unstandardized content and different learning paces. However, staff and students value hands-on activities during medical device training. In a blended learning approach, we examined whether using a syringe pump while conducting an e-Learning program improves the procedural skills needed to operate the pump compared to using the e-Learning program only. In two experiments, the e-Learning only group learned using only the e-Learning program. The e-Learning + hands-on group was instructed to use a syringe pump during the e-Learning to repeat the presented content (section “Experiment 1”) or to alternate between learning on the e-Learning program and applying the learned content using the pump (section “Experiment 2”). We conducted a skills test, a knowledge test, and assessed confidence in using the pump immediately after learning and two weeks later. Simply repeating the content (section “Experiment 1”) did not improve performance of e-Learning + hands-on compared with e-Learning only. The instructed learning process (section “Experiment 1”) resulted in significantly better skills test performance for e-Learning + hands-on compared to the e-Learning only. Only a structured learning process based on multi-media learning principles and memory research improved procedural skills in relation to operating a medical device.",

    "abstract": "Craft specialties such as surgery endured widespread disruption to postgraduate education and training during the pandemic. Despite the expansive literature on rapid adaptations and innovations, generalisability of these descriptions is limited by scarce use of theory-driven methods. In this research, we explored UK surgical trainees' (n = 46) and consultant surgeons' (trainers, n = 25) perceptions of how learning in clinical environments changed during a time of extreme uncertainty (2020/2021). Our ultimate goal was to identify new ideas that could shape post-pandemic surgical training. We conducted semi-structured virtual interviews with participants from a range of working/training environments across thirteen Health Boards in Scotland. Initial analysis of interview transcripts was inductive. Dynamic capabilities theory (how effectively an organisation uses its resources to respond to environmental changes) and its micro-foundations (sensing, seizing, reconfiguring) were used for subsequent theory-driven analysis. Findings demonstrate that surgical training responded dynamically and adapted to external and internal environmental uncertainty. Sensing threats and opportunities in the clinical environment prompted trainers' institutions to seize new ways of working. Learners gained from reconfigured training opportunities (e.g., splitting operative cases between trainees), pan-surgical working (e.g., broader surgical exposure), redeployment (e.g., to medical specialties), collaborative working (working with new colleagues and in new ways) and supervision (shifting to online supervision). Our data foreground the human resource and structural reconfigurations, and technological innovations that effectively maintained surgical training during the pandemic, albeit in different ways. These adaptations and innovations could provide the foundations for enhancing surgical education and training in the post-pandemic era.",

Some research into the experiences of these new groups of doctors has been performed. However, no previous research into the experiences of psychiatry residents specifically, is known. This qualitative study investigates how psychiatry residents, from these minoritized groups, experience their training regarding inclusion. Inclusion is defined as the degree to which one’s needs for connection and for being valued in one’s uniqueness, is satisfied. In-depth interviews with 16 psychiatry residents were conducted. These interviews were transcribed and coded using MaxQDA software. Initial themes that were constructed, were explored further in subsequent interviews and linked to literature. Finally, the developed themes were ordered in a model conceptualizing inclusion. Participants reported high belongingness within psychiatry training. Their experienced value in uniqueness, however, was generally quite low. Participants reported to experience little interest in and sensitivity for their perspectives and lived experiences from their co-workers. When faced with stigmatization and discrimination, participants reported lack of support from their colleagues. Assimilation was found to be the most frequently used coping strategy in dealing with diversity. Participants seemed to conform to the ‘neutral’ norm and experienced barriers in expressing themselves. Through this mechanism of assimilation, the added value that participants might bring with their unique knowledge and lived experiences was not used, both in patient care and in creating an inclusive climate within the organization. Moreover, assimilation is associated with psychological strain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Clinical supervisors play key roles in facilitating trainee learning. Yet combining that role with patient care complicates both roles. So, we need to know how both roles can effectively co-occur. When facilitating their trainees’ learning through practice, supervisors draw on their skills - clinical and supervisory - and available opportunities in their practice. This process can be conceptualised as supervisory knowing in practice (or contextual knowing) and offers ways to elaborate on how facilitating trainees’ learning can be optimised. The practice-based study presented and discussed here examined clinical supervisors’ knowing in practice related to facilitating trainee learning, across three medical specialities. Nineteen clinical supervisors from emergency medicine, internal medicine and surgery, were interviewed about their roles and engagement with trainees. Interview transcripts were analysed in two stages. Firstly, a framework analysis, informed by interdependent learning theory was conducted, focussing on affordances and individual engagement. Secondly, drawing on practice theory, a further layer of analysis was undertaken interrogating supervisors’ knowing in practice. We identified two common domains of supervisor practice used to facilitate trainee learning: (1) orientating and assessing trainees’ readiness (or capabilities), (2) sequencing and enriching pedagogic practices. Yet across the speciality groups the supervisors’ knowing in practice differed and were shaped by a trio of: (i) disciplinary practices, (ii) situational requirements and (iii) clinician preference. Overall, we offer a new reading of clinical supervision as practice differences generated distinct supervisory knowing in practice. These findings emphasise clinical supervision as fundamentally entwined in the speciality’s practice; and reinforce alignments with patient care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diagnostic errors are a major, largely preventable, patient safety concern. Error interventions cannot feasibly be implemented for every patient that is seen. To identify cases at high risk of error, clinicians should have a good calibration between their perceived and actual accuracy. This experiment studied the impact of feedback on medical interns’ calibration and diagnostic process. In a two-phase experiment, 125 medical interns from Dutch University Medical Centers were randomized to receive no feedback (control), feedback on their accuracy (performance feedback), or feedback with additional information on why a certain diagnosis was correct (information feedback) on 20 chest X-rays they diagnosed in a feedback phase. A test phase immediately followed this phase and had all interns diagnose an additional 10 X-rays without feedback. Outcome measures were confidence–accuracy calibration, diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and time to diagnose. Both feedback types improved overall confidence–accuracy calibration (R 2 No Feedback = 0.05, R 2 Performance Feedback = 0.12, R 2 Information Feedback = 0.19), in line with the individual improvements in diagnostic accuracy and confidence. We also report secondary analyses to examine how case difficulty affected calibration. Time to diagnose did not differ between conditions. Feedback improved interns’ calibration. However, it is unclear whether this improvement reflects better confidence estimates or an improvement in accuracy. Future research should examine more experienced participants and non-visual specialties. Our results suggest that feedback is an effective intervention that could be beneficial as a tool to improve calibration, especially in cases that are not too difficult for learners.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 2019–2021, we engaged in a project aimed at developing, implementing, and evaluating an educational intervention actively involving patient-teachers in undergraduate medical education at Université Laval, Quebec, Canada. Patient-teachers were invited to participate in small group discussion workshops during which medical students deliberate on legal, ethical, and moral issues arising from medical practice. Patients were expected to bring other perspectives, based on their experience with illness and the healthcare system. Little is still known about patients’ perspectives on their participation experience in such context. Informed by critical theory, our qualitative study aims to document,: (i) the motivating factors for patients’ participation in our intervention; and (ii) what patients gained from the experience. Data collection was based on 10 semi-structured interviews with patient-teachers. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Motivators for participation arose from: (i) perceived consistency between patients’ individual characteristics and those of the project, and (ii) conceiving the project as a means to reach individual and social goals. What patients gained mainly refers to (1) the appreciation of a positive, enriching, motivating yet uncomfortable and destabilizing experience; (2) a deconstruction of biases against the medical field and critical thinking about their own experience; (3) new knowledge, with a potential impact on their future interactions with the healthcare system. Results reveal patients as non-neutral thinking and knowing subjects, engaged in the participation experience as active teachers and learners. They also highlight the empowering and emancipatory nature of the learning gained through patients’ participation experience. These conclusions prompt us to promote transformative interventional approaches that question the pervasive power issues in medical teaching and value patients’ specific knowledge in teaching and learning the Art of Medicine.",

    "abstract": "Preparing novice physicians for an unknown clinical future in healthcare is challenging. This is especially true for emergency departments (EDs) where the framework of adaptive expertise has gained traction. When medical graduates start residency in the ED, they must be supported in becoming adaptive experts. However, little is known about how residents can be supported in developing this adaptive expertise. This was a cognitive ethnographic study conducted at two Danish EDs. The data comprised 80 h of observations of 27 residents treating 32 geriatric patients. The purpose of this cognitive ethnographic study was to describe contextual factors that mediate how residents engage in adaptive practices when treating geriatric patients in the ED. Results showed that all residents fluidly engaged in both adaptive and routine practices, but they were challenged when engaging in adaptive practices in the face of uncertainty. Uncertainty was often observed when residents’ workflows were disrupted. Furthermore, results highlighted how residents construed professional identity and how this affected their ability to shift between routine and adaptive practices. Residents reported that they thought that they were expected to perform on par with their more experienced physician colleagues. This negatively impacted their ability to tolerate uncertainty and hindered the performance of adaptive practices. Thus, aligning clinical uncertainty with the premises of clinical work, is imperative for residents to develop adaptive expertise.",

This study sought to reach a consensus on the attributes and competencies that are viewed as essential and important for working effectively as an early career doctor in rural and remote practice in Indonesia. A two-round Delphi study was conducted by reference to 27 consenting physicians working in rural and remote Indonesia. Forty-three items covering 9 attributes and 34 competencies were sent to these physicians to be rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 in terms of their importance for effective rural and remote practice. Nine attributes and 29 competencies progressed to Round 2. All nine attributes and 29 competencies were identified as essential or important for junior physicians’ ability to be effective in their practice. The essential attributes included professional quality related to prioritising the rural community. The essential competencies included medical skills, professional behaviour, interprofessional skills, health promotion and connection to the rural community. The consensus thus reached on these essential and important attributes and competencies can inform curriculum development for the undergraduate and postgraduate training of junior rural and remote physicians.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Teaching equitable clinical practice is of critical importance, yet how best to do so remains unknown. Educators utilize implementation science frameworks to disseminate clinical evidence-based practices (EBP). The Health Equity Implementation Framework (HEIF) is one of these frameworks, and it delineates how health equity may be concomitantly assessed and addressed in planning the implementation of an EBP. The HEIF therefore lays a strong foundation to understand and explain barriers and facilitators to implementation through an equity lens, making it well-suited for use by medical educators. Three equity-focused frames of reference within the model include (1) the clinical encounter, (2) societal context, and (3) culturally relevant factors, herein referred to as domains. The HEIF provides a structure for prospective and retrospective assessment of how EBP are taught and ultimately incorporated into clinical practice by trainees, with specific attention to delivering equitable care. We present three examples of common topics in internal medicine, contextualized by the three equity domains of the HEIF. We additionally acknowledge the limitations of this framework as a research tool with complex features that may not be suitable for brief teaching in the clinical environment. We propose a 360-degree learner assessment to ensure implementation of this framework is successful. By encouraging trainees to explore the narrative experiences of their patients and examine their own implicit biases, the HEIF provides a structure to address gaps in knowledge about delivering equitable care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Perfectionism is a personality orientation associated with mental health and adjustment problems. Recent evidence demonstrates that perfectionism is widespread among students and on the rise, with recent generations of students placing increasingly more importance on perfection. Whilst the extant literature is vast, it tends to focus on psychopathology and identification of perfectionism correlates rather than the experience of student perfectionism. Furthermore, the education literature is scant and there is a need to understand the deeper processes and nuances of perfectionism, particularly within health professions education where intense study demands, competition to gain entry to educational programmes, and professional cultures may nurture the problem. This phenomenological study explored the lived experiences of ten physiotherapy students as they wrestled with perfectionism in the various facets of their studies. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken, and participants completed log sheets to document perfectionism-related experiences. Idiographic profiles were composed and interview transcripts were analysed, drawing upon features of both phenomenological and thematic analysis. Perfectionism was found to have toxic consequences for the learning experience. Harmful phenomenological experiences included perpetual and excessive achievement striving, punitive self-criticism and health and wellbeing difficulties. A range of sabotaging learning behaviours such as self-handicapping and feedback avoidance was also illuminated, and cultural and organisational influences perceived to foster perfectionism emerged. Findings are discussed in relation to underlying processes and implications for educators. The prospect of findings transferring to other educational contexts is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Even though past research suggests that visual learning may benefit from conceptual knowledge, current interventions for medical image evaluation often focus on procedural knowledge, mainly by teaching classification algorithms. We compared the efficacy of pure procedural knowledge (three-point checklist for evaluating skin lesions) versus combined procedural plus conceptual knowledge (histological explanations for each of the three points). All students then trained their classification skills with a visual learning resource that included images of two types of pigmented skin lesions: benign nevi and malignant melanomas. Both treatments produced significant and long-lasting effects on diagnostic accuracy in transfer tasks. However, only students in the combined procedural plus conceptual knowledge condition significantly improved their diagnostic performance in classifying lesions they had seen before in the pre- and post-tests. Findings suggest that the provision of additional conceptual knowledge supported error correction mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Recruitment to General Practice (GP) is currently low in many countries. Here we focus on two binary choices for junior doctors: first, whether to apply to GP; second, whether to accept a GP training place if offered. Previous attitudinal studies have indicated factors claimed to affect recruitment. The current study goes further by quantifying the relative impact of different factors on the propensity of candidates to apply to GP and accept a training place. An online questionnaire was sent to candidates applying to United Kingdom (UK) specialty training in 2015. Descriptive statistics and a path analysis evaluated the importance of various factors on GP applications. Our results were synthesised with an analysis of data from the online applications portal. With 3838 candidates responding to the survey, the path analysis showed that personality and previous GP experiences were strongly associated with the decision to apply. There was some evidence that it was easier to enter GP than other specialties; in terms of deciding whether to accept, the evidence suggests GP was a backup plan for around 9% of candidates who accepted a GP post. Our results indicate that recruitment initiatives should focus on candidates who apply to GP but not as first choice or consider GP but do not apply, particularly by providing substantial experience of GP and accentuating the positives of the specialty such as work-life balance and the intellectual challenge of working with patients in primary care. Acceptance of a GP place may also depend on competition for places in other specialties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Undergraduate clinical assessors make expert, multifaceted judgements of consultation skills in concert with medical school OSCE grading rubrics. Assessors are not cognitive machines: their judgements are made in the light of prior experience and social interactions with students. It is important to understand assessors’ working conceptualisations of consultation skills and whether they could be used to develop assessment tools for undergraduate assessment. To identify any working conceptualisations that assessors use while assessing undergraduate medical students’ consultation skills and develop assessment tools based on assessors’ working conceptualisations and natural language for undergraduate consultation skills. In semi-structured interviews, 12 experienced assessors from a UK medical school populated a blank assessment scale with personally meaningful descriptors while describing how they made judgements of students’ consultation skills (at exit standard). A two-step iterative thematic framework analysis was performed drawing on constructionism and interactionism. Five domains were found within working conceptualisations of consultation skills: Application of knowledge; Manner with patients; Getting it done; Safety; and Overall impression. Three mechanisms of judgement about student behaviour were identified: observations, inferences and feelings. Assessment tools drawing on participants’ conceptualisations and natural language were generated, including ‘grade descriptors’ for common conceptualisations in each domain by mechanism of judgement and matched to grading rubrics of Fail, Borderline, Pass, Very good. Utilising working conceptualisations to develop assessment tools is feasible and potentially useful. Work is needed to test impact on assessment quality.",

    "abstract": "Medical schools worldwide undertake widening access (WA) initiatives (e.g. pipeline, outreach and academic enrichment programmes) to support pupils from high schools which do not traditionally send high numbers of applicants to medicine. UK literature indicates that pupils in these schools feel that their teachers are ill-equipped, cautious or even discouraging towards their aspiration and/or application to medicine. This study aimed to explore teachers' perspectives and practices to include their voice in discussions and consider how medical schools might best engage with them to facilitate WA. Interviews were conducted with high school teachers in three UK regions, working in schools targeted by WA initiatives. Data were analysed thematically using template analysis, using a largely data-driven approach. Findings showed that although medicine was largely seen as a prestigious and worthwhile career, teachers held reservations about advocating this above other choices. Teachers saw it as their role to encourage pupils to educate themselves about medicine, but to ultimately allow pupils to make their own decisions. Their attitudes were influenced by material constraints in their schools, and the perception of daunting, long and emotionally difficult admissions requirements, with low chances of success. Medical schools may wish to work with teachers to understand their hesitations and help them develop the mindset required to advocate a challenging and unfamiliar career, emphasising that this encouragement can further the shared goal of empowering and preparing pupils to feel capable of choosing medicine. Reciprocally, medical schools should ensure pupils have fair opportunities for access, should they choose to apply.",

    "abstract": "Variation in examiner stringency is an ongoing problem in many performance settings such as in OSCEs, and usually is conceptualised and measured based on scores/grades examiners award. Under borderline regression, the standard within a station is set using checklist/domain scores and global grades acting in combination. This complexity requires a more nuanced view of what stringency might mean when considering sources of variation of cut-scores in stations. This study uses data from 349 administrations of an 18-station, 36 candidate single circuit OSCE for international medical graduates wanting to practice in the UK (PLAB2). The station-level data was gathered over a 34-month period up to July 2019. Linear mixed models are used to estimate and then separate out examiner (n = 547), station (n = 330) and examination (n = 349) effects on borderline regression cut-scores. Examiners are the largest source of variation in cut-scores accounting for 56% of variance in cut-scores, compared to 6% for stations, < 1% for exam and 37% residual. Aggregating to the exam level tends to ameliorate this effect. For 96% of examinations, a 'fair' cut-score, equalising out variation in examiner stringency that candidates experience, is within one standard error of measurement (SEM) of the actual cut-score. The addition of the SEM to produce the final pass mark generally ensures the public is protected from almost all false positives in the examination caused by examiner cut-score stringency acting in candidates' favour.",

We studied whether there really is a measurable performance improvement when students are assessed over an extended period of time and how this improvement affects the reliability of the overall judgement. In-training assessment results were obtained from 104 students on rotation at our university hospital or at one of the six affiliated hospitals. Generalisability theory was used in combination with multilevel analysis to obtain reliability coefficients and to estimate the number of assessments needed for reliable overall judgement, both including and excluding performance improvement. Students' clinical performance ratings improved significantly from a mean of 7.6 at the start to a mean of 7.8 at the end of their clerkship. When taking performance improvement into account, reliability coefficients were higher. The number of assessments needed to achieve a reliability of 0.80 or higher decreased from 17 to 11. Therefore, when studying reliability of in-training assessment, performance improvement should be considered.",

    "abstract": "The current study used theories on expertise development (the holistic model of image perception and the information reduction hypothesis) as a starting point to identify and explore potentially relevant process measures to monitor and evaluate expertise development in radiology residency training. It is the first to examine expertise development in volumetric image interpretation (i.e., CT scans) within radiology residents using scroll data collected longitudinally over five years of residency training. Consistent with the holistic model of image perception, the percentage of time spent on full runs, i.e. scrolling through more than 50% of the CT-scan slices (global search), decreased within residents over residency training years. Furthermore, the percentage of time spent on question-relevant areas in the CT scans increased within residents over residency training years, consistent with the information reduction hypothesis. Second, we examined if scroll patterns can predict diagnostic accuracy. The percentage of time spent on full runs and the percentage of time spent on question-relevant areas did not predict diagnostic accuracy. Thus, although scroll patterns over training years are consistent with visual expertise theories, they could not be used as predictors of diagnostic accuracy in the current study. Therefore, the relation between scroll patterns and performance needs to be further examined, before process measures can be used to monitor and evaluate expertise development in radiology residency training.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Threshold concepts (TCs) are increasingly used in health professions education (HPE) research. TCs are claimed to be conceptual gateways which are often traversed with substantial difficulty. In this paper, we report on a scoping review investigating the following research question: What is the scope and nature of the currently available research on threshold concepts in health professions education literature? We employed Arksey and O’Malley’s model for scoping reviews. A search for literature on TCs in HPE research between 2003 and 2020 yielded 999 records of which 59 were included in the review. The data set was subject to quantitative descriptive analysis of article characteristics as well as qualitative thematic analysis of the scope of research on TCs. Among the 59 articles selected for review, there were 30 empirical, 26 conceptual and three reviews. A majority were published in 2015 or later. Almost half of the included articles attempted to identify possible TCs within HPE. Others investigated how TCs can be traversed or suggested how TCs could influence curriculum design. Some critically appraised the framework of TC. Although TCs are increasingly utilised in HPE, the present review identified how researchers came across methodological challenges related to identifying possible TCs and definitional challenges around identifying the essential characteristics of TCs. Before embracing TCs as the next go-to theory for learning in HPE, we acknowledge the need for methodological stringeny and rigour as well as more data to support TCs. Until then, any implementation of TCs in HPE curricula should be done cautiously.",

    "abstract": "The pedagogy underpinning clinical psychology training is often reliant upon the acquisition and transmission of knowledge and the practice of skills. The dominant paradigm in the training of clinical psychologists emphasises competence-based training drawing upon a scientist practitioner model of practice, often underpinned by knowledge of evidence-based interventions. Little has changed over the past 40 years. Training is predicated upon the assumption that effective therapy is attributed to the therapist's skills to implement specific therapeutic processes and her or his capacity to form an effective working alliance with the client or patient. We provide an argument for an alternative paradigm in which ecological principles are privileged with a view to enhancing clinical training of psychologists in health settings responsive to the trainee as well as the broader societal context in which they practice, by adopting a pedagogy which prioritizes the relationship between the person and the environment. The proposed approach brings an ecological set of assumptions to the learning experience in clinical contexts. Key principles, drawn from an ecological perspective includes: affordances, the emergence of self-organisation in clinical learning, constraints and rate limiters. The approach is supported by examples applied to clinical learning contexts. Implications for clinical training are discussed. The ways in which an ecological approach may contribute to more effective learning outcomes through the use of representative learning contexts may inform learning design, how learning is actioned in clinical psychology as well as future research on the pedagogy of clinical training.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of first impression is well researched in social psychology, but less so in the study of OSCEs and the multiple mini interview (MMI). To explore its bearing on the MMI method we included a rating of first impression in the MMI for student selection executed 2012 at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany (196 applicants, 26 pairs of raters) and analyzed how it was related to MMI performance ratings made by (a) the same rater, and (b) a different rater. First impression was assessed immediately after an applicant entered the test room. Each MMI-task took 5 min and was rated subsequently. Internal consistency was α = .71 for first impression and α = .69 for MMI performance. First impression and MMI performance correlated by r = .49. Both measures weakly predicted performance in two OSCEs for communication skills, assessed 18 months later. MMI performance did not increment prediction above the contribution of first impression and vice versa. Prediction was independent of whether or not the rater who rated first impression also rated MMI performance. The correlation between first impression and MMI-performance is in line with the results of corresponding social psychological studies, showing that judgements based on minimal information moderately predict behavioral measures. It is also in accordance with the notion that raters often blend their specific assessment task outlined in MMI-instructions with the self-imposed question of whether a candidate would fit the role of a medical doctor.",

    "abstract": "Whilst adaptive experts have well-researched beliefs and attitudes towards learning, what is unclear are the interactions that occur within the learning environment that constitute their learning experiences. The practice of geriatric medicine emphasises the interdisciplinary care of complex frail older adults. Our study sets out to understand the learning experiences of adaptive experts in geriatric medicine by examining how interactions at the intra-personal, inter-personal and organisational levels contributed to the development of adaptive expertise. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study through semi-structured interviews of 16 geriatricians experts from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Data were analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis. The core essence of the learning experiences was described as a journey of 'knowing when we do not know', which was characterised by three themes: (i) Anchoring ethos of person-centric care where the experts drew upon their values to develop a holistic view of the patient beyond the medical domain, (ii) Enabling stance of being curious where their curiosity and openness to learning was nurtured through the practice of reflection, and with the benefit of time as a commodity and for development of expertise, and (iii) Scaffolding organisational culture of inquiry where an environment that is supportive of learning is built on the culture of psychological safety and the culture of mentoring. Taken together, our study highlighted the importance of interactions at the intra-personal, inter-personal and organisational levels in the learning experiences of adaptive experts.",

Data collection included semi-structured interviews with students who participated in an optional course focused on these topics. We analyzed their motivations, goals, and interests using reflexive thematic analysis and created three themes based on students’ responses. Theme (1) “pre-existing conditions” focuses on students’ knowledge, beliefs, worldviews and experience prior to the class. Theme (2) “enacting change” examines their desires to become effective physicians and improve medicine overall. Theme (3) “creating community” considers their preferences for a supportive and connected learning and social environment. We discuss the findings within the context of adult learning theory and Self-Determination Theory. The research provides insight about the overt and underlying factors that drive medical students’ participation in training focused on social inequality. We also share recommendations for curriculum development and future research based on the patterns we found in students’ discussions of their needs and expectations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the increasing implementation of formative assessment in medical education, its’ effect on learning behaviour remains questionable. This effect may depend on how students value formative, and summative assessments differently. Informed by Expectancy Value Theory, we compared test preparation, feedback use, and test-taking motivation of medical students who either took a purely formative progress test ( formative PT-group) or a progress test that yielded study credits ( summative PT-group). In a mixed-methods study design, we triangulated quantitative questionnaire data ( n = 264), logging data of an online PT feedback system ( n = 618), and qualitative interview data ( n = 21) to compare feedback use, and test-taking motivation between the formative PT-group ( n = 316), and the summative PT-group ( n = 302). Self-reported, and actual feedback consultation was higher in the summative PT-group. Test preparation, and active feedback use were relatively low and similar in both groups. Both quantitative, and qualitative results showed that the motivation to prepare and consult feedback relates to how students value the assessment. In the interview data, a link could be made with goal orientation theory, as performance-oriented students perceived the formative PT as not important due to the lack of study credits. This led to low test-taking effort, and feedback consultation after the formative PT. In contrast, learning-oriented students valued the formative PT, and used it for self-study or self-assessment to gain feedback. Our results indicate that most students are less motivated to put effort in the test, and use feedback when there are no direct consequences. A supportive assessment environment that emphasizes recognition of the value of formative testing is required to motivate students to use feedback for learning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Adaptive teacher support fosters effective learning in one-to-one teaching sessions, which are a common way of learning complex visual tasks in the health sciences. Adaptive support is tailored to student needs, and this is difficult in complex visual tasks as visual problem-solving processes are covert and thus cannot be directly observed by the teacher. Eye-tracking apparatus can measure covert processes and make them visible in gaze displays: visualizations of where a student looks while executing a task. We investigate whether live dynamic gaze displays help teachers in being more adaptive to students’ needs when teaching optical coherence tomography interpretation in one-to-one teaching sessions and whether this fosters learning. Forty-nine students and 10 teachers participated in a one-to-one teaching session in clinical optometry. In the control condition, teachers saw the learning task of the student and could discuss it with them, whereas in the gaze-display condition, teachers could additionally see where the student looked. After the 15-minute teaching session, a test was administered to examine achievement. Furthermore, students filled in the ‘questionnaire on teacher support adaptivity’, and teachers rated how adaptive their support was. Bayesian analyses provide some initial evidence that students did not experience support to be more adaptive in the gaze-display condition versus the control condition, nor were their post-test scores higher. Teachers rated their provided support as being more adaptive in the gaze-display versus the control condition. Further research could investigate if live dynamic gaze displays impact adaptive teaching when used over longer periods or with more teacher training.",

Despite numerous studies exploring the perception of healthcare professional students (HCPS) of their LE, the validity evidence of the utilized questionnaires remains unclear. This scoping review aimed to identify questionnaires used to examine the perception of undergraduate HCPS of their LE and to assess their validity evidence. Five key concepts were used: (1) higher education; (2) questionnaire; (3) LE; (4) perception; and (5) health professions (HP). PubMed, ERIC, ProQuest, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies developing or adapting questionnaires to examine LE. This review employed the APERA standards of validity evidence and Beckman et al. (J Gen Intern Med 20:1159-1164, 2005) interpretation of these standards according to 5 categories: content, internal structure, response process, relation to other variables, and consequences. Out of 41 questionnaires included in this review, the analysis revealed a predominant emphasis on content and internal structure categories. However, less than 10% of the included questionnaires provided information in relation to other variables, consequences, and response process categories. Most of the identified questionnaires received extensive coverage in the fields of medicine and nursing, followed by dentistry. This review identified diverse questionnaires utilized for examining the perception of students of their LE across different HPs. Given the limited validity evidence for existing questionnaires, future research should prioritize the development and validation of psychometric measures. This will ultimately ensure sound and evidence-based quality improvement measures of the LE in HP education programs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Health professional learners are increasingly called to learn about health inequity to reduce inequities and improve patient care and health outcomes. Anti-oppression pedagogy (AOP) addresses the need for health professional learners to understand multiple health inequities and the structures and systems that produce inequities. However, the inclusion of AOP in health professions education varies and there is a lack of clarity in its conceptualization and integration. A scoping review was conducted to address this gap and to understand how AOP is conceptualized and integrated in health professions education. Thirty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles demonstrated that AOP is not commonly utilized terminology within health professions education. When AOP is integrated, it is not consistently conceptualized but is generally viewed as a broad concept that focuses on antiracism; decoloniality; intersectionality; and supporting learners to understand, critically reflect on, and act against structural and systemic forms of oppressions. In addition, there is variation in the integration of AOP in health professions education with the most common methods consisting of discussions, cases, reflection, learning through lived experiences, and the incorporation of humanities within a longitudinal curriculum. The results of this scoping review highlight the need for health professions education to develop one clear concept that educators use when teaching about anti-oppression, which may reduce working in silos and allow educators to better collaborate with each other in advancing this work. In addition, this review suggests that health professional programs should consider incorporating AOP in curricula with a broad and longitudinal approach utilizing the common methods of delivery. To better support programs in including AOP in curricula, further research is required to emphasize the benefits, provide clarity on its conceptualization, and determine the most effective methods of integration.",

Rural physicians are expected to have similar underrepresented aspects as minority physicians because of their specific sociocultural contexts and consequent private–professional intersection, which lead to ethical complexities. Therefore, to bridge this research gap, we interviewed 12 early- to mid-career Japanese physicians working in rural areas and explored their experiences. Through a narrative analysis guided by Figured Worlds theory, we analysed the data by focusing on the vocabulary, expressions, and metaphors participants used to describe their experiences. A central theme emerged concerning how the rural physicians configurated their personal versus professional participation in their local communities. Further, their identity narratives varied regarding how they constructed their identities, rural communities, and relationships as well as their identity formation ideals and strategies to achieve them. Informed by ‘Big Questions’ concerning worldview framework, we delineated four identity narratives as prototypes to describe how they participated in their communities. These identity narratives provide a preliminary understanding of how diverse identity formation is for rural physicians. In addition, our findings exposed the current professional identity formation framework as potentially biased towards single forms of participation in monolithic communities, overlooking complicated forms of participation in multiple communities. We argue that applying frameworks and concepts to capture these multiple forms of participation as well as revisiting the ‘discourse of integration’ are necessary steps to overcome the limitation of the current understanding of professional identity formation.",

Collaboration among GP-HPE researchers is crucial but challenging. Formulating a research agenda, involving stakeholders, and fostering inter-institutional collaboration can address these challenges and connect educational research and practice. Methods We used Q-methodology to explore perspectives on GP-HPE research of participants from all Dutch postgraduate GP training institutes. Participants individually sorted statements based on the relevance of future GP-HPE research for educational practice. Data analysis comprised inverted factor analysis, rotation, and qualitative interpretation of configurations of all statements. The National Meeting on Educational Research took a participatory approach. Results We included 73 participants with diverse involvement in GP-HPE research. We identified five distinct perspectives, each representing a research focus area for developing and innovating GP education: the clinician scientist, the socially engaged GP, the specific GP identity, the GP as an entrepreneur, and the GP engaged in lifelong learning. Discussion The resulting five perspectives align with General Practice hallmarks. Q-methodology and a participatory approach facilitated collaboration among stakeholders. Successful inter-institutional collaboration requires a common goal, neutral leadership, participant commitment, regular meetings, audit trail support, process transparency, and reflexivity. Future research should address evidence gaps within these perspectives. Conclusion Using Q-methodology turned out to be valuable for compiling a national research agenda for GP-HPE research. The research process helped to cross boundaries between researchers in different institutions, thus putting inter-institutional collaborative advantage center stage. Our approach could provide a conceivable procedure for HPE researchers worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In many contexts, responsibility for exit-level assessment design and implementation in undergraduate medical programmes lies with individuals who convene clinical clerkships. Their assessment practice has significant consequences for students’ learning and the patients and communities that graduates will serve. Interventions to enhance assessment must involve these assessors, yet little is known about factors influencing their assessment practice. The purpose of this study was to explore factors that influence assessment practice of clerkship convenors in three varied low-and-middle income contexts in the global South. Taking assessment practice as a behaviour, Health Behaviour Theory (HBT) was deployed as a theoretical framework to explore, describe and explain assessor behaviour. Thirty-one clinician-educators responsible for designing and implementing high-stakes clerkship assessment were interviewed in South Africa and Mexico. Interacting personal and contextual factors influencing clinician-educator assessment intention and action were identified. These included attitude, influenced by impact and response appraisal, and perceived self-efficacy; along with interpersonal, physical and organisational, and distal contextual factors. Personal competencies and conducive environments supported intention to action transition. While previous research has typically explored factors in isolation, the HBT framing enabled a systematic and coherent account of assessor behaviour. These findings add a particular contextual perspective to understanding assessment practice, yet also resonate with and extend existing work that predominantly emanates from high-income contexts in the global North. These findings provide a foundation for the planning of assessment change initiatives, such as targeted, multi-factorial faculty development.",

Drawing on Basic Psychological Needs Theory, consultants’ supervision styles are likely to affect junior doctors’ intrinsic motivation differently in terms of psychological need frustration and psychological need satisfaction. To examine the effects of (de)motivating supervision styles, we conducted two experimental vignette studies among junior doctors. In Study 1 ( N = 150, 73.3% female), we used a 2 (need support: high vs. low ) x 2 (directiveness: high vs. low ) between -subjects design and, in Study 2, a within -subjects design with the same factors ( N = 46, 71.7% female). Both studies revealed a consistent positive effect of need-supportive supervision styles on psychological need satisfaction (+), need frustration (-), and intrinsic motivation (+). Particularly in Study 2, the main effect of need-supportive styles was strengthened by supervisor’s directiveness. Moreover, in both studies, the effects of supervision styles on intrinsic motivation were explained through psychological need frustration and psychological need satisfaction. We discuss the implications of these findings for postgraduate clinical training.",

To better inform teaching and student support, this study aims to gain insights from summative assessments through profiling students’ performance patterns and identify those students missing the basic knowledge and skills in medical specialities essential for their future career. We use Latent Profile Analysis to classify a senior undergraduate year group ( n = 295) based on their performance in applied knowledge test (AKT) and OSCE, in which items and stations are pre-classified across five specialities (e.g. Acute and Critical Care, Paediatrics,…). Four distinct groups of students with increasing average performance levels in the AKT, and three such groups in the OSCE are identified. Overall, these two classifications are positively correlated. However, some students do well in one assessment format but not in the other. Importantly, in both the AKT and the OSCE there is a mixed group containing students who have met the required standard to pass, and those who have not. This suggests that a conception of a borderline group at the exam-level can be overly simplistic. There is little literature relating AKT and OSCE performance in this way, and the paper discusses how our analysis gives placement tutors key insights into providing tailored support for distinct student groups needing remediation. It also gives additional information to assessment writers about the performance and difficulty of their assessment items/stations, and to wider faculty about student overall performance and across specialities.",

    "abstract": "Simulation-based learning (SBL) is an important component in health professions education and serves as effective preparation or a substitution for clinical placements. Despite their widely accepted benefits, students from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds may not experience the same learning outcomes from engaging in SBL as their local peers due to complex factors. Supporting students from CALD backgrounds in SBL is vital, not only to optimise their learning experiences and outcomes, but also ensure inclusive health professions education. While the literature on the participation of students from CALD backgrounds in SBL activities is emerging, this scoping review was conducted to (1) map the evidence on how SBL impacts the learning outcomes of health professions students from CALD backgrounds; and (2) understand how students from CALD backgrounds perceive their SBL experiences. Following Arskey and O'Malley's framework and Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews, a search was conducted in January 2024 using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, and ERIC. Ten papers met the inclusion criteria. This review highlighted three themes: (1) diverse learning outcomes of SBL; (2) facing linguistic and cultural challenges that are inherent to SBL; and (3) preparation, reflection, and support to actively participate in SBL activities. This review indicates that SBL could enhance clinical skills and confidence in students from CALD backgrounds. However, well-designed SBL activities to meet the learning needs of students from CALD backgrounds are currently lacking and further research across broader health professions fields is needed.",

    "abstract": "The presence of digital technologies in clinical learning environments is increasing. However, there is little research into how technologies influence the interplay between touch and the acquisition of physical examination skills by health professional students. In this study, we aimed to explore how digital technologies feature in clinical educators' accounts of current physical examination teaching in practice. A qualitative interpretive design was used. Data was collected via in-depth interviews with 18 clinical educators from the disciplines of medicine, physiotherapy, midwifery, and nursing to investigate the current perspectives and practices used in teaching physical examination. We interpreted three themes within the data: Polarised perspectives of digital technology use in physical examination teaching, the integration of digital technologies into the teaching of physical examination, and the invisibility of digital technologies in physical examination teaching. Digital technologies have been extensively integrated into the teaching of physical examination. However, the perceptions of the participating clinical educators have not evolved at the same pace. We suggest that clinical educators re-examine their assumptions and attune themselves to the dynamic relationship between hands-on skills and digital tools.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Doctor-patient communication is a core competency in medical education, which requires learners to adapt their communication flexibly to each clinical encounter. Although conceptual learning models exist, information about how skilled communication develops over time is scant. This study aims to unpack this process of communication learning and to identify its facilitators. We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study employing a constructivist grounded theory approach in a General Practice training setting. Over a 6-month period, we closely monitored 8 first-year and 5 third-year trainees (n = 13) by means of clinical observations, stimulated recall interviews and audio diaries. In an iterative process of data collection and analysis, we triangulated these sources across trainees (horizontal analysis) and over time (vertical analysis) to identify how themes evolved. This analysis led us to the construction of a six-stage cyclic conceptual model during which trainees: (1) have an impactful experience; (2) become aware of own communication; (3) look for alternative communication behaviours; (4) experiment with new behaviours; (5) evaluate the effectiveness; and (6) internalise the new communication behaviours. Additionally, conditions were found to support learning and reflection. Becoming a skilled communicator seems to require a continuous approach, with repeated practice and reflection to adapt and internalise communication in the clinical encounter. Consequently, we recommend that trainees be supported with tailored feedback to strengthen their communication repertoire. Ideally, they should be guided by supervisors who serve as coaches in a safe learning environment with regular, planned learning activities.",

    "abstract": "There is growing concern about a potential decline in empathy among medical students over time. Despite the importance of empathy toward patients in medicine, it remains unclear the nature of the changes in empathy among medical students. Thus, we systematically investigated affective and cognitive empathy for patients among medical students using neuroscientific approach. Nineteen medical students who completed their fifth-year medical curriculum and 23 age- and sex-matched nonmedical students participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Inside a brain scanner, all participants read empathy-eliciting scenarios while adopting either the patient or doctor perspective. Brain activation and self-reported ratings during the experience of empathy were obtained. Behavioral results indicated that all participants reported greater emotional negativity and empathic concern in association with the patient perspective condition than with the doctor perspective condition. Functional brain imaging results indicated that neural activity in the posterior superior temporal region implicated in goal-relevant attention reorienting was overall increased under the patient perspective than the doctor perspective condition. Relative to nonmedical students, medical students showed decreased activity in the temporoparietal region implicated in mentalizing under the patient perspective versus doctor perspective condition. Notably, this same region showed increased activity under the doctor versus patient condition in medical students relative to nonmedical students. This study is among the first to investigate the neural mechanisms of empathy among medical students and the current findings point to the cognitive empathy system as the locus of the primary brain differences associated with empathy toward patients.",

This study investigated the effects of item disclosure on the medical licensing examination (MLE), examining test taker performance, psychometric characteristics, and factors affecting pass rates. This paper analyzed examinee performance data (n = 20,455) from 41 medical schools who took the MLE before (2009-2011) and after (2012-2014) the item disclosure policy (5548 total items). Changes in passing rates, performance of examinee, difficulty and reliability of the test, and factors affecting pass rate of the medical licensing examination before and after item disclosure were analyzed. In order to identify changes caused by item disclosure in the effects of student and school variables on the passing rate of MLE, Binary Logistic Hierarchical Linear Model was used. There was no significant change in pass rates before and after item disclosure. There was a modest increase in the proportion of test takers in the high-scoring group, following item disclosure. Degree completion status, gender, age of applicants and school mean were significant factors affecting pass rates, regardless of item disclosure. There was no difference between passing rates before and after item disclosure with respect to student- and school-level variables. Despite potential concerns for changes in test and examinee characteristics, empirical findings indicate that there was no significant difference caused by implementing item disclosure.",

    "abstract": "Conferences enable rapid information sharing and networking that are vital to career development within academic communities. Addressing diverse attendee needs is challenging and getting it wrong wastes resources and dampens enthusiasm for the field. This study explores whether, and how, motivations for attendance can be grouped in relation to preferences to offer guidance to organizers and attendees. A pragmatic constructivist case study approach using mixed methods was adopted. Semi-structured interviews completed with key informants underwent thematic analysis. Survey results outlining attendees' perspectives underwent cluster and factor analysis. Stakeholder interviews (n = 13) suggested attendees could be grouped by motivations predictable from level of specialisation in a field and past engagement with conferences. From n = 1229 returned questionnaires, motivations were clustered into three factors: learning, personal and social. Three groups of attendees were identified. Group 1 (n = 500; 40.7%) was motivated by all factors. Group 2 (n = 345; 28.1%) was mainly motivated by the learning factor. Group 3 (n = 188; 15.3%) scored the social factor highest for in-person conferences and the learning factor highest for virtual meetings. All three groups expressed a preference for hybrid conferences in the future. This study indicates that medical conference attendees can be clustered based on their learning, personal and social motivations for attendance. The taxonomy enables organizers to tailor conference formats with guidance on how to utilize hybrid conferences, thereby enabling better catering to attendees' desires for knowledge gain relative to networking.",

    "abstract": "We analyse interactions between teachers and students during video-recorded bedside teaching sessions in internal medicine, orthopaedics and neurology. Multiple raters used a high-inference categorical scheme on 36 sessions. Our research questions concern the types of student mistakes, clinical teachers' reactions to them and if they use different strategies to address different types of mistakes. We used a Poisson model and generalized mixed models to analyse these research questions. Most frequently, students made reproduction mistakes. Relatively high rates of rejection and a similar prevalence of low and high levels of elaboration and correction time for students were observed. Reproduction mistakes were associated with the highest level of rejection and the lowest level of elaboration. High levels of elaboration were observed when students were applying skills in new situations. Students were most often allowed time to correct when mistakes in the areas of analysis or application of skills and knowledge had occurred. There is a decrease in the rate of making mistakes for neurology and orthopaedics compared to internal medicine. Reproduction mistakes influence significantly the outcome feedback compared to application mistakes. Analytic and reproduction mistakes influence elaboration significantly compared to application mistakes. We found a significant effect whether the lecturer allows time for correction of reproduction mistakes compared to application mistakes. These results contribute to the understanding of interactive, patient-centred clinical teaching as well as student mistakes and how teachers are reacting to them. Our descriptive findings provide an empirical basis for clinical teachers to react to student mistakes in didactically fruitful ways.",

Learning theory underpins Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) as a means of safe transition to independent practice. Regulators mandate senior assistantships to improve practice readiness. It is important to know whether meaningful EPAs occur in assistantships, and with what impact. Final year students at one UK medical school kept learning logs and audio-diaries for six one-week periods during a year-long assistantship. Further data were also obtained through interviewing participants when students and after three months as junior doctors. This was combined with data from new doctors from 17 other UK schools. Realist methods explored what worked for whom and why. 32 medical students and 70 junior doctors participated. All assistantship students reported engaging with EPAs but gaps in the types of EPAs undertaken exist, with level of entrustment and frequency of access depending on the context. Engagement is enhanced by integration into the team and shared understanding of what constitutes legitimate activities. Improving the shared understanding between student and supervisor of what constitutes important assistantship activity may result in an increase in the amount and/or quality of EPAs achieved.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Empathy in healthcare professionals is associated with better treatment outcomes and higher satisfaction among patients with chronic pain. Activity patterns play an essential role in the adjustment of these patients and, as a pain behaviour, may have a communicative function and elicit distinct empathic responses. This study investigated whether the activity pattern profiles characteristic of these patients had differential effects on the empathic response (empathic distress and compassion/sympathy) of future healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals should improve their knowledge about the role of different activity patterns in the well-being of people with chronic pain and receive specific training in empathic skills. We controlled for several variables that could affect the empathic response (sex, age, academic degree, previous experience of chronic pain, and dispositional empathy). A total of 228 undergraduates performed an experimental task using vignettes depicting four activity pattern profiles displayed by people with chronic pain and completed questionnaires measuring dispositional and situational empathy. We conducted a MANCOVA analysis. Undergraduates showed more compassion/sympathy toward the medium cycler profile than toward the doer profile. Participants’ age was associated with empathic distress. Sex, academic degree, and previous experiences with chronic pain were not associated with their empathic response to the vignettes. Dispositional perspective-taking and empathic concern were significantly associated with compassion/sympathy responses, and personal distress was significantly associated with empathic distress. Activity pattern profiles may have a communicative function and elicit different empathic responses toward people with chronic pain. Individual differences in dispositional empathy play an important role on situational empathic responses.",

Proper guidance of the visual problem solving of apprentices by the master is necessary. Interaction and adaptation to the expertise level of the learner are identified as key ingredients of this guidance. This study focuses on the effect of increased participation of the learner in the task on the interaction and adaptation of the guidance by masters. Thirteen unique dyads consisting of a clinical pathologist (master) and a resident (apprentice) discussed and diagnosed six microscope images. Their dialogues were analysed on their content. The dyads were divided in two groups according to the experience of the apprentice. For each dyad, master and apprentice both operated the microscope for half of the cases. Interaction was operationalised as the equal contribution of both master and apprentice to the dialogue. Adaptation was operationalised as the extent to which the content of the dialogues was adapted to the apprentice's level. The main hypothesis stated that the interaction and adaptation increase when apprentices operate the microscope. Most results confirmed this hypothesis: apprentices contributed more content when participating more and the content of these dialogues better reflected expertise differences of apprentices. Based on these results, it is argued that, for learning visual problem solving in a visual and knowledge-intensive domain, it is not only important to externalise master performance, but also that of the apprentice.",

    "abstract": "Health professions education scholarship units (HPESUs) are increasingly becoming a standard for medical schools worldwide without having much information about their value and role in actual educational practices, particularly of those who work in these units, the educational scientists. We conducted a linguistic analysis, called Membership Categorization Analysis, of interviews with leaders of recent curriculum changes to explore how they talk about educational scientists in relation to these processes. The analysis was conducted on previously collected interview data with nine change leaders of major undergraduate medical curriculum change processes in the Netherlands. We analyzed how change leaders categorize HPESUs and educational scientists (use of category terms) and what they say about them (predicates). We noticed two ways of categorizing educational scientists, with observable different predicates. Educational scientists categorized by their first name were suggested to be closer to the change process, more involved in decisional practices and positively described, whereas those described in more generic terms were represented in terms of relatively passive and unspecified activities, were less explicit referenced for their knowledge and expertise and were predominantly factually or negatively described. This study shows an ambiguous portrayal of educational scientists by leaders of major curriculum change processes. Medical schools are challenged to establish medical curricula in consultation with a large, diverse and interdisciplinary stakeholder group. We suggest that it is important to invest in interpersonal relationships to strengthen the internal collaborations and make sure people are aware of each other's existence and roles in the process of curriculum development.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing teacher motivation in distributed learning environments is paramount to ensure high-quality education, as medical education is increasingly becoming the responsibility of a larger variety of healthcare contexts. This study aims to explore teaching-related basic need satisfaction, e.g. teachers' feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness in teaching, in different healthcare contexts and to provide insight into its relation to contextual factors. We distributed a digital survey among healthcare professionals in university hospitals (UH), district teaching hospitals (DTH), and primary care (PC). We used the Teaching-related Basic Need Satisfaction scale, based on the Self-Determination theory, to measure teachers' basic needs satisfaction in teaching. We studied relations between basic need satisfaction and perceived presence of contextual factors associated with teacher motivation drawn from the literature. Input from 1407 healthcare professionals was analyzed. PC healthcare professionals felt most autonomous, UH healthcare professionals felt most competent, and DTH healthcare professionals felt most related. Regardless of work context, teachers involved in educational design and who perceived more appreciation and developmental opportunities for teaching reported higher feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in teaching, as did teachers who indicated that teaching was important at their job application. Perceived facilitators for teaching were associated with feeling more autonomous and related. These results can be utilized in a variety of healthcare contexts for improving teaching-related basic need satisfaction. Recommendations for practice include involving different healthcare professionals in educational development and coordination, forming communities of teachers across healthcare contexts, and addressing healthcare professionals' intentions to be involved in education during job interviews.",

This study was designed to address this issue. Admissions data, preclerkship course performance and United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 results were analyzed over three years for University of California, San Diego (UCSD) postbaccalaureate premedical (PBPM) students (n = 25), students who participated in other postbaccalaureate programs (n = 34), and for the remainder of the medical students who did not participate in any postbaccalaureate programs (n = 329). UCSD PBPM program alumni did not significantly differ in their cumulative academic performance on exams in preclerkship courses and USMLE Step 1 pass rates compared to the rest of the class despite their significantly lower GPA, lower Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Math (BCPM) GPA, and Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) percentiles. For students who participated in the PBPM programs, PBPM program GPA was a significant predictor of preclerkship academic performance and USMLE Step 1 performance. When assessing academic readiness of applicants who have completed postbaccalaureate programs, admissions committees might closely consider the postbaccalaureate program GPA in addition to other academic metrices such as BCPM GPA and MCAT score.",

    "abstract": "The combination of measuring performance and giving feedback creates tension between formative and summative purposes of progress evaluations and can be challenging for supervisors. There are conflicting perspectives and evidence on the effects supervisor-trainee relationships have on assessing performance. The aim of this study was to learn how progress evaluations are used in postgraduate education with longitudinal supervisor-trainee relationships. Progress evaluations in a two-year community-pharmacy specialization program were studied with a mixed-method approach. An adapted version of the Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists (CanMEDS) framework was used. Validity of the performance evaluation scores of 342 trainees was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Semi-structured interviews were held with fifteen supervisors to investigate their response processes, the utility of the progress evaluations, and the influence of supervisor-trainee relationships. Time and CanMEDS roles affected the three-monthly progress evaluation scores. Interviews revealed that supervisors varied in their response processes. They were more committed to stimulating development than to scoring actual performance. Progress evaluations were utilized to discuss and give feedback on trainee development and to add structure to the learning process. A positive supervisor-trainee relationship was seen as the foundation for feedback and supervisors preferred the roles of educator, mentor, and coach over the role of assessor. We found that progress evaluations are a good method for directing feedback in longitudinal supervisor-trainee relationships. The reliability of scoring performance was low. We recommend progress evaluations to be independent of formal assessments in order to minimize roles-conflicts of supervisors.",

Higher education institutions have been tasked with increasing the number of underrepresented students in the health occupations pipeline to better align with the demographics of the general population and meet the need for a diverse health occupations workforce. This study used the National Science Foundation’s National Survey of College Graduates dataset to capture data across time, examining the intersectionality of race, gender, and first-generation status on the salary outcomes of students who earn degrees related to health occupations. Results indicate that the intersecting identities of students who earn a bachelor’s degree or higher in the health professions impact salary outcomes. Results of this study have implications for higher education policies that can impact increased diversity in the health occupations workforce pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It has been claimed that various discourses related to competence influence higher education, but there is limited understanding of the discourses underlying competence development. The specific aim of this study was to explore epistemic discourses concerning the development of competence of health professionals with a master’s degree in health science. Accordingly, the study was qualitative and adopted discourse analysis. Twelve participants, all of whom were Norwegian health professionals aged between 29 and 49 years, participated in this study. Four participants were in the final stage of study for their master’s degree with three months left before completion, four had completed their degree two weeks before their participation, and four had been working for one year after the completion of their degree. Data were collected in three group interviews. Three epistemic discourses were revealed: (1) a critical thinking competencies discourse, (2) a scientific thinking competencies discourse, and (3) a competence-in-use discourse. The former two discourses were considered the dominant discourses and indicated that a knowing “that” discourse connected the specialized competence of different health professionals with a wider field of competence. This wider field transcended the boundaries of various health disciplines and represented a novel competence developed through a synergizing process between critical and scientific thinking competencies, which seems to drive continued competence development. A competence-in-use discourse was formed in the process. This discourse can be viewed as a unique outcome that contributes to health professionals’ specialized competence and suggests that a knowing “how” discourse was also an underlying background discourse.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is an expectation that health professions schools respond to priority societal health needs. This expectation is largely based on the underlying assumption that schools are aware of the priority needs in their communities. This paper demonstrates how open-access, pan-national health data can be used to create a reliable health index to assist schools in identifying societal needs and advance social accountability in health professions education. Using open-access data, a psychometric evaluation was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of the Canadian Health Indicators Framework (CHIF) conceptual model. A non-linear confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on 67 health indicators, at the health-region level (n = 97) was used to assess the model fit of the hypothesized 10-factor model. Reliability analysis using McDonald’s Omega were conducted, followed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Findings from the non-linear CFA rejected the original conceptual model structure of the CHIF. Exploratory post hoc analyses were conducted using modification indices and parameter constraints to improve model fit. A final 5-factor multidimensional model demonstrated superior fit, reducing the number of indicators from 67 to 32. The 5-factors included: Health Conditions (8-indicators); Health Functions (6-indicators); Deaths (5-indicators); Non-Medical Health Determinants (7-indicators); and Community &amp; Health System Characteristics (6-indicators). All factor loadings were statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.001) and demonstrated excellent internal consistency ( $$\\upomega$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math> &gt;0.95). Many schools struggle to identify and measure socially accountable outcomes. The process highlighted in this paper and the indices developed serve as starting points to allow schools to leverage open-access data as an initial step in identifying societal needs.",

    "abstract": "Becoming a healthcare professional is a complex process, where learning occurs in various ways. This study explores an extracurricular learning approach, called the Social Health Bridge-Building Programme, designed to address health inequities. Student volunteers accompany persons in a socially vulnerable situation to healthcare appointments. Operating outside the realms of health education, the programme intends to provide an alternative road to training healthcare students to become capable of engaging with diverse populations, and reducing barriers to healthcare access. Based on an ethnographic fieldwork, using interviews and participant observation (\"walking along\") as methods, the aim of the study was to explore the learning processes and learning outcomes associated with bridge-building, as experienced by students. Our findings show that this extracurricular learning complemented the formal curriculum, and bridged the gap from theoretical knowledge to practice and to real persons, preparing students for their future roles. The particular positioning of walking alongside or sitting beside persons made the invisible visible, enabling student volunteers to see the variety of persons in need of bridge-building, ways of living in a socially vulnerable situation, inequity in health, and see the persons, beyond initial impression, fostering a deeper understanding and empathy among the students. Learning outcomes included communicational, relational, and observations skills, and a more comprehensive grasp of the healthcare system's complexity. We conclude that a non-governmental organization, independent of the healthcare system, may have found a novel way of providing extracurricular learning about health inequity to students. Demonstrating how the Social Health Bridge-Building Programme complements formal curricula, the concept could be applicable in other settings.",

However, empirical research into the experience of embodiment in learning in CPD is sparse, particularly in the practice of general medicine. In this study, we aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) learning experiences during CPD from an embodiment perspective, studying the appearance of elements of embodiment—the body, actions, emotions, cognition, and interactions with the surroundings and others—to build an explanatory structure of embodiment in learning. We drew on the concepts of embodied affectivity and mutual incorporation to frame our understanding of embodiment. Four Danish and three Canadian GPs were interviewed to gain insight into specific learning experiences; the interviews and the analysis were inspired by micro-phenomenology, augmented with a complex adaptive systems approach. We constructed an explanatory structure of learning with two entrance points (disharmony and mundanity), an eight-component learning phase, and an ending phase with two exit points (harmony and continuing imbalance). All components of the learning phase—community, pride, validation, rehearsal, do-ability, mind-space, ambiance, and preparing for the future—shared features of embodied affectivity and mutual incorporation and interacted in multi-directional and non-linear ways. We discuss integrating the embodiment perspective into existing learning theories and argue that CPD for GPs would benefit from doing so.",

However, professional and institutional cultures and structures are known to contribute to the challenges for CALD practitioners who work in dominant culture practice contexts. This scoping review used the theory of Legitimate Peripheral Participation to describe and interpret literature about the experiences of CALD health practitioners in view of informing strategies to increase their representation. A systematised search was conducted across four allied health, medicine and nursing databases. Following abstract and full text screening, articles which fit the inclusion criteria (n = 124) proceeded to data extraction. Categories relating to the experiences of practitioners were extracted, and three themes were identified that were subsequently theoretically interpreted: Discrimination, Consequences and Hierarchy. Discrimination functioned as a barrier to CALD practitioners being legitimised and able to participate equally in healthcare practice, retaining their position at the periphery of the practice community; Consequences reinforced this peripheral position and further impeded legitimation and participation; and Hierarchy was maintained through structures that reinforced and reproduced these barriers. The findings summarise how these barriers are reinforced through the intersections of professional and racial hierarchies, and highlight a need for strategies to address discrimination and structures that marginalise CALD practitioners’ identity, practices and participation in their health professional communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The transition into postgraduate medical training is complex, requiring an integration into the workplace, adjustment to new identities, and understanding of the social and organisational structure of healthcare. Studies suggest that social resources, including a sense of belonging, inclusivity from social groups, and having strong social identities can facilitate positive transitions. However, little is known about the role these resources play in junior doctors’ transitions into the healthcare community. This study aimed to explore the implications of having access to social resources for junior doctors. This study undertook secondary analysis from a longitudinal qualitative study which followed 19 junior doctors (residents within two years of qualification) for nine months. Data were thematically analysed using an abductive approach, with the social identity resource and belongingness (SIRB) model as a conceptual lens to explore how social networks of support act as identity resources (IRs) for junior doctors as they experience transitions. The doctors narrated that having accessible IRs in the form of supportive workplace relationships enabled an integration and a sense of belonging into healthcare practice, supported the construction of new professional identities, and strengthened career intentions. Those with inaccessible IRs (i.e. poor workplace relationships) expressed a lack of belonging, and casted doubt on their identity as a doctor and their career intentions. Our study indicates that SIRB model would be beneficial for medical educators, supervisors, and managers to help them understand the importance and implications of having IRs within the workplace environment and the consequences of their accessibility for healthcare staff experiencing transitions.",

Transformative learning through critical reflection on disorienting learning experiences supports perspective change to direct new activity. We explored how portfolio meetings support changes in students’ perspectives towards learning and study during the transition to studying medicine. This qualitative mixed methods study explored changes in medical students’ perspectives before and after two portfolio meetings with a mentor during the first year of medicine. Adopting a constructionist approach, we analyzed interview transcripts and written reflections from a diverse sample of students using reflexive thematic analysis. The findings were integrated during analysis. Transformative learning theory was our interpretive lens. Our analysis revealed five themes. Two themes represented students’ initial apprehension about portfolio meetings: The Disclosure Dilemma and A Question of Priorities. The theme “Seeing the Big Picture” described new perspectives from reflection on learning while preparing for meetings. Clarity from Dialogue described changed perspectives to learning and study after meetings. In the theme Dialogue Disappointment, meetings perceived as unhelpful led to persisting doubts about the value of portfolio meetings. Transformative learning was evident when students described new insights into their learning leading to goal-setting and new study strategies. When initial meetings were helpful, doubts about portfolio meetings were dispelled, enhancing student engagement in future meetings. Not all meetings were transformative, highlighting the importance of student and mentor preparation and training. Further research is needed to determine whether early portfolio experiences shape later engagement in clinical contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Research in various areas indicates that expert judgment can be highly inconsistent. However, expert judgment is indispensable in many contexts. In medical education, experts often function as examiners in rater-based assessments. Here, disagreement between examiners can have far-reaching consequences. The literature suggests that inconsistencies in ratings depend on the level of performance a to-be-evaluated candidate shows. This possibility has not been addressed deliberately and with appropriate statistical methods. By adopting the theoretical lens of ecological rationality, we evaluate if easily implementable strategies can enhance decision making in real-world assessment contexts. Methods We address two objectives. First, we investigate the dependence of rater-consistency on performance levels. We recorded videos of mock-exams and had examiners (N=10) evaluate four students’ performances and compare inconsistencies in performance ratings between examiner-pairs using a bootstrapping procedure. Our second objective is to provide an approach that aids decision making by implementing simple heuristics. Results We found that discrepancies were largely a function of the level of performance the candidates showed. Lower performances were rated more inconsistently than excellent performances. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that the use of simple heuristics might improve decisions in examiner pairs. Discussion Inconsistencies in performance judgments continue to be a matter of concern, and we provide empirical evidence for them to be related to candidate performance. We discuss implications for research and the advantages of adopting the perspective of ecological rationality. We point to directions both for further research and for development of assessment practices.",

    "abstract": "Rasch modelling is a powerful tool for evaluating item performance, measuring drift in difficulty over time, and comparing students who sat assessments at different times or at different sites. Here, we use data from thirty UK medical schools to describe the benefits of Rasch modelling in quality assurance and the barriers to using it. Sixty \"common content\" multiple choice items were offered to all UK medical schools in 2016-17, and a further sixty in 2017-18, with five available in both years. Thirty medical schools participated, for sixty total datasets across two sessions, and 14,342 individual sittings. Schools selected items to embed in written assessment near the end of their programmes. We applied Rasch modelling to evaluate unidimensionality, model fit statistics and item quality, horizontal equating to compare performance across schools, and vertical equating to compare item performance across time. Of the sixty sittings, three provided non-unidimensional data, and eight violated goodness of fit measures. Item-level statistics identified potential improvements in item construction and provided quality assurance. Horizontal equating demonstrated large differences in scores across schools, while vertical equating showed item characteristics were stable across sessions. Rasch modelling provides significant advantages in model- and item- level reporting compared to classical approaches. However, the complexity of the analysis and the smaller number of educators familiar with Rasch must be addressed locally for a programme to benefit. Furthermore, due to the comparative novelty of Rasch modelling, there is greater ambiguity on how to proceed when a Rasch model identifies misfitting or problematic data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The interdisciplinary nature of health professions education requires exploration of problems by interdisciplinary research teams. Drawing on the Dynamics of Cross-disciplinary Research Development conceptual framework, this study explores the processes and experiences of an interdisciplinary research team, identifying elements of successful collaboration. Case study data were collected from a team of nine researchers from six universities. Data included meeting minutes and researcher reflections. Researcher reflection and meeting minute themes converged within the framework constructs: Contexts and inputs, social learning processes, social capital outcomes, and knowledge and human capital outcomes. This study provides a blueprint for interdisciplinary researchers indicating that successful collaboration starts with transparent, distributed leadership. The convergence of data illustrates how social learning processes, social capital outcomes, and knowledge and human capital outcomes facilitate research team outcomes.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in health professions education (HPE) in applying argument-based validity approaches, such as Kane's, to assessment design. The critical first step in employing Kane's approach is to specify the interpretation-use argument (IUA). However, in the HPE literature, this step is often poorly articulated. This article provides guidance on developing the IUA using a worked example involving a workplace performance assessment tool. In developing the IUA, we have drawn inspiration from approaches used in the discipline of language assessment to situate the inferences, warrants and assumptions in the context of the assessment tool. The worked example makes use of Toulmin's model of informal logic/argumentation as a framework to structure the IUA and presents Toulmin diagrams for each inference such that the reader can connect the argument chain together. We also present several lessons learned so the reader can understand the issues we grappled with in developing the IUA. A well laid out IUA allows the argument to be critiqued by others and provides a framework to guide collection of validity evidence, and therefore is an essential ingredient in the work of assessment design and validation.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between faculty and students in higher education has the potential to influence and shape many aspects of teaching, learning, curricula, student experiences and performance, yet has received little attention as an area of study. This study investigates student-faculty interactions within a physiotherapy curriculum from the perspectives of students, faculty and physiotherapy managers at a South African university. The data, produced through multiple methods, derive from students, faculty and physiotherapy managers underpinned by critical-feminist perspectives. Thematic analysis of the data produced four themes. Two dominant threads emerging from the analysis as characterising student-faculty relationships are the deeply hierarchical relations of power characterised by a lack of caring and concern for students, and the exclusion of wider constructs for interaction; deriving from a particular entrenched medical model. Ironically, while caring relationships with patients are overtly advocated and developed, they appear to be largely absent in the same physiotherapy curriculum spaces in the relationships between faculty and students. These findings raise questions about how the most foundational attribute of a health science professional, that of caring, is being produced through the curriculum in the relationship between faculty and students in the health sciences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, a new digital clinical reasoning test (DCRT) was developed to evaluate students’ clinical-reasoning skills. Although an assessment tool may be soundly constructed, it may still prove inadequate in practice by failing to function as intended. Therefore, more insight is needed into the effects of the DCRT in practice. Individual semi-structured interviews and template analysis were used to collect and process qualitative data. The template, based on the interview guide, contained six themes: (1) DCRT itself, (2) test debriefing, (3) reflection, (4) practice/workplace, (5) DCRT versus practice and (6) ‘other’. Thirteen students were interviewed. The DCRT encourages students to engage more in formal education, self-study and workplace learning during their clerkships, particularly for those who received insufficient results. Although the faculty emphasizes the different purposes of the DCRT ( assessment of/as/for learning ), most students perceive the DCRT as an assessment of learning. This affects their motivation and the role they assign to it in their learning process. Although students appreciate the debriefing and reflection report for improvement, they struggle to fill the identified knowledge gaps due to the timing of receiving their results. Some students are supported by the DCRT in exhibiting lifelong learning behavior. This study has identified several ways in which the DCRT influences students’ learning practices in a way that can benefit their clinical-reasoning skills. Additionally, it stresses the importance of ensuring the alignment of theoretical principles with real-world practice, both in the development and utilization of assessment tools and their content. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term impact of the DCRT on young physicians’ working practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is widely used to assess medical students’ clinical skills. Virtual OSCEs were used in place of in-person OSCEs during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, their reliability is yet to be robustly analyzed. By applying generalizability (G) theory, this study aimed to evaluate the reliability of a hybrid OSCE, which admixed in-person and online methods, and gain insights into improving OSCEs’ reliability. During the 2020–2021 hybrid OSCEs, one examinee, one rater, and a vinyl mannequin for physical examination participated onsite, and a standardized simulated patient (SP) for medical interviewing and another rater joined online in one virtual breakout room on an audiovisual conferencing system. G-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals of the borderline score, namely border zone (BZ), under the standard 6-station, 2-rater, and 6-item setting were calculated. G-coefficients of in-person (2017–2019) and hybrid OSCEs (2020–2021) under the standard setting were estimated to be 0.624, 0.770, 0.782, 0.759, and 0.823, respectively. The BZ scores were estimated to be 2.43–3.57, 2.55–3.45, 2.59–3.41, 2.59–3.41, and 2.51–3.49, respectively, in the score range from 1 to 6. Although hybrid OSCEs showed reliability comparable to in-person OSCEs, they need further improvement as a very high-stakes examination. In addition to increasing clinical vignettes, having more proficient online/on-demand raters and/or online SPs for medical interviews could improve the reliability of OSCEs. Reliability can also be ensured through supplementary examination and by increasing the number of online raters for a small number of students within the BZs.",

Our study aims to specify that knowledge by describing in detail the actions teachers do when intervening, the interactional consequences of those actions, and how these relate to teacher roles in group discussions. We collected all first teacher interventions (n = 142) in 41 videorecorded group discussions on experiences from practice at the Dutch postgraduate training for General Practice. We analyzed the interventions using Conversation Analysis. First, we described the timing, manner, actions, and interactional consequences of each intervention. Next, we inductively categorized actions into types of actions. Finally, we analyzed the distribution of these types of actions over the group discussion phases (telling, exploration, discussion, conclusion). First teacher interventions were done at observably critical moments. Actions done by these interventions could be categorized as moderating, expert, and evaluating actions. Moderating actions, commonly done during the telling and exploration phase, are least directive. Expert and evaluator actions, more common in the discussion phase, are normative and thus more directive. The placement and form of the actions done by teachers, as well as their accounts for doing those, may hint at a teacher orientation to intervene as late as possible. Since the interventions are occasioned by prior interaction and responded to in different ways by residents, they are a collaborative interactional accomplishment. Our detailed description of how, when and with what effect teachers intervene provides authentic material for teacher training.",
