    "abstract": "This paper summarizes the advantageous and disadvantageous properties of alkali-activated slag cement and concrete by reviewing previously published work in English, Russian and Chinese. Practical problems and theoretical questions are discussed. Topics for future work in this field are suggested. The practical problems mentioned are quick setting, the possibility of alkali—aggregate reaction, and the occurrence of efflorescence, shrinkage, microcracks and strength variation. The theoretical questions discussed concerning alkaline activation include the roles of the alkaline anion and cation, the nature of the hydration products, microstructural development and the setting and hardening mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of the method of surface decoration on the wetability of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and the mechanical properties of the cement paste incorporating these dispersions. The results showed that stable and homogenous dispersions of MWCNTs in water can be obtained by using surface functionalisation combined with decoration using polyacrylic acid polymers. The cement paste specimens incorporating these dispersions revealed good workability and an increase in the compressive strength of nearly 50% even with only a small addition of the MWCNTs, namely 0·045–0·15% of the cement weight. These results indicate the existence of chemical bonds between the OH groups of the functionalised MWCNTs and probably the CSH phase of the cement matrix, which enhanced the transfer of stresses. A second method that was studied included decoration of MWCNTs with polyacrylic acid polymers and gum Arabic. These dispersions appeared to be homogeneous only for approximately 2 h after which a progressive sedimentation occurred. Good workability was found for the cement pastes produced with all of the dispersions; the only significant difference being the slower hydration of the cement incorporating gum Arabic. The mechanical properties of the cement pastes incorporating MWCNTs treated with polyacrylic polymers were unchanged.",

    "abstract": "The flow and deformation of cement-based materials accompanies the full cycle of three-dimensional concrete printing (3DCP) and profoundly affects the quality of printed structures. Therefore, rheology is closely related to 3DCP technology. However, since printing materials undergo complex changes (from fluid to solid) during the entire process, it is extremely difficult to obtain the rheological parameters of the material accurately, which makes it difficult to characterise the material's properties and explore the rheological laws within the technical cycle. In this regard, this article starts from the perspective of rheology, systematically reviews the performance requirements of 3DCP technology for printing materials, critically discusses the existing methods for characterisation of material printability, including various conventional and unconventional methods, and clarifies the scope of application of each method. In addition, this article introduces several buildability models based on consideration of the time dependency of the printing material and indicates the direction for the optimisation of the performance of printing materials.",

    "abstract": "A multi-method approach was used for the investigation and comparison of alkali-activated slag binders (AAS), pure slag and ordinary Portland cement (OPC). X-ray fluorescence, X-ray powder diffraction, granulometry, calorimetry, thermo-gravimetric analysis and environmental scanning electron microscope investigations of the microstructure with energy dispersive X-ray analyses were used to characterise the cements and their hydrate phases. In addition, the chemical composition of the pore solution, including the different sulphur-containing ions, was analysed. The precipitation mechanisms during binder hydration in the AAS and OPC systems exhibit significant differences: in AAS the formation of the ‘outer product’ C-S-H is much faster than in OPC. The high Si concentrations in the pore solution during the early hydration of AAS are related to the fast dissolution of Na-metasilicate. The fast reaction of Na is an important factor for the voluminous precipitation of C-S-H within the interstitial space already during the first 24 h. In addition to the Na-metasilicate component, the high fineness of the slag represents a further important factor for the fast hydration of AAS. The small slag particles (&lt; 2 μm) are completely dissolved or hydrated within the first 24 h, whereas hydration of the larger particles is much slower. The fast formation of a gel-like matrix in AAS is the product of a fast ‘through solution’ precipitation, which contrasts with the slower dissolution-precipitation mechanism of a ‘topotactic’ growth of C-S-H in OPC. The chemical and mineralogical characterisation of solid and liquid phases and their changes with time are the basis for thermodynamic modelling of the corresponding hydration process, which is presented in a second paper.",

The solutions were prepared with mixes of 0%, 80%/20% and 20%/80%. The activation process was studied at early ages by conduction calorimetric and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

It was observed that the presence of PC admixture retards the initial cement hydration reactions, although this effect may be offset by possible increased diffusion in later stages. Additionally, the PC admixtures produce a few alterations in the structure and composition of the formed C—S—H gel. The addition of 1% PC admixture in the pastes generates a higher percentage of silicate bridge (Si Q 2 units) mainly at 2 days. The admixture used in this study induced microstructural modifications in the pastes which slightly reduced the porosity; however the admixture did not affect the mechanical strength of the pastes at either 2 or 28 days of hydration. Finally, from the results of the rheological studies it was concluded that a low dosage of PC led to a substantial reduction (over 70%) in the yield stress.",

    "abstract": "Calcium sulfoaluminate, C 4 A 3 S or CSA, often known as Klein s compound, can be readily synthesized as a single phase at about 1300°C. It is also formed along with belite and a ferrite phase when limestone is reacted with various minerals or waste products at 1200–1300°C. The presence of CSA can lead to early strength development, and such systems may be regarded as low-energy cements, providing environmental benefits, notably emission of less carbon dioxide than in the production of Portland cement. Under controlled, specified conditions, usually including addition of gypsum, the hydration of CSA gives acceptable setting times and good strength development. These properties are based on the rapid formation of ettringite and variable quantities of an amorphous gel phase. These characteristics have already led to the formulation of various commercial products taking advantage of these special properties for applications in building chemistry and mining. Further systematic research is required leading to greater application of these novel cements.",

It has been concluded from the survey of the literature that cement–superplasticizer interactions are generally preceded by the adsorption of superplasticizers on the hydrating cement particles. However, the mechanisms of such adsorptive interactions have not been adequately addressed experimentally or discussed in the literature. The reason for this appears to be the lack of a conceptual model that can delineate the results to date and project needed experiments. A charge-controlled-reaction mechanism model involving Ca 2+ ions from initial hydration is proposed to explain the adsorption characteristics of superplasticizers and other organic additives and their effects. The calcium ions released by hydration form a bilayer immediately upon contact of water with the cement, which is followed by adsorption of superplasticizer anions on the Ca 2+ ion side of the bilayer. The interfacial structures and their influence on electrical characteristics, hydration reactions and phase growth in the hydrating cement are discussed in terms of the proposed model.",

The thermogravimetric analysis results showed that the amounts of added CaCO 3 became slightly lower as the hydration took place; however, any new reaction products were not detected by the X-ray diffractometry analysis. The engineering properties, including microhardness and modulus of elasticity, in the early stage of the hydration were remarkably improved by the addition of nano-CaCO 3 . It was suggested that the seeding effect of the nano-CaCO 3 particles and the nucleation of C–S–H caused the enhanced strength development.",

The concentration of all solutions was constant = 3% of Na 2 O by mass of the slag. The pastes were studied through isothermal conduction calorimetry, FTIR and 29 Si and 27 Al MAS-NMR. Results indicate that pastes activated with waterglass develop faster setting due to the formation of an initial calcium silicate hydrate. Setting, in pastes activated with NaOH is due to the formation of a more polymerised calcium silicate hydrate. Pastes activated with Na 2 CO 3 show longer setting times due to the initial formation of a sodium calcium carbonate which retard the reaction processes.",

In the concretes without silica fume the transition zone was more porous than the bulk cement matrix. However, in the concretes with silica fume, the transition zone was much denser, having a level of porosity similar to that of the matrix.

The samples were exposed to two levels of CO 2 (5 and 20%) in their curing environment at two levels of relative humidity (RH), namely 65 and 98%, RH, and the resulting changes in stiffness and toughness were contrasted with reference samples, which were cured in 98% RH and ambient CO 2 levels. Carbonation of MgO, following its hydration into brucite, yields nesquehonite, whereas that of Portland cement resulted in calcite. The conversion of brucite into nesquehonite increased the strength and toughness of the blends without PC, and this was attributed to the large increase in solid volume due to the carbonation reactions. The accelerated carbonation treatment damaged the blends without MgO, although it did not alter significantly the dynamic stiffness and toughness of the blends containing equal quantities of MgO and PC. Contrary to PC-based cements, in which the highest carbonation rates are found for intermediate humidity levels, the accelerated carbonation of MgO cements requires high levels of humidity and this is attributed to the high water consumption of the carbonation reaction of brucite, whereas carbonation of the PC liberates water",

The type of alkaline activator (Na-silicate, NaOH) has no influence on the type of hydrates formed but influences the Ca/Si ratio of the C–S–H. The addition of sodium silicate leads to the formation of C–S–H with a higher Ca/Si ratio (1.1–1.2), whereas NaOH results in a Ca/Si ratio of 0.8to1.1. In contrast, the kind and concentration of the activator has strong influence on the composition of the pore solution. Low concentrations of the alkaline activator result in lower Na, Si and Al concentrations and lower pH values.

This was due to the lack of a suitable method for measuring the packing density and voids content of cementitious materials. To resolve the problem, the authors have recently developed a new wet packing method that was applied herein to measure the packing densities and voids contents of cementitious materials containing different amounts of cement, pulverised fuel ash and condensed silica fume. The flowability properties of the paste formed of the cementitious materials with different water contents were also measured and correlated to the excess water contents, each determined as water content minus voids content. The results revealed that whereas an improvement in packing density would increase excess water content, flowability is governed mainly by excess water to solid volume and excess water to solid surface area ratios.",

    "abstract": "Reactive magnesia (MgO) has emerged as an essential component in a new family of cements with significantly superior technical and environmental performance over Portland cement. The physical characteristics of different reactive magnesia, which are likely to affect their engineering performance, vary considerably depending on their origin and manufacturing processes. To appropriately utilise such a material, it is essential to develop a better understanding of the characteristics of different magnesia from various sources. In this study, the detailed characterisation of 14 commercial magnesia in terms of reactivity, textural properties, X-ray diffraction pattern, pH value and hydration behaviour and morphology is presented and correlation between them is developed. Relationships were developed between the reactivity, specific surface area, agglomeration ratio and hydration rate based on the experimental observations. As a result, the reactive magnesia used in this study were grouped into three categories and their characteristics and anticipated performances in different applications were discussed.",

The paper considers the explanations put forward to explain sulfate attack, both from a chemical and microstructural perspective. Similarly, this paper reviews work on the physical damage caused by the precipitation of sulfate salts in porous materials. With the increased use of binary and ternary blends, this paper also considers the impact of binder composition on sulfate resistance, and similarly reviews how the nature of the sulfate species can affect the nature and extent of any deterioration. This then leads on to the important consideration of differences between field- and lab-based studies, reviewing the effect of various experimental parameters on sulfate resistance. This latter topic is of great importance to anyone who wishes to carry out such experiments.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that the fresh properties of cement paste and cement–sand mortar are governed mainly by three parameters: water content, packing density and solid surface area. However, these parameters vary simultaneously upon any change in the mix composition and hence the evaluation of their individual and combined effects has been a difficult task. Recently, the authors have found that the effects of these parameters on the flowability and rheological properties of cement paste may be evaluated in terms of the water film thickness (WFT) of the solid–water mixture. Herein, this concept of WFT is extended to cement–sand mortar made of sand with a maximum size of 1·18 mm. A number of mortar samples proportioned with different water contents and different sand gradings were produced for packing density, flowability and rheological properties measurements. From the results, the WFT of each sample was determined and the effects of the WFT on the flowability and rheological properties of the mortar were investigated. The good correlations between the flowability and rheological properties with the WFT revealed that the concept of WFT is applicable also to cement–sand mortar.",

This binder hardened within 12 h and achieved a compressive strength of 20 MPa after 24 h of curing under ambient conditions, which is associated with the formation of an aluminium substituted calcium silicate hydrate as the main reaction product. Carbonates including pirssonite, vaterite, aragonite and calcite were identified along with the zeolites hydroxysodalite and analcime at early times of reaction. The partial substitution of sodium carbonate by sodium silicate reduces the concentration of carbonate ions in the pore solution, increasing the alkalinity of the system compared with a solely carbonate-activated paste, accelerating the kinetics of reaction and supplying additional silicate species to react with the calcium dissolving from the slag as the reaction proceeds. These results demonstrate that this blend of activators can be used effectively for the production of high-strength alkali-activated slag cements, with a microstructure comparable to what has been identified in aged sodium-carbonate-activated slag cements but without the extended setting time reaction usually identified when using this salt as an alkali activator.",

With the help of selective extraction by sodium carbonate (SE), it was possible to quantify the amorphous C–S–H phase in SSC.

    "abstract": "As legislation forces significant reductions in the operational carbon dioxide emissions of the built environment, increasing attention is focused on the embodied carbon of structural materials. As the most prevalent structural material, the embodied carbon of concrete is of paramount interest. Previous direct or indirect analyses of embodied carbon in concrete have treated it either as an elemental material with a value of single embodied carbon, or calculated embodied carbon for a limited range of reinforced concrete mix designs, or returned only values for plain concrete. In this paper, the results are presented from a preliminary study into the embodied carbon of reinforced concrete as a function of: concrete strength grade; steel strength; mix design; cement replacement; and structural form. Findings are expressed both in terms of EC raw (kgCO 2 /kg reinforced concrete) and EC f (kgCO 2 per unit of structural performance). They suggest that there is a wide range of EC raw (0·06−0·47) and that EC f is minimised by using C50 concrete. Savings in EC f achieved by adjusting mix design parameters (20–35%) generally exceed those achieved by replacing cement with pulverised fuel ash (10–25%). C50 beams of all mix designs have lower EC f than comparable timber composite or steel beams.",

A blend of limestone calcined clay pozzolan (LCCP) was produced by grinding calcined clay and limestone in a ratio of 2 : 1 with 2% gypsum. Blends with cement replacement level of 0, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 50% using LCCP were cast. The effect of LCCP on the hydration of cement was investigated using isothermal calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. Mortar and concrete samples were cast to study the influence of LCCP on mechanical and transport properties. The addition of LCCP was found to have a beneficial effect on the early age hydration of cement. The induction period and initial setting time of cement paste were found to reduce on increased cement replacement level. Higher or similar compressive strength was observed for all the LCCP blends as compared to ordinary Portland cement. The pozzolanic reaction of calcined clay and formation of carboaluminates on the reaction of calcium carbonate with alumina helps to develop a refined pore structure that aids in reducing transport properties of concrete such as porosity, rate of water absorption and permeability.",

    "abstract": "Concrete carbonation is one of the main causes of reinforcement corrosion. Determination of the rate of concrete carbonation can be made by exposing specimens in natural atmospheres; however, as this results in too slow a process, testing is usually made by accelerating the process using atmospheres of relatively high CO 2 concentration. No general validation exists on how to extrapolate these testing conditions to real performance. This paper tries to contribute to the understanding of accelerated carbonation testing, by making comparisons between natural and accelerated (5 and 100% CO 2 ) conditions in a set of concretes. The results indicate that accelerated testing changes the ranking of concrete resistance towards carbonation and that therefore, the comparison has to be made among concrete with the same additions. The use of calculation methods (service life models) if properly adjusted with natural tests may be a useful complementary tool. The carbonation velocity, V CO2 derived from the square root law is a very useful parameter to compare concretes in any testing conditions.",

The science and applications of electrically conductive cement-based materials are reviewed. In addition, a comparative study of the effectiveness of various electrically conductive admixtures (discontinuous forms of steel and carbon) for lowering the electrical resistivity of cement shows that the effectiveness decreases in the order: steel fibre of diameter 8 μm, steel fibre of diameter 60 μm, carbon fibre of diameter 15 μm, carbon nanofibre of diameter 0·1 μm, coke powder (&lt; 75 μm) and graphite powder (&lt; 1 μm). For EMI shielding, the effectiveness decreases in the order: steel fibre of diameter 8 μm, coke powder (&lt; 75 μm), carbon nanofibre of diameter 0·1 μm, graphite powder (&lt; 1 μm), steel fibre of diameter 60 μm, carbon fibre of diameter 15 μm, and steel dust of size 0·55 mm. By using steel fibre (8 μm diameter) at 0·72 vol.%, a resistivity of 16 Ω cm and an EMI shielding effectiveness of 59 dB (1 GHz) were attained. The carbon admixtures cause the absolute thermoelectric power to be more positive, whereas the steel admixtures can cause the absolute thermoelectric power to be more positive or more negative. In particular, steel fibre of diameter 60 μm at 0·2 vol.% causes the absolute thermoelectric power to be strongly negative (−63 μV/°C).

Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) and X-ray diffractometry analyses showed ettringite and C–S–H as the main hydration products of the hardened SSC paste. Changes of the composition of the pore solution were determined during hydration. Thermodynamic calculations of saturation indices for possible reaction products supported the phase observations. A satisfactory strength development of SSC mortar was observed despite low reaction rates, maximum 26 wt % of the slag, after 56 days hydration. A greater fineness enhanced the degree of reaction of the GGBS and the compressive strength of SSC mortar. The high tendency towards carbonation is a negative property of SSC. Due to a fast progressive carbonation rate a coarsening of the microstructure occurred in conjunction with a loss of flexural strength. Excessive dosage of alkaline activator led to a significant loss of strength of SSC mortar. ESEM micrographs showed that ettringite crystals grew directly on the surface of the slag grains and caused a sterical separation of the hydrated slag particles. This coarsening of the hydrated structure was the reason for the loss of strength. According to the results of this study, SSC can be designed to obtain a sustainable, ecologically minded, binding material with low CO 2 emission during production.",

When NaOH was used as an activator, the slag replacement with ASTM Type F fly ash did not show a significant effect on either the strength development or hydration; Type C fly ash did not affect the strength development, but affected the hydration process due to the presence of C 3 A in the fly ash. Both fly ashes had a significant effect on the hydration and strength development when Na 2 SiO 3 was used as an activator. The addition of a small amount of hydrated lime significantly increased the early-age strength but slightly decreased the later-age strength of the activated slag/fly ash blends. Measurement of the heat evolution during hydration indicated that the addition of the hydrated lime had a slight effect on the hydration during the pre-induction period, but accelerated the hydration thereafter.",

Key parameters were defined as drying, concentration and transport of CO 2 into the sample. However, the trials were performed on small-scale samples of cement paste only. Following this an investigation was then conducted to understand (a) whether the carbonation would occur in pressed masonry units, (b) whether an improvement in the mechanical properties of those units could be expected, and (c) what conditions give rise to the maximum level of carbonation. Hence this paper presents the following: (a) the effect of natural and forced carbonation on the mechanical properties of pressed masonry units containing natural aggregates or Lytag; and (b) the conditions which give rise to the maximum level of carbonation. The results presented indicate that the natural carbonation of magnesia cement-based masonry units was very limited while forced carbonation improved the mechanical performance of the systems substantially.

Preliminary results show that the surface layers of concrete dry rapidly enough to impair curing of the cover zone that protects reinforcing steel. At depths greater than 20 mm drying was relatively slow. Water content results indicate that the surface layers are more porous than the underlying concrete. The measured effects of depth, OPC replacement and water/binder ratio upon the variations of relative humidity with time can be described with a simple empirical equation that incorporates a hyperbolic time function. The relative humidity dropped faster the lower the water/binder ratio and the higher the level of OPC replacement with pulverized-fuel ash or ground granulated blastfurnace slag.",

Solubility and regions of stability, including thermodynamic data, are presented. Ionic speciations at various temperatures were calculated. The water content of nitrate AFm was found to be sensitive to humidity conditions, unlike nitrite AFm whose water content seems to be independent of the moisture conditions over a wide range of p H2O . Nitrates and nitrites readily displace hydroxide, sulfate and carbonate from the AFm structures so AFm is mainly responsible for storing nitrite and nitrate in cement solids. A comprehensive picture of the phase relations of AFm phases and the binding power for nitrite/nitrate is given for pH∼12 and a temperature of 25°C. The presence of nitrate and nitrite alter the AFm/AFt balance and affect the specific volume of paste solids. Implications for the distribution of nitrate and nitrite in cements undergoing alteration are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Due to its complexity at nanoscale, calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), the dominant binding phase in cement hydrates, is not yet completely understood. In this study, molecular dynamics was employed to simulate the hydration products at low and high calcium/silicon ratios. It was found that two morphologies of calcium silicate hydrate gels can be distinguished – a branched structure at low calcium/silicon ratios and an ellipsoid particle structure at high calcium/silicon ratios. Using virtual X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) techniques, the simulated structures were characterised, confirming that they show features of calcium silicate hydrate as revealed by experimental approaches. The short-range structures of calcium and silicon atoms and the distorted calcium tetrahedrons resemble the features of silicate glasses obtained from experiments, implying the amorphous nature of the local structure in calcium silicate hydrate gel. Furthermore, formation mechanisms for the two morphologies are proposed. In the hydration process, calcium ions play roles in depolymerising the silicate structure and preventing the amorphous network formation. Therefore, at low calcium/silicon ratios, the reaction is governed by silicate skeleton growth, but at high calcium/silicon ratio, aggregations of calcium ions and short silicate chains dominate.",

The aim was to evaluate the influence of fineness and replacement level on the development of the compressive strength, the amount of bound water and calcium hydroxide and the heat of hydration of the composite cements. Replacing up to 10% of the fine OPC by fine limestone powder did not impair the compressive strength. Using 5% fine limestone powder instead of 5% fine FA in a cement containing 35% FA resulted, on the other hand, in a considerable strength increase of 13% at 28 days, indicating a synergetic effect between limestone powder and fly ash. The OPC fineness was the major parameter regarding the early hydration. At 28 days the fineness of the fly ash also played an important role due to its contribution to the pozzolanic reaction. Indeed, intensive grinding of the fly ash appeared to render the fly ash more reactive. The fineness of the limestone powder within the tested range (362–812 m 2 /kg) had no effect on the hydration of the OPC and the composite cement.",

As the hydration reaction proceeded, the peak value corresponding to silicon–oxygen (Si–O) vibrations in the FTIR spectrum shifted from low wavenumbers to high wavenumbers, which not only reflected the polymerisation process of silicon–oxygen tetrahedrons in the calcium–silicate–hydrate gel, but also the hydration reaction speed of cement paste at this stage. This was confirmed by experiment on samples with added superplasticiser. The shifting characteristics of the absorption peaks in the range 800–1025 cm −1 for samples at the ages of 8–12 h were comprehensively investigated in this study. The research results showed that the shifting speed of the characteristic peak for the blank sample was exactly the same as that for the sample reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Therefore, the addition of CNT materials into Portland cement did not influence the hydration reaction at the early age. This conclusion was verified by the thermometry test for hydration temperature.",

The particle size distribution (PSD) of each of the three components was varied by using different grinding times, and the consequences on heat release, strength development, pore structure and phase assemblage development were investigated up to 28 d. Higher fineness of both clinker and calcined clay can considerably improve compressive strength at all ages, while limestone fineness only plays a role at early age.

Plain cement paste is not much affected by chloride except for increased solubilisation of cement solids, but chloride is detrimental to the passivation of embedded steel. Emphasis is placed on establishing the underlying physicochemical concepts and mechanisms of corrosion, and integrating these into a holistic picture. Simplistic calculations and test conditions probably do not reproduce well the complex reactions with cement components occurring at the steel–cement interface and the concept of a ‘threshold' – defined in terms of a critical chloride content or chloride:hydroxide ratio – is just an approximation at best: other cement components are involved, as is the oxygen activity at the interface. Chloride binding can retard the migration of chloride in concrete and specimen calculations are presented showing that the main binding mechanism arises from the AFm, [Ca 2 (Al,Fe)(OH) 6 ].X.nH 2 O, content of the paste.

This is one of the relevant functions that multifunctional composites are able to develop when a conductive addition is included in the cement matrix. Strain sensing refers to the ability of a structural material to sense its own condition, such as strain or stress, through the piezoresistive behaviour (change of volume electrical resistivity when it is subjected to a force). CNTs, which possess exceptional electromechanical properties, are considered as a promising addition for practical applications such as structural health and load monitoring. Nevertheless, there is still an important challenge regarding CNT cement composite fabrication: achieving their effective dispersion. This point is addressed by means of a comparison between different physical and chemical dispersion methods. The technique used for that purpose is light-scattering particle size analysis. After selecting the optimal dispersing procedure, the effect on the strain-sensing properties of CNT reinforced cement pastes was studied for the following variables: CNT dosage, curing age, current intensity, loading rate and maximum stress applied. All these parameters are discussed taking gauge factor value as the reference.",

    "abstract": "Calcium sulfoaluminate cements are promising low carbon dioxide alternatives to Portland cement. Their main hydration products are ettringite and aluminium hydroxide. Ettringite has recently been identified as a potential heat storage material. The reversible dehydration of ettringite to metaettringite at elevated temperatures and under dry conditions involves a relatively high enthalpy, which can be used for (seasonal) heat storage. In this context, the effect of elevated temperatures (up to 110°C) and humidity conditions (steam curing and dry curing) on the stability of ettringite in calcium sulfoaluminate was studied experimentally using thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and thermodynamic modelling. The experimental results show that ettringite decomposes under steam curing conditions at temperatures far below 100°C to monosulfate. This may lead to delayed ettringite formation when the temperature is lowered again under humid or wet conditions. Under dry conditions at low water vapour saturation, the expected dehydration of ettringite to metaettringite is found. A thermodynamic model for the stability of hydrated calcium sulfoaluminate cements based on cement composition and calculations of thermodynamic equilibria has been established. The modelled phase development under different hygro-thermal conditions agrees well with the experimental findings. Stable heating and drying conditions for calcium sulfoaluminate based heat storage materials could be identified.",

All systems showed expansion, and expansion was found to increase with increasing gypsum content. The sample with M = 2 showed a high expansion and severe cracking after 1 d of hydration. Based on the pore solution chemistry, crystallisation pressures were calculated, which revealed that not only ettringite, but also the other hydrate phases present (aluminium hydroxide (AH 3 ), strätlingite, calcium aluminate decahydrate (CAH 10 ), monosulfate) may contribute to the total crystallisation pressure. The percolation pore radii obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry were used to calculate hydrostatic tensile stresses. It was found that in all investigated systems the hydrostatic tensile stresses exceeded the 1 d tensile strength, which is in line with the fact that all samples showed expansion.",

The surfaces of compacted ettringite pellets, like loose powders, decompose to mixtures of calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate hydrate (both gypsum and hemihydrate), alumina gel and water but the interior of pellets retain water with the result that recrystallization occurs and AFm forms.

Ettringite formation was retarded when hydration was carried out in KOH solutions whose concentrations were as high as 2·0M. Solutions with KOH concentrations between 0·5 and 1 . OM have the greatest retarding effect. In spite of the retarding effect of KOH, ettringite was observed to form at 80°C in 2·OM KOH. Hydration in solutions with KOH concentrations greater than 0·5M also produced syngenite. When C 3 A is hydrated with gypsum in the presence of C 3 S, ettringite, C-S-H and CH were formed in the absence of KOH. Hydration of 80% C 3 S, 10% C 3 A and 10% gypsum in 0·5M KOH solution was adequate to essentially eliminate the formation of ettringite. Rather, calcium hydroxide and C-S-H containing sulphate and aluminate were formed. Thus the preferred phases when hydration occurs in KOH are C-S-H and CH; whereas the preferred phases for hydration in water are C-S-H, CH and ettringite. Thus, the elimination of ettringite formation by high-temperature curing requires the presence of hydrating C 3 S. The observations made in studying these model systems are used as the basis for the development of a mechanism of delayed ettringite formation in cement. They are also used in describing a relationship between delayed ettringite formation and the alkali-silica reaction.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) paste is prepared by mixing dead-burned magnesia powder and potassium di-hydrogen phosphate with a proper proportion of water. The paste demonstrates superior performance such as fast setting, high early-strength, low shrinkage and good bonding which makes MPC suitable for applications in the rapid repair of infrastructures. However, it has been found that MPC easily sets in a few minutes and thus causes difficulties in manipulation. Therefore, how to retard and control the setting time of MPC becomes a challenging problem in both scientific and engineering fields. The setting time of MPC is greatly influenced by the reactivity of magnesia. A reliable, effective and economic test method has been developed to measure the reactivity of magnesia. In the present study, two kinds of magnesia, namely, high-reactivity magnesia and low-reactivity magnesia were blended in order to adjust the setting process of MPC. The effects of blending ratio and molar ratio of magnesia to phosphate and borax addition on setting time and compressive strength of MPC cement paste were investigated. Finally, the reaction product and reaction mechanism were examined and discussed.",

Different aggressive chemical solution conditions were used, to which the samples were exposed for up to 12 months and then tested for strength and microstructure.

In order to investigate the reinforcement mechanism, this work studied the effect of GNPs on the hydration behaviour of Portland cement through an experimental investigation with isothermal calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The results indicate that the addition of GNPs has little effect on the cement hydration process and the degree of hydration. As revealed by scanning electron microscopy and mini-slump tests, the GNPs were mechanically dispersed in the cement matrix. Special attention was paid to the physical functions between GNPs and cement and a possible mechanism is proposed to explain the formation pathway for GNP–cement composites.

Amino trimethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP) is used as a modifier. Coal fly ash is added as a filler to the magnesium oxysulfate cement in order to further reduce its production cost. The compressive strength, setting time, phase compositions, micro-morphology and volume stability of the modified magnesium oxysulfate cement are comprehensively analysed. The results indicate that the compressive strength of the modified magnesium oxysulfate cement reaches 82·1 MPa when the molar ratio of the active magnesium oxide/sulfuric acid (MgO/H 2 SO 4 ) (M) is 6, the water/cement ratio (R) is 0·6 and the ATMP and coal fly ash dosages are 0·2% and 50%, respectively. Low ATMP doses markedly affect the microstructure, hydration and shrinkage of the magnesium oxysulfate cement. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses prove that the needle-like magnesium hydroxide sulfate hydrate – 5Mg(OH) 2 ·MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O crystal (5·1·7 phase) – is the predominant strength phase in this cement system.",

An assessment of the thermal properties was made during the first 28 d of curing of the composites and compressive strength tests were conducted after 7 and 28 d. For pore structure characterisation, mercury pore structure analysis was carried out on the pure aerogel, the cement composites and the composites with the addition of granulate. The data obtained indicate that adding aerogel particles to concrete composites is an appropriate method of improving thermal parameters: thermal conductivity coefficients were two times smaller compared with control samples without aerogel and, simultaneously, the volumetric specific heat was comparable to that of the control samples. However, the addition of aerogel resulted in a reduction in compressive strength to approximately only 30% of that of the control samples.",

These binders may be calcium aluminate cements, calcium sulfoaluminate cements and also belite calcium sulfo-aluminate (BCSA) cements. The structure of stratlingite is known from single-crystal studies of tiny minerals but their bulk formation, crystal structure and microstructure of powders is poorly understood. This paper reports on the synthesis of stratlingite and a complete structural and microstructural characterisation by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy and thermal analyses. The structural and microstructural models have important implications for a correct quantitative phase analysis of stratlingite in cement pastes (for instance, in pastes of BCSA cements). The microstructure of stratlingite formed in cement pastes is highly dependent on the hydration conditions. In BCSA pastes, the (003) line position of stratlingite appears slightly shifted towards higher diffracting angles (lower inter-layered distance) after stopping hydration compared to that of a similar phase present in a paste analysed without stopping hydration. This is related to dehydration and disorder. This shift and peak broadening is even larger when the paste has suffered partial dehydration during curing (apart from stopping hydration). A microstructural study is presented.",

Conventional two-part alkali activation has many drawbacks, including that the activating solution is viscous, problematic and is not user friendly to handle. Thus, the aim of this research is to produce a one-part alkali-activated metakaolin/natural pozzolan, by using an earth alkaline source (rich in calcium oxide) from waste material (lime kiln dust), as an activating precursor to break the alumina-silicate crystalline phases. Thermal treatment of materials at two levels of treatment (450°C and 950°C) was used as an assisted activation approach. Analytical techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, were utilised to investigate the performance of the developed materials at a molecular level. Reduction of crystalline peaks, as well as the appearance of new wollastonite minerals within the calcined lime kiln dust, contributed to the development of 27 MPa compressive strength after 28 days. The dissolution that occurred through the pozzolanic reaction as well as thermal treatment evidently contributed to transform crystalline to amorphous phases.",

When 10% of FA is replaced by metakaolin, the compressive strength of LWGP increases by 5.5%–40.4%, and the residual strength after sulfate attack, freeze-thaw cycle and high temperature treatment is significantly improved. Using a small amount of metakaolin effectively mitigates the negative impact of WTA on the performance of LWGP. Utilizing WTA effectively reduces the total cost and carbon emission of LWGP production. Compared to plain LWGP, the mixtures with 15%–45% WTA exhibit a relative reduction in cost and carbon emission by 4.5%–13.4% and 1.3%–4.0%, respectively. Although the inclusion of metakaolin escalates both the cost and carbon emissions, its incorporation significantly enhances the overall performance of LWGP.",

Chemical shrinkage was carried out in 200 ml containers on water-covered 12 mm thick layers of paste, and the volume changes were monitored using 1 ml graduated pipettes. Autogenous shrinkage and expansion were determined by monitoring the dimensional changes of 285 × 25 × 25 mm paste bars, in, respectively, a sealed environment and in water. Volume changes are converted to millilitres per gram of binder for all three systems for purposes of comparison. Chemical shrinkage was found to increase for compositions between 0 and 15% MK and then decrease for compositions above 15% MK. Autogenous shrinkage was found to increase for compositions between 0 and 10% MK and then decrease for compositions above 15% MK. Expansion showed little variation for compositions between 0 and 10% MK and then increased for compositions above 15% MK.

This development is described along with the thermodynamic processes which either enhance the formation of alite by lowering its free energy, or inhibit the formation of alite by lowering the free energy of belite. These processes are always present to some extent depending on the concentrations of minor components in the raw materials and fuels, but can be specifically targeted by the controlled addition of effective mineralisers such as fluoride. This allows further increases in clinker output and reduction in fuel consumption, but perhaps more importantly allows higher contents of supplementary cementitious materials in composite cements for the same cement performance. The same approach can be used to produce new low temperature clinker types such as those based on the so-called Klein's phase.",

The addition of ACS, SF and CKD as partially replaced GGBFS is investigated so as to improve the mechanical and microstructural properties of the geopolymer mix. Compressive strength tests and scanning electron microscopy were utilised in these studies. Materials were prepared using water/binder of 0·30 at 38°C and 100% relative humidity (RH). Results showed that geopolymer materials prepared using alkali-activated slag exhibit large changes in compressive strength with increasing fired temperature from 300 to 1000°C and possess an enhancement in thermal stability as compared to concrete specimens. Replacement of GGBFS by 15% ACS resists thermal deterioration up to 1000°C. It was suggested to be suitably applied in refractory insulation applications as well as for production of concrete nuclear reactors. On the other hand, geopolymer mixes exhibit low stability when subjected to different concentrations of a mix of nitric and hydrochloric acid in equal parts (1:1).

The hydration mechanism of the resulting ACSA cement was investigated experimentally using quantitative X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry, as well as by thermodynamic modelling. During the first hours, mainly alite reacts. Ye'elimite starts to dissolve significantly after 2 d, as it is predominately present as inclusions within the alite matrix and thus reacts only after sufficient alite has dissolved to expose the ye'elimite domains within the clinker particles. The main hydration products are calcium–silicate–hydrates (C–S–H), ettringite, monosulfate and portlandite. Mortars prepared using the ACSA cement rapidly develop compressive and flexural strength at early ages corresponding to the fast hydration reactions.

The study demonstrates that sulfur trioxide is readily sequestered into cement clinker in a standard rotary kiln; however, some scrubbing of the exit gas may still be required. As the products of scrubbing (anhydrite or gypsum) are usually required to optimise the cement formulation, the recovered sulfur product can find an immediate use in the final cement product.

The results showed that, while the more highly damaged samples displayed the greatest decrease in ultrasonic velocity, they also displayed initial accelerated healing, which implies an increased quantity of individual cracks in the more damaged samples rather than an increase in individual crack widths.

Test results show that the AAB with additives gives high bond strength which is similar to the use of RMs. Bond strength between PCC substrate and AAB with additives is improved, due to increased reaction products, especially calcium–silicate–hydrate gel. However, the CH replacement at 15% shows a large amount of calcite resulting in a reduction in bond strength. The failure patterns and fracture interface images of the tested specimens also demonstrate the quality of the developed bond strength. It is shown that the interface zone of PCC substrate and AAB is homogeneous with no visible gap between the two bonding surfaces.

    "abstract": "The hydration, microstructure and mechanical performance of calcium belite–ye'elimite–ferrite cements were investigated by a multi-method approach. The early hydration was found to be dominated by the reaction of ye'elimite, calcium sulfate and calcium aluminate phases. The hydrates formed were mainly ettringite and an X-ray diffraction (XRD)-amorphous phase composed of CAH 10 and alumina hydroxide. The later reaction of belite resulted in the formation of strätlingite and phase transformations mainly occurring within the XRD-amorphous phases. These processes modified the initial microstructure and the resulting mechanical performance. The micromechanical modelling used in this work contributes to understanding of the performance origin and reveals the role of individual hydrates in volume filling and strength evolution.",

    "abstract": "Using glass fibres to reinforce cement-based materials (CBMs) has great effects on their fresh behaviours. In addition, the impact of water – particularly the average water film thickness (AWFT) – on the fresh properties of CBMs cannot be ignored. However, the combined effects of glass fibre content and AWFT on the fresh characteristics of CBMs are not satisfactorily understood. Therefore, in this study, mortar mixtures with varying fibre/cement (f/c) ratios and water/cement ratios were prepared and subjected to mini V-funnel tests, mini slump flow tests, stone rod adhesion tests, sieve segregation tests and wet packing tests. The AWFTs of the mortar mixes were also determined. The experimental results indicated that the f/c ratio (fibre content) had a noticeable influence on the fresh properties, packing density and AWFT. Modelling analysis demonstrated strong correlations of the workability, flowability, adhesiveness and cohesiveness with the f/c ratio and the AWFT. In other words, both the AWFT and the fibre content collectively serve as governing factors influencing the fresh behaviours of mortars reinforced with glass fibre.",

When the coordination number of calcium decreases to 5, the short-range order of the structure is disrupted and ettringite becomes X-ray-amorophous.

The blended cements were based on the two Portland cements with partial replacement by ground granulated blast furnace slag, GGBFS (60%), pulverized fuel ash, PFA (30%) and blast and a Mexican volcanic ash (22%). An increase in the temperature of hydration brought about initial acceleration of all five cement systems, as indicated by the increased magnitude of the maximum of peak II and shifts to earlier times. There was a clear contribution from the GGBFS to the heat evolution curves of the blended cement incorporating GGBFS, which increased with increasing temperature. By way of contrast, there was no enhancement of the cement hydration in the early stages of hydration in the case of the PFA blended cement, and the appearance of peak II was slightly retarded. The incorporation of volcanic ash had little effect on the initial hydration, but gave an additional peak after peak II, similar to that observed in the GGBFS system. At this stage, the total heat evolved was greater than that in the corresponding neat cement, especially at 20°C. It has also been demonstrated that alkali activation of GGBFS and volcanic ash was readily brought about by NaOH at 40°C. The enhanced activity observed in the Portland cement–volcanic ash system is attributed to activation of the ash by the portlandite liberated during the early hydration of alite.",

The adsorption behaviour leads to an increase in particle size in the cement and asphalt emulsion (CAE) system. In the present study, a laser particle size analyser was employed to characterise the particle size variation, and the results indicated that the cement/asphalt emulsion ratio (C/AE) and types of asphalt emulsion had great influence on the particle size in the CAE system. Within the same period, the particle size increased more prominently with a larger C/AE, but when the C/AE exceeded 0·625, it had little influence on the particle size increase after 30 and 60 min. The particle size and its increasing magnitude during different periods in the cement–cationic asphalt emulsion system were both greater than those in the cement–anionic asphalt emulsion system. The viscosity test indicated that particle size increase led to the loss of flowability of the CAE system. A filtration method was used to investigate the adsorption behaviour of asphalt droplets to the cement grains and the adsorption ratio was correlated with the variation in particle size, indicating that the particle size increase in the CAE system was mainly attributed to this adsorption behaviour.",

However, its proper use is a great concern because its over-dosage could lead to drastic reduction in the cohesiveness of concrete. Furthermore, experience has indicated that the SP demand, saturation dosage and dosage causing segregation are highly dependent on the powder content and therefore the effects of SP are not simple functions of dosage. This study aims to evaluate the effects of SP dosage on the fresh properties of cement paste containing condensed silica fume (CSF). A number of cement paste samples with different SP dosages and CSF contents were tested. The results showed that the addition of SP would improve the packing density, flowability and rheology but impair the cohesiveness of cement paste. It would also render the cement paste shear thickening. To cater for the effects of powder fineness, it is proposed that the SP dosage should be measured in terms of the quantity of SP per surface area of the powder content.",

Addition of alkali metal salts both accelerates the setting time of CAC and deteriorates long-term strengths in the order of decreasing ionic radius of the metals. The effect of alkaline earth metal salts on setting behaviour depends on the amount of addition: low concentrations retard, but high concentrations accelerate setting behaviour. Calcium is found to have the strongest acceleration effect with the lowest deterioration in strength.

The cements were produced using a neutral granulated blast-furnace slag and sodium carbonate. To accelerate strength development at ambient temperatures, a combination of silica fume and slaked lime was used as accelerating admixture in the cement's formulation. Powder sodium lingosulfonate was added into the formulation to reduce the water demand of the cements; it also delayed setting and increased compressive strength. Alkali-activated slag concretes were produced using the developed cements. Compressive strengths in the range from 30 to 85 MPa were achieved for the concretes at 28 d. The accelerating admixture increased 1-d compressive strength for the alkali-activated slag concretes cured at ambient temperature up to 25 MPa. The optimum concentration of sodium carbonate was equivalent to 3·5% and 4·5% sodium oxide (Na 2 O) for precast and in situ application, respectively. The accelerating admixture is recommended at 6% for dry powder alkali-activated slag cements. The accelerated ageing test showed that the dry powder alkali-activated slag cement had a sufficient shelf life.",

Cylindrical specimens were tested under uniaxial compression to investigate the stress–strain behaviour of hybrid-fibre composites with particular focus on the impact of matrix strength and steel fibre content. The experimental results indicated that the mechanical properties of hybrid-fibre systems were improved with increasing content of steel fibre, and this enhancement became more and more pronounced with increasing matrix strength. The impact of additional steel fibre on compressive parameters, such as compressive strength, strain corresponding to peak stress, elastic modulus and toughness index, were also strongly influenced by the matrix strength. Positive responses due to steel fibre were reduced with decreasing matrix strength, and even transformed into a negative effect in a low-strength matrix. When considering both high strength and toughness, a moderate amount of steel fibres was favourable. Furthermore, a simple analytical model especially for hybrid-fibre-reinforced ECC was proposed to give satisfactory predictions of the complete stress–strain behaviour.

    "abstract": "Gypsum is usually considered to be one of the main corrosion products during sulfate attack and its negative role has been widely investigated. However, conditions necessary for the formation condition of gypsum are limited and many structures are located at neutral pH. This paper investigates the influence of pH on the formation of gypsum. The system of CaO-SO 3 -Na 2 O-H 2 O was designed to analyse the precipitation of calcium ions with sulfate ions as gypsum in solutions at different pH conditions. Meanwhile, cement mortars were immersed in sulfate solutions at high pH and neutral pH. The products formed in the system of CaO-SO 3 -Na 2 O-H 2 O were examined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a laser scanning confocal microscope. Besides appearance and compressive strength, products formed in mortars during sulfate attack were also investigated with XRD and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that low pH is beneficial for gypsum formation and promotes the growth of gypsum crystals. Leached portlandite or decalcification of calcium-silicate-hydrate at neutral pH produced more free calcium ions and caused the formation of much more gypsum in interfacial transition zones or matrix, which resulted in the serious mortar damage.",

It is considered that nanoparticles such as nanosilica could act as a pozzolanic material as well as a seeding agent for nucleation and acceleration of the formation of the calcium silicate hydrate network. This work evaluates the effect of nanosilica on the calcium silicate hydrate network and microstructure of hardened ternary, quaternary and quinary system Portland cement based pastes. The quinary system, containing Portland cement, limestone, fly ash, microsilica and nanosilica, and ternary combinations (Portland cement, limestone and fly ash) showed mean calcium/silicon atomic ratios of the calcium silicate hydrate gel in the 28 d old hardened paste of 1·2 and 2·3 respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results show the presence of the bridging silicate tetrahedra (Q 2 ) characteristic of a peak at around 980 cm −1 and a shoulder at around 1060 cm −1 in the calcium silicate hydrate gel network of the ternary, quaternary and quinary combinations; these bands are thus more pronounced for the nanosilica-enhanced formulations. The sample obtained in the presence of microsilica and nanosilica (quinary combination) showed evidence of a more intricate calcium silicate hydrate gel network (bridging tetrahedra) characteristic of a honeycomb-like structure opposed to the ternary combination (control sample).",

The compactness and mechanical strength of RPC can be greatly improved by incorporating nanoparticles. The promotive ratio of flexural and compressive strength of RPC is up to 30%.

The presence of sulfate in the clinker is in the form of anhydrite, in addition to calcium sulfoaluminate. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of anhydrite on cement properties and the hydration process. Experimental results indicate that burning at 1270°C for 30 min is suitable for clinker production. The presence of anhydrite can prolong the setting time and improve the compressive strength. Compared with natural gypsum, anhydrite in the clinkers can promote the formation of ettringite. Results also show that the incorporation of phosphogypsum in the production of sulfate-rich belite sulfoaluminate cement is a promising way to utilise phosphogypsum.",

In treatment practices for this type of special ground, the general grouting materials used have a number of shortcomings, such as large consumption of materials and an unpredictable range of diffusion; it addition they are easily scoured by water. In this work a new grouting material was developed with pasty clay–cements to overcome the aforementioned problems with consideration of the specific structure and adverse environment of soft and loose ground. The rheological properties, setting times of the slurry and the mechanical characteristics of solidified grout stone were tested in a series of laboratory experiments. Compared with ordinary cement slurry and cement–clay slurry, the new material showed greater initial viscosity, adjustable thixotropy and setting time, a strong resistance to scour and a controllable diffusion range. An engineering application was analysed to illustrate that the new grouting material not only fulfils the requirements for grouting in soft and loose ground, but it can also be applied in soil layers with macrovoids as well as formations suffering from water soaking or scouring.",

A sub-solidus phase relation for the ternary system silicon dioxide–calcium oxide–phosphorus pentoxide (SiO 2 –CaO–P 2 O 5 ) is reported. The ternary system is based on Rietveld refinements of X-ray diffraction patterns from experimental tests. The overall picture is based on known phase diagrams, relevant Rietveld refinements models, stoichiometric relationships as a function of increasing phosphorus pentoxide concentration and vacancy theories for solid solutions of phosphate belites. A tool is developed for predicting the chemistry of the product as well as the chemistry during heating when producing Portland cement clinker. A thermodynamic database for phase chemistry calculations of clinkering reactions has been created and evaluated. Suitable compounds and solution species have been selected from the thermochemical database included in FactSage software. Some solution compositions have been uniquely designed to allow for the proper prediction of the cement clinker chemistry. The calculated results from the developed database for heating raw materials in cement clinker production and cooling of the product are presented in this paper. The calculated results provide a good prediction of the phases and quantities formed during heating and non-equilibrium cooling. The prediction of the amounts of alite, belite and aluminoferrite phases in the product according to the Scheil method is good. The temperature interval for the existence of all of the major phases is relevant. The thermodynamic data for a solution phase of alite with substituting ions of primarily magnesium oxide and phosphorus pentoxide would improve the predictability of the developed database.",

The crystallisation period was limited to 10 s only to study the initial crystals, which provide the anchoring sites for most admixtures in cement. It was found that, in the absence of polycarboxylate polymers, only few, but large (l ∼ 3·5 μm), hexagonal, prismatic ettringite crystals exhibiting numerous defects on their surfaces were formed. However, when polycarboxylate polymers were present during the crystallisation, then the crystal sizes decreased to ∼ 0·5–2·1 μm. Generally, crystal sizes were found to decrease with increasing specific anionic charge of the same kind of polycarboxylate polymer. Apparently, polymers exhibiting a higher affinity to the crystal surfaces of ettringite inhibit its growth more strongly and produce smaller crystals. Furthermore, the specific chemistry (base monomers) of the polycarboxylate also has an impact on the size of ettringite crystals.",

All of the specimens were then subjected to continuous moist curing for 150 d to evaluate self-healing performance. Mechanical property (modulus of rupture (MOR) and mid-span beam deflection) characterisations and ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements were used to assess self-healing capability. Experimental results showed that even under progressively increasing sustained mechanical loading, MOR results greater than the original values could be obtained, depending on mineral admixture selection. Although deflection results were more adversely affected by progressive sustained loading compared to MOR results, even the lowest deflection value obtained from different ECCs was still more than 100 times that of conventional concrete after healing. Under continuous moist curing, there were minimal changes in ultrasonic pulse velocity results of all ECCs subjected to progressively increasing sustained loading, so that recovery results similar to those of specimens without sustained loading were obtained, despite the fact that ultrasonic pulse velocity testing was not that sensitive in capturing the effects of self-healing.",

Besides the reduced carbon dioxide footprint, LCDF concrete offers other advantages such as reduced cost as well as improved dimensional stability due to reduced hydration heat, creep and shrinkage. Nevertheless, decreasing the quantity of CM has a negative impact on concrete workability. To restore workability, multi-sized fillers are advocated to replace aggregates and CM. Generally, fillers can improve the packing density of concrete due to the filling effect and thus more excess water or paste is available to facilitate spread and flow rate. Two types of fillers were examined in this study – limestone with particles smaller than 75 μm and foundry sand with particles of 75–400 μm. The particles of these two fillers are respectively similar and larger in size when compared with cement. Concrete mixes with no fillers and with mono- or multi-sized fillers were prepared and tested for flowability and strength. The results indicate that more superplasticiser is needed to achieve the same flowability when fillers are added. It was also found that, at the same water/CM ratio, fillers can improve concrete strength, and the use of multi-sized fillers can simultaneously improve the flowability and segregation resistance of concrete.",

The binary, SF10, majority of ternaries, SF10T10, SF10T20 and SF10P10, and air-entrained, SF10A3% and SF10T20P20A3% mixtures showed acceptable resistance against salt scaling with scaling lower than 0.8 kg/m2, as opposed to quaternaries.

    "abstract": "Superplasticizer (SP) are indispensable in modern concrete technology. This study presents a novel, cost-effective method for synthesizing a high-performance SP using coal-based humic acid (CHA) derived from lignite. Through oxidative depolymerization of lignite to prepare CHA, followed by sulfomethylation and condensation reactions, we have successfully developed a CHA-derived SP (SP(CHA)). Structural characterization confirmed the successful synthesis of CHA and its transformation into SP(CHA). Notably, CHA demonstrated superior sulfomethylation reactivity compared to commercially available solidum humate(NaA). Performance evaluations showed that the synthesized SP(CHA) outperformed both FDN (a commercial SP) and SP(NaA) in terms of water reduction efficiency, slump retention, and enhanced long-term compressive strength. Specifically, SP(CHA) achieved a water-reducing rate of 16.4% and a 28 days compressive strength improvement of 23.2%, exceeding the benchmarks for high-efficiency water reducers. By harnessing the abundant and low-cost lignite resource, the approach holds substantial promise for advancing sustainable construction practices.",

Considering the complexity of factors that affect the frost resistance of RAC, this study employed five neural network algorithms, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Radial Basis Function Network (RBFNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Regressor (RFR), along with two optimizations methods, Particle Swarm Optimation-Back Propagation (PSO-BPNN) and Genetic Algorithm-Back Propagation (GA-BPNN) to predict the frost resistance of RAC. A database was compiled from 616 mixes in peer-reviewed literature, with 8 variables affecting the freeze-thaw resistance of RAC were taken as inputs. The compressive strength, mass loss rate, and relative dynamic elastic modulus after freeze-thaw cycles were taken as outputs. The results show that the main factors affecting the freezing resistance of RAC were the number of freeze-thaw cycles, the replacement rate of recycled aggregates, crushing index and water-cement ratio. Among the seven algorithms, PSO-BPNN model has the best comprehensive prediction performance, with R 2 of predicted compressive strength reaching 0.9714. It provides reference value for further research on RAC frost resistance.",

In this study, three JS waterproofing coatings were developed by integrating styrene-acrylic emulsion (SA) with Portland cement (PC), white Portland cement (WPC), and sulphoaluminate cement (CSA), respectively. The tensile properties and water absorption of these coatings were evaluated. Additionally, the effect of SA on the hydration processes and products of the various cements was investigated using calorimetry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that JS waterproofing coatings formulated with PC and WPC exhibited superior elongation at break, while those incorporating CSA demonstrated significantly higher tensile strength and reduced water absorption. The addition of SA was found to significantly inhibit the dissolution of C 3 A and C 3 S phases in PC and WPC, thereby prolonging the induction period of cement hydration and reducing the formation of ettringite (AFt). In contrast, CSA exhibited rapid reactivity, with ion dissolution rates surpassing the adsorption capacity of SA, resulting in extensive AFt formation within JS waterproof coatings. These AFt crystals integrated into the coating's organic matrix, forming a reticulate network that enhanced tensile strength and significantly improved waterproofing performance.",

This study addresses some controversies by considering the combined effect of densification and volume expansion of C-S-H. Based on this concept, a constitutive law is proposed and incorporated into a numerical model. The model predicted well the various microstructural properties of cement paste (e.g. time-dependent bulk density of C-S-H, nitrogen-accessible surface area, capillary pore volume and quantities of various hydrates). Nitrogen adsorption tests (NATs) were performed to validate the numerical results. The SSA was found to have no clear relationship with the total pore volume measured by the NAT. However, the SSA showed an almost perfect linear relationship with porosity of finer pores (less than ∼8 nm). Therefore, it was concluded that only this portion of finer pores detected by nitrogen are ‘gel pores’ within low-density C-S-H, which truly reflects its growth. This redefinition and the findings of this work provide better understanding of the microstructural development of cementitious materials and more appropriate interpretation on the widely used NAT.",

Traditional reduction methods rely on costly, resource-intensive reducing agents derived from primary raw materials. This study presents a sustainable approach by synthesising ferrous sulfate from industrial iron-rich sludges and waste sulfuric acid to mitigate hexavalent chromium levels in Portland cement. Three types of iron-rich sludges, sourced from municipal wastewater treatment and steel manufacturing, were analysed using X-ray diffraction to identify their iron-bearing phases. Key parameters, including sludge grinding intensity, stirring rate, reaction time and temperature, were systematically optimised to enhance ferrous sulfate yields. Under optimal conditions, approximately 17 g of pure ferrous sulfate were produced from 10 g of sludge and 50 ml of 20% waste sulfuric acid, achieving a recycling efficiency of around 90%. Incorporating the synthesised ferrous sulfate into ordinary Portland cement reduced hexavalent chromium concentrations below 2 ppm, complying with Environmental Protection Agency, USA standards. This method demonstrates the feasibility of repurposing industrial waste to enhance cement’s environmental performance, offering a promising valorisation pathway for iron-rich sludges and waste acids. The approach is cost-effective and environmentally friendly, aligning with circular economic principles and promoting green innovations in industrial waste management.",

In this work, CG was obtained by calcining desulfurised gypsum with the addition of potassium aluminium sulfate dodecahydrate (KAl(SO 4 ) 2 .12H 2 O henceforth called PASD). The effects of calcination temperature and PASD content on the properties of the CG were systematically investigated and the morphological control mechanism of PASD on the CG was revealed. The properties of the CG were the optimum when desulfurised gypsum with 0.3% PASD was calcined at 170°C for 2 h. The initial and final setting times were 11.3 min and 15.2 min, respectively, and the flexural and compressive strengths at 2 h were 3.46 MPa and 9.38 MPa, respectively. The addition of PASD can promote the transformation of dihydrate gypsum into well-crystallised hemihydrate gypsum and regulate the morphology of hydration products. The addition of PASD not only caused the dihydrate gypsum to dehydrate and crack by layer, but also made the diameter of hydration products more uniform, thus improving the strength of the CG. High-quality CG will improve the performance of downstream building products, thereby broadening the utilisation of desulfurised gypsum.",

However, the chloride ions present in sea sand can increase the risk of rebar corrosion. Compared with traditional cements, AACMs may offer superior chloride ion binding capacity. Alkali-activated slag/sea sand (AASS) mortars with varying alkali dosages were prepared in this study. First, the mechanical properties of the AASS mortars were tested. Subsequently, electrochemical methods, including chloride ion fixation and pH analysis, were used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of rebars. The results showed that an increase in alkali dosage enhanced both the pH and the chloride ion fixation capacity, improving the corrosion potential, reducing the corrosion current density and increasing the polarisation resistance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests indicated optimal corrosion resistance at a 6% alkali dosage, with the best rebar passivation at this level. Analysis of hydration products revealed how the increased alkali dosage boosted chloride ion fixation and rebar corrosion resistance. The results of this work provide a theoretical basis for the application of AASS mortar in construction.",

Use of some admixtures such as silica fume and pulverized fuel ash (PFA) may further increase shrinkage. Blending Portland cement (PC) with metakaolin (MK) has shown expansive tendencies which may be applicable in suppressing early shrinkage. By blending MK with PFA partially to replace PC, shrinkage may be regulated. The current work is particularly directed towards regulation of autogenous shrinkage. Paste bars in which PC was replaced by up to 20% MK, 30% PFA and 30% MK plus PFA blends were monitored for autogenous shrinkage for up to 200 days during sealed moist curing at room temperature and 100% relative humidity. The results reported show reduced autogenous shrinkage, although cement type was also found to be an important factor in influencing shrinkage. The use of PC-MK-PFA blends should provide technological, economic and environmental advantages by reducing PC production and its associated greenhouse gas emissions, and improving concrete durability",

    "abstract": "Practical use of high performance concrete (w/c ≤ 0·40) has shown that it is sensitive to cracking at early ages. Based on a belief that early volume contraction due to chemical shrinkage is a driving force for cracking, experiments to determine total chemical shrinkage and external chemical shrinkage have been carried out on cement pastes in the w/c range 0·30-0·50 over a 48 h period, using two types of cements. Measurements of true external chemical shrinkage are very difficult to carry out because of the disturbance of bleeding. To avoid this, the samples were placed in very thin walled, elastic rubber containers and rotated continuously under water. The results show that the total chemical shrinkage was largely independent of w/c for the first 48 h, but occurred with a faster rate at lower w/c during the first 12 h. The external chemical shrinkage was equal to the total chemical shrinkage until it ‘flattened out’, demonstrating that a semi-rigid skeleton was established which led to empty contracting pores during further hydration (i.e. shrinkage). The ‘flattening out level’ (vol %) increased with decreasing w/c. Furthermore, the transition from fluid paste to semi-rigid skeleton was more gradual at lower water-to-cement ratios. It is proposed that both these effects of external chemical shrinkage indicate that high performance concrete is more sensitive to cracking at early ages under conditions of some degree of external restraint.",

The results showed that C-S-H, stratlingite and hydrogarnet were the main hydrated phases formed under these working conditions. On the other hand, the pore structure of the MK-blended pastes was refined. This demonstrates that there was no evidence of any conversion reaction from the hexagonal metastable phase to a stable cubic phase after 53 months of curing",

A previous paper presented a theoretical basis to improve the Whiting set-up and to convert it into a reliable method for the calculation of chloride diffusion coefficients. The approach was based on the fundamentals of electrochemistry regarding transport in electrolytes, by use of the Nemst—Planck and Nemst—Einstein equations. In this Paper preliminary experimental results are presented and natural diffusion and migration tests are compared.

A further aim was to compare the influence of different slags in relation to the formation of sulphoaluminate and the other clinker phases required. The behaviour of high temperature reactions was investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mineralogical observations were carried out through X-ray powder diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Three different mixtures and a single ladle slag were prepared using modified Bogue calculations, which are characterised by the assessment of a potential phase composition in order to produce belite-rich cement activated with sulphoaluminate. The results so far prove that steelmaking slags have the potential to be used as raw material, since sulphoaluminate along with polymorphs of dicalcium silicate and ferrite phases were detected after firing at 1200°C in an air atmosphere.",

In addition, it has been used to evaluate the potential for results of chemical interaction with external solutions or with other concrete materials (such as alkali-reactive aggregates). Once related to physical durability test data, knowledge of the pore solution composition in combination with the nature of the solid phases present can be used to predict the potential for future durability-related chemical interactions. This paper discusses three areas where the usefulness of pore solution analysis has been instrumental in increasing the understanding of concrete durability issues related to: (a) alkali binding as it affects alkali–silica reaction (ASR), (b) chloride-binding as it affects reinforcement corrosion resistance, and (c) delayed ettringite formation (DEF).",

In this study, the effect of up to 2% potassium sulfate on two types of PCE composed of different molar ratios of methacrylic acid (MA) and methoxy-polyethylene glycol methacrylate ester (MPEG-MA) was studied, and the mechanism behind the effect of sulfate was investigated. Mini slump tests revealed that the dispersing ability of both PCEs was negatively impacted by sulfate, with the less anionic PCE being more affected than the more anionic one. This result coincided with adsorption and zeta potential measurements. These indicate that in the presence of high sulfate concentrations, the less anionic PCE adsorbs in lower amounts. A mechanistic study revealed that, contrary to previous findings by other authors, the PCE molecules do not significantly shrink and coil in the presence of elevated sulfate concentrations. Instead, it was observed that the delayed addition of potassium sulfate leads to desorption of already adsorbed PCE. Accordingly, competitive adsorption between PCE molecules and sulfate ions takes place. PCEs exhibiting higher grafting density are more negatively affected in their dispersing ability than PCEs showing higher anionic character. Thus, the latter are less sensitive to variations in cement composition.",

These measurements were complemented by characterising the prehydrated anhydrous cement using isothermal calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetric analysis. Following prehydration at 60% RH, conventional hydration resulted in a negligible reduction in strength development plus a decrease in workability and increase in setting time.

The compressive strength and alkali–silica reaction (ASR) expansion was also tested. The test results indicated that GP can increase the compressive strength of cement pastes and control the ASR expansion of mortars. With the increase in GP content, ASR expansion decreases sharply, although compressive strength decreases a little with a large amount of GP. The characteristic pore sizes decreased with some capillary pores transforming to interstitial pores or gel pores as GP content increased. GP could diminish pore size in cement pastes, which has important significance in improving durability. Incorporating GP in cement-based materials had little effect on the kinds of hydration products, but it significantly affected the amount of hydrates, especially calcium hydroxide. The amount of calcium hydroxide reduces with the increase in curing age and GP content. The microstructure of hardened pastes containing GP was relatively dense with an abundance of calcium silicate hydrate, whose morphology was different from the gel in pure cement systems. This kind of calcium silicate hydrate gel with a low calcium/silicon ratio had a network structure formed by irregular stumpy and lamelliform gel granules. GP has high pozzolanic activity.",

The slag grain-size grinding and the heat treatment in saturated vapour pressure autoclave conditions were investigated to study the compressive strength behaviour of the new material. This substitution induces a decrease in compressive strength. The reaction products consist mainly of 11 nm tobermorite and xonotlite. The X-ray diffractions of these phases are difficult to see. The slag seems more reactive with lime than quartz. Observations with the scanning electron microscope allow better appreciation of these crystallites.

Ettringite is the major hydrate phase precipitated in the early stages of hydration in these systems and may be formed by three different main reaction pathways. To investigate the process of these mechanisms, the hydration of four different ternary blends were examined by means of heat flow calorimetry, in situ X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. For the CSA-rich mixes, it was found that hydration in the first 48 h is only subject to the behaviour of ye'elimite and anhydrite dissolution and the resulting formation of ettringite. In the system with the highest OPC proportion, the initial hydration kinetics were found to be more rapid, leading to very high ettringite quantities in the first couple of hours. With the dissolution of the anhydrous OPC phases, more ettringite is formed by the hydration of C 3 A and the consumption of AH 3 stemming from the hydration of ye'elimite and calcium provided by the dissolution of C 3 S. In the OPC-rich mixes, more than 50% of the formed ettringite can be attributed to this coupled reaction pathway.",

Fly ashes collected directly from different sources are used in the study.

The increase in the concentration of ions in the alkaline solution is primarily associated with the dissolution of the glassy phase and the crystalline content of fly ash is largely unaffected by the alkaline exposure. The increase in the concentration of Si in the solution relative to the concentration of Al is not influenced by the solution molarity or the temperature. The glass that contains Ca is more reactive and dissolves earlier than the aluminosilicate glass present within the fly ash. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the fly ash glassy phase is adequately fit using a single pseudo-Voigt (PV) peak. The peak position of the PV fit is invariant of the dissolution of the glassy phase and an intensity-based measure of the X-ray diffraction analysis intensity pattern with the PV fit provides an accurate estimate of the undissolved glassy content present in the fly ash.",

Cement pastes were immersed in 0·031 mol/l (0·44 wt%) and 0·352 mol/l (5 wt%) sodium sulfate solutions at 20°C for up to 900 d. The surface appearance, mass change and compressive strengths of the cement pastes were investigated during the sulfate attack process. Mineral phases formed in the surface layer and the inner portion of the cement pastes were investigated with X-ray diffraction at different stages of deterioration. Scanning electron microscopy was used to further examine cement paste microstructures after immersion in 0·352 mol/l sodium sulfate solutions for 180, 300, 600 and 900 d. The results showed that the deterioration in cement pastes first occurred in the surface area and then gradually extended to the inner portions. Ettringite was the main product at the initial attack stage, while gypsum was formed at later stages. The formation of fine ettringite resulted in volume expansion of the cement pastes. Gypsum was formed as veins that were sub-parallel to the surface. Ultimately, gypsum formation was accompanied by the decalcification of calcium silicate hydrate, causing softening of the external cement paste layer.",

All of the specimens were then subjected to continuous moist curing for 150 d to evaluate self-healing performance. Mechanical property (modulus of rupture (MOR) and mid-span beam deflection) characterisations and ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements were used to assess self-healing capability. Experimental results showed that even under progressively increasing sustained mechanical loading, MOR results greater than the original values could be obtained, depending on mineral admixture selection. Although deflection results were more adversely affected by progressive sustained loading compared to MOR results, even the lowest deflection value obtained from different ECCs was still more than 100 times that of conventional concrete after healing. Under continuous moist curing, there were minimal changes in ultrasonic pulse velocity results of all ECCs subjected to progressively increasing sustained loading, so that recovery results similar to those of specimens without sustained loading were obtained, despite the fact that ultrasonic pulse velocity testing was not that sensitive in capturing the effects of self-healing.",

    "abstract": "Calcium aluminate cements (CACs) are used in combination with calcium sulfates as binders in self-levelling mortars. The influence of commercial CAC/anhydrite ratio on the solid phase assemblage and pore solution at water to binder (w/b) ratios of 0·40 and 0·72 was investigated between 1·5 h and 91 d of hydration using a multi-method approach including x-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and thermodynamic calculations. The reduction of the extent of hydration at the lower w/b ratio can be explained by a lack of water for complete hydration and lack of space. In the system with a CAC/anhydrite weight ratio of 1, ettringite and AH 3 were the main hydration products, whereas in the case of a CAC/anhydrite ratio of 2·3, in addition to ettringite and AH 3 , monosulfate was present along with strätlingite and at a later age. In contrast to the thermodynamic modelling results, anhydrite persisted even at low calcium sulfate contents as the precipitation of AH 3 around the anhydrite grains seemed to lead to a chemical blocking.",

    "abstract": "Owing to its exceptional physical properties, silica aerogel is regarded as an attractive candidate material for building insulation applications; however, the widespread adoption of silica aerogel is limited by its inherently brittle nature and related sub-micrometre dust release. In this paper, the poor mechanical properties of silica aerogel were improved by combining the silica phase and cementitious materials to reach engineering strong composites and maintain relatively low thermal conductivity. The mechanical properties, durability (freeze–thaw resistance, water resistance and drying shrinkage) and thermal conductivity of the silica aerogel–cement composites were comprehensively studied. The composites show improved mechanical properties as compared to pure silica aerogel, but this decreases with the increase of silica aerogel content. With respect to the durability, surprisingly, the silica aerogel can efficiently improve the frost and water resistance of the composite, which might be benefited by the strong hydrophobicity of the silica aerogel. The optimal performance of the composite is observed at 60 vol.% aerogel loading. The thermal conductivity, compressive strength, flexural strength and bonding force are 0·065 W/(m/K), 3·81 MPa, 2·23 MPa and 0·27 MPa, respectively, and the drying shrinkage of the composite is only 0·12% after 90 d.",

The experimental results showed that the MOS cement prepared by dolomite ores at the calcination temperature of 850°C for 30 min with the α-magnesium oxide/magnesium sulfate molar ratio of 4 demonstrates better mechanical properties than those made in other circumstances.

In this work, the mechanical properties of MOCC (setting time and compressive and flexural strengths) were tested. The rules governing the phase composition and microstructure changes of the hydration products were analysed using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that MOCC solidifies rapidly, has high early compressive and flexural strengths and exhibits excellent long-term mechanical properties, far superior to those of the same grade of C20 PCC. The main phase at different curing times was found to be 5Mg(OH) 2 .MgCl 2 .8H 2 O (5.1.8). With hydration from 7 to 365 d, the amount of 5.1.8 fluctuated between 30% and 37% and the microscopic crystal morphology of the MOCC changed significantly. Importantly, fibre-like and rod-like crystals were observed to transform into their respective gel phases from 180 to 270 d. This phenomenon explains the fact that the content of 5.1.8 was the lowest but the mechanical strength of MOCC was the highest at 180 and 270 d. It was also confirmed that 5.1.8 gel is one of the main strength phases.",

Results show that the cement hydration regime is greatly altered by the alkanolamines, depending on their types and dosages. At the dosage of 0.5%, the aluminate reactions, including the formation of AFt and the reaction of C 4 AF, are greatly accelerated, and consequently the silicate hydration is retarded. Compared to DEIPA, TEA increases the [Al] in pore solution, probably due to the stronger complexation with aluminate ions (Al(OH) 4 − ), while DEIPA notably enhances the dissolution of C 4 AF after depletion of gypsum, suggesting a stronger complexation with iron ions (Fe 3+ ). Through a comparison of the hydration of pure alite and cement systems, it is found that the effects of the two alkanolamines on cement hydration are primarily influenced by their impacts on the aluminate reaction.",

The associated mineralogical changes have modified the microstructure of the altered region and there is clear evidence of increased porosity in the zone of portlandite dissolution. Additionally, experiments conducted at 85°C show the presence of a narrow Mg-Al-Si rich band in the clay close to the contact. Analyses indicate the formation of a di-phasic (Mg-aluminate hydroxide and Mgsilicate hydroxide) gel with low crystallinity and compositions close to hydrotalcite and sepiolite, respectively. Reactive transport modelling has been used to simulate phase transformations within the active region and relate these to porosity changes based on simple molar volume considerations. Given the close coupling of mineral chemistry and microstructure in cement±clay systems, such an approach is regarded as essential if reliable estimates are to be made of long-term reactivity.",

The quantitative measurement using α-Al 2 O 3 as a reference phase, revealed that the decomposition of C-S-H started at 560°C but became significant only above 600°C. The C-S-H decomposition rate increased dramatically with temperatures above 600°C. The decomposition of C-S-H influenced the strength loss of high-performance concrete (HPC) exposed to temperatures above 600°C but had little or no effect on the occurrence of explosive spalling. This test result confirms the vapour pressure mechanism for explosive spalling of HPC. It is also postulated that the strength loss of concrete exposed to temperatures below 600°C must be mainly caused by the HCP pore-structure coarsening.",

This was achieved by preparing a blend of 75% gypsum with a 25% mixture of Portland cement and silica fume. An optimum silica fume—Portland cement ratio of 0·25-0.66 provided a system with strength levels twice as high as those of pure gypsum. The system also exhibited a high wet/dry strength ratio of ∼60 % after 200 days of water immersion. This improvement was explained by the reduction in ettringite formation and the development of a microstructure in which gypsum crystals were engulfed by CSH.",

The carbonation of CSH and calcium hydroxide occurs simultaneously, but a residue of calcium hydroxide carbonates more slowly.

In this paper, a self-weight consolidation model is proposed to explain this phenomenon. This model arises from the observation that, in the usual range of water/cement ratio by volume of 10-2-0, the concentration of cement paste is high and the cement particles are expected to be in close contact with each other, thus suggesting the presence of inter-particle forces. This is akin to the concept of effective stress in soil mechanics. The existence of such forces implies that bleeding must be governed by consolidation and not sedimentation as previously thought. Two series of tests were conducted and the results compared with the theoretical predictions. The very good agreement represents an improvement over traditional sedimentation models and suggests that the bleeding phenomenon may indeed be governed by the mechanics of consolidation.",

Pyrogene oxides are highly reactive pozzolanic nanoscale additives. They react much faster pozzolanically than other commonly used pozzolans and in this way they consume the available calcium hydroxide in a much shorter time. It is shown by using in situ X-ray transmission microscopy, pH-change measurements and the strength property results that Aerosil begins to react as early as the first hour of contact with both the added calcium hydroxide in solution and with the products of the tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) hydration reaction. In comparison with the other commonly used pozzolans, that is, silica fume, pyrogene oxides contribute by developing a better early and final strength. The concrete specimens that were cast by combining silica fume with small quantities of Aerosil were considered to belong to the ultra high performance class and were additionally characterised by finer pores and reduced total porosity.",

Portland cement is an important constituent of constructional concrete but its production emits about 0·8 t of carbon dioxide per tonne and Portland cement must now be considered together with alternative binders if environmental impacts of construction are to be reduced. The present paper addresses this sustainability issue and places the current position, in which Portland cements are commonly blended with supplementary cementitious materials, into context with binders that are emerging as candidates for more radical chemistry changes, the details of which are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the use of silica fume for the production of mortars and high-performance concrete is of great importance to the construction materials sector. Different applications of silica fume have generated extensive studies about its high reactivity as a pozzolanic material, in addition to its effect on the properties of some materials within which it is incorporated. In this study a sonication process was applied by means of which the deagglomeration of the larger particles of densified silica fume (CSF) was achieved. The result is a CSF treated with the ultrasound probe, which is obtained for different tests where the parameters of sonication such as sonication power level and sonication time are varied. This treatment makes it possible to increase the quantity of submicrometric particles in the sample. The effect of sonication process on CSF produces a greater quantity of very fine particles, which improve the pozzolanic reactivity of silica fume and increase the fixation of hydrated lime. This behaviour also produces higher mechanical strength in mortars manufactured with sonicated silica fume (SSF). The mechanical strengths of SSF mortars were greater than those for control and CSF mortar. Different percentages of cement were substituted (between 0 and 15% by weight), and in all cases the SSF mortars showed important differences from the CSF mortar. It was observed that for the longest sonication times and highest sonication power levels, mechanical strengths were increased.",

    "abstract": "The influence of high temperature curing at early ages on the hydration characteristics of a complex binder containing ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) was investigated. High-temperature curing at early ages promotes the early hydration of cement, but it hinders the later hydration, and leads to large pores in the microstructure. So the long-term strength of cement mortar cured under high temperature at early ages is lower than that cured at under 20°C. The hydration of a cement–GGBS complex binder is more sensitive to temperature than is cement, and the strength gain rate of a cement–GGBS mortar is higher than that of cement mortar under high temperature curing at early ages. After high temperature curing at early ages, the later hydration of the cement fraction of the complex binder is hindered, but the later reaction of GGBS fraction is not influenced. The further reaction of GGBS increases the C–S–H gel quantity and improves the pore structure. Therefore, the cement–GGBS mortar gains a high early strength under high temperature curing at early ages, and its strength has a considerable increment at later ages due to the contribution of the reaction of GGBS.",

The compressive strength, the flexural strength and the water resistance of MOC are improved by the incorporation of ACFAR. Furthermore, the improvement effects of ACFAR are compared with those of raw coal fly ash (RFA) on MOC cement. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of MOC cement reveals that ACFAR decreases the interspaces in MOC cement and facilitates the radial growth of 5Mg(OH) 2 ·MgCl 2 ·8H 2 O.

    "abstract": "The addition of copper oxide in cement raw mix is known to improve its burnability, with increase in formation of the alite phase. Copper slag, a by-product of the metallurgical industry, containing copper oxide can therefore be a useful additive in the manufacture of cement, particularly for hard burning raw mixes. This paper presents a study on the effect of addition of 1·5–2·5% of a typical by-product copper slag sample to cement raw mixes prepared from two different limestone samples, with free silica content of 5·52 and 10·97% and average grain sizes of 124 and 175 μm. The clinker parameters such as limestone saturation factor, silica modulus and alumina modulus were in the ranges 0·91–0·92, 2·11–2·29 and 1·0–1·20, respectively. The fineness values of the raw mixes were 3·50–4·20 and 20·80–21·34% retained on 212 and 90 μm sieves, respectively. Burnability studies of these raw mixes were conducted at temperatures of 1300, 1350, 1400 and 1450°C, with retention time of 20 min, and showed increase in the rate of lime assimilation, acceleration in the formation and growth of C 3 S and lowering in clinkerisation temperature by 50°C. The free silica was found to be completely assimilated at 1400°C in mixes containing copper slag. The mineral phase developments and microstructures of laboratory clinker samples fired at 1400 ± 5°C were comparable to control clinker prepared at 1450 ± 5°C. Physical properties of ordinary Portland cement prepared using this clinker showed performance comparable with control cement. The copper slag contains heavy elements, therefore a leaching study was also conducted by immersing hardened cement pastes in distilled water for 6 months. The leachates, such as barium, copper and chromium, were found to be 0·032, 0·005 and 0·031 ppm, indicating fixation of these elements in the clinker mineral phases.",

In this paper, the production of CH in cement hydration and its consumption due to the reaction of mineral admixtures is considered in order to develop a numerical model that simulates the hydration of concrete containing silica fume, fly ash or slag. The heat evolution rates of these admixture-blended concrete were determined by the contribution of both cement hydration and the reaction of the mineral admixtures.

The viscosity, hydration temperature, spreading ability, fluidity, flexural strength and unconfined compressive strength of MCGs with MFA and naphthalene-based superplasticiser (SP) were investigated. The relatively new concept of ‘static viscosity’ was considered. The ranges of water/MCG (w/MCG) ratios, MFA contents and SP contents were 0·8–3·0, 0–50% and 0·5–3·0%, respectively. The viscosity, hydration temperature and flow time were found to decrease with increasing w/MCG ratios, MFA and SP contents, but mini-slump diameter, bleed capacity and setting time increased. The effects of MFA were not as obvious as those of SP. The addition of 2·0% SP decreased the flexural strength and the compressive strength, while 40% MFA increased the flexural strength and decreased the compressive strength. The optimum w/MCG ratio, MFA and SP contents are recommended as 1·0–1·5, 30–40% and 1·5–2·0%, respectively. A low initial viscosity of the optimised MCG ensured desirable rheology properties and satisfactory mechanical properties of the hardened grout. To avoid instability, oversaturation or long setting times, SP dosages should not be excessive.",

Mixes including self-curing agents showed better water retention, higher content of non-evaporable water, lower water absorption and permeable pores compared with non-cured mixes without self-curing agents. For mixes without silica fume, the use of PEG+PAM was more effective than the use of PEG alone, especially at late ages.

Data pertaining to porosity, tortuosity and permeability of concrete were typically obtained by testing different concrete mixtures prepared with varying water/cement ratios, cement contents and coarse/fine aggregate ratios. The experimental data were used to explore the correlation between pore characteristics and permeability of concrete. The results show that a correlation exists between the porosity/tortuosity ratio and the permeability of concrete, the coefficient of permeability increasing with increasing porosity/tortuosity ratio.

The dry solid powder thus obtained can then be used for the preparation of advanced geopolymeric material by just the addition of water. The process overcomes some of the drawbacks of the conventional manufacture of geopolymeric materials, and especially obviates the need to handle highly alkaline solution and the requirement of sodium silicate as this is synthesised in situ in the developed process. The advanced geopolymeric material thus produced was characterised using x-ray diffraction analysis, infrared spectral studies and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that even the dry powder material contained all the necessary mineral phases found in conventional geopolymeric materials. The developed advanced geopolymeric material was tested for mechanical strength as per the relevant Indian standard and was found to possess compressive strength 28·5% higher than that of conventional geopolymeric materials.",

The aim of this paper is to highlight the correlation between mesostructural organisation and chemical reactivity of cement pastes with an additive. The affinity of triethanolamine (TEA), an activator molecule, with cement grains was assessed by measurement of total organic carbon. Moreover, the influence of the amine on the dispersion state, sedimentation kinetics and rheological behaviour was studied. Finally, X-ray diffraction, aluminium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal calorimetry were used in order to study the chemical reactivity of cement in the presence of the admixture.

Then, the available free water amount and fluidity of cement paste with various water-to-cement ratios (w/c) and PCE dosages are measured. The phase and particle size distribution of early cement hydrates are analysed by X-ray diffraction and laser particle size analysis, respectively. As a result, a surprising tendency is observed: the increase rate of fluidity increases with decreasing w/c ratio when the dosage of PCE gradually increases. This phenomenon cannot be explained by the steric effect. The authors also conclude that not less than 2·0% of solids volume of ‘AFt–PCE’ structures (early hydrates of ettringite (AFt) coated with PCE, &lt; 200 nm) are dispersed well in the interstitial pore space along with non-adsorbed PCE. Based on these results, the authors present a possible dispersion mechanism in the PCE–cement system studied here based on the repulsion originating from the exclusion of free polymers (non-adsorbed PCE, ‘AFt–PCE’ structure and some other fine matters coated with PCE) from the gap between cement particles.",

Hence, the interaction effect between initial gypsum and sodium chloride (NaCl) in the cement hydration process was investigated. Isothermal calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy were used to evaluate the hydration process of cement paste. Moreover, a thermodynamic model and boundary nucleation and a growth model were applied to calculate the hydration products and describe the hydration process, respectively. It is clear that sodium chloride can accelerate cement hydration, but as the incorporated sodium chloride increases, the acceleration effect is weakened. The incorporation of chloride salts will promote the dissolution of minerals and increase the growth rate. In the early stage of hydration, the formation of ettringite precedes formation of Friedel's salt, owing to the fact that tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) favours binding with SO 4 2− , which can be demonstrated by the change in ion concentrations and the evolution of hydration products. The formation of Kuzel's salt depends not only on the chloride concentration but also on the hydration time.",

    "abstract": "Cements containing calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) have reported excellent characteristics at both early and later ages. However, there are a number of studies reporting poor durability when compared with Portland cement (PC). Durability tests are used as an indicator for service life, and thus the viability of a cement system relies on its performance in these tests. Test methods often assume a sufficient maturity based on extensively tested PC systems; however, slower hydrating binder assemblages and variable chemistries can be severely underestimated when tested at the default 28 days. For example, a belitic CSA (BCSA) cement tested at this time will fail to account for later-stage hydration products that can improve the durability of the system. Tests on the durability of BCSA cements beyond 28 days of curing are sparsely covered in the literature, although in each study the results have shown a marked improvement in durability performance – a characteristic paralleled by other slow-hydrating binders such as fly ash composite cements. The use of an equivalent cement hydration/maturity in testing protocols is proposed, which could be considered a baseline for subsequent improvements that can be made with regard to how alternative binder systems are tested. A call to action for the cement community is outlined to (a) understand what tests are actually testing at a chemical level, (b) develop a ‘cure test’ to assess maturity and (c) undertake round-robin testing.",

Flexural and compressive strength of mortars made from PC/SAB-1 cement blends are lower than in PC-mortar kept for 90 days at 20°C/100% relative humidity (wet cure) and 20°C/60% relative humidity (dry cure). SAB-1 cement and the 85 wt% SAB-1/15 wt% PC blend have shrinkage-compensating properties opposite to PC in tested mortars. PC-mortar shows excellent protective properties against corrosion of steel reinforcement. Steel in the SAB cement mortar is not passivated but occurs in the nonstable state. The related pH values of the mortar extracts were 12·41 and 11·32, respectively. In the 85 wt% SAB-1/15 wt% PC-mortar the steel is protected against corrosion. This statement is confirmed by the pH value of the mortar extract of 11·88. A 15 wt% replacement of SAB-1 cement by PC is still sufficient for steel passivation.",

Total porosity, compressive strength and the amount of non-evaporable water were measured. The amount of non-evaporable water showed good correlation with the porosity of the hardened cement pastes, and the composition and type of cement had little affect on this relationship. It was clearly shown that the water/cement ratio significantly affected these relationships. It was shown that there were two steps in the development of strength in the function of total porosity: in the early stage of hydration, the development of strength was controlled by maximum pore size: in the later stage, it was controlled by porosity. The effects of porosity and maximum pore size on the strength can be expressed using Griffith's equation, if it can be assumed that the elastic modulus and surface energy are exponential functions of porosity.",

These diagrams reveal critical regions of cement SO 3 contents with respect to expansion potential.

Mass transfer of calcium, magnesium, aluminium, iron, silicon and sulphur leads to the development of a distinct zonal structure extending 100–250 μm into both the cement and the clay. The associated mineralogical changes have modified the microstructure of the altered region and there is clear evidence of increased porosity in the zone of portlandite dissolution. Additionally, experiments conducted at 85°C show the presence of a narrow Mg-Al-Si rich band in the clay close to the contact. Analyses indicate the formation of a di-phasic (Mg-aluminate hydroxide and Mgsilicate hydroxide) gel with low crystallinity and compositions close to hydrotalcite and sepiolite, respectively. Reactive transport modelling has been used to simulate phase transformations within the active region and relate these to porosity changes based on simple molar volume considerations. Given the close coupling of mineral chemistry and microstructure in cement±clay systems, such an approach is regarded as essential if reliable estimates are to be made of long-term reactivity.",

The relative intensities for the resonances from the calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) phase in these spectra show that addition of kaolinite results in a C–S–H phase that on average has longer chains of SiO 4 tetrahedra as compared to the results for pure WPC. On the other hand, addition of bentonite results in a C–S–H with slightly shorter average SiO4 chain lengths. Furthermore, the 29 Si MAS NMR spectra demonstrate that the basic structure of the kaolinite admixture is not affected by the hydrating cement and that kaolinite is not consumed during hydration. This observation is supported by 27 Al MAS NMR which also shows that the rate of formation of ettringite is very similar for the pure WPC and the WPC–kaolinite mixture.

Thus, by reiterated imaging of the same sample region at different times, processes in the sample volume can be tracked. During cement hydration, effects such as the formation and further evolution of microcracks and pores – mainly related to autogeneous shrinkage – could be observed for the first time in the cement volume with up to 1 μm resolution.

The ESEM micrographs showed that metakaolin particles were packed loosely at 10 min after mixing, with many large voids. As hydration proceeded, gels were seen and these precipitated on the surfaces of the particles. At a later stage, the particles were wrapped by thick gel layers, and their interspaces were almost completely engulfed. The corresponding EDXA results showed that the molar ratios of K/Al and Si/Al gradually decreased with the development of hydration. As a result, the molar ratios of K/Al and Si/Al of hydration products after 9 h were 1·28 and 6·54, respectively, and these were close to the theoretical values (K/Al = 1·0, Si/Al = 6·0 for K-PSDS geopolymer cement paste).

This geometrical configuration gives the model the ability to be applied to all types of pore size distribution. The permeability is expressed in function of porosity, tortuosity, critical pore radius and constrictivity, which depends on pore size distribution. These parameters are obtained from mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements. The predicted permeability values were compared with experimental ones obtained by direct measurements according to Darcy's law. The experimental validation concerns three mortars chosen for their polymodal pore size distribution. Theoretical and experimental results are in the same order of magnitude. However, the model could be improved by a better estimation of the material morphological parameters.

The ability of the wasteform grout to retain radioactive gases depends on its mass transport properties, which evolve with age, water saturation degree and any degradation. This paper reports the gas diffusion, gas permeation and water absorption (sorptivity) coefficients of two mature wasteform grouts containing 75% pulverised fuel ash or 75% blast furnace slag. Some of the slag grouts were found to be affected by microcracking, and these were subsequently examined using backscattered electron microscopy and quantified using a specifically developed image analysis procedure. Prior to transport testing, samples were conditioned in a realistic manner to a range of water saturation levels (10–100%). The mass transport properties were found to be highly dependent on the degree of water saturation, in particular for samples conditioned at relative humidity greater than 55%. The microcracks have a significant effect on permeability, but less influence on diffusion and water absorption. Implications of the results on the effectiveness of these grouts for radioactive waste containment are presented.",

Many of the leading-edge contributions on the subject were either authored by Professor Glasser and his colleagues or heavily inspired by their work. In the present paper, the limits and recent evolutions of thermodynamic models applied to cement systems are briefly presented, and their current limitations and future challenges are discussed. A number of examples illustrate how such models can be used to predict the influence of different factors such as cement composition, hydration, relative humidity or temperature on the composition and the properties of a hydrated cementitious system. The combination of chemical and transport models makes it possible to calculate the interactions of cementitious systems with the environment. However, precipitation and dissolution processes can be slow so that thermodynamic equilibrium may not always be reached, particularly during the first stages of the hydration process. This is why an approach that couples thermodynamics and kinetics could provide useful information. The introduction of kinetics would not only help understanding of the intricate influence of various factors, such as solution concentrations, on the hydration of cement but it would also provide the theoretical basis for the development of fully coupled thermo-poro-mechanical models for the prediction of the volume stability of cement systems exposed to chemically aggressive environments.",

Retention mechanisms for key heavy metals and metalloid ions in the cement matrix are reviewed and are shown to be irreversible in the majority of cases, provided a degree of physical durability is maintained.

The experimental results show that the chemical and mineral compositions of fly ash particles vary with particle size. Fine fly ash fractions present high amounts of alkali, un-burnt carbon, CaO, SO 3 and glass phase, whereas coarse fly ash fractions have more crystalline phases. In addition, the fly ash fractions with mean size under 8 μm show significantly higher pozzolanic activity and higher compressive activity index than coarse fractions.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a microbial product, termed ‘biocement', and its role in construction engineering. Biocement, a novel metabolic by-product of microbially induced carbonate precipitation by way of urease (urea hydrolysing enzyme), presents a promising biotechnology for the enhancement of durability of building materials and structures. Urease-producing bacteria are ubiquitous in nature and, when added to cement, help to improve its compressive strength, reduce permeability and reduce the corrosion rate of reinforced structures. Promising results when using this metabolic product have encouraged various research groups worldwide; in-depth studies using these different approaches are discussed in this paper. The status of similar research from China's perspective is also elaborated. The results from different groups suggest that biocement, a product of green technology, can be used as an additional cementitious material to enhance the durability of building materials and structures.",

The effect of magnesia content on setting time, temperature rise during initial reaction and strength development of the cement mortar were examined. The reaction products of cement with water, and cementing structure were also examined. The results show that the cement was rapid setting and had high early strength. With the increase of magnesia content, the setting time of cement became shorter and the temperature rose higher during initial reaction. Compressive strength was also increased with increasing magnesia content. The microstructure of the hardened cement was studied by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy. The reaction product in the cement is magnesium potassium phosphate hexhydrate (MgKPO 4 ·6H 2 O-MKP).",

The logarithmic equation ρ(t)=K m ln (Dt) is proposed to show electrical resistivity development over time during the deceleration period of hydration. A similar logarithmic equation, [Formula: see text], can be obtained from the heat evolution results. The parameters K m and [Formula: see text] respectively represent the rate of densification of the cementitious matrix per unit volume and the heat release rate per unit weight of binder. The paste with a lower replacement content of fly ash was found to have higher K m and [Formula: see text] values. There is a positive linear relationship between K m and [Formula: see text], so [Formula: see text] can be determined by K m . The parameters D and D′ represent the hydration rate for a cement particle in the hydration system: D slightly increases with fly ash replacement content using the electrical resistivity method and D′ from the heat results is close to the D value from the electrical resistivity method for the same fly ash content. A logarithmic relationship is established between the hydration heat at 24 h and the resistivity at 24 h. Based on this idea, the kinetics of hydration heat can be predicted using electrical resistivity measurement as an alternative method.",

In order to validate the proposed model, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests on 30-day-cured cement paste samples with different w/c ratios were conducted to determine microstructure properties such as porosity, tortuosity and pore size distribution. The tortuosities of the samples from the proposal model were compared with those from the MIP tests and the results show good agreement.

The best way to utilise pond fly ash is to convert it into geopolymer cement. Geopolymers form a class of binders manufactured by activation of solid aluminosilicate source material with a highly alkaline activating solution and aided by thermal curing. In the past few decades, geopolymer binders have emerged as one of the possible alternatives to ordinary Portland cement binders due to their reported high early strength and resistance against acid and sulfate attack apart, from their environmental friendliness. An experimental study was conducted to assess the activating influences of the combination of different alkali hydroxides and silicates (NaOH/Na 2 SiO 3 , NaOH/Li 2 SiO 3 , KOH/Na 2 SiO 3 and KOH/Li 2 SiO 3 ) on the mechanical properties of mortars. Geopolymer mortars using sand were cured at 80°C for 4, 8 and 12 h and compressive strengths were determined. Curing was also done by heating in a microwave oven for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min and compressive strengths were determined.

Using different molecular PCEs, the evolution process from bubbles in fresh cement mortar to pores in hardened cement mortar was investigated, considering their effects on mortar workability and mechanical performance. The results showed that PCEs with various functional groups have different air-entraining capabilities. PCEs with ester groups decreased the surface tension and significantly promoted the air-entraining capability, resulting in a notable increase of air content in fresh cement mortar. PCEs with sulfonic acid groups increased the surface tension and remarkably decreased the air content in the fresh cement mortar. A higher air-entraining capability benefits the dispersing properties of PCEs and therefore the PCEs with ester groups performed better in dispersibility in comparison with the PCEs with sulfonic acid groups. The stability of bubbles entrained in fresh cement mortar leads to differences in the pore structure of hardened cement mortar. The PCEs with ester groups diminished the size of large bubbles, leading to significantly decreased porosity of the hardened mortar. PCEs with sulfonic acid groups in the backbone barely optimised the pore structure, with a large amount of large pores remaining in the hardened mortar. Decreased porosity and pore size hence led to higher compressive strength of the hardened cement mortar.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of silica fume and fly ash on the pore structures of blended pastes at such low w/b ratios. Two curing regimes, standard moisture curing and steam curing, were adopted and the pore structures were determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results show that the addition of silica fume refined the pore structure regardless of the curing method and age. The addition of fly ash decreased the porosity after 7 d, whereas the critical pore size was almost unaffected by fly ash under standard curing. Compared to 90 d standard curing, steam curing contributed to a decreased porosity for all the pastes and a reduced critical pore size for the reference and fly ash paste. Moreover, the introduction of both SCMs resulted in a similar pore structure to that of the silica fume paste.",

Through comparisons of the setting time and four other critical moments in early-age hydration evolution obtained from electrical resistivity and hydration heat tests, the application of electrical resistivity to characterise the setting behaviour of cement paste was proven to be effective, through the peaks on the rate curve of resistivity and the inflection point on the electrical resistivity–log time curve.

Preservation of the α′ dicalcium silicate phase to ambient is described in this paper. Commercially available raw materials and reagent-grade chemicals were used and clinker syntheses were conducted. Preservation of the α-belite phase to ambient temperature was achieved by a combination of chemical doping with control of the furnace atmosphere and fast cooling of the clinker.

To investigate the combined effects of WFT and fibre content on the fresh properties of mortar, a number of mortar samples with various water/cement ratios and PP fibre contents were produced for measurements of packing density, flowability, cohesiveness and adhesiveness. It was found that the fibre content has certain effects on the packing density and WFT. Apart from the indirect effects through the change in WFT, the fibre content also has direct effects on the flowability, cohesiveness and adhesiveness.

The goal of this research was to evaluate the effects of the main parameters affecting concrete sensor performance using various criteria (sensitivity of the sensor, standard deviation of the prediction error, repeatability, cross-correlation and hysteresis) in both static and dynamic loading regimes. Dynamic criteria such as sensitivity, internal repeatability, cross-correlation and hysteresis showed that the energy levels for the dispersion of CNTs have a greater effect on improving sensor performance than the amount of CNTs. On the contrary, the repeatability indicated that the amount of CNTs has a greater effect on sensor performance than the dispersion quality (energy level) of the CNTs. On the whole, the sensor produced with 0·15 wt% (by weight of cement) CNTs, superplasticiser and sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant using the maximum energy level (ultrasonic bath for 2 h and 90 min of probe's ultrasonication) offered the best performance both in the static and dynamic load regimes.",

Simple mixing was used for the control group and the effect of mechanical activation on the macroscopic properties of geopolymers was studied using tests for compressive strength, fluidity and setting times. The effect of mechanical activation on the pozzolanic reaction of geopolymers was assessed using isothermal calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that the 28-day compressive strength of the geopolymer formed by mechanical activation was 26% higher than that of the geopolymer prepared using simple mixing. Workability and fluidity were also enhanced. The reactivity of the precursor was improved by mechanical activation, particularly for the FA. The mechanically activated FA experienced a pozzolanic reaction within 7 days, while the undisturbed FA produced pozzolanic activity after 14–28 days. In addition, mechanical activation lessened the carbonisation of the one-part FA/slag-based geopolymer The implications of these results in terms of the influence of mechanical activation on pozzolanic activity are discussed.",

It focuses on the effect of temperature on the enforced carbonation of cement paste. The enforced carbonation is a rapid process at ambient temperature, which is further accelerated at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the extent of the reaction is increased when the temperature rises. The carbonation reaction is divided into two kinetic stages. During the first stage, the carbonation kinetics is controlled by the availability of carbon dioxide that increases at higher temperatures. During the second stage, the reaction kinetics is controlled by the dissolution of the hydrates. Increased temperature accelerates this process by increasing the undersaturation level of the dissolving phases. The main carbonation products are calcium carbonate and an alumina–silica gel. The increasing temperature has a limited impact on these phases, and the differences come mainly from the different degrees of carbonation.",

    "abstract": "Currently, all the cement consumed in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, is imported from other provinces (e.g. Alberta) by long-distance (∼1800 km) freight truck. Transporting cement over long distances not only raises its cost, but also results in a higher carbon footprint. Producing cement locally is therefore a potential low carbon and economic solution for the local industry. However, it is unknown if the local raw materials are suitable for cement manufacture, and there is a lack of a critical raw material – iron ore – for cement manufacturing. However, instead of iron ore, there are iron-rich tailings from a local rare earth element (REE) mine. Towards a low carbon and circular economy, the use of local raw materials (i.e. limestone, clay and gypsum) and mine waste (REE tailings) to manufacture cement in the NWT was explored and the first bag of cement in the history of the NWT was produced. Concrete samples made with the NWT cement achieved strength comparable to that of concrete based on commercial ordinary Portland cement. In addition, it was estimated that locally producing cement in the NWT has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3.0–61.7% as compared with importing cement from other provinces.",

    "abstract": "Ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) is well known to be capable of improving the performance of cement-based materials, but few studies focus on the impact of its large dosage on concrete containing basalt powder. In this study, the compressive strength and chloride permeability of cement-based materials with compound mineral admixtures (CMAs) containing high-volume GGBFS, basalt powder and desulfurisation gypsum were investigated. The results showed that the mortar strengths at 3, 7 and 28 days decreased with increasing GGBFS content, but that at 56 and 84 days increased with the addition of 45 wt% GGBFS. This is because the activity of GGBFS at an early stage has not been stimulated and the pozzolanic effect is exerted at a later stage. Moreover, cement replacement with up to 55 wt% GGBFS caused a significant decrease in the chloride diffusion coefficient of the mortar and concrete. Furthermore, the incorporation of GGBFS led to a remarkable refinement in pore structure of the hardened paste due to pozzolanic and filler effects. Therefore, the partial replacement of cement with high CMA contents (≥70 wt%) in concrete is desirable for ocean projects requiring low chloride permeability, and significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions.",

    "abstract": "Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements are known for their special properties, such as shrinkage compensation and high early-age strength. These properties are dependent on the hydrated phase assemblage, which in turn is governed by the phases present in the initial anhydrous cement. However, the anhydrous CSA phase quantification by X-ray diffraction (XRD) Rietveld can be challenging due to the presence of overlapping peaks, polymorphs and preferred orientation. To overcome this problem, an approach involving high-resolution large-area Raman imaging (5 mm × 5 mm, 250 000 pixels, with 10 μm/pixel resolution) complemented by XRD analysis is introduced. This integrated approach of combined XRD and Raman imaging is found to be crucial in the initial identification of phases that are present in a CSA system. Most importantly, quantitative analysis shows a strong correlation (R 2 &gt; 0.99) and agreement (variation &lt;5 wt%) between the two independent methods, adding confidence and reliability to the phase assemblage obtained by this dual-technique approach.",

Some of the blends achieved a high wet/dry strength ratio exceeding 0·6 after 200 days of water curing. This is explained by the development of a microstructure in which gypsum crystals were engulled by C-S-H. The optimum compositions were revealed by high absolute values of compressive strength in the water-saturated state, as well as low values of water absorption. The high values of water absorption for some compositions together with the low values of strength in the wet state are due to the extra content of silica fume, which is not needed for pozzolanic reaction and can be freely removed from the structure by washing.",

    "abstract": "The scope of manufacturing blended cements in India and the resultant saving in energy consumption were identified. The characterisation of the two main mineral admixtures, namely fly ash (FA) and blast furnace slag (BFS), was based on their chemical and mineralogical composition and their particle characteristics. It was found that all the three factors are important from the point of view of selection of appropriate mineral admixture for blending with cement. The durability performance of concrete with blended cements was improved in terms of its resistance to the three deteriorating factors, namely alkali±silica reaction (ASR), sulphate attack and the corrosion of steel reinforcement. The improved resistance towards the ASR was due to the higher retention of alkalis and the refinement of pore structure, and is due to formation of secondary calcium silicate hydrate (C-SH) during the hydration of FA or BFS components in cement. Its resistance towards the Na 2 SO 4 expansion is on account of lower content of free Ca(OH) 2 , besides the refinement of pore structure. Its lower resistance towards the strength reduction in MgSO 4 environment, like ordinary portland cement (PC), is attributed to the deleterious reaction of Mg ++ cations with C-S-H. In general, blended cements having tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) contents in the range of 5–8% and the FA content of 25–30% or the BFS content above 60%, show moderate to good sulphate resistance. The higher corrosion resistance is attributed to the refinement of pore structure resulting in lower chloride and oxygen diffusivity, greater chloride binding capacity and higher electrical resistivity of the concrete made with blended cements. In comparison to concrete with OPC only, early and extended curing are required to obtain higher long term strength and better durability performance: the economic considerations show that the use of blended cement in concrete is the cheapest alternative available to control reinforcement corrosion.",

Control specimens in which the steel was subjected to a modest level of cathodic protection at a current density of 5 mA/m 2 were also prepared. After treatment, the specimens were sectioned and analysed to determine changes in the distribution of ions within the pore solution phase and in the total chloride content. Microhardness profiles were also measured. It was found that, as well as causing the free and bound chloride content of the specimens to decrease with time, the higher current densities also produced major increases in the pore solution alkali concentrations near the embedded steel. Associated with this local increase in pH value, there was an increase in soluble sulphate ion concentration which appeared to be controlled by solubility equilibria. For the limited range of specimens studied, no significant changes in microhardness profiles were observed.",

The permeability is expressed in function of porosity, tortuosity, constrictivity factor and critical pore radius of the material. The modelling is based on the use of a tridimensional cubic pore network. Two types of measurements are carried out on mortars and cement paste: (a) mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) measurements so as to determine the model entry parameters which allow calculation of the ‘theoretical’ permeability; (b) direct water permeability measurements by the application of the Darcy's law so as to validate the model. The calculated and measured permeabilities are globally in the same order of magnitude. However, some differences are noted. They can be explained by the complexity of correctly estimating some model entry parameters (e.g. tortuosity). Moreover, the permeability expression established shows that it is more affected by tortuosity and critical pore radius variations than by porosity or constrictivity.",

The data on reinforcement corrosion confirmed the superior performance of silica fume cement in sea water, followed by blast furnace slag and fly ash cements.

Accelerated leaching tests with ammonium nitrate were performed on CEM I (OPC) pure hardened paste and concrete. Water permeability was measured and pore structure analysed through MIP. The results showed that the accelerated ammonium nitrate leaching was governed by a diffusion process and was responsible not only for portlandite dissolution but also for CSH decalcification. This degradation generated a large capillary porosity (1–0·1 μm), and was responsible for a significant increase in total porosity. Water permeability for the paste (∼10 −20 to 10 −18 m 2 ) and concrete (∼10 −21 to 10 −19 m 2 ) increased by about two orders of magnitude, and was well correlated with the porosity evolution. Dynamic elasticmodulus measurements confirmed the significant impact of this type of degradation on the final physicomechanicalstate of the materials.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of fly ash (FA) and limestone (LS) on the hydration and durability of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) subjected to Caron's Lake water. The results revealed that the increase of LS content increased the water of consistency (normal consistency) of cement pastes, whereas the initial and final setting times were reduced by up to 30%. The portlandite contents of mixtures containing FA decreased. At the same time, an increase of LS content from 10 to 20% decreased the portlandite content by up to 90 days. On the other hand, the portlandite content of 30% LS increased by up to 90 days. Cement pastes containing FA had the lower values of total sulfate and chloride contents than sulfate-resisting cement pastes. The compressive strength of mixture M.10 (20% FA and 10% LS) showed higher compressive strength values than the other cements when immersed in both curing media, namely tap and Caron's Lake water. It is recommended that cements that are to be used for underground concrete structures or marine structures that are exposed to sulfate-containing seawater do not contain more than 10–20% of LS.",

The nanomodification included grow carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibres (CNFs) on the cement particles. Pastes having a water-to-binder ratio of 0·5 were produced. The test results revealed that partial replacement of sulfate-resistant cement by CHH cement decreased the electrical resistivity of the 28 day old specimens but worsened the mechanical properties. The lower compressive strength was attributed to a lower degree of hydration of the CHH cement. The addition of a mixture of surfactants enabled the production of specimens consisting entirely of CHH cement. The hardened material obtained was characterised by a nearly doubled compressive strength in comparison with the reference specimens made from pristine sulfate-resistant cement. This was attributed to a high degree of hydration as well as reinforcing action of the CNTs and CNFs. The electrical resistivity was lowered by one order of magnitude classifying this material as a semiconductor.",

The sporadic and inconsistent evidence of acicular crystals in the MOC phases has, however, puzzled researchers performing microstructural studies of MOC cement. The present investigations showed that the divergence in strength among Sorel cements with different mixture designs can be attributed to the various phase assemblages and the distinct microstructures that result. Comprehensive microscopic observations illustrate that the crystalline phases of MOC cement were, in general, needle-shaped crystals, bundled in different forms, with a granular surface of nano-sized tiny grains. Imprints of bundled needle-shaped crystal were also observed in the massive and dense microstructure of cement paste with a high compressive strength. The different crystalline phases of the microstructures under investigation were further identified by elemental composition analysis. The microstructural identification of Sorel cement provides a sound basis for a detailed study of the different crystalline phases.",

In addition, binary combinations of the pozzolans and Portland cement were investigated using EN 196-5. The outcomes manifested some anomalies between the different approaches. Complementary observations (such as environmental scanning electron microscope, insoluble residue and hardened concrete properties) were conducted to further clarify the results. The compressive strength and depth of water penetration of the concrete specimens containing the pozzolans revealed that EN 196-5 had superior compatibility with real concrete performance. This suggests that EN 196-5, which was originally developed for pozzolanic cements, can successfully determine the activity of Portland pozzolanic cements containing natural pozzolans, silica fume and fly ash.",

The crystalline phases could be transformed and the impurities could be effectively purified for original phosphogypsum by the pretreatment process. Therefore, water resistance of the CBPG mortars from pretreated phosphogypsum was improved significantly when compared to that of the mortars from original phosphogypsum.

Marl is unsuitable for the clay product industry, and might thus be the high-volume available alternative pozzolan globally that the cement and concrete industry is looking for in order to reduce its carbon footprint. Mortars are made where calcined marl replaces cement by volume at levels of 0, 20, 35, 50 and 65 vol.%. Excellent strengths at both 1 and 28 d relative to reference are obtained for up to 50 vol.% replacement, and the strength continues to increase up to 1 year. The capillary porosity volume increases along with the electrical resistivity, indicating a pore refinement or segmentation, as well as perhaps reduced ionic strength in the pore-water. These are properties that might reduce the propagation rate of rebar corrosion once initiated by carbonation, as carbonation rate increased with cement replacement. The chloride ingress is significantly reduced when cement is replaced by calcined marl. Sulfate resistance is also tested at both 5 and 20°C, but no significant changes are observed after 9 months' exposure.",

The study was performed during 3 months when the samples were kept in four different environments: ambient air at 20°C and 65% relative humidity; dry air at 45°C and 35% relative humidity; water at 45°C; and saturated carbon dioxide at 20°C. Results show a great sensitivity of the calcium sulfoaluminate mortars to carbonation, with various consequences on their mechanical properties and dimensional stability. The consequences are much more moderate, however, when w/c ratio is low.",

To obtain a global elastic constant for a cement-based composite, a homogeneous method is used to perform the upscaling process. This paper presents a method to obtain the global elastic modulus for cement paste with consideration of capillary water pressure. The elastic modulus of different phases is determined using nano-indentation tests. The volume fractions of different phases in the cement paste are determined by using an isothermal conductive calorimeter and a cement hydration kinetic law at early age. The global elastic modulus of cement paste is calculated based on a self-consistent scheme. Considering that, at very early hydration of cement paste with a high water-to-cement ratio, water occupies a relatively high fraction and its pressure may influence the elastic properties of the paste, capillary water with capillary pressure is considered instead of pure air voids without mechanical properties during the upscaling process in this investigation. The global elastic modulus obtained in this way is compared with the value obtained from impact experiments and good agreement is found.",

Their use is now increasing due to the development of dedicated standard processes. The combination of CSA cement with OPC has been widely investigated and a few products have been developed and are already available on the market. Supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) are widely used to improve the durability performance and lower the clinker content. High levels of substitution have allowed for improvements of performance indicators in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, but mechanical strengths at early ages can be affected.

Current formulations do not contain alite; however, alite calcium sulfoaluminate (a-C$A) cements can combine the favourable characteristics of Portland cement (PC) with those of C$A cement while also having a lower carbon dioxide footprint than the current generation of PC clinkers. This paper presents two results on the formation of a-C$A clinkers. The first is a thermodynamic study demonstrating that the production of a-C$A clinker is possible without the use of mineralisers, doping with foreign elements, or using multiple stages of heating. It is established that a-C$A clinker can be readily produced in a standard process by controlling the oxygen and sulfur dioxide fugacity in the atmosphere. This allows for the stabilisation of ye’elimite to the higher temperatures required for alite stability. The second result establishes that when using fluorine to mineralise a-C$A clinker production, the iron content in the clinker is also an important variable. Although the exact mechanism of alite stabilisation is not known, it is shown that alite formation increases with the combination of calcium fluoride and iron (III) oxide in the mix.",

The use of self-curing compounds is increasing in the context of the widespread use of self-compacting concrete (SCC) owing to its superior performance in both fresh and hardened states. This paper addresses the effect of using paraffin wax as a self-curing compound in SCC mixes. The variable parameters of the study include curing type, concrete grade (mix proportions), molecular weight and dosage of paraffin wax. Water retention, sorptivity and compressive strength tests were conducted on hardened concretes. The weight loss after 90 d was found to be less in specimens with a self-curing agent than in specimens without. The compressive strengths of the self-cured specimens closely matched those of conventional water-cured specimens. The optimum dosages of light and heavy molecular weight liquid paraffin wax were determined to be 0·1% and 1·0% by weight of cement respectively. It is this concluded that the use of self-curing compounds in SCC facilitates better hydration and thus enhancements in strength and durability properties.",

    "abstract": "In order to improve the fluidity retention performance of cement, monomers containing ester groups were introduced into slow-release polycarboxylate superplasticisers (PCEs). Four slow-release PCEs with different molecular weights (M w ) were synthesised through aqueous free radical polymerisation. The effect of the molecular weight of slow-release PCEs on the dispersion performance, hydrolysis reaction ratio, adsorption process and hydration of cement was investigated systematically. Due to the hydrolysis reaction, the amount of adsorbed groups continued to increase over time. The adsorption amount of PCEs on the cement particles increased with increasing M w , indicating that M w was the main factor affecting adsorption. The retardation of cement hydration was weakened with increased M w , due to a reduction in the number of molecules adsorbed on the surface of the cement particles. Among the four PCEs, the PCE with medium M w displayed excellent initial dispersion. The PCE with the highest M w exhibited the worst dispersion retention, the strongest adsorption capacity and the most cement hydration acceleration. The PCE with the lowest M w showed outstanding dispersion retention and the maximum delay in cement hydration. According to fluidity retention requirements, an appropriate M w may be thus selected, which provides a reference for the synthesis and performance of slow-release PCEs.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid fly ash cement is a binder with a composition between that of pozzolanic fly ash cement and alkali-activated fly ash cement. Its production requires less cement clinker than ordinary Portland cement, facilitating a much-needed reduction in the carbon dioxide footprint related to the production of high-clinker-containing cement. Research on activation methods is required to overcome the low early age strength and slow strength development in hybrid fly ash cements. In this study the activation of a South African siliceous fly ash (70%) for use along with Portland cement (30%) in a hybrid alkaline binder was investigated. Both chemical (the addition of sodium sulfate) and mechanical (milling) activation of fly ash was studied. The aim of this work was to develop a better understanding of the characteristics of compressive strength development of hybrid fly ash cement mortars over an extended curing period of up to a year. The results indicated that the combination of mechanical and chemical activation (sodium sulfate) can be considered a viable solution to improving early strength and slow strength development, so that hybrid cements are able to comply with the strength requirements of the BS EN 197 cement specification.",

The microstructure of hardened MPC was analysed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results indicated that the water stability of MPC is highly dependent on the pre-curing regime. Although increasing the ratio of magnesia to phosphate is detrimental to the strength of MPC in air, it was able to improve the water stability. The strength development of MPCs with steel slag was found to similar to those of the fly ash blends, but showed poor water stability. The shrinkage of MPC paste was found to be more significant with an increase in curing age and the dosage of steel slag and fly ash for specimens cured in air, but an opposite trend was exhibited for specimens immersed in water. The cracks in hydrated MPC with steel slag could be the main reason for its poor water stability.",

A crack healing method based on biomineralisation is presented to repair microcracks in concrete specimens. By analysing the change in permeability, adopting two different ultrasonic detection methods, and conducting unconfined compressive strength tests, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction tests, this method of repair was proved to be effective and its repair effect was evaluated. Results show that the permeability of specimens repaired using this healing method declines significantly, but samples with a crack width of 0·05 mm experience a different decreasing trend from those with crack width of 0·15 mm. The unrepaired crack depths of samples with a crack width of 0·15 mm are almost zero, and the smaller the crack widths, the larger the unrepaired crack depths. Using this healing method, samples with wider cracks (0·10 mm and 0·15 mm) are repaired more effectively and regained higher strengths. As a consequence, the healing method can repair small cracks between 0·05 mm and 0·15 mm in concrete, but wider cracks (0·10 mm and 0·15 mm) are repaired more completely and show improved effectiveness of the repair. The healing method and results of repair provide an important reference for subsequent study on the practical repair of microcracks.",

In this paper, ternary cement pastes containing metakaolin (MK) and limestone filler (LF) finer than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) were studied to evaluate the effects of these SCMs on packing density and water film thickness (WFT). The flowability of the pastes at different water to cementitious material ratios by volume ((w/cm) v = 0·5 to 1·0) was evaluated by mini-slump and Marsh cone tests to evaluate the opposite effects caused by the incorporation of finer particles (increase of free water to lubricate the particles due to higher packing and increase of specific surface area). The incorporation of LF and MK increased the flowability when (w/cm) v was increased over the optimum water demand corresponding to the maximum packing density. The rheological properties of the pastes were primarily dominated by the relative solid packing fraction and the flowability was found to be mainly governed by the WFT. The incorporation of finer particles accelerated the setting time. The reactive particles (OPC and MK) can be replaced by LF up to 20% to obtain a similar compressive strength, as validated by Powers’ model.",

From adsorption and zeta-potential measurements, it is found that a lower viscosity occurs owing to (a) the electrostatic repulsion and (b) a lower particle volume fraction. Moreover, the gluconate anion is expected to enhance the formation of a homogenous polymer network on the cement grain surface, which explains the viscosity stabilisation time. In situ investigations of hydration using environmental scanning electron microscopy showed that SG induced modifications of the ettringite crystal morphology by reducing the amount and size of the ettringite needles. From pore solution analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectra, a mineral similar to syngenite is detected. These morphological changes lower the shear resistance and the paste viscosity. A thorough understanding of the plasticising mechanism will lead eventually to a more predictable concrete flow behaviour, which is particularly useful for concrete practitioners facing concerns related to combined use of admixtures.",

Special emphasis is placed on the compliance of ground cement with ASTM C465 requirements. Compared with control mixtures, the test results showed that the addition of increased GA concentrations leads to improved flowability immediately after mixing, together with reduced τ 0 and η values. This is related to a combination of factors, including the amount of water required to achieve normal consistency and the creation of repulsive forces between neighbouring cement particles. At longer elapsed times from mixing, however, the mixtures containing amine-based GA exhibited increased τ 0 and η values, mostly due to chemical interactions between these molecules and the cement hydrating compounds. The efficiency of GA molecules to alter the rheological properties of cement pastes was found to be slightly affected by the increase in temperature that is normally encountered in real grinding mills.",

Lime–silica fume (lime–SF) paste (1 : 1 wt) was used as a green binder in lieu of cement. The binder was combined with expanded perlite (EP) aggregate with various aggregate volume contents of 25, 50 and 75%. The compressive strength, indirect tensile strength, bulk density, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and solar reflectivity of the hardened mortars were determined at 28 d of curing. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to assess the phase composition. The durability of the developed mortars was estimated with an accelerated aging test. The results showed that the newly developed mortar possesses reasonable mechanical performance, reduced thermal conductivity and enhanced solar reflectivity. The increased porosity of EP-blended mortar facilitates water migration within the hardened structure, leading to remarkable enhancement in resistance to wetting/drying aging conditions and hence improved durability. TGA patterns revealed a phase composition similar to that of the hydrated cement. Scanning electron microscopy showed that good bonding exists between the hardened lime–pozzolan matrix and EP aggregate. The lightweight mortar developed can be highly recommended for plastering and rendering applications in sustainable and energy-efficient buildings.",

However, OPG often suffers from a low degree of reaction, a high number of crystalline by-products and, as a result, low strength. Here, one-part geopolymer was assisted by mechanochemical activation (MC-OPG) to produce grout. The precursor materials (slag and fly ash) and sodium silicate were mechanochemically activated utilising co-grinding to produce a geopolymeric precursor, after which water is the only additive required to initiate the geopolymerisation reaction. The effects of slag/fly ash ratios on grout mixtures were also investigated. A series of tests was examined, including rheological characteristics, setting time, bleeding, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), ultrasonic pulse velocity, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that the mechanochemical activation technique increased the rheological characteristics and reduced the fresh properties (setting time and bleeding) of geopolymer grout compared to the one-part geopolymer. Considering mechanical properties, the UCS of MC-OPG grout was higher (41–73%) than that of OPG grout. Furthermore, slag content significantly affected the rheological, fresh and mechanical properties of all the geopolymer grouts regardless of the activation method.",

    "abstract": "The effects of replacing OPC with three types of calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements (40 wt%, 20 wt%) were studied. The results were broadly consistent with previously published data, with a few notable exceptions. Because of the production of ettringite, setting times were decreased. The maximal hydration temperature increased in concretes containing 40 wt% CSA but dropped in concretes with 20 wt% replacement. The drop was caused by a lack of accessible sulfates, which limited the synthesis of ettringite. In comparison to OPC concretes, the inclusion of additional anhydrite and calcium oxide was related with a delayed formation of the second temperature peak. Their excess slowed the calcium aluminate and belite reactions and reactivated the synthesis of ettringite, C–S–H, and portlandite. The effects of aluminum hydroxide were also indicated as potentially significant, although this was not proven experimentally in this study. The slightly lower compressive strength reported for mixes containing 40 wt% CSA was associated with better-formed ettringite. The same was identified as the key to lowering total shrinkage in mixtures containing 40 wt% CSA and increasing for lower CSA replacement levels. In that case, the insufficient amount of ettringite generated resulted in expansion that was insufficient to alleviate or compensate for the developed shrinkage.",

The hydration reaction is incomplete, and tetra calcium phosphate is the only crystalline solid detected by X-ray diffraction analysis. The apparent activation energy of tetracalcium phosphate hydration is 36 kJ/mol. An activation energy of this magnitude is indicative of an interfacially controlled reaction. As with many hydration reactions, which are initially interfacially controlled, a layer of hydration product accumulates on the hydrating surfaces, and subsequent hydration becomes diffusionally controlled. Consistent with such a mechanistic path, seeding with calcium hydroxide reduces both the maximum rate of heat evolution and the total heat of reaction , while seeding with hydroxyapatite increases the total heat evolved. Complete hydration may be achieved when a tetracalcium phosphate slurry is continuously agitated for an extended period. After storage for one year large Ca(OH) 2 crystals have precipitated and an equilibrium involving hydroxyapatite and Ca(OH) 2 has been achieved. Carbonate readily enters the hydroxyapatite lattice and carbonated hydroxyapatite is formed in a CO 2 atmosphere. Although its composition is uncertain, the carbonated hydroxyapatite formed has a Ca/PO 4 ratio of 2, and it is the only phase observed at the complete reaction of tetra calcium phosphate under CO 2 .",

    "abstract": "Densified silica fume was incorporated in concrete mixes, containing various alkali contents, at the rate of 10% silica fume replacing 20% cement by mass. The cast specimens were steam-cured at 75°C and were examined by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis soon after steam curing (1 day), and after periods of28 days and 1 year of external exposure. Mortars with and without silica fume were made with the same cement as that used in the concretes, and their pore solutions were expressed at different ages for the determination of their chemical compositions. The results show that the silica fume is very effective in removing alkali from the pore solution. However, densified silica fume agglomerates of 40-100 μm size persisted in the concrete, and in the presence of high alkali levels acted like reactive aggregate. Nevertheless, the silica fume was very effective in reducing the concrete expansion caused by a reactive granite aggregate, although it added slightly to the expansion of concretes containing a non-reactive basalt aggregate. The silica fume also had an influence on the type of sulphoaluminate phase formed in the concrete, and favoured the formation of ettringite. Therefore, silica fume may be effective in controlling both the alkali—aggregate reaction and secondary-ettringite formation in steamcured concrete.",

    "abstract": "The overall aim of this paper is to establish the engineering properties and material durability of Portland limestone cements, particularly when they are exposed continually to an environment rich in magnesium sulphate ions, and conducive to thaumasite formation. In particular, non-destructive and destructive tests were used to identify and examine the interaction of the changes in mechanical properties with the onset of sulphate attack. To achieve these objectives, 40 × 40 × 160 mm mortar specimens were subjected to air curing at 5°C and 20°C, and also immersed in 1·8% MgSO 4 solution, again at 5°C and 20°C. The limestone content in the test specimens was kept at 0%, 5%, 15% and 35% replacement of cement by mass. The formation of thaumasite was checked and confirmed by x-ray diffraction supported by thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The non-destructive tests used in the study included pulse velocity, dynamic modulus, shrinkage, expansion and changes in mass. In addition, flexural and compressive strengths were determined. All the tests were carried out up to one year. The results obtained from the tests have then been critically analysed. It is shown that mortar prisms containing 35% limestone and exposed to magnesium sulphate solution at 5°C suffered extensive damage and deterioration within one year. In addition, prisms containing 15% limestone gave strong signs of impending damage due to sulphate attack. The results of the non-destructive and destructive tests were highly complementary, and confirmed each other. The major mechanical deterioration occurred through the loss of compressive strength of almost 75% of that of the original unaffected mortar, whilst the loss in flexural strength was relatively small. The results strongly indicate that compression members, containing 35% limestone and exposed to aggressive sulphate environment at temperatures of about 5°C, can be seriously at risk in their ability to carry loads. On the other hand, it is unlikely that flexural members under these conditions would suffer the same degree of serious structural damage.",

Also, the porosity and absorptivity of these mortars and the corrosion activity of embedded reinforced specimens were measured. A good correlation was found between the coefficient obtained by the RTC method and that determined from the increased chloride concentration, and on the other hand, a good correlation was also found between pozzolanic characteristics and this last chemical parameter and/or its direct and indirect related parameters.

Both kinds of UFP have a strengthening effect. Adding UFP and superplasticizer simultaneously leads to better filling and dispersing effects in cement paste, because the particles of UFP cannot fill in the cement floc effectively unless the self-coagulation of the UFP is destroyed by adsorbing superplasticizer. The strengthening effect of UFP is due to its densifying effect and chemical activity, as well as its capacity to modify the pore structure.",

The water in the mixtures was pre-mixed with alkalis to partly simulate the initial solution formed when water is mixed with cement, since alkalis are believed to strongly affect the conversion rate of silica fume. The combination of NMR data with information from thermogravimetry (TG) has been utilized to balance the total chemical reaction for each mixture, and thereby the empirical formula of the CSH gel as well. The consumption rate of silica fume is found to be faster than the hydration of the minerals after three to seven days. Furthermore, the average chain length of the linear polysilicate anions in the CSH gel is longer in mixes with silica fume than without. The latter is accompanied with a lower CIS ratio in the gel. The C/S ratio of the gelfrom the pure cement minerals tends to increase with age. Silica fume accelerates the hydration of the cement minerals at early age, but retards the hydration at a later stage under the current conditions.",

Relevant features of nano-scale Ca(OH) 2 particles are explored using thermal analysis. Different forms of Ca(OH) 2 with varying degrees of crystallinity and surface area were prepared using Ca(OH) 2 and CaCO 3 as starting materials.

The presence of two separate and distinct thermal decomposition events (in derivative form of thermogravimetric analysis results) was observed, depending on the degree of crystallinity. Endotherms occurred at temperatures of about 426°C and 454°C. Binary mixtures of Ca(OH) 2 with substantially different degrees of crystallinity exhibited a well-defined thermal decomposition doublet. The height of each endotherm peak was dependent on the mass proportions of each mixture component.

Recent studies have highlighted the predominance of the filtration phenomenon during the extrusion flow of firm cement-based materials. Such a filtration leads to process blockage and prohibits its utilisation in industrial settings. In the present study the introduction of a vibration system to the extruder in order to inprove the extrusion flow was investigated. The effects of such external excitation on the rheological behaviour of a firm extrudible cement-based paste (yield stress reduction without losing retaining shape properties) were examined and some extrusion tests (ram and screw extruders) were performed to show the potential of a vibration/extrusion coupling.",

In the present study agar was used to immobilise ureolytic bacteria by brushing the agar onto the surface of the cement paste, providing a local micro-environment. Bacterial deposition of a layer of calcite on the surface of the specimens resulted in a decrease of capillary water uptake and thus prevented the penetration of water and hazardous substances. This method of brushing semi-solid mixtures onto the surface of the cement paste specimens showed remarkable effects.

    "abstract": "Supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) are commonly added to improve the performance of concrete. However, the effects of SCM on the behaviour of cement paste/mortar/concrete depend on many factors and have so far remained elusive, making the mix design of high-performance concrete containing SCM rather difficult. This paper evaluates the effects of SCM, the fresh and hardened properties of mortar made with superfine cement and condensed silica fume added at different water/cementitious materials ratios. First, the packing densities of the solid particles in the mortar samples were measured directly by a new wet packing method. Then, based on the measured packing densities, a mix parameter called water film thickness (WFT) was quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that the WFT plays important roles in the fresh and hardened properties of mortar, as demonstrated by the good correlations established between the WFT and the rheology as well as the strength of the mortar samples tested.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to investigate the hydraulic behaviour of a stainless steel converter slag after changing its chemical composition and cooling path. The target slag was designed to resemble ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS). A synthetic slag with a chemical composition close to stainless steel converter slags was mixed with 22, 30 and 38 wt% fly ash (FA) from lignite combustion, heated up to 1550°C and then granulated by quenching in water; the solidified new slags were named FA22, FA30 and FA38 respectively. Quantitative X-ray diffraction on FA22 revealed that the amorphous phase was approximately 40 wt%, the rest being bredigite and merwinite. For FA addition of 30 wt% or more, the amorphous phase reached almost 100 wt%. The resulting slags showed significant hydraulic activity when mixed with sodium-based activators, with C-S-H, hydrotalcite and hydrogarnet being the main hydration products formed. The calorimetric behaviour and the mechanical properties of blended cements with 30 wt% FA30 and FA38 were comparable to a blended cement with GGBFS. Assuming that FA addition will take place during the liquid state of the slag, the proposed process can result in a new hydraulic binder.",

    "abstract": "Calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) is a main product of Portland cement hydration. Although C-S-H is treated as an amorphous phase in macro scale, the atomic-scale structure of C-S-H is considered to be nanocrystalline and short-ordered. Various studies have been carried out and many models have been proposed in the past few decades to describe the structure of C-S-H at nano scale. Tobermorite and jennite are considered as two naturally existing crystalline solids sharing similar structures with C-S-H, especially tobermorite. As a result, tobermorite-based models are predominant in the literature. Besides, combination models with both tobermorite and jennite as well as exceptive models have also been developed in the same period. In this paper, the C-S-H models developed in the past decades are reviewed systematically. The reliability of the models is discussed based on the fundamental requirements of the C-S-H structure from consideration of experimental observations and structural chemistry, including charge balance, Ca/Si (C/S) ratio and Q n distribution. Finally, some considerations on the understanding of C-S-H are put forward for possible development of C-S-H structure in the future.",

The cathodic current density applied was 5 A/m 2 over a treatment period of 12 weeks. The effect of ECE on the physical and microstructural properties of the specimens was studied using microhardness and mercury intrusion porosimetry techniques. Eventually, removal of chloride ions was noted to be more effective in OPC in comparison with blended cements.

    "abstract": "Concrete exposed to cyclic freezing and thawing may deteriorate by surface scaling, internally developed cracks or both in combination. The rate of deterioration tends to be accelerated in concretes containing higher levels of supplementary cementitious materials including slag and limestone. A fundamental insight into the relationship between cement composition and freeze–thaw resistance is therefore imperative for developing durable composite cement concretes. Concrete samples prepared from CEM I, binary slag cements and ternary limestone slag cement blends at 0·5 w/b ratio without air entrainment were investigated. The freeze–thaw test was based on the CIF method according to PD CEN/TR 15177. Additionally, phase assemblages in the concretes before and after freeze–thaw damage were evaluated. Before freeze–thaw testing, compressive strengths were similar but the composite cements were slightly more susceptible to carbonation. However, the scaling and internal damage resistance decreased in the order of CEM I, binary and limestone ternary blended cements. The composition of the scaled material differed from the bulk, revealing an absence of portlandite and a marked reduction in AFm and ettringite contents. A probable explanation for the reduced freeze–thaw resistance includes the porosity differences and the lower portlandite content compared to CEM I concrete.",

Soda sludge (73·5 wt%), clay (26·3 wt%) and minor amounts of iron ore (0·2 wt%) were mixed to obtain a raw mix that is later burned at nine different burning schemes. Four different burning temperatures (1050, 1100, 1150 and 1200°C) and three different burning durations (60, 90 and 180 min) were applied for clinkerisation. The clinkers obtained were investigated by chemical, mineralogical and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The analyses confirmed the formation of the alinite phase [Ca 10 Mg 0·8 [(SiO 4 ) 3·4 (AlO 4 ) 0·6 O 2 Cl]] in the clinkers. Results revealed that increasing burning temperature and duration did not cause a significant change in the phases developed, but caused an increase in the crystal size of the phases. Compressive strength tests were also performed on the produced alinite cements to determine the appropriateness of these cements for structural purposes. It is envisaged that the alinite cement produced at a substantially lower temperature than normal Portland cement clinker will lead to benefits not only in terms of economy and ecology but also sustainability of the cement production.",

One major issue when introducing process changes is the need to maintain product quality. In some ways, oxygen-enriched air combustion resembles oxy-fuel combustion. The model results were validated and found to be consistent with full-scale operational data for normal running conditions and for a full-scale test with oxygen-enriched air. The model shows, for example, that with an additional 1500 m 3 /h of oxygen, fuel addition at the calciners can increase up to 108% and the raw material feed rate can increase up to 116% for a process with a raw meal feed of 335·5 t/h.",

The accelerated experiment has been performed by using a 6 mol/l ammonium chloride solution because natural leaching is a slow process. In order to obtain the mechanical response of different cement pastes, specimens of different water/cement ratios and fly ash contents were prepared. At specified leaching durations, a compression test was performed on the sound and leached specimens. The compression tests show that the loss of compressive strength has a significant linear correlation with the leached ratio of all specimens. This indicates that the decrease in strength is mainly governed by the dissolution of calcium hydroxide. The residual compressive strength loss was related to the mix proportion. The loss of compressive strength increases with water/cement ratios in general. In addition, the addition of fly ash increases the residual compressive strength of totally leached pastes, because more calcium hydroxide is consumed owing to secondary hydration.",

Relative contents of geopolymeric products and hydration products are studied by acid dissolving testing. The mineral composition, morphology and chemical groups of geopolymeric products and hydration products are analysed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Geopolymer setting time is much faster when calcium content increases. Calcium has a positive effect on compressive strength of geopolymers. By acid dissolving testing, the ratio of geopolymer value/ordinary hydration product value in metakaolin-based geopolymer was 4·4 : 1, whereas in CFA-based and CFA + 6% calcium hydroxide-based geopolymers the values were 1 : 1·7 and 1 : 1·5, respectively. Thus, the main product in metakaolin-based geopolymer is geopolymeric products, whereas in CFA-based geopolymer, hydration products also occur.

The experimental results showed that the mechanical and porosity–permeability properties deteriorated due to contamination by drilling fluid. The deterioration in properties was found to be more serious with an increase in drilling fluid content: for a drilling fluid content of 30%, mechanical properties were reduced by about 50% compared with those of pure cement stone, and porosity and permeability were increased by 7·9% and 0·369 millidarcy (3·6 × 10 −12 cm 2 ). SEM, EDS and TGA revealed that chemical incompatibility between drilling fluid additives and cement slurry is the main reason for contamination: the additives contain many functional groups that are not compatible with cement slurry (e.g. carboxylate (–COO − ) and amide groups (–CONH 2 )). These additives easily generate a flocculation mechanism when in contact with cement slurry. They are adsorbed onto the surfaces of cement grains, thus coating the cement particles, reducing the hydration reaction rate and destroying development of the cement stone microstructure, leading to a reduction in strength and an increase in porosity and permeability.",

Mortars and pastes with cement replacements of 0%, 5% (CDW g 5) and 10% (CDW g 10) were produced. The different mortar types were tested to ascertain their 7, 28 and 90 d strengths and durability-related properties, including capillary absorption, chloride diffusion, accelerated carbonation, resistance to alkali–silica reaction (ASR) and sulfate attack. Mortar containing CDW g performed better than the control only with regard to expansion due to ASR. In the other tests, mortar containing CDW g did not attain the performance of the control specimens. However, for the CDW g 5 mortar, performance losses were not significant, indicating that this particular waste at this dosage may be used to partially replace Portland cement. A replacement of 10% could be considered in concretes with lower levels of performance requirements.",

It is also sometimes employed to enhance superplasticiser dispersity to improve the fluidity and workability of cement and concrete, but the reason for this effect is unclear. The work discussed in this paper investigated the early hydration process of cement paste and the adsorption of sodium tripolyphosphate and polycarboxylate superplasticiser (PCS). The results show that there is competitive adsorption between PCS and sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate inhibits PCS from adsorbing onto the surface of cement particles, and PCS also reduces the adsorption of sodium tripolyphosphate. When both of these are reduced, there is a significant increase in the thickness of the adsorption layer and the zeta potential, which is shown to be the main reason for the improvement in fluidity. This indicates that some salts can be used to adjust the adsorption process of PCS in order to improve the fluidity and workability of cement paste and fresh concrete.",

    "abstract": "Ye'elimite-containing cements are of growing research interest owing to their characteristic properties. Strontium (barium) (Sr(Ba))-bearing ye'elimite is synthesised by the substitution of Sr 2+ (Ba 2+ ) ions for Ca 2+ ions in ye'elimite. Here, Rietveld refinement for Sr(Ba)-ye'elimite is reported. The effect of strontic and baric substitutions on the crystal system of ye'elimite is analysed. Additionally, the crystalline phases and potential ACn (amorphous and non-quantified crystalline phase) contents, in clinkers containing Sr(Ba)-ye'elimite, are determined. As substitutions increase, the crystal system of Sr-bearing ye'elimite transforms from an orthorhombic system to a cubic system, but Ba-bearing ye'elimite remains cubic throughout the process. In the clinkers, the Sr-bearing ye'elimite reaches 97% (wt%) and the Ba-bearing ye'elimite is greater than 94% (wt%), with insignificant amounts of amorphous and non-quantified crystalline phase (ACn) contents. With a higher degree of substitutions, the lattice parameters of Sr(Ba)-bearing ye'elimite exhibit linear growth trends.",

The evolution of the properties of the samples (compressive strength, static modulus of elasticity, stress–strain behaviour, hardened density, water permeability coefficient and length change) was monitored. The surface deterioration of the samples was also observed and the morphological features of the products were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Water immersion was found to improve for the properties of the samples and reduce the water permeability coefficient. Moreover, at the initial stage of sodium sulfate attack, the presence of sulfate ions had a positive effect on the evolution of the properties due to the formation of ettringite and gypsum. Afterwards, the samples immersed in sodium sulfate solution showed a degradation in the properties, induced by the expansion of expansive products and the generation of micro-cracks. Furthermore, the mortar immersed in sodium sulfate solution showed higher expansion and a larger hardened density than the mortar immersed in water. An increase in the concentration of the sodium sulfate solution was found to reduce the time needed to reach peak properties and to accelerate deterioration of the properties at the late stage.",

Cement slurry with FL exhibits good comprehensive performance under high-temperature and ultra-high-temperature conditions. The working mechanisms of the fluid loss reducer FL are studied and the compressible ‘viscoelastic adsorbed layer’ perspective is proposed, which could explain the excellent ability to control the filter loss of cement slurry under high temperature.",

The results showed that increasing the SP dosage significantly increased the packing density and water film thickness (WFT) of the cementitious paste, and increases in SP dosage and WFT contributed to increasing the flowability of the cementitious paste. At the same SP dosage and WFT, cementitious pastes containing CSF tended to have higher flowability. It is postulated that this is because the finest portion of CSF and water flowed together as a slurry that coated the larger sized particles with a certain slurry film thickness (SFT). Regression analysis of the test data revealed a very good correlation of flowability to SP dosage and SFT.",

The reference formulation contained 60% PC, 20% LS and 20% FA by mass of binder in an effort to minimise clinker and maximise the other constituents. nS particles were characterised by way of transmission and X-ray scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The nS was added at 0·3 or 0·6% by mass as a partial replacement for PC and different water-to-binder (w/b) ratios were explored. Compressive strength tests and thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) performed at day 7, 28 and 56 testified to pozzolanic behaviour. Results suggest a mechanism of ‘de-activation’ of some FA particles with age. A new ratio: (compressive strength in MPa)/(calcium hydroxide content detected by TGA) was introduced, correlating microscale characteristics (hydration products) and macroscale performance (delivered compressive strengths). Back-scattered SEM images confirmed the calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) network formation, the presence of reacted/unreacted FA particles and the availability of calcium hydroxide for delayed hydration reactions. Tests on mortars also confirmed the enhancement offered by nS addition. The lower bound nS addition was determined to be 0·6% by mass of binder for pastes and 0·5% for mortars.",

To determine the viscoelastic behaviour of MCG comprehensively and enhance its injectability, the viscosity variation characteristics of MCG suspensions need to be known. In this research, the new test method of ‘static viscosity’ was adopted and the synergistic effects of microfine cement (MC) fineness, water/solids (w/s) ratio and contents of microfine fly ash (MFA), silica fume (SF) and superplasticiser (SP) on the static viscosity of MCGs were studied comprehensively. The maximum MCG grain size was in the range 20–35 μm, the w/s ratio was varied from 0·8 to 3·0 and the contents of MFA, SF and SP were varied from 0 to 50%, 5 to 15% and 0 to 3·0%, respectively. The viscoelastic behaviours of the MCGs were determined by analysing the viscosity, hydration temperature, spreading ability and flowability of suspensions under different conditions. MCGs composed of blends of MC + MFA, MC + SF and MC + MFA + SF, with low initial viscosity and desirable viscoelastic properties, are discussed and recommended. The optimised viscoelastic behaviour, desirable spreading ability and flowability of MCGs can ensure their injectability, grouting effects and substitution for chemical solution in grouting applications, especially for small voids and microcracks.",

Water removal from porous solids can be governed by moisture diffusion, capillary flow and sorption-based mechanisms, which generate various drying models. Taking into account material types and water to cement ratios, the water removal kinetics and status of hardened cement pastes and mortars were investigated by oven drying at 60°C. Diffusion- and sorption-based drying kinetic models were revisited and employed to capture the drying profiles of CBPMs. The characteristics of drying profiles, model parameters and their relations to the pore structures of CBPMs were analysed. The results show that pore structure is a primary factor impacting drying kinetics and status. For dense porous solids, a long enough drying time is required to obtain a sufficiently dried status and for predicting the equilibrium moisture content by the models. Oven drying at moderate temperature can be an efficient drying method for removing water from a dense porous solid.",

The thermal stability of alkali-activated mortars and hydrated mortars prepared using ladle slag and two different aggregates was studied.

All samples were characterised and analysed through a strength test, dilatometric analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, ultrasonic pulse velocity and scanning electron microscopy. The hydrated ladle slag mortars exhibited properties similar to or better than the commercial calcium aluminate cement, while the alkali-activated ladle slag's thermal properties were inferior to the hydrated ladle slag mortars. The tests also showed that the use of ferrochrome slag aggregates in hydrated ladle slag mortars exhibited similar properties to those using sand aggregate mortars. The damage behaviours of the mortars were dependent on the temperature-induced dehydration, dehydroxylation and thermal incompatibility between the paste and aggregates. The results from this study specify the possibilities of using 100% industrial by-product-based mortar and near-zero carbon dioxide emissions as a fire-resistant material in furnaces, buildings and fireplaces.",

It is also sometimes employed to enhance superplasticiser dispersity to improve the fluidity and workability of cement and concrete, but the reason for this effect is unclear. The work discussed in this paper investigated the early hydration process of cement paste and the adsorption of sodium tripolyphosphate and polycarboxylate superplasticiser (PCS). The results show that there is competitive adsorption between PCS and sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate inhibits PCS from adsorbing onto the surface of cement particles, and PCS also reduces the adsorption of sodium tripolyphosphate. When both of these are reduced, there is a significant increase in the thickness of the adsorption layer and the zeta potential, which is shown to be the main reason for the improvement in fluidity. This indicates that some salts can be used to adjust the adsorption process of PCS in order to improve the fluidity and workability of cement paste and fresh concrete.",

Studies of carbonation-induced corrosion and of rehabilitation methods, such as electrochemical re-alkalization, require the convenient preparation of realistically large specimens of carbonated concrete in a sufficiently short time. This paper describes a rapid method of preparing carbonated concrete by exposing concrete, which has been dried to an internal relative humidity of 60%, to a pure atmosphere of carbon dioxide gas at 15 bar pressure (1500 kPa). The pressure chamber used can accommodate specimens up to 150 mm diameter or 100 × 100 mm section and such specimens can be fully carbonated in 2 weeks, much more quickly than by other methods. Carbonation increases the electrical resistivity and strength of the concrete and reduces the water absorption. Optical and electron microscopical investigations on the carbonated concrete confirm that the microstructure is no different from that produced in concrete by carbonation under natural exposure. The accelerated carbonation method can be used for development work on materials and repair methods and has been used by the authors in preparing carbonated concrete specimens for re-alkalization tests.",

The use of 29 Si{ l H} CP/MAS rather than 29 Si MAS NMR for the detection of thaumasite is shown to reduce the instrument time by up to a factor of IOOO because of the large difference in 1 H and 29 spin-lattice relaxation times (T H 1 and T Si 1 ) and the 29 Si intensity gain by CP for this mineral. The non-standard behaviour of the 1 H and 29 spin-lattice relaxation processes observed for some samples is shown to follow a decay exponential in t with time t. 27 Al MAS NMR is used to quantify ettringite for some of the samples.

The image of the cross-section of the irradiated area of the sample is transferred indirectly to a photographic film through the β - decay of a dysprosium foil which becomes the primary target of transmitted neutrons. Moisture gradients can then be read from the film by a densiometer or studied in detail by an image processing system. Examples given are the detection of the water front during the capillary suction of water by a cement mortar, a dried concrete core drilled out of an old structure and a sealed cured concrete cast in the laboratory, and a subsequent image analysis of the mortar samples.",

Two different fibres, steel and polypropylene, were used to form single and hybrid FRC systems at five different volume fractions (1% to 5%). It was found that the tensile properties of FRC depended mostly on the type, content and selected FRC system. Single type steel fibre-reinforced concrete (SS-FRC) was found to behave in a typical manner, with peak load occurring at a very small deformation followed by a drop of the load to zero with no sign of load recovery. In the case of single type polypropylene fibre-reinforced concrete (SP-FRC) the behaviour was more ductile and presented mostly a double-peak response: a first peak at small deformation and a second peak large deformation. Steel fibres are believed to contribute more to strength whereas polypropylene fibres are believed to contribute to the ductility (i.e. toughness). For hybrid systems (Hy-FRC), it was found that the behaviour was in fact the combined behaviour of steel and polypropylene. The response of Hy-FRC was more balanced in terms of strength (first peak) and post-peak ductility.",

It is shown that the data given in the literature are frequently in error due to inappropriate analytical procedures. Initial rapid sorption of SMF occurs, probably on an ettringite precursor. This is followed by partial desorption of SMF, but eventually the alkaline nature of the cement pore fluid precipitates a chemically altered derivative for which some analytical data are given. The retarding effect of SMF is pronounced at 20°C but diminishes or disappears with increasing temperature up to 55°C. In comparable paste specimens SMF reduces the mean size of Ca(OH) 2 crystallites and alters their morphology, but promotes the growth of larger ettringite crystals.",

    "abstract": "Citric acid added as set retarder significantly contributed to enhancing the setting temperature and to extending the thickening time of a calcium aluminate phosphate (CaP) geothermal cement slurry consisting of calcium aluminate cement (CAC) as the base reactant and sodium polyphosphate (NaP) solution as the acid reactant. The set-retarding activity of citric acid was due to the uptake of Ca 2+ ions from the CAC by carboxylic acid groups within the citric acid. This uptake led to the precipitation of a Ca-complexed carboxylate compound as a setretarding barrier layer on the CAC grains' surfaces. However, this barrier layer was vulnerable to disintegration by the attack of free Ca 2+ ions from CAC, and also to degradation at elevated temperature, thereby promoting the generation of exothermic energy from acid—base reactions between the CAC and NaP after the barrier was broken. The exothermic reaction energy that was promoted in this way minimised the loss in strength of the citric-acid-retarded cement. The phase composition assembled in both retarded and non-retarded cements after autoclaving at 180°C encompassed three reaction products, hydroxyapatite (HOAp), hydrogrossular and boehmite, which are responsible for strengthening the autoclaved cement. The first two reaction products were susceptible to reactions with sulphuric acid and sodium sulphate to form crystalline bassanite scale as the corrosion product. The boehmite phase possessed a great resistance to acid and sulphate. Although the bassanite scales clinging to the surfaces of the cement were the major factor governing the loss in weight, they served to protect the cement from further acid and sulphate corrosion until their spallation eventually occurred. Nevertheless, the repetitive processes of HOAp and hydorgrossular → bassanite → spallation played an important role in extending the useful lifetime of CaP cement in a low pH environment at 180°C.",

For that reason, even for mortars with such a low alkaline reserve as those with total amount of cement substitution of 45%, the carbonation rate obtained has been very low when a low water/cementitious material ratio and a plasticiser were used. The corrosion rates of steels embedded in these mortars have been measured by the polarisation resistance technique. In the initial curing period it was observed that normal Portland cement–FC3R–fly ash mortars did not provoke a premature depassivation of steels. During the subsequent carbonation attack, it was observed that the combination of FC3R and fly ash in mortars resulted in corrosion rate levels slightly higher than those observed in non-substituted mortars.",

The effects of two retarders, sodium gluconate (SG) and citric acid (CA), on the workability of pastes containing 0·7 wt% β-naphthalenesulfonic acid-based superplasticiser (BNS) were determined. At the same BNS dosage, improved workability only occurred with the addition of 0·03–0·09 wt% SG, and not with 0·12–0·15 wt% SG or with 0·03–0·15 wt% CA. The reasons for this phenomenon were investigated by way of the adsorbed amount of BNS on C 3 S, C 2 S, C 4 AF-gypsum, and C 3 A-gypsum surfaces at different SG or CA dosages using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. SG and CA were found to reduce the adsorbed amounts of BNS on C 3 S, C 2 S, and C 4 AF-gypsum surfaces at 5 and 60 min because of the competitive adsorption between the retarders and BNS. CA also had a more remarkable reducing effect than SG. On the other hand, the adsorbed amount of BNS on C 3 A-gypsum was enhanced because the retarders accelerated the formation rate of ettringite. The adsorbed BNS amount was also higher in the presence of CA than that of SG, indicating that CA enhances the consumption of BNS in the structure of ettringite. Overall, 0·03–0·09 wt% SG distributes BNS better on different minerals and improves paste workability.",

This method requires common laboratory X-ray powder diffractometers (knowing the equipment constant) and avoids the dilution/alteration of the sample. However, the obtained values may be biased due to poor particle statistics. On the other hand, internal standard analysis in transmission geometry is suitable to determine the absolute amorphous and crystalline non-quantified contents that are less biased owing to enhanced particle averaging statistics.

Aluminium and PZT particles were distributed in a Portland cement matrix, and the dielectric constant, tan δ and strain coefficients were experimentally investigated as a function of inclusion volume fraction. The three-phase piezoelectric composites were found to possess higher piezoelectric strain coefficients, d 33 , than their two-phase counterparts (PZT and Portland cement composites). The highest value of d 33 observed for the three-phase composite was 8·1 pC/N for volume fractions of 0·7 and 0·2 for PZT and aluminium respectively, which was 164% of the value observed for the two-phase composite, at the same PZT volume fraction. An analytical model was used to predict values for the effective dielectric constant of the three-phase composites, and these values compared reasonably well to the empirical data. An investigation of sample degradation as a function of time was performed. Samples showed the highest degree of reduced dielectric performance occurred within two days of data capture, and minimal subsequent reduction in performance after 300 d. Electrical properties of the composites are influenced by the oxidation of aluminium by the alkaline constituents in the cement matrix, distribution of PZT and aluminium within the matrix, particle agglomeration, inclusion size, contact resistance between particles and air voids. The increased dielectric and piezoelectric strain coefficients, demonstrate that these types of materials may be useful in applications such as structural health monitoring and energy harvesting.",

MWCNTs with different concentrations were incorporated into cement-based composites to improve the toughness and fracture resistance of the composites. The effect of different concentrations of MWCNTs on the mechanical properties of the cement-based composites was investigated. Results show that the flexural strength and compressive strength increase significantly. The microstructure of the MWCNTs in hardened cement was observed and analysed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The reinforcing mechanisms of cement-based composites by MWCNTs were also discussed, and the conclusion is that the improvement can be correlated to energy-dissipating processes owing to crack bridging, network filling and MWCNTs pull out at the crack tips. The porosity and pore size distribution of the composites were measured using mercury intrusion porosimetry, and the results indicate that cement-based composites containing MWCNTs have lower porosity and more concentrated pore size distribution.",

Structural, dynamic and mechanical properties of calcium silicate hydrate gel at the colloid level (∼15 nm) were investigated for the first time in light of molecular dynamics. Calcium silicate hydrate models were constructed by aggregation of colloids consisting of layered molecular structures. Five calcium silicate hydrate samples were first constructed by 108 spherical calcium silicate hydrate particles coated by water molecules of thickness from 0 nm to 0·2 nm. The built models including 200 000∼300 000 atoms were subsequently subjected to uniaxial tension testing to determine the mechanical properties. Structurally, water molecules coating the colloids disjoin the interaction between neighbouring calcium silicate hydrate particles by replacing the stable ionic–covalent bonds with low-strength H bonds. Water molecules in the interparticle region diffuse faster than structural water molecules inside calcium silicate hydrate gel, which reduces the stability of colloid aggregation. With increasing water-coated molecule layers, both the stiffness and cohesive force of calcium silicate hydrate gels are significantly weakened. During the tensile process, the region rich with water-coated molecules become the crack propagation channel, which accelerates the tensile failure of calcium silicate hydrate gel in the saturated state.",

Therefore, GFNS was used as a partial replacement of cement to study its effect on the reduction of ASR. It was found that the use of GFNS for at least 30% cement replacement reduced the 10 d and 21 d mortar bar expansions below the allowable limits. The consumption of portlandite by the pozzolanic reaction of GFNS is considered as the primary reason for the reduction of expansion.

The saturation levels with respect to the hydration products of PC and AAS were obtained by thermodynamic modelling. The main findings of this study were: the effective saturation index for portlandite in the AAS system was always below zero and the sulfate-bearing phases were not stable in the AAS system compared with those in the PC; strätlingite and hydrotalcite phases were stable in the AAS paste due to the high magnesium and silicon concentrations in the pore solution; both the ionic strength and alkalinity of the AAS pore solution were higher than those of the PC pore solution, which were responsible for more severe efflorescence in the AAS paste and the higher conductivity of the AAS pore solution. According to thermodynamic estimations, tobermorite-based C–S–H was dominant in the AAS system after 7 d, while jennite-based and tobermorite-based C–S–H gels were present in the PC system up to 28 d. The results suggest that in PC and AAS pastes, different solid phases are formed during the hydration, which change with time, and the reactions and equilibria in both binders are completely different.",

The electrical resistivity, chemical shrinkage and autogenous shrinkage of the pastes decreased with increasing w/b ratio and fly ash content after final setting. The autogenous shrinkage development over time could be divided into a setting period, a rapid growth period, an expansion period and a slow growth period. Based on the test results, the chemical shrinkage and the autogenous shrinkage were linearly correlated to electrical resistivity after hydration for 24 h and 30 h respectively. The linear relationships will help to expand the application of electrical resistivity measurements. The parameter γ, defined as the proportion of autogenous shrinkage to linear chemical shrinkage after the final set, decreased with time due to increasing paste stiffness. This parameter will help researchers quantitatively understand the volume proportion of autogenous shrinkage and empty cavities during hydration.",

The individual constituent of the waste concrete powder is mechanically activated in the ground hardened cement paste (GHCP). This influence on the properties of AASC fresh, hardened pastes and hardened concretes was assessed depending on the concentration (5–60%) and the fineness (200–800 m 2 /kg) of the GHCP, the nature of the alkali activator (sodium carbonate and sodium silicate) and the curing conditions (normal conditions and steam curing). The considered properties for the fresh paste were the water/binder ratio and the setting time; for the hardened paste, the water absorption, density and compressive strength after 2, 7, 14, 28, 180 and 360 d of ageing were assessed. The GHCP accelerated setting and hardening, improved the early strength and long-term strength of the AASC paste and replaced slag by up to 45%. The influencing factors affected the strength of the AASC with GHCP as an admixture in the following order: alkali activator type &gt; curing conditions &gt; GHCP fineness. The accelerating and strengthening effects of the GHCP were more intense under normal curing conditions than under steam curing, and the GHCP activated more AASC using sodium carbonate than sodium silicate. The compressive and flexural strength of concrete samples based on AASCs with 7·5–10% GHCP included improved up to 30–40% compared with the reference samples.",

For a certain amount of entrained water needed for internal curing, an accurate assessment of the absorption capacity of SAP in cement paste is necessary rather than other solutions to properly proportion the dosage of SAP in cement-based materials, thus attaining their effectiveness in mitigating autogenous shrinkage with fewer adverse effects. In this paper, early-age performances of cement paste with and without SAP, including rate of heat evolution, capillary pressure and rheological properties, are compared, with simultaneous observation of the particle size of SAP in the cement paste. Results indicate that the absorption capacity of SAP in situ can be quantitatively evaluated through the comparison of the rate of heat evolution and capillary pressure from the addition of water to setting. The ideal dosage can be confirmed based on the theoretical amount of entrained water needed for internal curing.",

This study investigates cracking evolution of restrained cementitious materials with and without expansive agent based on a comprehensive analysis of residual stress and acoustic emission (AE) signals. Residual stress was calculated according to the measured strains in a dual-ring test. AE parameters such as AE counts, energy, frequency, amplitude and the AE based b-value were studied. The obtained results indicated that the addition of expansive agent led to expansion at early ages, in which case the cement pastes were in a state of compression and the residual tensile stress was delayed. As the material neared the age of visible cracking, an abrupt residual stress release, as well as an obvious AE characteristic (e.g. AE counts and energy) change, would be observed. The most AE hits had an average frequency around 50 kHz. AE hits with larger amplitude occurred less often than the AE hits with smaller amplitude, but the corresponding energy released was much higher. A remarkable decreasing trend in b-value was observed before the sudden residual stress release for the plain cement paste, whereas for the paste with expansive agent the b-value varied relatively smoothly.",

Because of the lack of data concerning the direct comparison between the pore solution of cement and mineral additions-based material, six types of hardened cement pastes were tested. For this purpose, Portland cement (CEM I or CEM V) and mineral additions (limestone filler, fly ash, blast-furnace slag and silica fume) were used. Results from chemical analyses by ionic chromatography show significant concentrations of divalent ions, such as sulfates and calcium, in the pore solution. In fact, the reference cement paste based on CEM I contains about 1.8 mmol/l of calcium and 1.6 mmol/l of sulfates. However, the use of mineral addition significantly modifies the pore solution. In particular, a substitution of cement by 10% of silica fume increases the calcium and sulfates concentrations to 12.2 mmol/l and 6.7 mmol/l, respectively. This change in the chemical composition, the pH and the ionic strength should be taken into account in multispecies transfer modelling and the thermodynamic equilibrium. The time evolution of the chemical composition, pH and ionic strength of the pore solutions was also investigated.",

This as yet unique combination of methods led to greater understanding of the hydration behaviour of the complex binder (cement–calcined clay). The results showed considerable differences depending on the type of calcined clay, its chemical–mineralogical composition and fineness, especially with regards its reaction mechanism with aluminate clinker phases controlled by the composition of the pore solution.

    "abstract": "The present study is comprehensive research on application of biocementation to enhance the properties of concrete including rice husk ash (RHA) as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM). RHA has a large potential to be used as SCM because it has high silica content which eventually forms C–S–H gel by reacting with calcium and water, which increases strength of the cementitious material. However, using high doses of RHA causes a decrease in concrete strength because excessive silica is available to react with calcium hydroxide, forming silica clumps within the concrete matrix, which reduce the bonds within the concrete constituents causing micro cracks. Hence to mitigate this problem, enzyme induced calcium carbonate precipitation (EICCP) process was used to treat the micro cracks, and enhance the mechanical and durability properties of RHA blended concrete. Results showed that EICCP process enhanced the strength of the mix at each replacement level and 10% replacement level exhibited optimum results. with nearly 29% increment in compressive strength. This mix also exhibited enhanced durability as compared to the control specimens. Since concrete constitutes a significant portion of embodied carbon footprint, using greener concrete mixes like “Experimental Mix” has the potential to considerably decrease the carbon footprint of construction.",

    "abstract": "This research explores the effect of steam curing on the strength, durability and microstructure of concretes with and without mineral admixtures of fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast-furnace slag powder (SL). Two types of C55 strength grade concretes (one was pure cement concrete, the other was a concrete made by replacing part of the cement with 12% FA and 18% SL) were prepared and their compressive strength, chloride diffusion coefficient and carbonation depth under standard and steam-curing conditions were measured and compared. The phase composition and microstructure of the concretes under the two curing conditions were tested by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results showed that, on the one hand, compared with standard curing, steam curing is beneficial to the early strength, but not conducive to the later strength development and chloride permeability resistance of both types of concretes. Furthermore, for the steam-cured concrete, the 28 days carbonation depth of the forming surface is higher than that of the bottom surface. In addition, steam curing can reduce the carbonisation resistance of pure cement concrete and improve the carbonisation resistance of concrete mixed with FA and SL. On the other hand, composite mineral admixtures of FA and SL reduce the early strength and the carbonisation resistance of concrete cured by standard curing, but improve the later strength, the carbonisation resistance and chloride permeability resistance of concrete cured by steam curing. FA and SL are thermally activated under steam curing and can react with the calcium hydroxide formed by cement hydration in the early stage, which produces a larger amount of secondary hydration products to improve the pore structure and interfacial microstructure of the concrete with FA and SL. In this way, the adverse effects of steam curing on later strength and durability of concrete are significantly restrained by composite mineral admixtures of FA and SL.",

The study investigates the impact of CAC, both with and without the presence of fly ash (FA), on the mechanical, physical, durability, and microstructural properties of ECC-CAC mixtures. Various proportions of FA-to-CAC up to 1.5 were considered, while assessing different engineering parameters of compressive and flexural strengths, ductility, ultrasonic measurements, chloride penetrability, and drying shrinkage. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to analyze the reaction products related to CAC and/or FA in selected mixtures. Higher strengths of CAC-ECC were achieved at earlier curing ages, though the transformation of CAC’s metastable phases led to reduced strengths in ECC-CAC mixtures compared to the control ECC during extended curing periods. Furthermore, the combination of FA with CAC played a crucial role in avoiding the hydrates conversion and minimizing the shrinkage in CAC-ECC, achieving even lower shrinkage levels than those observed in control OPC-ECC.",

The sensitivity of cement to the sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde type of superplasticizer (SP) and its optimum content was determined from apparent viscosity as afunction of three parameters. It was found that the values characterizing apparent viscosity of the pastes depend non-linearly on the amount of C 3 A, and that the relation is linked to the content of free CaO in cement. Values of pH for the cement suspensions are also highly correlated with the content of free CaO, and may be regarded as an indicator for selection of cements that have good workability with SP. The quality of SF had no significant influence on the rheological behaviour of the cement pastes with SP that had the lowest content of C 3 A, free CaO and alkalis. For all the cements with higher contents of these components, a decrease in viscosity was observed only after the addition of the lower reactivity SF. It has been proved that SF can improve the efficiency of the SP and may reduce the water content provided that its reactivity is limited. The chemical processes at the beginning of hydration are restrained by the same phenomenon.",

Reaction rate constants for the acceleration stage have been calculated using modifications of the Jander and Avrami equations and activation energies have been estimated. Small concentrations of polymer were found to influence the growth of phases to a substantial degree but not to change the hydration mechanism.

It was found that: there is no evidence that sodium cations take part in cation interchange or play a catalytic role in the early stages of hydration; no sodium cations of a detectable quantity are chemically incorporated into the structure of C-S-H solid solution; and no hydrates of zeolitic type or other crystalline phases containing sodium are formed in the AAS pastes studied. It has been concluded that most sodium in AAS pastes is present in pore solution and may be partly sorbed by C-S-H, and that sodium cations may only have the effect of balancing and maintaining OH − anions during the AAS hydration. The structural incorporation of sodium cations in C-S-H is deemed very limited.",

It is considered that the shear vane can have many advantages for particulate suspensions and, because slip layers are avoided, the vane measures a more fundamental property than that determined using a smooth bob. A variety of instrument parameters which can affect the gel strength measured by vanes have been examined and the most important effect was found to be the measuring system stiffness. The use of different instruments could alter the rate of application of shear stress, until first flow occurred, by at least two orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "The advisability of controlling the temperature rise and fall in concrete at early age is well recognised, and the choice of an appropriate, low-heat cement with suitable heat of hydration characteristics can assist in this control. This is particularly pertinent with respect to water-retaining and massive concrete structures where the need to prevent early-age thermal cracking is paramount. Portland cement/ground granulated blast furnace slag (PC/ggbs) or PC/fly ash cements are often used in these structures due to their low heat hydration properties. This paper presents the results of isothermal conduction calorimetry tests carried out on PC/ggbs and PC/fly ash cements and describes a model that uses these results to simulate the heat evolution processes in hydration concrete sections at early ages. The tests covered a range up to 90% ggbs and up to 65% fly ash content by mass of cement, at temperatures from 5° to 60°C. For PC/ggbs cements, the total heat of hydration can be considered as a composition of three components, that is heats from an initial Portland cement reaction, a latent ggbs hydraulic reaction and co-reactivity effects of PC and ggbs; whereas for PC/fly ash cements, the initial PC reaction dominated with a small co-reactivity effect.",

    "abstract": "Synopsis It is well known and accepted that the presence of chlorides and carbonation of the concrete cover are the two main causes of corrosion of reinforcement, and that the simultaneous occurrence of both chlorides and carbonation is expected to increase the likelihood of corrosion. This likelihood may be quantified and monitored through the use of electrochemical techniques. Polarization resistance and electrochemical impedance measurements on rebars embedded in carbonated mortar containing chlorides have been carried out and the results indicate that these techniques not only allow the extent of corrosion to be estimated but also give information about the effect of the variables on the corrosion process.",

Al 2 O 3 content up to 15% has a positive effect on the reactivity of GBFS. Due to the interaction between the Al 2 O 3 and CaO contents the effectiveness of the Al 2 O 3 depends also on the CaO content, which is clearly more significant in lime-rich slags than in slags that are poor in lime. For the optimisation of the quality of GBFS it is recommended to maintain Al 2 O 3 over 10·5% and CaO over 40%. It was found by 27 Al NMR investigation that aluminium in GBFS is mainly tetrahedrally coordinated. However with rising Al 2 O 3 so-called ‘tricluster’ is formed in the slag glasses. This leads to a reactivity reduction.",

For that purpose, thermogravimetric (TG) studies of several FC3R/lime pastes, activated by using different chemical compounds (NaOH, gypsum, CaCl 2 and Na 2 SO 4 ), were performed. First, lime fixation and the nature of the hydration products were characterised from TG curves. Second, sodium sulphate was considered as the best chemical activator in the lime fixation process, yielding a 100% of fixed lime for short curing periods. In addition, hydrated gehlenite crystals incorporating sulphate ions were identified, mainly in cured pastes. From these experimental studies, it can be concluded that FC3R is a very good pozzolanic material for inclusion in lime pastes and mortars, and the addition of a small amount of Na 2 SO 4 and CaCl 2 enhanced the reactive ability of FC3R with hydrated lime.",

X-ray diffraction analysis and differential scanning calorimetry tests were also conducted to determine phase composition, pozzolanic activity and chloride binding of plain and blended cements. The performance of blended cements was found to be better in comparison with plain cements in terms of strength reduction and expansion characteristics and the performance was also found to depend on the type of cement (Type I or Type V). Results also indicate that the presence of chloride ions in the sulphate environment mitigates the sulphate attack in both plain and blended cements.",

Its chemical composition, based in silicoaluminates, together with its zeolitic structure, can be used in concrete, due to its high pozzolanic activity. Mortars were prepared using faujasite-based spent catalyst as a cement replacement (in quantities up to 15%). The mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strengths, and porosity) of these mortars were tested using several water/binder (w/b) ratios (0.4–0.6), curing times (7–90 days) and cement types (CEM I 52.5 R, CEM I 42.5 R, CEM II 42.5 R B-M (V-LL) and CEM II 32.5 N). Thermogravimetric analyses of the pastes were also performed. High short-term pozzolanic activity of the zeolite FC3R and high strength gains were observed in the substituted mortars. During the testing period no negative effects in the mechanical properties were observed for the range of substitutions used. It was found that when the w/b ratio is low, a plasticiser must be used because FC3R has a high water demand. This effect can be partially compensated by using fly ash in the mix, because the spherical shape of fly ash enhances the workability of the mortars.",

Therefore, in the present study, the possibility of synthesising the above-mentioned energy-saving green cement was investigated by adding FBC ashes in various proportions to the raw meal. For this purpose, a raw meal composed of a mixture of limestone, bauxite and gypsum together with FBC bottom ash and baghouse filter ash was prepared. It was sintered in a laboratory-scale muffle furnace at temperatures of 1200, 1250 and 1300°C for various holding times. The results of chemical and mineralogical analysis as well as microscopic examination revealed that FBC ashes have the potential to be used in the raw meal due to the formation of characteristic mineral phases of this type of cement, namely yeelimite, belite, ferrite and anhydrite, in the sample sintered at optimum temperature of 1250°C for 60 min.",

Prisms are used in flexural tests to determine modulus of rupture, flexural toughness and post-cracking flexural strength. Flexural test results show that after reaching the cracking load, the specimens continue to carry more loads with an increase in deflection until the peak load is reached. Following the attainment of peak load, softening mode of collapse is noticed, exhibiting high ductility. UHPC mixtures containing fibres show no degradation in tensile properties under wet–dry cycles and modestly gain strength under thermal cycling, indicating the possibility of the applications of UHPC in aggressive exposure conditions.",

With the use of unmodified straw fibres, the compressive strength of the cement-based material decreases with an increase in corn and cotton straw content, but the rate of decrease is considerably lower than that of wheat and rice straw, mainly because of differences in the strength of the straw. The incorporation of fly ash, urea formaldehyde resin and other materials can effectively improve the mechanical and thermal insulation properties of mixed-type building materials. Three methods of modification are proposed – alkali treatment, grafting treatment and direct addition of a modifier. A multiple linear regression equation between mechanical properties and the content of the main components of the cotton straw cement-based materials is obtained, which provides a theoretical basis to predict and design cement-based block materials. Finally, to address the problems of the mix type (difficult stirring, slow hardening, and energy demands and environmental pollution during the modification process), the concept of a composite-type bionic straw cement-based building material is introduced, which provides direction towards the development of new bionic light straw materials.",

Fuel and oxygen feed to the burning zone and calciners are optimised for the partial oxy-fuel scenario. The lowest specific energy consumption is desired while maximising the amount of carbon dioxide theoretically possible to capture.

Within the limits of the model, the introduction of full oxy-fuel and partial oxy-fuel combustion is possible while maintaining product quality. When simulating partial oxy-fuel combustion, the energy consumption will increase even when no power consumption for the production of oxygen is included.",

The results showed that the optimum addition content of steel slag powder in combined admixture was less than 20%. Steel slag powder decreased normal consistency water requirement, retarded setting time of cement paste and had positive effects on the fluidity of cement mortar. As the curing ages increased, the flexural and compressive strengths of mortars with combined admixture increased rapidly to even higher than that of the blank sample. Additionally, early-age strength could be improved by increasing the specific surface area of the steel slag powder. Hydration products mainly included calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel, C-S-Al-H gel and Ca(OH) 2 . Mixing these two powders of GGBFS and steel slag powder had a positive effect regarding the hydration of steel slag powder.

    "abstract": "The influence of nanosilica (nanoscale-size particles of amorphous silica) on the leaching behaviour of Portland cement pastes made with a relatively low water/binder ratio (w/b = 0·36) and different nanosilica contents (0–3·8 wt% of binder) was investigated through the use of an ultra-accelerated leaching test (using concentrated ammonium nitrate solution as a leachant) coupled with scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analyses. The effect of leaching on the physical and mechanical properties of such pastes was assessed and their chemical resistance to leaching was evaluated through a parametric model. It was found that the addition of nanosilica improves the chemical resistance of cement pastes by producing a significant leaching deceleration (up to 69%). As a result, the decay of compressive strength of leached specimens (about 60% reduction) is significantly retarded. Higher residual compressive strengths were also obtained for totally leached specimens containing nanosilica, as a result of the ability of this admixture to consume portlandite during cement hydration and then reduce the porosity associated with portlandite dissolution during leaching.",

The crystalline phases of calcium carbonate crystal formation and the surface morphology of cement mortar are investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Microbial cement mortar specimens treated in calcium hydroxide source show higher compressive strength (∼29%) and tensile strength (∼47%) compared to control specimens. Surface treatment of specimens with bacteria resulted in an approximately 56% decrease in water absorption and increased the resistance to water and hazard material penetration. This biological surface treatment shows promising prospects for increasing strength and durability aspects of cement mortar specimens.",

The granules of the composites investigated were formed from dried components that were later wetted. The granules thus obtained were burned at 700°C for 1 h. In the samples, 5, 15 and 25% (by weight) of the Portland cement was replaced with the additive. The specimens were then hardened for 28 days under normal conditions. It was estimated that combustion of silica gel–clay–limestone composite at 700°C produced a new artificial pozzolana (SGCL), the pozzolanic activity of which is 260 mgCaO/g. During the combustion process, the fluorine from silica gel was not released into the atmosphere, but combined to form a stable CaF 2 compound. It was established that 5 and 15 wt% SGCL pozzolana additive increased the compressive strength of the samples that were cured for 7 and 28 days under normal conditions. This effect is related to the on-going pozzolanic reaction and the formation of stratlingite (C 2 ASH 8 ) and hydrogarnet (C 3 AS x H 6–2x ). It was estimated that CaF 2 , which was formed during combustion of the SGCL composite, remained in a stable form during the curing process of the samples. This was because all investigated samples of cement with different amounts of additive released a negligible quantity of fluorine (&lt;1·5 ppm) into the liquid phase.",

    "abstract": "Micro- and nano-siliceous particles have been employed as one of major components of Portland cement composites because of their filling effect and pozzolanic reaction. Enhancing the mechanical properties of Portland cement composites using nano-particles without workability reduction and dispersion difficulties is one of the challenges in the cement field of research. In order to overcome disadvantages of nano-particles in cement, a new method was investigated in this study. Magnetite-silica core-shell nano-composites (MS), which have been widely used in biological fields, were employed here as fillers and reinforcements in cement pastes. These nano-composite particles consist of nano-magnetite (NM) cluster and nano-amorphous silica shell. Different types of analysis such as X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer were conducted on these particles to investigate their properties. MS particles were synthesised by coating nano-magnetite particles with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a source of silica. MS particles were used as an additive material in cement paste mixes with cement replacement ratios of 0·05, 0·1 and 0·2%. Additional samples were also made with the same cement replacement ratio of NM and nano-silica (NS). Experimental results indicated that the compressive strength of cement paste can be increased up to 14%. This is mainly attributable to the pozzolanic effect of silica shell in combination with the filler and nuclei effect of these particles. It was also found that the MS does not change the workability of mixes considerably. Additionally, the microstructure of cement pastes was characterised using scanning electron microscopy to evaluate the effect of NM, NS and MS particles on the microstructure of cement pastes.",

It was found that the diameters of polymer particles adsorbed on cement were larger than those in colloidal solution, especially for polymer particles with a high content of soft monomer. The ‘real coverage area’ of polymer particles on cement was theoretically calculated according to the number average diameter of polymer particles adsorbed on cement. It was found that, instead of the adsorption amount of polymer on cement, the real coverage area of polymer on cement is positively correlated with the setting time of latex-modified cement paste. A higher content of soft monomer led to easier deformation of the polymer particles adsorbed on cement, so that the retardation effect of latex on the early hydration of cement increased.",

The highest pozzolanic activity (134 mg calcium oxide (CaO)/g) was observed in the samples calcined at a temperature of 900°C. In the samples, 5, 10, 15 and 25% (by weight) of the Portland cement was replaced with calcined additive at the temperature of 900°C. The samples were then hardened for 28 d under normal conditions. Owing to relatively low pozzolanic activity, the pozzolanic reaction in the samples with the additive up to 28 d of hydration was not noticeable. However, calcined mica clay additive acted as a microfiller and significantly increased the rate of hydration of Portland cement clinker minerals. The calcined mica clay additive had a positive effect on the compressive strength of samples cured for 28 d under normal conditions because up to 15 wt% of ordinary Portland cement can be replaced with the additive being investigated without impairing the strength class of the cement.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the properties and performance of green alternatives to ordinary Portland cement is now a significant challenge for many researchers. Alkali-activated slag (AAS) is a promising alternative because it has good durability and is both cost-effective and eco-friendly. However, high shrinkage limits the adoption of AAS. This paper investigates the potential of shrinkage mitigation in AAS paste by combining a low volume fraction of dry and water-saturated natural cellulose fibres (NCFs), which act as an internal curing agent, depending on their porous structure and hydrophilic properties, as well as fibre reinforcement to enhance the mechanical properties. Shrinkage, internal relative humidity (RH), strength and heat flow were tested; microstructural analysis was conducted as well, in order to illustrate the influence of NCFs on the AAS microstructure. The results show that NCFs effectively implement outstanding mitigation of AAS autogenous shrinkage and drying shrinkage by about 35–66·9% and 33·9–51·5%, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of NCFs can enhance the flexural and compressive strength by around 4·6–8·0% and 4·7–9·0%, respectively, when compared to the AAS paste. It was evident from the experiments that the evolution of internal RH, which is supposed to be responsible for the high AAS shrinkage, corresponded well to the development of AAS deformation.",

A sodium hydroxide concentration of 8 M guaranteed optimal reorganisation of the dissolved units to form the reaction products. Calcium hydroxide altered the aluminium distribution in the paste, acting as nucleation spots and intervening in the formation of initial and final reaction products. High temperatures were found to favour the efficiency of the alkali activation, increasing the rate constant and simplifying the expiration of energy barriers.

The chloride ion concentration in the destination solution is measured by ultra violet–visible spectrophotometer at different time intervals. In the natural condition, the penetration of chloride ions through a 7-mm thick mortar disc takes approximately 24 h, whereas nanosilica incorporated mortar resists the ingress of chloride ions up to around 72 h. Furthermore, in the accelerated condition, the diffusion coefficient is reduced from 6·8 × 10 −11 m 2 /s to 4·7 × 10 −11 m 2 /s with 3% addition of nanosilica (type I) by weight of cement. The microstructure studies through scanning electron microscopy reveal that the nanosilica refines the pore structure of the mortar and leads to a denser microstructure owing to the formation of additional calcium-silicate-hydrate gel. The pozzolanic reactivity is also determined using a thermogravimetric technique wherein nanosilica and silica fume incorporated cement mortar reduces the calcium hydroxide content by 67 and 30%, respectively. These studies demonstrate that nanosilica efficiently reduces the chloride permeability of cement mortar owing to higher pozzolanic activity.",

Polymer grafting did not affect the zeta potential but altered the adsorption profile onto Portland cement, with poly(ethylene oxide)-grafted lignosulfonate reaching saturation rather than forming a multi-layer structure as observed with lignosulfonates. The grafted lignosulfonates increased slump values by up to 30% compared with non-grafted lignosulfonate while allowing for significant reductions in water content.

LF-NMR is also used in the study of CAC microstructure. The results of the T 2 distribution curve prove that there are mainly two kinds of pores of different sizes in the slurry, and they gradually become smaller, especially in more than 10 h. The weighted average T 2 and specific surface area decreased and increased, respectively, due to the gradual densification of the slurry. Owing to the conversion of CAH 10 and C 2 AH 8 to C 3 AH 6 , the solid specific surface area decreased, resulting in the LF-NMR specific surface area curve slowing down or even decreasing in about 20–50 h of hydration. XRD and SEM results further validate the characterisation of hydrated CAC microstructure by LF-NMR.",

The UHPC samples were soaked in 10% sodium sulfate solution for 0–180 days (SA duration). The sulfate ion concentration, flexural strength and compressive strength of the UHPCs were investigated. The microstructure of the UHPCs before and after SA was analysed using a multi-technique approach (analysis of interfacial transition zones (ITZs), X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry). The results showed that, with an increase in SA duration, the compressive strength of the UHPC made with RFA increased. The generated gypsum and ettringite refined the microstructure by converting harmful pores (&gt;20 nm) into harmless pores (&lt;20 nm) in the UHPC matrix. For the same SA duration, the sulfate ion concentration of UHPC increased with an increase in RFA content due to more ITZs, pores and microcracks introduced by the RFA. Strength development models for UHPC with different RFA contents under SA were developed.",

The increase in the porosity of the OPC specimens was greater than that of MKG specimens, whose main constituents reacted with the nitric acid solution relatively mildly. However, large quantities of fragments peeled away from the MKG specimens, and their mass and compressive strength losses were greater than those of the OPC specimens. The porosities of the MKG specimens were only slightly changed. The strength loss of the MKG specimens was mainly due to broken matrix structures and newly formed porous silicious frameworks.",

Zero emission target will be reached using several leverages, including the reduction of the clinker content in cement. Low clinker cement represent a market solution and are already efficiently implemented in many European countries, however, the strength development of low clinker cement at early age is lower compared to Ordinary Portland Cements (OPC) with higher clinker contents. The use of blends of low clinker Portland cement and Calcium Sulfoaluminate Cement (CSA) could support the need for low CO 2 binder with high early strength. The behavior of four blended cements containing CSA clinker, OPC clinker, limestone, fly ash, pozzolana and slag has been characterized using different techniques in terms of resistance to carbonation, chloride migration and sulfate attack. The findings indicate that the durability performances are enhanced when supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) with pozzolanic or latent hydraulic activity are present, as opposed to the presence of limestone. SCMs exhibit an active role also in an OPC-CSA matrix. Blend of CSA-OPC cement and slag represents a system characterized by both high early and late strengths, along with favorable durability behavior.",

The results indicate that within the range of 0.0% to 0.6% GO content, the hydration activity of MgO first decreases and then increases with increasing GO dosage.

    "abstract": "pH and hardness are crucial physicochemical properties of groundwater, exerting a substantial influence on the formation of underground ecosystems. The application of cement-stabilized soil has the potential to modify these characteristics. However, the specific impacts of cement-stabilized soil on the pH and hardness of groundwater remain poorly understood. In this study, cylindrical leaching experiments were employed to elucidate the alterations in pH and hardness of leachate derived from cement-stabilized soil under various conditions. The findings indicated that the pH of the leachate was predominantly influenced by soaking time, whereas it was minimally affected by the cement content. The dissolution of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ) resulting from hydration reactions served as the primary factor contributing to the pH fluctuations within the leachate, which ranged between 12.1 and 13.0. The proportion of cement in cement-stabilized soil directly influenced the availability of calcium ions in the leachate. Furthermore, a lower pH in the soaking solution tended to induce an elevated hardness in the resulting leachate. Of particular significance was the observation that the equivalent calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) concentration in the leachate consistently surpasses 850 mg/l. Consequently, cement-stabilized soil demonstrably exerted a substantial influence on increasing groundwater hardness. Although this contribution diminished progressively over time, it remained a non-negligible factor.",

The alkali activators employed included sodium metasilicate pentahydrate (Na 2 SiO 3 ·5H 2 O) and anhydrous sodium metasilicate (Na 2 SiO 3 -anhydrous). Various parameters were explored, such as compressive strength, electrical resistivity, mass and volume changes, and acid penetration depth. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy images, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and elemental mapping were also used to monitor microstructural changes. The results showed that one-part alkali-activated slag concrete made with anhydrous sodium metasilicate in a nitric acid medium had relatively better performance than the same concrete activated with sodium metasilicate pentahydrate. Microstructural analysis showed that due to the nitric acid medium, the composition of binder gel atoms changed, but no new phase was created in the concrete matrix. Based on the findings derived from EDX analysis, it could be inferred that the greater abundance of sodium and magnesium elements in one-part AASC, in comparison to the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mixture, contributed to a retardation in concrete destruction. In addition, the OPC mixture displayed mass and volume changes 2.43 and 2.64 times greater than those of the one-part AASC activated with anhydrous sodium metasilicate.",

The results indicate that the optimal activation of CSA occurs with calcination at 500°C for 6 h, followed by rapid cooling in ice water, significantly improving the microstructure and early strength of the mortar. Incorporating 5% CSA increases compressive strength and reduces the mortar’s chloride diffusion coefficient by 8.6%.

Extensive studies have confirmed that adding redispersible polymer powder (RPP) to ordinary Portland cement enhances its water resistance. This study thus investigates the effect of ethylene vinyl acetate-based RPP on the mechanical properties and water stability of magnesium potassium phosphate cement (MKPC). The findings indicate that incorporating 0.5% RPP in MKPC achieves the highest flexural and compressive strengths compared to samples without RPP. The addition of 0.5% RPP also results in the greatest water stability and lowest water absorption. Thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analysis reveal that 0.5% RPP promotes the formation of hydration products. As shown in scanning electron microscopy results, MKPC with 0.5% RPP exhibits larger, smoother and more fully formed hydration products. The RPP adsorbs on the magnesium oxide surface, reducing flowability and delaying the hydration process. In later stages, the film-forming effect of RPP establishes a spatial network structure with hydration products, thereby enhancing the water resistance of MKPC.",

The results showed a significant improvement in the chloride penetration resistance of the CW–cement concrete, even considering the selection of limestone aggregates.

By conducting macro-performance tests (setting time, compressive strength) and micro-analyses (X-ray diffraction, heat of hydration, scanning electron microscopy), the effects of varying gypsum levels on these interactions were identified. The results showed that an increase in gypsum content from zero to 9 wt% progressively extended the setting time for cement pastes containing 5 wt% AFA. For cements with 7 wt% and 9 wt% AFA, the setting time first decreased before increasing. The compressive strengths at 1, 7 and 28 days typically first increased and then decreased. This behaviour was linked to the additional SO 4 2− from gypsum reacting with tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) to form significant quantities of ettringite, enhancing the dissolution and hydration of tricalcium silicate. However, excessive gypsum led to excessive SO 4 2− adsorption on C 3 A surfaces, inhibiting its hydration and thus diminishing the formation of calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate hydration products. Optimal results for setting time and compressive strength were achieved when the ratio of C 3 A to sulfur trioxide (SO 3 ) ratio (C 3 A/ST ratio) was between 0.38 and 0.56. By adjusting the gypsum content, the C 3 A/ST ratio in the cement–AFA–water system was effectively regulated, offering critical insights for optimising high-performance shotcrete.",

To investigate the mechanisms underlying these influences, unconfined compressive strength tests and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses were performed on CTS samples cured under four different conditions, with assessments made at 7, 14 and 28 days. The results showed that, with an increase in both cement content and curing age, the internal compactness improved, the gel pore water content decreased and the crystallisation water content (CWC) increased, thereby enhancing compressive strength. Under water curing, the CTS demonstrated more complete hydration, resulting in a denser pore structure and the highest strength. In contrast, natural curing slowed hydration due to pore water evaporation, necessitating the consideration of suction and carbonation effects. Based on the experimental data, a linear model was developed to characterise the relationship between CWC and strength. This model elucidates the correlation between the degree of hydration and strength, providing a valuable reference for predicting trends in strength development.",

    "abstract": "During the hydration process water in cementitious materials is consumed and the internal relative humidity of the pore system drops. Due to the self-desiccation, autogenous deformation – which plays an important role in early-age macroscopic volume change of cementitious material – will occur. While there is general agreement about the existence of a relationship between autogenous deformation and internal relative humidity changes in the pore system, the actual mechanism is still under discussion. Surface free energy of solid particles, disjoining pressure and capillary tension are the three frequently discussed mechanisms. This paper presents models for calculation of the disjoining pressure and capillary tension of cement paste. In the model of disjoining pressure, the disjoining is divided into three components, namely, van der Waals force, the electrostatic force and the structural force. Portland cement paste (CEM I 52.5 R) with water/cement ratio 0.37 is studied to compare the roles of the disjoining pressure and capillary force on the autogenous deformation.",

The rheological performance and hydration process of the cement paste were analysed. Results showed that adding C-S-Hs–PCE could improve the rheological performance of cement paste. With a low amount of C-S-Hs–PCE adopted, the viscosity and shear stress reduced slightly, while a high amount of C-S-Hs–PCE led to sharply decreased viscosity and shear stress. Adding C-S-Hs–PCE could shorten the cement hydration induction period and improve the hydration heat release rate significantly. The crystalline nuclei provided by C-S-Hs–PCE promoted the nucleation growth of hydration products. When C-S-Hs–PCE content increased, the hydration reaction products in the hardened cement slurry increased remarkably, and a large number of hydration products effectively filled into the micro-pores, leading to reduced large pores and increased nanopores. Adding 1.0% C-S-Hs–PCE increased compressive strength at 1 day by 12.9%, the 3 day compressive strength by 18.2%, 7 day compressive strength by 20.5% and 28 day compressive strength by 12.6%. The findings could provide a theoretical reference for the performance regulation of cementitious materials.",

    "abstract": "During clinkering, the release of volatile sulfur elements poses a threat to the surrounding atmosphere and environment. Thus, it becomes imperative to investigate the gasification process of sulfur elements during the collaborative disposal of cement kilns. Thermogravimetric analysis was employed to determine the main gasification reaction temperature range, followed by kinetic and thermodynamic analysis. The results revealed that using Friedman, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Starink, the average activation energies of sulfur gasification reaction were determined to be 226.56, 270.54, 259.90 and 260.58 KJ/mol, respectively. The KAS model exhibited a favourable fit with the experimental results, enabling the estimation of the pre-exponential factor. In terms of thermodynamic properties, the gasification reaction displayed positive ΔH and ΔG values, indicating it is highly endothermic and non-spontaneous. From a reaction function perspective, sulfur gasification is predominantly influenced by diffusion. The established mathematical prediction model of the sulfur gasification ratio demonstrated minimal deviation from the experimentally measured value. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters presented in this study provide a theoretical foundation for the precise control and capture of harmful sulfur elements during clinkering.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoaluminate cement (PAC) exhibits superior potential for oil/gas well cementing in environments that are rich in carbon dioxide due to its high-temperature resistance, strength, and corrosion durability. The effects of wellbore temperature (particularly high temperatures) on the strength of PAC and its hydration products were investigated in this study. The evolution of PAC’s properties under curing at 90–150°C curing was studied using compressive strength tests, permeability analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was found that the compressive strength of the PAC cured at 150°C was significantly increased (&amp;gt;100%) as compared with curing at 90°C. The permeability of the PAC remained extremely low (&amp;lt;7.23 × 10−3 mD (∼7.14 × 10−14 cm2)). Key hydration products include hydrated phosphoaluminate, hydroxyapatite, hydrated aluminate and aluminium hydroxide. Elevated temperatures (&amp;gt;110°C) promoted the conversion of C2AH8 in hydrated aluminate to denser C3AH6, contributing to a permeability increase. Aluminium hydroxide morphology transitioned from nordstrandite at 90°C to aluminium hydroxide gel and boehmite (γ-AlOOH) at 150°C. Hydroxyapatite and C3AH6 demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, serving as critical drivers for PAC’s high-temperature strength enhancement. The microstructure of hydrated PAC remained stable across the tested temperature range. These findings clarify the high-temperature performance mechanisms of PAC, supporting its application in challenging well cementing environments.",

Microbubble insulation cement made with colloidal gas aphron (CGA) fluid was fabricated and tested. According to the results, the thermal conductivity of the CGA cement was reduced by 73.5% and the reduction in thermal conductivity was 12.07–68.69% higher than traditional insulation materials (perlite, vitrified microbeads). After curing at 60–100°C, the 10% CGA cement retained consistent compressive strength (10.41–13.43 MPa) and low thermal conductivity (0.118–0.155 W/m.K). This mix is also better suited for geothermal formations due to its increased fluidity and decreased density. Large-diameter pores appeared in the cured cement following CGA rupture. Additionally, the CGA prevented calcium silicate hydrate from forming, which prevented hydration products from filling the gaps and led to many micropores and microcracks. The heat transfer path was greatly expanded by the loose cement structure, which also decreased the total heat transmission per unit time. The results of this study offer fresh economic and environmental insights into the design of geothermal cements, considering the thermal conductivity, and lay a foundation for the efficient development of geothermal energy.",

Therefore, the TA dosage was adjusted for the 10°C and 40°C samples.

The SAC had properties of rapid and high strength development. The slag hydration products consisted mainly of the gel-like C-S-H phase and silica-alumina gel. The pastes had a high number of very fine pores with a radius of less than 5 nm. This was obtained by autoclaving at a low temperature of 105°C for a very short time (0·5 day). When SAC was autoclaved at temperatures higher than 105°C, the pore radius became wider. When curing at temperatures lower than 105°C, it took longer to obtain the same hydration ratio. Also, the addition of heavy metal ions (Pb(NO 3 ) 2 or CrO 3 solution) did not affect the hydration of SAC as much. The amount of leached Pb II ions was 1·3 × 10 −6 mmol/cm 2 at 28 days immersion for SAC-NSP pastes (2 mass% Pb(NO 3 ) 2 added as Pb II ions with sodium silicate solution as an activator) autoclaved at 105°C for 0·5 day.

The combination of calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) and tobermorite phases was responsible for strengthening and densifying the autoclaved cement. At 300°C, an excessive growth of wellformed tobermorite and xonotlite crystals generated an undesirable porous microstructure, causing the retrogression of strength and enhancing water permeability. Although all the phases formed in the autoclaved cements were vulnerable to reactions with H 2 SO 4 , so depositing bassanite scales as corrosion product over the cement's surfaces, the C–S–H phase played an important role in retarding the rate of acid erosion. Thus, after the uptake of Ca by the H 2 SO 4 , Ca-destitute C–S–H preferentially reacted with the Mg from the slag to form the lizardite phase that not only retarded the rate of acid erosion, but also retained the integrity of the cementitious structure. Therefore, SSAS cement has good potential as an acid-resistant geothermal well cement at temperatures up to 200°C.",

Experiments reveal that, from the initial state up to cancellation, profiles of both pore water pressure and total lateral pressure are hydrostatic. Simultaneously, the evolution kinetics of both pressures are identical. Consequently, the variation of the lateral pressure envelope during setting is modelled using the Richards equation. Modelling requires the identification of two parameters (permeability of the fresh cement paste and a source term) that describe water requirements during setting. The permeability coefficient is examined through a drainage experiment, coupled to the inverse analysis for identification of the coefficients resulting from the solution of the Richard's equation. Using the parameters identified, the results of the numerical simulation of the pressure variations into the formwork, are in good agreement with the experiment.",

The pastes had 0, 20 and 40% VP as cement replacement and water to binder ratios (W/B) of 0·40, 0·50 and 0·60. The accelerated chloride ion diffusion test was used to calculate the chloride ion diffusion coefficient (D i ) of pastes using the Nernst–Plank equation for steady-state condition. In addition, electrical resistivity, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were also conducted. Good correlations were found between D i , total pore volume and electrical resistivity of the pastes. The Di values of VP-blended pastes were within the range of 10 −7 –10 −9 cm 2 /s. It was also found that blending cement with VP significantly reduced the long-term chloride ion diffusion coefficient and hence increased the long-term corrosion resistance of pastes. This fact was also supported by the presence of lower quantity of Ca(OH) 2 and higher quantity of Friedel's salt in the VP-blended pastes as observed from the DSC tests. Pastes with 40% VP showed better performance in terms of chloride ion diffusivity. The water to binder ratio was also found to affect the D i at the early ages of curing, but became less important at the later ages of curing.",

Low temperature calorimetry was used specifically to assess the percolation (connectivity) of pore networks with various size entryways. Differences amongst the influences of the alkalis are highlighted and discussed in terms of their intrinsic atomic characteristics.",

For this study, well defined Portland cement clinkers consisting of alite and aluminate doped with different amounts of Na 2 O were used. Isothermal conduction calorimetry of cements made from this clinker revealed that doping with Na 2 O activates the initial heat evolution of the clinker during the initial hours. It also influences the main reaction. In situ X-ray diffraction for monitoring cement hydration demonstrates that the dissolution of C 3 A and gypsum is accelerated by the incorporation of Na 2 O. The formation of crystalline ettringite and monosulphate during the first few hours of hydration is delayed. After 90 days of hydration, most of the C 3 A has reacted to monosulphate, detectable by differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy and 27 Al nuclear magnetic resonance. An increase of the Na 2 O content brought about less ettringite in the hydrated samples and changed the morphology of monosulphate to thinner and smaller hexagonal plates.",

The various w/c ratios used were (0·32–0·20). Superplasticiser (sodium salt of naphthalene formaldehyde sulfonic acid polycondensate) was used for mixtures with w/c = 0·20 to facilitate the mixing process. The different cement pastes were cured in a humid atmosphere (approximately 95% relative humidity) for the first 24 h, then under water for the remaining time up to 28 days. After 28 days of hydration, the different specimens were immersed in 7% sodium sulfate solution for up to 16 months. The degree of sulfate attack on different specimens was investigated using: X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The results of the compressive strength, percentage of expansion, bulk density and mass change at various curing ages showed an increase in the sulfate resistance of the hardened cement pastes prepared with w/c ratios of 0·24 and 0·20. The presence of 0·5% calcium stearate as an admixture in the cement pastes improved the sulfate resistance in the pastes with different w/c ratios used in this study and that related to its waterproofing effects.

This sprayed concrete layer acts as a consolidating shield avoiding the convergence (the tendency of the section to squeeze) or dangerous structural collapses. Their efficiency could be related to: cement class and its chemical composition; environmental conditions (humidity; temperature); concrete mix design. A loss of accelerator efficiency is extremely dangerous for workers' safety as sudden collapses of the sprayed material can occur. Only a few studies have been published on the effects of these factors on the accelerating properties of alkali-free accelerators. In the present study, the influence of alkali metals (sodium and potassium) on cement pastes to which different alkali-free accelerators had been added was studied. It was discovered that the higher the alkali content the worse was the accelerator performance. In order to elucidate this phenomenon an analytical investigation was carried out. This included morphological (environmental scanning electron microscopy – field emission gun), chemical (induced coupled plasma – atomic emission spectroscopy), crystal-chemical (X-ray powder diffraction) and physical–chemical (hydration temperature profile; thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry) evaluations. The results revealed significant morphological and crystal chemical differences among the investigated samples.",

In the geochemical conditions in northern Germany, the porewater is of very high salinity, with salt contents of up to 2·5 M. In this work, the elemental composition of leaching water (with different types and amounts of salt) after 24 to 72 h contact with concrete was studied in order to simulate different water intrusion scenarios. It was found that in, addition to the main concrete elements (calcium, silicon, aluminium and iron), many trace elements were quantified in the concrete leachate. The influence of the concrete grain size in the leaching experiment showed that the use of particles &lt;100 μm is necessary to obtain reproducible results. The influences of different solution salinities and the addition of calcium chloride and sodium sulfate on the leaching process were examined. For most elements, an increase in sodium chloride concentration enhanced the leaching process.",

The use of calcium chloride increased the strength of the cement very significantly. Equilibrium water extraction indicated that the addition of CaCl 2 .H 2 O decreased the evaporable moisture and the pH of the extract from hardened cement paste, which is an indication of enhanced pozzolanic reaction between the lime and bagasse ash. The optimum bagasse ash replacement for cement was found to be 10% without activator and 20% with 4% CaCl 2 .H 2 O.

It has been shown that ground clinker can be set regulated by calcium salts other than gypsum, in particular calcium acetate, formate and nitrate. Rheology of the paste is improved when gypsum is replaced by other salts, probably due to less water binding and surface hydration products without the needle-like morphology of ettringite. In particular, for calcium nitrate, the cumulative hydration temperature is reduced, which allows for low-energy cement without changing clinker chemistry. Removing calcium sulfate all together may also allow heat curing or evolution of hydration heat in massive structures to exceed 70°C without risking delayed ettringite formation.

    "abstract": "Superplasticisers improve the flow properties of fresh cement and offer undoubted benefits to the construction sector. There is concern in the nuclear industry, however, that the presence of a superplasticiser in grout or backfill cement may increase the solubility of radionuclides in the cementitious pore water and/or reduce their adsorption from solution. This paper describes the effect of a commercial, polycarboxylated, polyether comb type superplasticiser on the behaviour of selected metals in blended cements through a series of batch and monolith leach experiments. Results of batch experiments show that the presence of free superplasticiser in solution reduces uptake of nickel ( 63 Ni) and europium ( 152 Eu) by both blast-furnace-slag- and pulverised-fly-ash-modified ordinary Portland cement. Further, metal bound in the presence of free superplasticiser is readily remobilised on exposure to fresh cement solution. Conversely, metal uptake is almost complete and appears irreversible when exposed to hardened cements prepared with superplasticiser as part of the original mix. Monolithic slag cement samples prepared with superplasticiser suffer from bleed, with the surplus water containing a significant proportion of the metals added, including uranium and thorium. Digital autoradiography reveals heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity in the monoliths and demonstrates that the dissolved metals have not been effectively immobilised throughout the specimen. The mobility of thorium may indicate similar behaviour by other tetravalent actinide species, notably Pu(IV) and Np(IV).",

The similarity of this behaviour for the two pastes indicates that inhibition of cement hydration is not the sole reason for SG reduction of fluidity loss of cement paste with PNS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data show competing adsorption forces between SG and polar groups of PNS on the active points of the cement particle surface. This reduces the transformation rate from a caudal style to either a ring or horizontal PNS adsorptive style, as confirmed by dynamic adsorptive models. These are important mechanisms of SG reduction in the fluidity loss of cement pastes with PNS.",

The transformation of β-belite (C 2 S) to α′-C 2 S mainly depends on the dosage of borax, and the change in polymorphs is almost complete when the dosage of borax reaches 5%. The formation of α′-C 2 S can significantly increase the compressive strength and the concentration of borax has a great effect on the strength development of the activated cements. The hydration products of activated cements were also investigated. The results show that the activation of belite can promote the formation of ettringite.

Samples were subjected to two chloride exposure conditions (either complete submersion or a cyclic 6 h wetting and drying cycle). Depths of free chloride penetration as well as total and water-soluble chloride contents were measured for the exposed samples. Samples cured for 28 d before exposure showed far better resistance to chloride ingress than those cured for 7 d. The cement–slag blend with S1, having an alumina content of 12·23%, performed better than the blend with S2 (alumina content of 7·77%), especially for samples cured for 7 d. This was attributed to the higher basicity of S1. However, when the samples were cured for 28 d, the difference between the performances of the slag blends became minimal. Despite this, the overall performance of the slag blends, which was compared against a CEM I 42·5R-type cement, was found to be better at both curing durations.",

Additionally, three interface roughness values and two durations of erosion are set as the main variables. The results indicate that the chloride content in the interfacial zone is higher than that present elsewhere and this phenomenon is termed the ‘interfacial zone effect’ (IZE). This is mathematically described as a GaussAmp function. The IZEs at 180 d are distinctly lower than those at 60 d. The IZEs are minor for superficial parts, but major for deep parts. Specimens with a moderate roughness have the least IZE, whereas those with lower and higher roughness both have greater IZEs. The mechanism of these laws is also analysed.",

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and thermogravimetric methods were used to study different depths of cement paste with a water/cement ratio of 0·35 after 28 d of carbonation. Firstly, based on the hydration and carbonation reaction equations of the CSH, the variation of Ca 2+ can be obtained, and then according to the variation of Ca 2+ to calculate the carbonation degree of CSH. Secondly, the parameter I(Q 2 )/I(Q 1 ) was determined to characterise the structural change of the CSH quantitatively. Finally, the relationship between the CSH carbonation degree and I(Q 2 )/I(Q 1 ) was analysed. The results showed that the carbonation degree of CSH can be expressed as the ratio of the molar content of calcium carbonate carbonated by CSH and the molar content of Ca 2+ in the initial CSH. A good linear relationship was found between the value of I(Q 2 )/I(Q 1 ) and the CSH carbonation degree. Therefore, the NMR method can be used to determine the carbonation degree of CSH.",

To study the basic performance of the seawater-mixed MOC paste, the setting time, hydration exothermic characteristics, compressive strength, thermal stability, seawater resistance, phase composition and microstructure of the paste were analysed in detail. The results showed that the use of seawater in the MOC paste slightly retarded the setting time and increased the total hydration heat. The compressive strength and thermal stability of the seawater-mixed MOC were slightly lower than those of the MOC paste prepared with freshwater. The main hydration product of both MOC pastes was 5Mg(OH) 2 .MgCl 2 .8H 2 O. The residual strength ratio of the seawater MOC paste was 9·70% higher than that of the freshwater MOC paste after 28 d immersion in seawater. However, the standard deviations suggest that the properties of MOC pastes prepared with seawater or freshwater were not significantly different.",

Cement pastes with fixed weight fraction (50%) of FAC, and varying amounts of NT (1·5–4·5 wt%) were prepared, keeping a fixed water-to-binder ratio of 0·35. The resulting strength and hydration attributes as well as microstructural features were studied. The use of NT in FAC incorporated cement pastes led to strength enhancement of the resulting pastes, at the age of 28 d. A 3% addition (by binder weight) of NT was found to be the optimum for incorporating in FAC modified pastes. A more even and compacted microstructure was obtained with the incorporation of NT. FAC particles showed superior bonding and interfacial characteristics. The reduced porosity, as determined from qualitative assessment by scanning electron microscopy imaging, resulted in denser composites with the addition of NT. Improved hydration attributes and microstructural features are attributed to the accelerated pozzolanic reaction of FAC in the presence of NT and the pore-filling effect of nano particles.",

Establishing a numerical model to predict cement properties is therefore becoming increasingly important when considering the effect of C-S-H on the concrete's cohesion and durability. This manuscript presents a novel numerical model of high-density and low-density C-S-H gel phases to simulate the nanoindentation procedure. During the simulation, the C-S-H gel is considered as discrete particles with certain mechanical properties on the nanoscale. Combining the van der Waals force function and the peridynamic force function, some key parameters of the properties of the materials can be obtained by controlling the C-S-H bulk packing fractions and keeping particle-level material properties constant in the simulation. The results show good agreement with experimental and theoretical results for cases involving linear and non-linear self-consistent conditions reported in the literature.",

Relative contents of geopolymeric products and hydration products are studied by acid dissolving testing. The mineral composition, morphology and chemical groups of geopolymeric products and hydration products are analysed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Geopolymer setting time is much faster when calcium content increases. Calcium has a positive effect on compressive strength of geopolymers. By acid dissolving testing, the ratio of geopolymer value/ordinary hydration product value in metakaolin-based geopolymer was 4·4 : 1, whereas in CFA-based and CFA + 6% calcium hydroxide-based geopolymers the values were 1 : 1·7 and 1 : 1·5, respectively. Thus, the main product in metakaolin-based geopolymer is geopolymeric products, whereas in CFA-based geopolymer, hydration products also occur.

In this study, the divalent metal oxide solid solution (RO phase) in SS was analogue synthesised to study its hydration activity and expansibility. The results showed that the hydration activity and expansibility of magnesium oxide (MgO) in the analogue-RO phase is affected by the content of ferrous oxide (FeO); with the increase of molar ratio (x) of iron oxide to magnesium oxide in the analogue-RO phase, the autoclave expansion rate and hydration activity of the cement paste decreased. When x ≤ 0.5, the RO phase had high hydration activity and could cause poor soundness of SS. When x = 1, the RO phase had low hydration activity and could cause slight expansion of SS. When x ≥ 2, the RO phase had no hydration activity and could not cause any expansion of SS. The control of different analogue-RO phase compositions induced different hydration and expansibility, which provided a theoretical basis for the influence of the RO phase on the soundness of SS and enabled measures to be proposed to reduce the expansion of SS, thereby promoting high-volume utilisation of SS in cement and concrete.",

The hydration products and microstructure of pastes were further explored through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

The compressive strength of paste after steam curing is improved, and the compressive strength of the paste mixed with 30% SS can reach more than 50 MPa after 90 days of steam curing.

SS has secondary hydration after long-term ageing and can fill and refine the pore structure, according to SEM.

In this work, the setting times, compressive strength and microscopic analysis (X-ray diffraction quantitative analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy) were used to determine the effects of changes in gypsum content on the hydration and mechanical properties of cement mixed with an accelerator at different temperatures. The results showed that an increase in the gypsum content of the cement promoted the formation of ettringite (AFt) and decreased the setting times of the cement pastes at 0°C, 20°C and 40°C. Mortar compressive strength tests showed that, after curing at 0°C, 20°C and 40°C, the highest compressive strength was exhibited with a final molar aluminate-to-sulfate ratio (C 3 A/SO 3 ; henceforth called the MASR) of 0.84, 0.84 and 1.18, respectively. The mechanical properties of the hardened cement pastes were adversely affected by MASRs that were too high or too low. When the MASR was too high, the conversion of AFt to monosulfate (AFm) was facilitated and C 3 S hydration was slowed. Conversely, when the MASR was too low, this enabled large amounts of AFt to occupy the space where calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gels were formed, resulting in decalcification of the C-S-H gels.",

Now, liquid accelerators exhibit several serious issues, including slowly setting times, low late-stage strength, and high preparation costs et al. Despite the availability of various types of liquid accelerators on the market, addressing these issues simultaneously remains challenging. This study, a low-alkali liquid accelerator (SLA) is prepared using the water bath heating method. This accelerator promotes the setting and hardening of cement and improves late-stage strength through the synergistic effect of low dosages of sodium fluosilicate (SF) and sodium silicate (SS), while also reducing the preparation costs. At a dosage of 7 % SLA, the cement paste achieves a final setting time of 3 min 30 s. The 1 d compressive strength of the mortar reaches 9.5 MPa, and the 28 d compressive strength is 7 % higher than the control sample. It is found that the synergistic effect of SS and SF generates SiO 2 gels and C-S-H gels while creating an alkaline environment that promotes the dissolution of the coating layer of hydration products and silicate mineral phases. Thus, the SLA prepared through the synergistic action of SS and SF effectively overcome the shortcomings of the liquid accelerators.",

Considering the threat of chloride salts still present in desalinated sea sand, this study investigates the effect of Na + , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ (contained on the surface of simulated desalinated sea sand) and metakaolin (MK) additions on the chloride binding properties of simulated desalinated sea sand mortar. The chloride binding capacity of the mortar and the hydration products of the mortar were analysed by chloride content measurement, X-ray diffraction, differential thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results show that Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ have a greater positive effect on improving the chloride binding capacity of mortar than Na + . This is because Ca 2+ promotes the positive potential of the C–S–H gel in the mortar and Mg 2+ facilitates the generation of a solid solution of Friedel’s salts and AFm in the mortar. The addition of MK in mortar improves the physical binding ability of the mortar to chloride ions. This improvement is primarily attributed to the increased production of C–S–H gel and C–A–S–H gel resulting from the addition of MK. This study is expected to provide theoretical support to facilitate the application of desalinated sea sand.",

The C-S-H seeds, both before and after modification, were characterised using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, silicon nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to systematically assess their properties. The early and later mechanical properties of cement pastes mixed with different types of C-S-H seeds were investigated. Additionally, theoretical calculations were performed to ascertain whether the modified C-S-H seeds complied with the pertinent restrictions on alkali content when incorporated into cement. The research findings revealed that the modified C-S-H seeds provided a greater variety and a higher quantity of effective seeds compared with the non-modified seeds. The early strength of cement paste containing modified C-S-H seeds was enhanced by 131.4%, indicating a more pronounced seeding effect than that of non-modified seeds, without negatively impacting later strength. Theoretical calculations validated that the incorporation of 2% modified C-S-H seeds did not trigger an alkali–aggregate reaction. The method is a novel approach for utilising less active solid waste in cement to produce C-S-H seeds, offering a reference for the convenient and cost-effective use of aluminium-rich waste in the preparation of C-S-H seeds.",

The results demonstrated that C-S-H–PCE could shorten the hydration induction period and increase the hydration heat release. When the C-S-H–PCE dosage was 2%, the initiation time of the hydration acceleration period (tA) decreased by 0.084 h and the cumulative heat release over 72 h increased by 3.032 J/g. However, the use of TEA retarded the hydration induction period and increased the hydration heat release. When 0.5% and 1% TEA were added to the LS–cement binder with 1% C-S-H–PCE, the values of tA increased by 113.32% and 127.99% respectively and the cumulative heat of the acceleration period (QA-C) increased from 49.38 J/g to 95.90 J/g. With 2% C-S-H–PCE and 0.5% TEA, the exothermic peaks in the acceleration period were obviously enhanced, with QA-C reaching 100.444 J/g. Moreover, 2% C-S-H–PCE and 0.5% TEA promoted the reaction rate of crystalline nucleation and crystal growth. The use of C-S-H–PCE increased the rheological properties of the binder, while the use of TEA decreased the rheological performance of the binder.

This study investigates the effects of SP and LP on the workability, mechanical properties and durability of MSC, complemented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Results show that the slump, slump flow and strength of MSC initially increase and then decrease with rising SP or LP content, peaking at 10% SP and 5% LP. Compared to MSC without admixtures, 10% SP increases slump and compressive strength by 33.3% and 13.2%, while 5% LP yields respective increases of 23.3% and 7.1%. A combined addition of 10% SP and LP at a 7:3 ratio further enhances the performance of MSC, the compressive strength by 14.1%, freeze–thaw resistance by 68.4% after 50 cycles, sulfate resistance by 44.4% after 30 cycles, and shrinkage resistance by 58.9% after 90 days. SEM observations reveal that appropriate quantities of SP and LP fill internal pores, consume calcium hydroxide, and refine the microstructure, contributing to the improved compactness and durability of MSC.",

The setting times, compressive strengths and autogenous shrinkage of mortars were measured, and the hydration kinetics, phase assemblage and microstructural evolution were characterised. Key findings revealed distinct responses between the two systems. The incorporation of PT sand in the PC mortar markedly delayed the setting times, reduced the compressive strengths and increased the porosity, mainly because the acidic nature of the PT sand suppressed PC hydration. Conversely, the AAS mortar exhibited superior compatibility with PT sand, mainly attributable to its inherently higher alkalinity and denser pore microstructure. The setting times were maintained within practical ranges (4.18 h and 6.14 h) and a 28-day compressive strength of 44.5 MPa was achieved. The inherent alkaline reservoir in AAS mortar effectively neutralised the acidic challenges, while residual pyrite was still detected. The results of this work demonstrate the feasibility of using PT sand in AAS mortar.",

Various analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy were used to elucidate the mechanisms of SF in relation to OLCP. Results show that incorporating SF enhances the homogeneity of OLCP significantly, refines pore structure and increases compressive strength. These improvements are primarily attributed to the pozzolanic, filling and nucleation effects of SF, which depend on maintaining essential flow properties and adequate dispersion within the OLCP. Notably, a stronger correlation was found between compressive strength and pore structure parameters, particularly the ratio of small to large pores. The results provide valuable references for the development of high-performance lightweight cement with high pressure bearing capacity.",

As calcined clays become more widely accepted as supplementary cementitious material (SCM) around the world, it becomes very important to reliably predict the energy requirements for the industrial calcination of clays. In this study, a simple mathematical model is developed to estimate the calcination energy required for the conversion of kaolinite into metakaolin considering the drying and dehydroxylation process. The model was developed using seven natural clays with varying chemical compositions and a wide range of kaolinite contents (73–25%). The two key input parameters, namely, moisture content and kaolinite content, were found to be sufficient for obtaining a reasonable prediction of the energy demand (R2 = 0.97). In addition, the study found that the associated minerals also have a slight influence on the calcination energy, with iron-rich clays exhibiting relatively lower energy demand compared to quartz-rich clays. The model was validated with 22 other clay samples and the results indicate that good estimates of energy requirements for the calcination process can be made and that the model can be used satisfactorily for the design of clay calcination processes.",

Hydrothermal treatment at 160°C of OPC modified by CaHPO4 leads to phase transformations of a poorly crystalline phosphate containing product phase into crystalline hydroxyapatite. Generally, the presence of sodium and calcium phosphates resulted in improved flexural strengths; an exception was when (NaPO 3 ) n ·Na 2 O was used.

In this study, the bleeding process, including channelling of cement paste and mortar, was investigated. The latter material is a step forward in the study of bleeding of concrete. Besides surface settlement, pore pressure and density profiles were also measured during the experiments to give a better insight into the mechanism of bleeding and channelling. The effect of bleeding and channelling on the strength development in a column was also studied. A difference in strength of about 30% was found between samples from upper and lower parts of a column. However, the effect of channels on the compressive strength is found to be negligible as the area of such channels is small compared to the total area. With these data, a better understanding of the channelling mechanism was achieved. A simple model was then used to estimate when channelling will occur.",

The temperature at which the maximum occurs depends upon the nucleation rates of CAH 10 and AH 3 : the CAH 10 nucleation rate is expected to decrease with temperature whereas the AH 3 nucleation rate is expected to increase. Thus, one passes from an induction period controlled by the CAH 10 nucleation rate to an induction period controlled by AH 3 at the temperature that induces the maximum retardation of the hydration.

The kinetic equations of C-S-H decomposition at 600, 700 and 800°C are proposed. The quantitative measurement using α-Al2O3 as a reference phase, revealed that the decomposition of C-S-H started at 560°C but became significant only above 600°C. The C-S-H decomposition rate increased dramatically with temperatures above 600°C. The decomposition of C-S-H influenced the strength loss of high-performance concrete (HPC) exposed to temperatures above 600°C but had little or no effect on the occurrence of explosive spalling. This test result confirms the vapour pressure mechanism for explosive spalling of HPC. It is also postulated that the strength loss of concrete exposed to temperatures below 600°C must be mainly caused by the HCP pore-structure coarsening.",

Synthetic slags, of varying glass:crystal ratios, were used along with Portland cement as a reference.

    "abstract": "Engineers often have to deal with materials of ill-defined behaviour such as cement-based materials in order to perform special design tasks. There is usually great difficulty in predicting the engineering properties of such materials due to various factors, including their non-homogeneous nature, their composite behaviour with dissimilar ingredients and sometimes the dual and/or contradictory effects of some components on the overall performance. Until recently, the methods used to predict the engineering properties of cement-based materials have been based mainly on statistical and mathematical models, which in turn are derived from human observation, empirical relationships and assumptions with limited ability to account for the effects of and interaction between all variables involved. An alternative approach, termed artificial neural networks (ANNs), has recently emerged in different engineering fields as a popular tool to predict the behaviour of materials. Due to the relatively recent adoption of ANNs for modelling the behaviour of cement-based materials, a good understanding of its fundamental basis and a critical assessment of its performance are essential. This paper examines the most widely used ANNs in materials modelling (the feed-forward, back-propagation (FFBP) neural networks). Guidelines for building, training, and validating such networks are provided. A critical assessment is presented of the effects of various parameters on the training and performance of FFBP networks and their use as an alternative approach to traditional modelling methods is evaluated through a case study. Recommendations are made to optimise the performance of ANNs.",

The calculation results showed that framework clusters should be primary polycondensation products of geopolymeric cement made with NaOH or KOH-activated metakaolin, which was also verified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy equipped with magic angle spinning technique. In addition, the semi-empirical AM1 calculations revealed that the existence of sheet polycondensation clusters was also possible, the amount of which depended on the types of alkaline solution.",

    "abstract": "Four water-reducing chemical admixtures: calcium lignosulfonate, amino-sulfonic-based superplasticiser, sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde and sulfonated melamine urea formaldehyde resin were added to Portland cement paste in amounts ranging from 0 to 0·6%, at a constant water/cement ratio of 0·4 and their early hydration was investigated for up to 72 h. The results show that the rate of hydration during the hydration staring period was accelerated and the hydration induction period was extended by the four water-reducing chemical admixtures. Sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde has the most encouraging effect on hydration and made the hydration peak rate increase to 60 kJ/kg per h in a dosage of 0·6% during the hydration starting period. By increasing the induction period and reducing the second hydration peak rate of cement paste strongly, calcium lignosulfonate was found to be the most effective retarder among the four water-reducing chemical admixtures. When the dosage of calcium lignosulfonate was 0·6%, the hydration induction period of the cement paste was extended from 10 to 40 h. The use of a 0.6% dosage of amino-sulfonic-based superplasticiser extended the induction period from 6 to 29 h. With the addition of sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde and sulfonated melamine urea formaldehyde resin, the induction period was only slightly affected. It is interesting that the second hydration peak rate of cement paste increased with the dosage of sulfonated melamine urea formaldehyde resin, which differed from other three water-reducing chemical admixtures.",

When sodium chloride is added in the solution, the zeta potential tends to become positive. The inversion of the potential is explained by releases of Ca 2+ by the portlandite and calcium-silicate-hydrate.

The characterisation of the raw and the calcined clays included X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetry and infra-red spectroscopy. The pozzolanic activity was evaluated by mechanical tests, performed on calcined clay–lime and on calcined clay–cement mini-cylinders, and by physical method (dosage of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ) by differential scanning calorimetry). The identification of the hydrated phases was done by XRD, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. Kaolinitic clay from Tabarka was found to have the highest pozzolanic activity, compared with the illito-kaolinitic clay from Medenine containing some haematite. It was demonstrated that the haematite contained in the last clay did not contribute to the pozzolanic reaction in the presence of calcium hydroxide while in the presence of cement, the pozzolanic reactivity is improved. The haematite contained in Medenine clay contributes to the reaction with cement to form iron substituted ettringite and iron-substituted C–S–H. Furthermore, a new hydrated ferritic phase (Ca 3 Fe 2 (OH) 12 ) is formed. The major hydraulic products such as C–S–H, C 2 ASH 8 and C 4 AH 13 were identified.",

Magnesium phosphosilicate cement (MPSC) is a new type of magnesium phosphate-based cement, which is composed of magnesia, phosphate and silicate materials, such as fly ash. MPSC has the characteristics of rapid setting and high early strength. In the present study, the effect of different additives, sodium tripolyphosphate (ST), borax (NB) and boric acid (BA) on the properties of MPSC was investigated, including the setting time, temperature rise of cement during initial hydration and strength development. In comparison with the MPSC sample without additive, ST had an acceleration effect on the setting process, whereas NB and BA had a retarding effect on the hydration. BA had a longer retardation time than NB. The higher the rate of temperature rise, the higher was the reaction rate, the shorter was the setting time, and the higher was the early strength. Hydration products of MPSC were analysed by X-ray diffraction. The results showed that a cementitious hydrate, MgKPO 4 ·6H 2 O (MKP), formed in the hardened cement paste. There was no new product formed after the additives were incorporated in the hydration system, they might influence the formation rate of MKP during reaction.",

Materials deals with cement paste, mortar and concrete on one hand, and two types of terracotta, pink and brown, on the other hand. The results obtained for these two types of construction materials show that the electrical charge distribution within the material during the chloride transfer depends on the volumic cement proportion in the material. This was highlighted by the establishment of a plateau region at low frequencies of the EIS in the Nyquist plot. Moreover, the extension of the plateau region is closely linked to the volumic cement proportion. These electrical charges could reduce the transfer electrical current, which distorts the estimation of the diffusion coefficients obtained with accelerated tests.",

In addition to the strength test proposed by the statistical model, a calorimeter was used for a supplementary measurement to identify interactions among the chemicals. The calorimetric test results revealed that the interaction between triethanolamine and sodium thiocyanate was more pronounced for the amount of heat released before 72 h due to the accelerating effects on both the C 3 S and C 3 A phases. Furthermore, a statistical test showed that even at a higher dose (0·1 wt%), the effect of calcium nitrate was far less efficient than the effect of calcium chloride, which did not significantly improve the overall early strength of cement.",

The dispersion of cement paste mixed with copolymer was studied by means of the zeta potential, adsorption behaviour, cement paste fluidity, setting time and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the copolymer with a higher carboxylate content exhibited lower adsorption on the surface of cement particles and more negative zeta potential, and resulted in longer retention dispersion and setting time at the same dosage; however, excessive carboxylate content decreased the dispersing force of cement particles.

However, the slags that complied with this specification have become unavailable. The material now used to meet the requirements of the specification is a blend of standard construction industry ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), which has high fineness, with Calumite which is a coarser slag powder. Both materials have very similar chemical compositions, and the main reason for blending is to control the particle size distribution (PSD) to replicate the performance of the previous supply. The effect of changing the PSD on the performance properties of the cement paste was investigated. Isothermal conduction calorimetry at elevated temperatures was carried out to monitor the heat of hydration; it was found that the peak heat and total heat evolution increased with an increase in GGBS content. It was also found that Calumite contributes very little to the hydration reaction and thus behaves similarly to an inert filler. As the GGBS content was decreased, the fluidity of the pastes increased up to a certain point, but decreased again for systems dominated by very coarse particles, indicating that there is an optimum balance between the finer and coarser slag particles within this cementing system.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) together with their high aspect ratios have drawn intense interest in their potential for use in composite materials. As common cement slurries are not capable of playing a major role in either preventing the degradation of a cement sheath or improving cement stability in cement-to-formation contacts, the idea of designing CNT-reinforced cements with a high Poisson's ratio, shorter thickening time and less free water and fluid loss came to mind. In this research, the properties of CNT–cement composites, which were synthesised by applying multi-wall CNT–water nanofluids in cement slurry, were thoroughly investigated. The results indicated that the Poisson's ratio of CNT–cement composite with 3 wt% multi-wall CNTs is four times greater than that of the unreinforced cement. Moreover, the free water and fluid loss of the former are 97·5% and 85·0% less than that of the latter.",

    "abstract": "Belite-barium calcium sulfoaluminate cement is a new type of cement characterised by low energy consumption and low carbon dioxde emissions, but the slow hydration of the belite phase leads to a slow mechanical property gain at early ages compared with ordinary Portland cement. A doping technique has been proposed as one option to promote its reactivity. Strontium slag, a kind of chemical industrial waste produced from the manufacture of strontium salt, has a high level of emissions in China. In this study, the influence of strontium oxide on the formation mechanism of dicalcium silicate with barium oxide and sulfur trioxide, which are both in excess in belite-barium calcium sulfoaluminate cement clinker, is investigated. Results show that strontium oxide accelerates the decomposition process of calcium carbonate, and its final decomposition temperature can be lowered by 67°C. Strontium oxide decreases the formation rate of dicalcium silciate at the same temperature, but the amount of total dicalcium silicate formed can still be as high as 94·5 wt% at 1350°C. Moreover, it is revealed that strontium oxide plays a significant role in stabilising β-dicalcium silicate, and reduces γ-dicalcium silicate by about 40%. This study could lead to environmental benefits and cement performance improvement.",

Aqueous sulfate solution from cement paste and prepared calcium-silicate-hydrate samples are used to take other ions and cement hydration into account. The effects of gypsum content, temperature and alkalinity on dissolution and adsorption behaviours of sulfate in cement paste are studied. The results show that higher gypsum content leads to more sulfate ions adsorbed on samples. Sulfate adsorption on calcium-silicate-hydrate samples increases with temperature elevation, which is in agreement with both Divet's and Škapa's results, which used relatively simple calcium-silicate-hydrate–sulfates systems. Higher alkalinity is unfavourable for sulfate ions adsorbed on calcium-silicate-hydrate samples. An alternative opinion was given by Divet and Randriambololona whose result is complex and not representative owing to the adsorption behaviour of sodium ions being neglected.",

Sludge or Portland cement was substituted with 5 wt%, 10 wt% or 15 wt% of anhydrite gypsum. These systems lead to the preparation of supersulfated cement. These blends were shown to possess both the advantages of gypsum (early hardening, high early strength and enhanced workability) and Portland cement (improved durability in moist conditions). The initial and final setting time, bulk density and compressive strength of cement pastes were measured. Differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques were used to investigate the hydration products. Substitution of DWTS with 15% anhydrite accelerates the final setting time and increases the bulk density as well as the compressive strength. Substitution of OPC with 5% anhydrite gives the same results but extends the final setting time. It can be concluded that supersulfated cement can be prepared from samples with 10–15 wt% anhydrite substituted DWTS or from the sample with 5 wt% anhydrite substituted OPC.",

Recent advances in cement hydration and nano-characterisation techniques for Portland cement have started to unravel the basic cement hydration phases (calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel in particular) at the nano scale. It is likely that Portland cement and several others can be classified as ‘inorganic cements', since they share many common characteristics at the nano-scale structure level; still, each system possesses its own unique reaction mechanisms attributable to specific reaction environments. In this paper, such similarities are discussed and highlighted, when possible, in terms of inorganic polymerisation and sol–gel processes. The ability to tailor chemical structures of Portland cements at the nano-scale level can not only render improved mechanical properties but also possibly create unique microstructures.",

The main results showed that the effect of STPP on the early-age cement paste properties strongly depends on its concentration. Rheological tests showed an increase of viscosity for the higher STPP dosage. Microcalorimetric measurements revealed an increasing delay in early-age cement hydration as the STPP concentration increased. This delay was also recorded on setting times for the lower STPP dosages. The effect was inverted in the case of the higher STPP concentrations, for which a false set phenomenon was observed. In spite of the delay on hydration rate, the differences recorded between the compressive strength values of the different mixtures remained low.",

In the present study the superplasticising effect induced by third-generation polycarboxylates was benchmarked against conventional melamine-based superplasticisers on oil well cement. Two commercial superplasticisers were studied at five different concentrations. The hydration progress over time was analysed by way of monitoring the crystal growth using a scanning electron microscope. Infrared and 29 Si solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were measured. Rheological and surface tension studies were conducted at the early stages of hydration. The results show clearly that the third-generation polycarboxylate under investigation was superior in terms of better cement workability. This superiority was attributed to the multi-branched nature of this compound which induced sterical repulsion on the cement grain surface. Moreover, the superplasticiser–cement complexed phases were found to be thermodynamically unstable as evidenced by infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Recommendations are made concerning the application of superplasticisers in the oil industry in order to enhance the performance of the drilling process.",

Based on studies concerning the thermal properties of porous media and experimental research on the relationship between porosity and the addition of aqueous foam, an equation describing the change in thermal conductivity with aqueous foam volume is deduced and then amended. Microscopic analysis of the process of setting is conducted by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the coagulation of a single bubble wall and bubbles connecting with each other lead the ISF to lose fluidity gradually. A loss of fluidity time (LFT) index is then proposed on the basis of field process requirements and the aforementioned microscopic analysis, and a home-made instrument to test LFT is developed. Effects of aqueous foam volume and accelerator type, along with its addition quantity, on the LFT of ISF are investigated. The relationship equation provides a theoretical foundation for steerable adjustment of the LFT. Furthermore, under the restriction of cost, thermal conductivity threshold and LFT, the parameters of the feasible construction state areas of four different accelerators were compared; in this study AC3 was found to be the most appropriate accelerator.",

Based on the ultrasonic wave technique, the hydration reaction processes of Portland cement pastes with various water-to-cement ratios (w/c = 0·28, 0·40 and 0·50) were monitored by using the ultrasonic transducers. Performance analysis of the transducers showed that the shielded transducer has characteristics of a high signal-to-noise ratio, large head wave amplitude and a clear waveform. The head wave amplitude of the shielded transducer was 73% greater than that of the unshielded transducer, and the amplitude ratio of the head wave to the second wave of the shielded transducer was also increased (by 46%). The relationship between waveform and the wave parameters of the received ultrasonic wave and cement hydration reaction time was analysed. It was found that the cement hydration reaction process can be divided into different periods. The wave velocity in the cement paste is sensitive to w/c ratio, and increases with the progress of cement hydration reaction as well as the compressive strength. This was confirmed by the micro-morphology of the cement paste at various periods.",

The preparation of clinkers is essential in cement production, in which all raw materials react with each other to generate key phases in cement under some specified conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the sintering characteristics of BCSAF cement clinkers. Four BCSAF clinkers with different compositions were examined. High-temperature microscopy, quantitative x-ray powder diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyse sintering features and phase composition. The results show that the use of wastes from the production of manganese and magnesium metals, which were added to the raw materials to make clinker pellets, can significantly reduce the firing temperature of BCSAF clinker. The firing temperatures of clinkers with added wastes were below 1300°C, much lower than the temperature used for conventional Portland cement (1450°C). The ferrite phase was always found to inter-grow with the phase or C2AS phase, just like the interstitial phase. The ferrite phase acted as a solid solution during cement sintering. A small quantity of iron oxide can make the clinker more porous, leading to energy savings in subsequent grinding processes.",

This study investigated the erosion of ordinary aerial lime and sticky-rice mortars under the cyclic actions of wetting–drying (WD) and dilute sulfate acid (DSA). Comprehensive experimental tests were conducted to study the mechanical properties, quality, microstructure and pore structure of the mortars according to cyclic WD and DSA actions. Results showed that both the WD and DSA actions can significantly degrade the compressive and shear strengths of the mortars. The DSA softens the mortar matrices more severely than the WD by a leaching mechanism. Apparently, sticky rice does not change the micro morphology, pore structure and packing pattern of the mortar matrices, but it inhibits the carbonation of the lime. Both the WD and DSA actions can erode the ordinary aerial lime and sticky-rice mortars, causing more porous matrices and coarser particles. The results of this study make it possible to clarify how the WD and DSA actions affect the durability of partially matured aerial lime mortars with or without sticky rice, with potential uses in the restoration of ancient buildings.",

In addition, hardened and durability-related properties using migration resistance and thermal conductivity tests were evaluated. It was observed that the workability and the setting time decreased largely according to the increase in the percentage of nano-silica as compared to the reference mortar. This finding is confirmed by micro calorimetry results, which indicate a significant increase for the heat evaluation in the presence of nano additives. The thermo-gravimetric analysis indicated the acceleration of the hydration reaction and continuation of the prolonged pozzolanic reaction, which results in the densification of the microstructure confirmed by the increase of compressive strength by 21% at 112 days for 10% addition of nano-silica as compared to the reference mortar. Moreover, the incorporation of nano-silica had also improved the durability of the mortars by reducing the effective diffusion coefficient and thermal conductivity by 46% and 40%, respectively, especially for mortar containing 10% nano-silica.",

It was found that the addition of CAC dramatically improved the acid resistance of the MKG due to the reduced volume of permeable voids and enhanced neutralisation capacity. The mixture with 10% CAC showed the lowest deterioration.",

    "abstract": "For refractory application inert alumina fillers frequently are mixed with calcium aluminate cements to improve particle packaging and to reduce the demand of water for low-cement castables. This finally results in decreased porosity and higher strength. Investigations by isothermal heat flow calorimetry show that the presence of alumina filler material with high specific surface area leads to a shortening of the induction period of calcium aluminate cement hydration. The study also demonstrates that the specific surface area of the chosen alumina filler changes the starting point of the main hydration reaction and in consequence the setting time of the calcium aluminate cement mixture is strongly influenced. During the dormant period the heat flow of calcium aluminate cement hydration with coarse alumina filler material of lower specific surface area is characterised by negative values. By addition of filler with higher specific surface area, the surface available for heterogeneous nucleation can be increased. Owing to more available surfaces the critical energy barrier for stable nuclei formation can be reduced. This results in a positive heat flow during the dormant period and a shift of the main reaction to earlier points in time.",

Two temperature profiles, one aggressive and another at moderate temperatures, are used. It is found that Terra Alba gypsum dehydrates to form hemihydrate (CaSO 4 ·0·5H 2 O) and an interstitial gypsum phase at 128°C. The interstitial phase formed contains less water than hemihydrate. Anhydrite (CaSO 4 ) is produced at a temperature of 140°C or higher. The commercial rock gypsum studied generates both hemihydrate and anhydrite at 128°C, and its impurities do not dehydrate until the temperature is increased to 500°C. The dehydration process of a synthetic gypsum indicates that it has an interstitial gypsum phase dehydrating in a similar way to the interstitial phase found in the Terra Alba gypsum. For all these gypsums, anhydrite is the only dehydration product at 500°C. These findings are further confirmed by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses.",

A method of increasing the fracture toughness of the HSLC by using a modifier as a coupling agent on the surface of the microparticles of aggregate is proposed. Use of the hollow microspheres is proposed to produce lightweight concrete with high performance characteristics: increasing the content of spherical microparticles in the concrete composition promotes the formation of a close-packed structure with low deformation. The coefficient of fracture toughness of the HSLC was found to be comparable to that of fine-grained high-strength normal concrete and is limited by the strength characteristics of the micrometric aggregate particles. The aim was to create an active iron–silica shell on the surface of the hollow spheres, which interacts with the major components and products of cement hydration and reinforces the phase boundary. The proposed method reduced longitudinal and transverse deformations of the HSLC by 1·20–1·60 and 1·37–2·21 times respectively. The elastic modulus of the HSLC was determined to be 6·0–8·5 GPa, with a Poisson's ratio of 0·08–0·14. The nanomodifier reduced the intensity of cracking under the influence of shrinkage stresses of HSLC by 56·9%.",

A thermodynamic description of this equilibrium is proposed and some new relationships are derived involving the saturation indexes of dissolved pure substances and the calcium/silicon ratio of the calcium silicate hydrate.

The aim is to find new resources that can be used in any step of cement and concrete production and to find solutions to many problems related to the disposal of wastes. This article discusses the use of wastes generated from cement-bonded wood particle board (CB) manufacturing in cement production. CB waste, which basically contains wood chips and hydrated cement, cannot be recycled within the CB process itself; it thus has to be disposed of and does not have any economic value. However, CB waste can be burned in cement rotary kilns, which may result in certain energy savings due to the presence of wood particles as a secondary fuel. Furthermore, the hydrated cement may decompose and clinker compounds may reform during a calcination process. This work investigated the possibility of using CB waste in cement manufacturing and its effects on energy consumption and cement characteristics. The results indicate that CB waste can be successfully used to partially replace the raw mix in cement plants.",

The influence of molecular weight on the performance in cement paste was systematically investigated by measuring the flowability of fresh cement paste, rheology properties, conformation in solution and adsorption characteristics. The results illustrate that when the molecular weight is relatively small, the number of carboxylic groups from the backbone accessible for the cement particle surfaces is too small to have good dispersion. However, PCE with a relatively large molecular weight may be co-precipitated with early cement hydration products owing to rapid adsorption kinetics. Moreover, PCE of much larger molecular weight leads to larger adsorption amounts from the view of both kinetics and thermodynamics. In addition, the flowability and the yield stress are closely related to adsorption amount. An important finding is that the dispersion ability of PCE can be improved with an increase in molecular weight within a certain interval.",

Incompatibility between PCP and sulfate ion is well known and the dispersion ability of PCP has been known to degrade by sulfate ion in a solution of fresh cement paste. Flowability and rheology studies have revealed that block PCP or gradient PCP is less sensitive to sulfate ion than random PCP when the density of side chains is 1:1. Total organic carbon and dynamic light scattering are used to reveal this difference. Results for total organic carbon illustrate that the adsorption amount of block PCP and gradient PCP is much larger than for random PCP at the same PCP concentration, because the density of exposed carboxylic groups with block distribution is higher than in random PCP, therefore there is a larger adsorption amount. Results of dynamic light scattering show the conformation of random PCP in synthetic solution is unchanged with the concentration of sulfate ion, whereas that of block PCP or gradient PCP shows shrinkage in a high sulfate ion concentration. These findings offer guidance for research and development of PCP to improve its sensitivity to sulfate competitive adsorption and subsequently its compatibility with cement.",

The hydration of magnesium oxide in paste and the microstructure of the paste were determined by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis, mercury intrusion porosimetry, FESEM and backscattered SEM. The results show that the hydration activity of LCM can be easily designed by regulating the calcining temperature. Both early age (7 d) and later age (90 d) autogenous shrinkage of steam-cured cement paste could be partially compensated when adding 4 wt% LCM prepared at 850°C (M85), probably due to the locally restrained continued slow hydration of magnesium oxide in M85.",

The primary SCPs in the MMOS mixes were iron oxyhydroxides (FeOOH) and ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ), while ferrous oxide (FeO) was only observed at low w/c ratios, indicating a lower degree of oxidation. The presence of di-iron nonacarbonyl (Fe 2 (CO) 9 ) at high w/c ratios suggested a higher degree of oxidation. At lower w/c ratios, rust products readily diffused.

The composite was made with mortar reinforced with natural fibres extracted from the petiole of the Washington robusta (WR) palm tree. The fibres used were first chemically characterised by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray and infrared diffractometry spectroscopies alongside tensile testing to discover their morphological structure. Afterwards, the fibres were incorporated into mortar with mass percentages varying from 0 to 4% to determine experimentally the thermomechanical properties of the manufactured samples. The chemical findings indicated that WR fibres are rich in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and possess a high crystallinity index, which enhances the mechanical properties and durability of the composite. The density obtained for the composite W2RC4% is 1305 kg/m 3 and less than 2000 kg/m 3 ; this composite can thus be classified as a lightweight concrete according to the standard NF EN 206 + A2/CN (2022). The thermal conductivity and thermal effusivity dropped by about 60% and 42%, respectively. Moreover, the WR reduces the compressive strength (76%) and the flexural strength (36%) to minimum values, respectively, of 5.9 MPa and 3.8 MPa.

    "abstract": "Recent dental material advancements have sparked increased interest in dental cements due to their natural tooth-like appearance, biocompatibility and stability. These cements hold potential for dental fillings, enamel and root protection, and connecting dental implants. However, no single cement fulfils all application needs, necessitating multiple types. Ideal dental cements require resistance to degradation, strong bonding, high strength, fracture toughness and optical transparency for imaging. The solid-state method reaction was used for the synthesis of calcium aluminate (C 3 A) cement powder and the effects of the addition of 10 wt% and 20 wt% zirconia (ZrO 2 ), bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3 ) and zinc oxide (ZnO) were examined. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, radiopacity evaluation and tests for setting time and compressive strength, were performed for characterisation and property evaluations. With the formation of a new phase (C 3 ZA 2 ), the compressive strength was increased by up to 275% by reducing the porosity and stabilising phase transitions during hydration. The results showed that bismuth oxide and zirconia additives led to high radiopacity (7 and 3.5 millimetres of equivalent aluminium, respectively), good biological properties and a significant impact on strength in dental applications.",

    "abstract": "Belite-ye’elimite-ferrite (BYF) cement has garnered significant interest as an alternative to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) due to its lower limestone content, early-age strength development, and improved durability. However, the main challenge to the commercial production of BYF cement is the requirement for large quantities of costly aluminous raw materials. The introduction of alpha prime belite (α'C 2 S) to BYF clinker would minimize production costs while maintaining mechanical properties. Herein, α'C 2 S containing BYF clinkers were synthesised and analysed to determine their properties and hydration characteristics. The clinker samples were synthesised using a previously reported clinkering technique wherein a sulfur-containing atmosphere was used, with a raw mix design including additions of a combination of boron, potassium, and sodium-containing doping agents. Preliminary data showed adequate amounts of α'C2S were preserved reaching more than 40 wt.% of total clinker composition. Moreover, the heat release curves revealed enhanced hydration kinetics for the modified clinkers compared to the unmodified ones. While there was a noticeable improvement in ettringite precipitation upon hydration, the precipitation of strätlingite remained the same after doping. The experimental findings showed high potential for the existence of low ye’elimite BYF clinker formulations as part of the wider portfolio of OPC clinker alternatives.",

The present study aimed to compare the volatilization of minor and trace elements in cement clinker formation in a high carbon dioxide atmosphere and a conventional combustion atmosphere. Raw meal samples were exposed at high temperature to the two different atmospheres, with elemental analysis performed before and after. For both atmospheres, the minor elements potassium and sulphur, and the trace elements rubidium, lead, thallium, caesium, cadmium and mercury were highly volatile. For most of the analysed elements, no difference was observed between the two atmospheres. However, volatilization of potassium, sodium and sulphur was lower in the high carbon dioxide atmosphere.

    "abstract": "There are divergent views in the literature regarding the use of additional water in cementitious materials containing superabsorbent polymers (SAP). The polymer is mainly used to mitigate autogenous shrinkage. Some studies report a decrease in compressive strength and attribute it to the addition of SAP, while others argue that the real issue is the use additional water. The aim of this study is to analyze the state of art regarding the influence of additional water in cementitious mixtures containing SAP and its influence on compressive strength and autogenous shrinkage. Microconcretes and pastes are categorized based on SAP dosages and systematically reviews relevant literature. The methodology employs a parameterization approach for standardized comparisons, considering water-to-cement ratios (w/c) and total water content. Autogenous shrinkage and compressive strength are analysed for each mixture, with and without extra water. Results reveal distinct behaviors, indicating optimal SAP dosages of 0.20% by weight of binder for balancing autogenous shrinkage mitigation and minimal harm to compressive strength. In conclusion, this research contributes valuable insights into SAP's effectiveness in mitigating autogenous shrinkage and provides a foundation for optimizing SAP dosages in different cementitious materials. The findings facilitate informed decisions for durable concrete construction practices.",

Impedance data for PRC cured in three different humidity environments at room temperature are reported as a function of hydration time. Z* plots show the presence of two semicircular arcs. With time, a decrease in cell conductance is observed, and this is consistent with results of others. However, comparison of data from ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ cured samples show important diflerences in the characteristics of both the low- (LF) and high-frequency (HF) arcs. These differences, and their implications for ACIS measurements on cement systems, are discussed by the use of other immitance formalisms for analysing ACIS data.",

The restrained autogenous stress developed was smaller than that expected on the basis of consideration of the autogenous shrinkage strain only. This was accounted for by relaxation due to early age creep. Reduction of w/b and the addition of silica fume led to stresses that could approach 50% of the strength. At such high stresses, the risk of cracking was significant. Development of the stress in high-strength concrete could not be directly related to the properties of its cement paste matrix. The presence of aggregates reduced proportionally the autogenous shrinkage. However, this was not accompanied by a similar proportional reduction in the induced stress, since the aggregate also caused a reduction in the creep relaxation effect. The reduced creep in the concrete, compared with the paste, was not always proportional to the aggregate content.",

    "abstract": "As part of a detailed study to investigate the processes and mechanism of alkali—silica reaction (ASR), OPC mortars with 50% of the aggregate replaced by highly reactive fused silica (FS) were immersed in 1M KOH and saturated NaCl solutions at 38°C for 150 days. The expansion of the mortars was measured every 5 days for the first 30 days and every 15 days thereafter, and compared with the expansion of a series of OPC control mortars without FS. Maximum expansions (up to 2·2%) were observed in the FS mortars immersed in NaCl. Polished mortar specimens were studied using back-scattered electron imaging techniques and electron microprobe analysis to determine the extent of reaction of the FS and to obtain quantitative chemical analyses of the ASR gels. ASRfrequently appeared to initiate inside the reactive silica grains rather than at their peripheries, possibly reflecting the higher surface energies of microcracks and other internal discontinuities. The amount of visible reaction of the FS appeared greater in the KOH mortars, although they expanded less than the NaCl mortars. Element mapping of partially reacted FS grains demonstrated that alkali cations (Na + , K + ) are clearly capable of diffusing into the silica structure, whereas the larger hydrated Ca 2+ ions are not. The ASR gels generated in the NaCl mortars had low CaO contents &lt; 1 wt%) compared with those produced in the KOH solution (∼14·5 wt%). This appears to provide conclusive evidence that high calcium contents inhibit the expansion of ASR gels. The implications of these experimental results for elucidation of the mechanism of ASR are discussed. The importance of absorption of alkali cations (Na + , K + ) onto the surface of the reactive aggregate during the early stages of reaction and the availability of Ca 2+ ions in the cement pore fluids in controlling the expansion behaviour of the resultant ASR gels are stressed.",

SAXS measurements have shown that the microstructure of PC samples cannot be described in terms of a classical porous medium with a well-defined specific inner surface, but rather obeys the formalism of fractal geometry. The application and potential of the SAXS technique for randomly disordered and fractal structures are outlined. Measurements have been taken on powdered and size-fractionated cement samples with different water—cement ratios (w/c) and different amounts of added chloride salts, and on different types of cements. The analysis of the data obtained by SAXS showed that inner surface and volume structure are fractal; however, only the mass fractal dimension D m (2·3-3·0) could be evaluated with sufficient precision and reproducibility. By comparing these D m values and the specific surface areas obtained by BET (40-70 m 2 /g), a correlation between D m and BET surface was found when only one parameter (w/c) was varied. The SAXS measurements showed that drying procedures (which are necessary for BET measurements) give rise to a different microstructure of the cement samples, as revealed by different D m values for these samples.",

The simultaneous addition of CaSO 4 and CaF 2 to compositions in the system CaO—Al 2 O 3 —Fe 2 O 2 -SiO 2 results in formation of phases not found in ordinary Portland cement: for example, C 11 A 7 ·CaF 2 , C 4 A 3 S, and 3C 2 S·3CaSO 4 ·CaF 2 , etc. These modify the compatible equilibrium phases as well as the stable primary fields of C 3 A and C 3 S. Finally, CaSO 4 and CaF 2 are responsible for changing the melt composition together with its rheological characteristics. Clinkerization of raw meals with silica moduli greater than 10 and lime saturation factor greater than 0·95 is possible when CaF 2 and gypsum partially replace traditional fluxes. Finally, the results of an industrial test in which a mineralized white cement (AS-SR type) was produced are presented. The clinker has about 80% silicates plus aluminates; fluorellestadite is a characteristic phase of this process. The thermal and economic balances are positive compared to traditional fabrication. The durability properties of the new cement, when subject to attack by sulfates and sea water, are much better than a normal white cement.",

However kaolin from natural sources may be notably impure, even after beneficiation. During heating, essential to convert unreactive kaolin to reactive metakaolin, impurities present in the precursor kaolin may become activated with respect to dissolution in alkaline cement pore fluid. The most important impurities in this context are muscovite and potassium-rich felspar. Potassium felspar and muscovite, heated and unheated, were slurried with Ca(OH) 2 and water at ∼22°C for up to 28 days. Significant alkali releases were obtained even from unheated minerals. However, the extent of release increased with increasing calcination temperatures in the range 500–700°C. The results indicate that supposedly ‘inert’ aggregate minerals may become reactive towards cement. In cement–metakaolin mixes, much of the alkali liberated from mineral impurities is probably incorporated into cement solids but the overall effectiveness of metakaolin in decreasing the alkali contents of cement pore fluid is reduced. However, alkali release may also be beneficial: metakaolin may release sufficient alkali to enhance slag hydration in slag–Ca(OH) 2 –metakaolin blends.",

It was observed that the presence of PC admixture retards the initial cement hydration reactions, although this effect may be offset by possible increased diffusion in later stages. Additionally, the PC admixtures produce a few alterations in the structure and composition of the formed C—S—H gel. The addition of 1% PC admixture in the pastes generates a higher percentage of silicate bridge (Si Q2 units) mainly at 2 days. The admixture used in this study induced microstructural modifications in the pastes which slightly reduced the porosity; however the admixture did not affect the mechanical strength of the pastes at either 2 or 28 days of hydration. Finally, from the results of the rheological studies it was concluded that a low dosage of PC led to a substantial reduction (over 70%) in the yield stress.",

    "abstract": "In this study, an artificial intelligence model has been developed to predict the rheological properties of oil well cement (OWC) slurries incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) such as metakaolin (MK), silica fume (SF), rice husk ash (RHA) or fly ash (FA). An experimental study has been carried out to create the database used for training the model. OWC slurries having a water-to-binder ratio of 0·44 along with a new-generation, polycarboxylate-based, high-range water-reducing admixture (PCH) were prepared. They had 5 to 15% partial replacement of API class-G OWC by MK, SF, RHA or FA. The rheological properties of the slurries were investigated at different temperatures in the range 23 to 60°C using an advanced shear-stress/shear-strain controlled rheometer. Experimental data thus obtained were used to develop a predictive model based on feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural networks. The developed model could effectively predict the effect of key variables such as temperature, dosage of SCM and dosage of PCH on the rheological properties of OWC slurries with an absolute error of less than 7%. The developed model could also effectively predict the rheological properties of new slurries designed within the range of input parameters of the experimental database used in the training process.",

The mineral composition and the microstructure of the clinker were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM–EDS) and lithofacies. The results show that strontium calcium sulfoaluminate and the minerals of Portland cement clinker can coexist in one clinker system. The optimal composition of alite-strontium calcium sulfoaluminate clinker is as follows: strontium calcium sulfoaluminate 9% (mass %), C 3 S 59·35%, C 2 S 14·14%, C 3 A 7·50%, C 4 AF 10·00%. The content of strontium calcium sulfoaluminate produced during the sintering process at 1380°C is high. The compressive strength of the cement prepared under the testing conditions reaches 30·5 MPa, 58·4 MPa and 122·2 MPa at 1 day, 3 days and 28 days curing ages, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Sodium gluconate (SG), a commonly used retarder, is usually employed to improve the dispersion and dispersion retention of polycarboxylate superplasticiser (PCE) in real concrete. However, whether SG can improve the rapid loss of fluidity resulting from montmorillonite (Mt) in poor aggregates has not been confirmed until now. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of SG on clay tolerance of PCE. Fluidity loss of cement–Mt paste was tested to assess the clay tolerance. The adsorption behaviour of additives and the reaction between additives and Mt were studied to propose a dispersion model. The results show that SG cannot be intercalated into Mt, and it can alter the dosage of PCE added to reach the same initial fluidity level, thereby altering the amount of PCE in solution, which can affect the intercalation of S-PCE (PCE adsorbed on the surface of cement particles) rather than directly hinder the intercalation. This effect is decided by the dosage of SG: more than 0·20 wt% of SG can enhance the clay tolerance of PCE, whereas less than 0·20 wt% of SG may weaken it. The result provides good experience for the improvement in clay tolerance of PCE in real engineering practice.",

    "abstract": "It is a common concern that ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) blended CEM I concrete lacks sufficient early-age strength, which may prevent its application in cast-in-place structural concrete. This has been identified in the present study through GGBS activity index tests and compressive strength tests of GGBS blended concrete specimens. Current codes for GGBS used in concrete require a minimum early-age hydraulic activity and a specific surface area. The particle size distribution (PSD) of GGBS can also affect the physical and mechanical properties of concrete, but this cannot be sufficiently addressed by the standard testing methods. This paper proposes a quantitative assessment method which can quickly determine the particle shape and PSD of CEM I cement and GGBS samples based on electron microscope image analysis. This method of assessment offers the potential to work as an important supplementary method to the existing testing methods adopted by the cement industry. In addition to the particle shape analysis, CEM I and GGBS samples were also characterised based on isothermal calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests. These tests were conducted at 20°C and 38°C curing to investigate the effect of curing temperatures.",

Fer decomposed under high-temperature alkaline conditions with the release of hydrolysates that, along with the hydrating clinker, participated in the formation of new phases contributing to strength recoveries. These phases included crystalline magnesium and aluminium-containing silicates, calcium and carbonated calcium silicates and amorphous hydrates.

The effects of nano-silica, nano-magnesia and nano-zirconia on the evolution of the mechanical and thermal properties of calcium aluminate cement (CAC) pastes at three temperatures (105, 350 and 900°C) were investigated. At 105°C, the addition of nano-zirconia resulted in better residual compressive strength than those of the pastes with the other nanoparticles. The improvement in thermal properties of the pastes with added nanoparticles was mainly at temperatures of 350°C and 900°C. The main reason for the difference of properties is that the incorporation of nanoparticles accelerates the forming process of the solid phase according to calorimetric analysis. The microstructure of the pastes was also found to be affected by the nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry analyses were conducted to investigate the phases and the mass changes, respectively. The experimental results show such nanoparticle optimisation would enable the development of novel forms of functional CAC materials for use at high temperature.",

Experiments were on pressed and non-pressed composites, fabricated with and without carbon dioxide curing. Dimensional stability comparisons were made between composites of date palm fibre and cement subjected to different moisture conditions, including air-dried, oven-dried and saturated conditions. Their flexural performances were then evaluated and compared with control specimens. The results revealed that the application of pressing and carbon dioxide curing as accelerating processing techniques have significant influences on the resultant products. The oven-dried composites exhibited poor flexural toughness behaviour compared with the air-dried or saturated specimens. Fibre growth in the transverse direction due to moisture conditions was observed to be efficient in strengthening the transition bonding areas with the matrix. In comparison with board length, the changes in board thickness and mass due to moisture effects were remarkable. This behaviour suggests that the final volume stability response of the composite is dominated by the orthotropic property due to the various constituents. Microstructural observations confirmed that carbon dioxide curing densified the matrix, leading to better dimensional stability of the composites, even after 25 wetting–drying cycles.",

In this work, the influence of cement composition and calcium sulfate source on the content of water bound by hydration was investigated, with the future goal of designing non-expansive materials with a dry internal environment. A thermodynamic approach was used first. Ten cement compositions were prepared by blending a CSA clinker comprising 54·3% ye'elimite and 29·1% belite with anhydrite and calcium oxide, respectively, within the ranges 80–95%, 5–20% and 0–15%. Cement suspensions (water/cement ratio (w/c) = 6) were maintained under stirring at 20°C for 1 month. The cement comprising 80% clinker and 20% anhydrite led to the highest contents of ettringite and bound water, which was simulated well by thermodynamic calculations. A kinetic study was then performed on cement pastes (w/c = 0·5 or 0·6), with the cement comprising 80% clinker and 20% calcium sulfate (introduced as anhydrite or gypsum). The addition of gypsum, which dissolves faster than anhydrite, led to the rapid formation of a dense microstructure, which tended to limit the progress of hydration at later age. With anhydrite, higher hydration degrees were reached and specimens cured in a wet or dry environment exhibited smaller volume changes.",

Various approaches were used to analyse and explain the action mechanisms of the superplasticisers, including zeta potential measurements, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, hydration analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results showed that the addition of superplasticisers decreased the compressive strength and water demand of the MOS cement and also retarded the hydration process, prolonged the setting time, changed the porosity and pore distribution, and decreased the relative content of the main hydration products in the cement. In the magnesium oxide–magnesium sulfate–water system studied, the hydrophobic interaction of the NF superplasticiser in the MOS cement was stronger than that of the PC superplasticiser. NF superplasticiser thus appears to be more suitable for MOS cement, improving its fluidity without significantly reducing its compressive strength.

The compressive strength of the mortars was evaluated at 3, 7, 28 and 90 days.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new model is proposed to describe the coupled transport of ionic species and ionic solution in unsaturated concrete. The main difference between the present model and most existing models is the inclusion of osmotic effect due to small pore sizes and osmosis-flow due to electrochemical reactions taking place at two electrodes. Chemical- and electro-osmosis is a well-known phenomenon in soils and clays. Cement and concrete materials, whose microscopic properties are very similar to clays, are expected to have a similar behaviour. However, despite the large amount of work that has been published on the osmosis of soils and clays, there is very little work on the cement and concrete materials. The aim of this paper is to address this problem. The model proposed in the paper is applied to predict the chloride penetration in unsaturated concrete and the electrochemical chloride removal in chloride-contaminated concrete by applying an external current. Numerical examples are presented and results are validated using published experimental data.",

The purpose of this paper is to develop a three-scale scheme for predicting the intrinsic permeability of heated cement paste. In this scheme, cement paste is modelled as a multi-phase composite material and further represented by three two-phase composite constituents. By analysing the thermal decomposition, the variation of various constituents in cement paste is expressed as a function of the heating history. Based on effective medium theory, the intrinsic permeability of heated cement paste is obtained in terms of the volume fractions and permeabilities of various constituents of the cement paste. Finally, the validity of the three-scale scheme is preliminarily verified with experimental data obtained from the literature.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, liquid nitrogen freezing and vacuum drying are used to sublimate the water in cement slurry, so that the microstructure of cement slurry can be maintained and the hydration process can be stalled. The microstructure changes of cement slurry containing potassium polyacrylamide (K-PAM) are then observed. The conclusion of the incompatibility mechanism is drawn by comprehensive analysis of the results of the molecular structure of K-PAM, aggregation stability and microstructure of cement slurry. Experimental research shows that a K-PAM molecular chain can adsorb a plurality of cement particles, resulting in an adsorption bridging effect. After reacting with Ca 2+ in cement slurry, K-PAM turns into polypropylene calcium, which forms a needle-like structure in the cement slurry. Such a needle-like structure is aggregation and staggers to form a net-like structure, causing cement slurry flocculation. Hydrophilic groups of K-PAM and water interact with each other through hydrogen bonding, which forms a layer of solvent membrane on the surface of the cement particles, hindering the contact between water and cement particles. This can reduce the hydration reaction rate, and finally decrease the compressive strength of cement stone.",

Compressive and bending strength were also measured. The following conclusions were obtained: in the case of existing calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ), hydration products were calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) and aluminium-rich (Al, Si, Ca)OH gel. C–S–H had a calcium/silicate ratio of 1·4 and the aluminium-rich (Al, Si, Ca)OH gel was located on the surface of unreacted slag particles to hinder the hydration of slag. A mixture of slag and anhydrite (without lime) reacted to produce C–S–H and ettringite, but the initiation time of reaction was very long – as much as 400 h. In this case, the calcium oxide/silica (CaO/SiO 2 ) ratio of the calcium-silicate-hydrate was considered as low as 0·6 to 0·8. Monosulfate (AFm(SO 4 )) was not produced from slag hydration, as the solubility of slag is lower than that of monosulfate. The compressive strength of mortar without gypsum was 25 N/mm 2 at 91 d, whereas that containing gypsum of 15% by mass was 70–80 N/mm 2 at 91 d. In the case of 2% calcium hydroxide, the compressive strengths with gypsum were all less than 15 N/mm 2 at 91 d and they were lower than that without gypsum of 25 N/mm 2 at 91 d. Reducing the addition of calcium hydroxide was very effective for mortar strength with gypsum but addition in excess of 2% retarded the hydration. The strength of mortar without formation of ettringite (slag–lime system) had lower bending/compressive strength ratio.",

Enhancing the mechanical properties of Portland cement composites using nano-particles without workability reduction and dispersion difficulties is one of the challenges in the cement field of research. In order to overcome disadvantages of nano-particles in cement, a new method was investigated in this study. Magnetite-silica core-shell nano-composites (MS), which have been widely used in biological fields, were employed here as fillers and reinforcements in cement pastes. These nano-composite particles consist of nano-magnetite (NM) cluster and nano-amorphous silica shell. Different types of analysis such as X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer were conducted on these particles to investigate their properties. MS particles were synthesised by coating nano-magnetite particles with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a source of silica. MS particles were used as an additive material in cement paste mixes with cement replacement ratios of 0·05, 0·1 and 0·2%. Additional samples were also made with the same cement replacement ratio of NM and nano-silica (NS). Experimental results indicated that the compressive strength of cement paste can be increased up to 14%. This is mainly attributable to the pozzolanic effect of silica shell in combination with the filler and nuclei effect of these particles. It was also found that the MS does not change the workability of mixes considerably. Additionally, the microstructure of cement pastes was characterised using scanning electron microscopy to evaluate the effect of NM, NS and MS particles on the microstructure of cement pastes.",

The effect of three moisture states (fully saturated, semi-saturated and fully dry) on the bonding properties between the PVA fibre and ECC matrix at three target temperatures (25°C, 0°C and −20°C) was investigated. It was found that, at 25°C, the bonding properties decreased with an increase in moisture content. At 0°C and −20°C, the bonding properties increased with an increase in moisture content. At −20°C in the fully saturated state, the bonding load was too large to cause fibre rupture. The bonding properties were found to increase with decreasing temperature in the fully saturated and semi-saturated states and decrease with decreasing temperature in the fully dry state. This study of the effect of low temperature and moisture state on the bonding properties between PVA fibres and ECCs provides theoretical support for how to ensure good ductility when ECCs are in service at low temperature.",

The temperature sensitivity of the CCBs significantly increased when clinker was replaced with calcined clay, even at a 30% replacement level. The compressive strength development of the CCBs was higher than that of ordinary Portland cement at a lower temperature, perhaps due to the formation of low-density products such as stratlingite rather than enhanced clinker hydration. The reduced compressive strength development of the CCBs cured at 50°C could be due to multiple reasons (e.g. lower clinker hydration, reduced pozzolanic reaction, reduced stability of carboaluminates and ettringite). However, merely a 24-h lag in temperature exposure reversed this temperature effect, mainly due to the enhanced stability of carboaluminate and ettringite phases. The reduction in hydration was mainly in the belite phase and could be due to large changes in calcium alumina silicate hydrate having a high alumina substitution. It is hypothesised that the adverse effect of high-temperature exposure on CCBs is due to the formation of a physical barrier of highly polymerised calcium silicate hydrate on the surface of unhydrated clinker. The improved performance due to the delay in high-temperature exposure could be due to the enhanced stability of ettringite and carboaluminate phases.",

Two size fractions of CBP considered for cement replacement are CBP1 (passes through 150 μm but is retained on 75 μm) and CBP2 (passes through 75 μm). Compressive strength tests on mortar with CBP reveal that strength does not exceed that of the control; however, 10–15% cement replacement by CBP is the optimum. The presence of hydrate phases by X-ray diffraction and quantification of portlandite in the paste samples as studied by thermogravimetric analysis up to 90 days confirms the action of pozzolanicity. Furthermore, to determine the feasibility of CBP1 and CBP2 fractions in concrete, the strength and carbonation of M25 grade concrete were studied by replacing 45% cement with a combined proportion of CBP1 (20%) and CBP2 (25%). This reduced the concrete grade from M25 to M20 and increased the accelerated carbonation depth. Nevertheless, the projected natural carbonation coefficient with accelerated carbonation data is determined as low. The CBP used is cost-effective, requiring little mechanical processing and no chemical activation; thus it can satisfactorily be used for low-cost housing construction and lower-grade structural and non-structural uses.",

In this work, the adsorption of radioactive caesium and strontium ions by sodium aluminosilicate hydrate (NASH) gel, the main component of geopolymers, was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations to obtain nanoscale insights into the ions’ interactions with the gel. The formation of strong ion–oxygen bonds allowed both ions to be effectively adsorbed on the NASH surface, but the adsorption ratio of strontium ions (17.2%) was slightly lower than that of caesium ions (21.0%). Because strontium ions are divalent, they can form stronger electrostatic interactions with water molecules and chloride ions, which hinders their approach to the interface. For the same reason, the diffusion coefficient of strontium ions in solution is lower than that of caesium ions. These results provide new insights into the nuclear waste fixation capacity of NASH gel and guidance for the design of new CBMs for radioactive waste disposal.",

Magnesium oxide from salt-lake brine can be used to produce magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC), but the calcium impurities present in salt lakes affect the properties of MOC. To investigate the effects of these impurities, magnesium oxide was produced by calcining a magnesium hydroxide precursor. By adding calcium hydroxide or calcium chloride, the incorporated calcium impurities were 0, 5 and 10% by mass of magnesium oxide. The compressive strength, heat of hydration, composition of the hydration product phases and the pore structure development of MOC samples were evaluated. It was found that Ca 2+ ions increased the early strength and the rates of setting and hardening of the MOC. However, the presence of calcium impurities did not change the hydration phase composition. This is primarily because the Ca 2+ ions promoted the participation of magnesium oxide in the hydration reaction and enhanced the early strength of the MOC. The findings of this study demonstrate the technical feasibility of utilising magnesium resources from salt lakes to prepare magnesium oxide and apply it in the production of MOC.",

This method is satisfactory for solutions of near-neutral pH, but for sulphonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) materials it is unsatisfactory at higher pH values. In particular, the alkaline nature of cement gives rise to a high concentration of hydroxyl ions and this results in interference. The sample may be neutralized with acid, but this also results in ion interference. Spectrofluorimetry is shown to be a more satisfactory method: it can be used for SMF in solution in either fresh or set cement mixes with only minor pH adjustment.

It was found that such ashes, unlike most conventional fly ashes, exhibit distinct hydraulic properties and – if mixed with appropriate amounts of water – set and harden spontaneously at ambient temperature, yielding a C—S—H phase and ettringite as main products of hydration. Under hydrothermal conditions the hydrogarnet phase is formed as the main reaction product, together with tobermorite and anhydrite. Depending on the composition of the ashes, the strength of the hardened material can be enhanced by the addition of some other cementitious constituents, particularly blast furnace slag. Due to the favourable strength-to-bulk density ratio, the hardened material may be considered a lightweight cementitious product.",

The montmorillonitic fraction started to gain pozzolanic activity above a calcination temperature of 700°C. It was also demonstrated that the pozzolanic activity of the clays calcined at 700°C was directly related to the percentage of kaolinite in the crude samples.

    "abstract": "Cementitious materials are an integral part of the engineered barrier system in the French design of a deep geological radioactive waste repository. A maximum increase in temperature to 70°C resulting from exothermic hydration reactions and heat generation by the radioactive waste could lead to significant changes in hydrated cement paste mineralogy, which in turn will affect the sorption of radionuclides. Cementitious materials were prepared with ordinary Portland Cement at 20 and 70°C using different temperature conditions of hardening, cure and alteration. Selenite uptake was measured in each system. The sorption of selenite was studied in a pH and Eh range where Se(IV) is stable. Sorption kinetics and sorption isotherms of selenite were determined at 20 and 70°C for up to 140 days in the concentration range of 2 × 10 −11 to 8 × 10 −4 mol/l for initial selenite. With increasing temperature, the hydrogarnet phase appeared and the crystallinity of C–S–H phases increased (formation of afwillite). Ettringite could no longer be detected. With the temperature increase, the specific surface area was about four times lower than the specific surface area of the sample aged at 20°C. The distribution ratios (R d ) decreased with temperature as a result. At 20°C, there was an initial fast sorption process (surface process) followed by a slower process such as a diffusion process into the solid phases. R d values of 3600 ± 400 l/kg were obtained for 20°C altered cement suspensions at 30 days and for selenite concentration ranging from 8 × 10 −12 to 6 × 10 −7 mol/l. At 70°C, the sorption kinetics were similar and R d values were found to be 1290 ± 80 l/kg. Saturation of the sorption site(s) was observed for selenite concentrations greater than approximately 2 × 10 −7 mol/l.",

Depending on their use, the cement-based materials can be exposed to different types of aggressive environments. For instance, damage to concrete structures in contact with a sulfate and saline environment are of most importance. Belite cements have excellent durability against determined expansive attacks and lower heat of hydration than that of Portland cements. These properties convert belite cements into good candidates for the immobilisation of low-level liquid waste and medium-level liquid waste. In this work, the authors present a long-term durability study at 40°C of a kind of belite cement from coal fly ash class C as alternative raw material. The aggressive was a 0·5 mol/l sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 ) solution, which is common in some evaporator concentrate solutions of medium-level liquid waste and low-level liquid waste. The attack was evaluated by means of flexural strength changes of mortars over 180 days.

    "abstract": "Complex cementitious matrices undergo weathering with environmental exchange and can release metallic pollutants during alteration. The molecular mechanisms responsible for metal release are difficult to identify, though this is necessary if such processes are to be controlled. The present study determines and models the molecular mechanisms of Pb release during Portland cement leaching. As Pb release is strongly related to its speciation (i.e. atomic environment and the nature of bearing phases), the first objective of the present study was to investigate the evolution of Pb retention sites together with the evolution of the cement mineralogy during leaching. Complementary and efficient investigation tools were used, namely X-ray diffraction, micro-X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption fine structures. The second objective was to reproduce our results with a reactive transport code (CHESS/HYTEC) in order to test the proposed speciation model of Pb. Combined results indicate that in both the unaltered core and the altered layer of the leached cement, Pb(II) would be retained through C-S-H 'nano-structure', probably linked to a Q1 or Q2P silicate tetrahedra. Moreover in the altered layer, the presence of Fe atoms in the atomic environment of Pb is highly probable. Unfortunately little is known about Fe phases in cement, which makes the interpretation difficult. Can Fe- substituted hydrogranet (C3AH6) be responsible for Pb retention? Modelling results were consistent with Pb retention through C-S-H in layers and also in an additional, possibly Fe-containing, Pb-retention phase in the altered layer.",

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns caused by microstructural objects (nanometre and micrometre range) as well as by crystalline phases were observed at room temperature and at 40°C. Combined and time-resolved SAXS and WAXS studies in the early stage of hydration (until approximately 21 h) are reported. The experimental results indicate that two types of internal surfaces occurred simultaneously. Smooth surfaces, namely surfaces of Euclidean geometry, coexist with fractal surfaces. Analysis of different segments of a scattering curve showed that the proportions between Euclidean and fractal surfaces changed with time after the onset of hydration. A direct comparison of the structure-forming processes in the nanometre range at different temperatures (room temperature and 40°C) is given by the SAXS results. SAXS/WAXS, in addition to small-angle neutron scattering, represents one of the few relevant non-destructive test methods that provide undisturbed information about the nanostructure and microstructure of hydrating phases. The combination of SAXS and WAXS is a powerful tool for the simultaneous observation of X-ray amorphous (non-crystalline) and crystalline structures.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study of the characteristics and pozzolanic activity of three volcanic tuffs to assess the quality and availability of the tuffs for use as supplementary cementitious materials in cement-based composites. The main parameters of the tuffs (chemical composition, proportion of vitreous phase, mineral species and rock structure) were assessed by chemical composition analysis and x-ray diffraction. The pozzolanic activity component (PAC) of tuff, calculated from chemical composition and amorphous phase content, is proposed as an intrinsic index of pozzolanic activity without consideration of particle size and was used to evaluate the tuffs. The pozzolanic reaction degree (PRD) of the tuff/cement pastes was determined by hydrochloric acid dissolution. The pozzolanic activity strength index (PASI) was evaluated as the ratio of the compressive strength of the blended tuff/cement mortar to that of a control cement mortar. The results showed that the tuffs possess great potential for pozzolanic activity in terms of PAC, PRD and PASI because they have high contents of silicon dioxide and aluminium oxide and plentiful amorphous phases. A correlation between PAC and pozzolanic activity index was revealed and a consistent relationship between PRD and PASI was also found.",

    "abstract": "The internal micro-environment temperature and humidity, which depend on external climate and concrete material properties are important factors affecting the durability. In a natural environment, the diurnal and seasonal weather cycles lead to the fluctuations in internal climate in concrete. This paper is focused on the internal temperature and relative humidity of fly ash concrete under natural climatic conditions. Three fly ash replacement levels, namely, 15%, 30% and 45% are considered. The temperature and humidity inside and outside concrete specimens are recorded chronically by temperature and humidity sensors. The test shows that the internal temperature varies similarly to the external ambient temperature, and the content of fly ash has a little influence on temperature response. The internal humidity fluctuates more slowly than the temperature; in particular, it may remain almost constant for a long time during winter. The higher fly ash content (such as 30% or 45% replacement ratio) increases the fluctuation in internal humidity, especially during summer. Therefore, in the concrete durability studies involving impact of temperature and relative humidity, while the external environment temperature can be directly considered instead of internal temperature, the ambient humidity and the micro-environment humidity must be clearly distinguished.",

    "abstract": "Fly ash is the most widely used supplementary cementitious material in the world. In India, although the widespread use of fly ash started only two decades ago, fly ash cement already makes up almost 70% of the market and still more fly ash is mixed in concrete. Yet, over a 100 Mt of fly ash produced in India every year is not utilised. This study presents a study of the characteristics of ten different fly ashes collected in India and the correlation between their chemical and physical properties. An understanding of the characteristics of the fly ashes is not only important to increase their consumption, but also to evaluate the potential of exporting fly ashes to other countries. It was found that, while most of the fly ashes had lower amorphous contents, they generally were finer than most cements. The results also indicate that the commonly used acid dissolution tests are not reliable to evaluate the reactivity of the fly ashes.",

The yield stress was found to increase and plastic viscosity decreased with clinker substitution.

Analytical methods such as X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, eight-channel microcalorimetry and thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry are used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these changes. Incorporation of a single retarder (NB) results in short MKPC hardening times and low early strengths. Admixture with 1·5% or more NB and CN effectively lengthens the hardening time of MKPC, but greatly decreases its fluidity. Incorporation of NB, CN and NS in the ratios 1·5%:1·5%:5% results in an initial hardening time of 37·02 min and the appearance of two temperature peaks in the hydration temperature curve. The resulting cement mix has fluidity of 115 mm and strength of 52·56 MPa after 12 h of hydration. Reaction between NB and CN creates a calcium borate film that envelopes magnesium oxide particles, preventing dissolution of magnesium oxide and generation of the hydrated product MgKPO 4 ·6H 2 O (MKP), thus slowing down the hydration process. Incorporation of an appropriate quantity of NS endows fluidity of MKPC that can reach 125 mm, owing to crystal waters released during solvation and changes in phase.",

In this paper, a kind of Sr-bearing ye'elimite was synthesised with the formula 3CaO·SrO·3Al 2 O 3 ·SO 3 (abbreviated as C 3 ŠA 3 $); the characterisation and hydration process of C 3 ŠA 3 $ are reported here. Comparing to C 4 A 3 $, mineralogical analysis of C 3 ŠA 3 $ was conducted, and Rietveld quantitative phase analysis was employed to quantify the hydration products of C 3 ŠA 3 $ and correlate to calorimetric data. Results show that C 3 ŠA 3 $ accounts for over 93% in the clinker, and the ACn contents are insignificant in terms of amounts. Without gypsum, the hydration process of C 3 ŠA 3 $ is more retarded and prolonged than C 4 A 3 $ at an early stage.

As regards C 3 ŠA 3 $ hydrating with a certain amount of gypsum, the hydration rate of C 3 ŠA 3 $ is accelerated to approach C 4 A 3 $ blended with gypsum. In the paste of C 3 ŠA 3 $ blended with gypsum at 28 d, AFt occupies the majority of crystalline phases to take up 42·1%; minor phases AFm and strontium sulfate account for 3·1% and 7·4%, respectively.",

Important properties including mass, compressive and flexural strength, sorptivity, water penetration depth and porosity have been rigorously investigated. Significant findings demonstrated that increasing the replacement level of diatomite resulted in a systematic decrease in the final mass of cellulose fibre-reinforced cement mortars and a dramatic increase in both flexural and compressive strength. In the short term, sorptivity, water penetration depth and porosity were enhanced, whereas the pozzolanicity of diatomite provided long-term strength gain over the 6 month period of study. Microstructural development of mortars, confirmed using scanning electron microscopy, revealed a denser, more compact structure in the diatomite specimens, which was consistent with the physical property measurements. This research supports the development of environmentally friendly diatomite-based mortars for construction.",

However, it is difficult to cast such structures and some teething problems are still present. In this paper a case study is presented in which a Voronoi-like tessellation was used as formwork to manufacture a small cementitious plate. Cementitious structures are not very often thin and they are susceptible to cracking. In this research, a self-healing strain-hardening cementitious material was considered as a solution to this problem. Using strain-hardening cementitious materials, it was possible to produce a thin high-strength cementitious form that could can be easily cast and demoulded. In addition, the Voronoi structure showed outstanding healing capabilities. This principle may broaden the use of these aesthetically interesting materials as design applications in the future.",

For mortars reinforced with 3% steel fibres by volume, both flexural and compressive strengths were remarkably enhanced. The optimal content of RHA was found to be about 10–15%. The addition of RHA decreased the hydration heat evolution rate of the cementitious composites, but the hydration process was brought forward due to the addition of RHA. As a result of calcium hydroxide consumption through the pozzolanic reaction of the RHA, the interface was strengthened with an increase in curing time and the microstructure of the mortar containing RHA blended was denser than that of mortar without RHA. The high pozzolanic reaction and the filler effect of RHA contributed to a finer pore structure and a decrease in porosity.",

To examine the carbonation curing mechanism, fresh cement pastes and concretes subject to carbonation are characterised using a non-contact electrical resistivity measurement method. Resistivity measurements reveal that characteristic features of the hydration accelerated by carbonation are different from conventional hydration. The typical induction period is absent in the carbonation curing owing to the rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate. The resistivity measurement method produces a superimposed result of early hardening and multiple instances of progressive hardening by carbonation curing. The electrical resistivity is 3–6 times higher in the carbonated cement paste and about 8–16 times higher in the carbonated concretes in comparison with the hydration references. The carbonated lightweight concrete shows lower bulk resistivity than the carbonated normal-weight concrete, possibly owing to the release of internal water from the lightweight aggregates during carbonation. This is evidence of internal curing by lightweight aggregates.",

    "abstract": "The reduced lifetime of geothermal wells is one of the main issues facing the geothermal industry, with cement durability being one of the main causes for shortening of a well's life. While most wells are cemented with American Petroleum Institute (API) class cements, alternative cementing systems are currently being considered. In this paper, the interactions of two alternative cement formulations with a typical geothermal rock formation are compared with a class A cement. This allows understanding of the most critical zone in the geothermal cement, which is the outermost layer where the cement encounters and, consequently, interacts with the exterior harsh environment, including the volcanic formation and brine. The faster setting of white cement and high-alumina cement compared with the well Portland cement seems to reduce the reaction extent with the rock. For all the cements tested, both the increased curing temperature (from 150°C to 290°C) and the use of bentonite as drilling mud significantly decreased the bond between the cement and the rock.",

    "abstract": "Thermal-shock resistance of high-content fly ash–Portland cement blends was tested in the following ways. Activated and non-activated blends with 80–90% fly ash F (FAF) were left to set at room temperature, then hydrated for 24 h at 85°C and then for an additional 24 h at 300°C, and tested in five thermal-shock cycles (600°C heat – 25°C water quenching). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analyses, along with calorimetric measurements and scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersive X-ray tests demonstrated that the activated blends form more hydrates after 24 h at 300°C, and achieve a higher short-term compressive strength than do non-activated ones. Sodium meta-silicate and soda-ash engendered the concomitant hydration of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and class F fly ash (FAF), with the formation of mixed crystalline FAF–OPC hydrates and FAF hydrates, such as garranite, analcime and wairakite, along with the amorphous FAF hydration products. In sodium sulfate-activated and non-activated blends separate OPC (tobermorite) and FAF (amorphous gel) hydrates with no mixed crystalline products formed. The compressive strength of all tested blends decreased by nearly 50% after five thermal-shock test cycles. These changes in the compressive strength were accompanied by a marked decrease in the intensities of XRD patterns of the crystalline hydrates after the thermal shock. There was no significant difference in the performance of the blends with different activators.",

The results showed that the increment of specific surface area (ΔS) at 30 min and decrement of 30 μm sieve residue (Δη) for the four kinds of grinding aids showed an exponential function with an increase in dosage. TEA, CLS and STPP showed good grindability to cement clinker, while PG even showed some negative grindability. Through the chemical action of the grinding aids and their impact on particle size distribution of the cement samples, TEA and PG were found to accelerate the heat release rate, while CLS and STPP delayed it. TEA enhanced early mortar strength. CLS increased both the early and late mortar strength. STPP showed no remarkable impact on mortar strength while PG was found to decrease the mortar strength.",

The aim of this study was to mitigate the autogenous shrinkage and improve the strength of blended cement containing quartz tailing by modifying the interface between the quartz tailing and the cement matrix. In this study, the quartz tailing was modified by calcining the material mixed with carbide slag at 1050°C. The compressive strength, autogenous shrinkage, microstructure and nanomechanical properties of the blended cement pastes containing modified quartz tailing were investigated. The results show that modified quartz tailing particles mainly consist of an inner core of quartz and a β-dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) layer. Compared to unmodified quartz tailing, modified quartz tailing increases the compressive strength of the blended cement paste and at the same time decreases its autogenous shrinkage. In addition, the nanoindentation modulus and hardness of the interfacial zone between quartz tailing and cement matrix are improved, and the porosity of the blended cement paste is decreased. This can be attributed to the formation of calcium silicate hydrate gel owing to the hydration of the β-C 2 S contained in the modified quartz tailing, and hence enhancement of the interface microstructure between the quartz tailing and cement matrix.",

However, a relatively great amount of migrated sulfate as well as expansive sulfate products (gypsum and ettringite) were still found in the blended cement mortars under the electrical field, for which their deterioration was also notable.

Isothermal calorimetry showed that the addition of ASa increased the first exothermic peak of cement hydration and advanced the second exothermic peak. The morphology of hydration products was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a model for the early hydration of cement paste was established. X-ray diffraction and SEM were also used to analyse the phase composition and morphology changes of C 3 A and C 3 S with or without ASa and early hydration models were established. Analysis of the experimental results revealed that the sodium hydroxide produced by ASa hydrolysis had the function of consuming gypsum, breaking calcium silicate hydrate gel film and increasing the calcium hydroxide concentration in the cement paste. The ettringite in the hydration products interweaved together to form a skeleton structure, which was conducive to cement paste hardening.",

The rate of carbonation of mortar with and without mineral admixture (pulverized fuel ash (PFA) and ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS)) is shown to depend on the total volume of pores having a radius &gt; 450 Å present in the hardened matrix prior to accelerated carbonation. The greater the volume of pores above the critical radius in the hardened matrix prior to accelerated carbonation, the faster is the rate of carbonation, and vice versa. The above relationship also holds for plain cement concrete and concrete blended with PFA and GGBS, as both concrete and mortar of similar type (water/binder (w/b) ratio, PFA or GGBS content) follow an identical carbonation trend. The results of the present study also demonstrate that the rate of carbonation of hardened cement matrix, apart from depending on the total volume of pores having a radius &gt; 450 Å, is also controlled by the parameters (cementitious content, type and proportion of mineral admixture in the mix) that control its alkalinity. The present study also emphasizes the need to precure the hardened cement matrix with and without PFA and GGBS in water for a minimum period of 7 days to minimize the pore volume above the critical radius (&gt; 450 Å), and thereby to optimize the resistance of the matrix to carbonation. The total volume of pores having a radius &gt; 450 Å is also shown to be linearly related to the 7 day compressive strengths of mortar blended with and without PFA and GGBS.",

The electrochemical reaction that occurred at the electrodes resulted in a marked increase in the OH - concentration of the pore solution in the zone of the sample close to the cathode, whereas a steep decrease was observed in the zone of the sample facing the anode. These changes had different effects on the transport of chloride. In the zone towards the cathode, the rising OH - concentration caused more and more of the total current to be transported by the OH - ions as the migration progressed in time (chloride removal became much less efficient here), while in the peripheral zone towards the anode more and more current was transported by the Cl - ions (chloride removal became more efficient here). This resulted in a change of chloride concentration in the pore solution and the solids, which was in disagreement with the direction of migration of these ions. According to the direction of migration, the Cl - concentration should have decreased most slowly in the peripheral zone towards the anode, because the Cl - ions leaving the sample at this point can be replaced by others that have moved in from the zone of the sample closer to the cathode. In the case of the alkali ions sodium and potassium, the changes in concentration were in agreement with the direction of migration.",

    "abstract": "Fly ashes, from an extensive database showing extremes in ratios of major oxides, are considered as potential raw meal ingredients for preparation of sulfoaluminate cements. Simple algorithmized, essentially Bogue-like, computations are performed in order to create a link between the chemical composition of raw meals and their mineralogical composition, as expected to result from their burning. The computations refer to a set of three-component raw meals, all containing limestone and gypsum but differing in the kind of fly ash introduced as the third raw meal component. The individual raw meal compositions are identified in computations, yielding three phase products, composed of C 2 S, C 4 A 3 S; and C 4 AF. The content of each phase is within the following limits: C 2 S, 60·7–83·4 wt%; C 4 A S, 4·2–27·2 wt%; and C 4 AF 2·67–30·5 wt%. As a result, fly ashes are thus convenient raw sources for production of sulfoaluminate cements. Of special interest are fly ashes low in SiO 2 /A 2 O 3 or SiO 2 /(Al 2 O 3 + Fe 2 O 3 ) ratios, providing clinkers with the preferred proportions of the mineral phases.",

    "abstract": "Aggregates, varying in alkali reactivity, were used for making mortar bars and concrete prisms, employing the same Portland cement. Measurement of length changes of the specimens was carried out under various storage conditions and for different lengths of time. Scanning electron microscopy of the specimens and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of the products formed in them has shown that alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) products develop first and much faster than ‘secondary’ ettringite (mat-form, filling cracks) associated with some deteriorated steam-cured concrete elements. The expansion and cracking due to AAR was more rapid and extensive at higher temperature (80°C) than at lower temperature (40°C). Mat-forms of ettringite developed only after prolonged storage of the specimens in a fogroom, and the amount was larger in the specimens initially treated at 80°C, mainly because more AAR expansion and cracking occurred at the higher temperature, but also because the higher initial temperature caused larger formation of secondary ettringite. It is concluded that AAR products were primarily responsible for the expansion and cracking that occurred in the specimens containing reactive aggregates. The formation of ettringite was not involved in this deterioration, but it may have had a secondary role at later ages. The deterioration of some steam-cured concrete railway sleepers may be explained based on these results.",

The leaching of heavy metals Cr (total chromium and of Cr 6+ ), Pb, Cd, Zn, Mn, Co, V, Ti, Ni and Cu in fly ash cement mortars has been investigated by tank leaching and shaken extraction test methods; comparisons are made between the leachability of heavy metals under different pH conditions and of metals from specimens at different curing ages. In addition, a pH controlled shaken extraction test method is proposed; an advantage of this method is that leachant pH remains nearly constant at 6.6 ± 0.3 throughout the extraction process, leading to the diminution of the impact of pH variation of leachant on the leachability of heavy metals. The results of this study mainly indicate that: (a) heavy metals do leach from the tested cement mortars, but the amount leached is small; with increasing fly ash addition and water to binder ratio the leaching of heavy metals from cement mortars increases; (b) in a tank leaching test, the leaching of heavy metals from fly ash cement mortars is also a diffusion controlled process; compared with the tank leaching test, a shaken extraction test can extract more toxic heavy metals from hardened mortars; (c) the leachability of some heavy metals is greatly dependent on leachant pH: for example at pH around 7, leaching of Mn, Zn, total Cr (Cr for short in the following), Cr 6+ and Pb will be much increased in comparison to that at pH over 12; (d) the leaching of Co, total Cr and Cr 6+ from cement mortars is reduced with curing age, but no evident effect of curing age on the leaching of Cd, Ti, Ni, Mn, Zn and V has been observed; and (e) increased leaching of both Cr and Cr 6+ will occur when cement mortars have been carbonated.",

In this study tests were performed on samples of hardened cement paste of several ages in order to evaluate the relative influence of various parameters like water—cementitious (W/C), cement—powder (C/P) and water—powder ratio and to investigate the difference between traditional and self-compacting concrete. It was concluded that adding limestone powder as a filler and superplasticiser has an important influence on the pore structure of the cement paste. Decreasing the C/P and keeping the amount of water and powder constant induces a more porous cement paste.

This advancement covers all aspects of the concrete industry, from mixing to curing. The study presented here contains the results of an investigation of various concrete curing methods used recently in the region. Specifically, the study investigates the influences of the environment and curing methods on the compressive strength of silica fume high-strength concrete. Specimens were kept at five different curing conditions and in two different environments for a period of 9 months. The curing conditions used were water curing (control), no curing (NC), sprinkle curing (SC), plastic curing (PC) and burlap curing (BC). Eeach of the last four conditions was exposed to two different environments: indoor (ID) environment and outdoor (OD) environment. The strength results were determined at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 270 days. The results reveal that the effects of the curing methods on the compressive strength of the specimens are highly influenced by the exposure conditions, and the different curing schemes have varying effects on the compressive strength of the specimens. This suggests that careful and more efficient curing practices and techniques are required when curing concrete in the hot dry environments such as in the climate of the Gulf region.",

For cylinders that were cured at an elevated temperature (70°C) and silane-treated, both the ascending and descending branches of the compressive stress-strain1 curve became steeper and more linear.

The strengths, stress intensity factor (K IC ), and critical crack tip opening displacement (CTOD C ) were studied by varying the fibre and polymer contents. As a result, fracture toughness and mechanical properties increased with both increasing fibre and increasing resin contents. The silane agent improved the adhesion of polymer to aggregates and resulted in greater compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexural strength and material resistance to crack extension. Adding fibres to the polymer concrete produced a bridging effect at the crack tip and hence slowed the crack propagation. For all specimens, the critical K IC and the critical CTOD C values increased with increasing fibre content. Carbon fibre reinforcement increased K IC by 86·5% and CTOD C by 321·7% of the original value of the unreinforced polymer concrete. Nylon fibre reinforcement increased K IC by 49·1% and CTOD C by 219·5% of the original value of unreinforced polymer concrete.

The potential high-temperature alkali degradation of these retarders is assessed, and its role in altering the kinetics of cement hydration at temperatures between 70 and 90°C. The high-temperature alkaline stability of cement set retarders is poorly studied. However, it may represent one way to understand the delay in hydration induced by such additives, and the discontinuity of cement hydration, with the longer setting times at higher temperatures in that range. Degradation products are identified and their thermal stability is evaluated. Retarders containing carboxylic acid become partially fragmented at high pH and 90°C. The effect on cement setting kinetics is similar for hydrolysed retarders containing carboxylic acid groups: the setting times are longer at 80°C than at 70 and 90°C. The sulfonate groups of lignosulfonate-type retarder, treated at pH 13·4, 90°C, are partially converted to sulfate and the ether groups to alkoxides. The setting time changes linearly with temperature for the high-pH-treated lignosulfonate retarder in the studied temperature range.",

    "abstract": "An earlier study with metakaolin and 10 Portland cements (PC) suggested that the ASTM C 452-68 test could be used to characterise and differentiate 28-day blended cements prepared with metakaolin. ASTM C 452-68 testing was once again conducted on 67 cements: the above 10 PC and 57 blended cements (POZC) containing 20%, 30% or 40% silica fume or diatomites (D or N) (= Z pozzolan). ASTM C 452-68 specimens were made from all the cements and their daily rate of increase in length was determined. The results showed that in a gypsum and water environment, the pozzolanic reactions induced by the reactive silica, SiO 2 r− , present in Z pozzolans, prevailed over the sulfatic hydration of the pozzolans themselves, reaching completion within 28 days. The explanation is that the formation rate (V f ) of the calcium silicate hydrate gel and silanol groups from the SiO 2 r− present in the Z pozzolan finishes being greater than the V f observed for the ettringite forming slowly (ett-lf) from the C 3 A of ordinary Portland cement, which declines to zero, even though sulfatic hydration continues. The positive 7 and/or 28-day results obtained with the Frattini test (EN 196-5) and the tests set out in standards EN 450, ASTM C 311-07, EN 13263-1 or ASTM 618-95a provided proof that the ASTM C 452-68 test can be validly used to characterise 28-day POZC prepared with any natural or artificial pozzolan, subject, however, to the establishment of suitable standard physical-chemical requirements and specifications.",

The addition of barium oxide is of benefit to increase the content of C 2·75 B 1·25 A 3 S¯, and it can also activate the belite and promote the formation of alite at low temperature. The optimal silica modulus, iron modulus, lime saturation factor and content of C 2·75 B 1·25 A 3 S¯ are 2·3, 1·4, 0·94 and 4% respectively, and the proper content of barium oxide is 1·8%(by weight). The compressive strength of this cement prepared under these conditions reaches 52·3, 78·4 and 106·5 MPa at 3-day, 7-day and 28-day curing ages, which shows excellent performance of mechanical strength. The compositions, structures and performances of the clinker were analysed by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy and metallographic microscope.",

The high desorptivity of cement mortars results in rapid dewatering when they are applied in the freshly mixed wet state to absorbent substrates in masonry construction. This paper particularly focuses on the dewatering that takes place due to the interaction of wet mortar and brick substrate in the freshly mixed state and the properties of cement mortars that are significantly influenced as a consequence of this interaction in the hardened state. The transfer sorptivity, time to dewater, setting time, consistence, strength and water penetration depth, along with the effect of dewatering on these parameters, were investigated not only for mortar/substrate optimisation in masonry construction but also for improved mechanical properties. The results obtained show that the ability to manipulate water transport kinetics and hence reduce mix-water loss during dewatering by using zeolite – a natural pozzolanic replacement material – is a vital feature of cement mortars not only for enhanced mechanical properties and durability but also for sustainable production of these mortars in construction practice.",

Based on measuring the dissolution rate of the alkali sulfates and ion concentration in tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A)–alkali sulfate–water (H 2 O) systems compared with gypsum, and testing the heat flow, compressive strength, setting time and linear deformation of cement with different alkali sulfate contents, the differences between the alkali sulfates and gypsum are analysed. It is shown that aphthitalite could not act as a retarder, whereas calcium langbeinite can act to achieve almost the same retardation as gypsum. In view of the volume stability and strength development of cement, aphthitalite has a negative action when the equivalent sodium (Na 2 O e ) content induced is above 1·42%. The X-ray diffraction analysis patterns and scanning electron microscopy images show that aphthitalite restrains ettringite formation. It is suggested that more attention should be paid to the negative action of aphthitalite when alkali and sulfate contents in clinker appear to be high.",

In addition, the effect of the mixing sequence of clay and PCE in cement paste was also investigated to explore the mechanism of the low clay-tolerance of PCE. The results indicated that the addition of clay reduced the adsorption of PCE on cement grain surfaces. Accordingly, the workability of the cement paste mixed with PCE was also changed with the addition of clay. In the presence of clay, although the total consumption of PCE was increased, the fluidity of the paste decreased. The results from different mixing sequences revealed that, in the presence of clay, the adsorption amount of PCE on cement grain surfaces was highly reduced, leading to poor dispersion of the cement particles.",

The CD contents vary from 0 to 10% and the sodium carbonate contents are fixed at 5% and 10%. The results show that the reaction process can be significantly accelerated by adding a small quantity of CD. Both increasing the concentration of sodium carbonate and extending the sealed curing are proven to be beneficial to compressive strength development of the samples. The main reaction products in the binders are calcite, calcium silicate hydrates and hydrotalcite-like phases. The curing regimes have a negligible influence on the formation of those phases. In terms of carbonation, increasing either CD or sodium carbonate contents can restrict the extent of carbonation of the samples. This is attributed to the formation of large quantities of hydrotalcite-like phases in the binder.",

In this study, cement paste samples containing titanium dioxide nanoparticles were exposed to multiple cycles of nitrogen dioxide gas and ultraviolet radiation, along with wetting and drying, to simulate the effects of field exposure. The photocatalytic efficiency was monitored at each cycle and the surface of the samples was examined visually, chemically and mechanically between the cycles. The results indicate that the nitrogen dioxide oxidation efficiency decreased with cycling, possibly due to carbonation of the paste or loss of titanium dioxide particles. The pits found from the scanning electron microscopy images indicate there has been deterioration on the sample surfaces. Observations of surface deterioration imply possible acid attack, leaching and/or loss of titanium dioxide, suggesting that particularly the surfaces of cement-based materials can be negatively affected by photocatalysis.",

Results show that the presence of borax can effectively restrain the early hydration rate of DCRCM, and this leads to reductions in both the hydration products and the flocculent structure in the paste. Obvious shear thinning occurs in the fresh DCRCM paste with the increase of shear rate, followed by gradually stabilised viscosity. As the amount of borax is increased, the yield stress and plastic viscosity of DCRCM paste decrease and the rheological properties are significantly improved. However, when the amount of borax is 4%, the rheological type of DCRCM paste changes to shear thickening at a high shear rate, which is unfavourable in terms of the improvement of rheological properties.",

The results revealed that YW can significantly improve the compressive strength of cement and reduce its permeability.

However, it remains unclear whether this type of material can work in a stable way in harsh environments. This study investigated the chemical–physical–mechanical stability of metakaolin-based geopolymer (MKG) mortars under the immersing actions of sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate solutions up to 180 days by testing their visual appearance, mass, dimensions, strength, microstructure and chemical components. Results show that the immersion actions do not cause obvious changes in mass, dimensions or compressive and flexural strengths of the MKG mortars. A white deposit, consisting of magnesium hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, magnesium carbonate and magnesium silicate aluminate hydrate, appeared on the surfaces of the high-alkali MKG specimens immersed in magnesium sulfate solution for 30 days, and disappeared at later ages due to the continual consumption of magnesium hydroxide. Mg–Na exchanges occurred for the MKG mortars immersed in magnesium sulfate solution. Overall, the chemical–physical–mechanical stability of geopolymer-based materials depends on the material components and interactions with the environment. Caution should be used before any engineering applications, and relevant issues deserve further rigorous investigation in the future.",

The hydration activity of the FT was found to be poor. The mechanical properties and durability of the concrete made with FVS were close to those of the FA concrete and optimal performance was obtained from a mixture of FA and FVS. Mercury intrusion porosimetry, X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis were used for microanalysis of cementitious systems with 70% cement and 30% FA, 70% cement and 30% FT, and 70% cement and 30% FVS. The results were promising and suggested that the FVS possessed obvious secondary hydration activity and could improve the microstructure of the concrete matrix.

    "abstract": "Alkali-free flash setting accelerators are widely used in the area of underground construction as they allow a very rapid hardening of cementitious systems. These admixtures are particularly used for wet-mix shotcrete, which involves pneumatically pumping a previously prepared concrete to a nozzle, where liquid accelerator is added. Compressed air is used to ‘shoot' the mixture onto the receiving surface. The resulting concrete layer acts as a consolidating shield that helps to avoid the tendency of the excavated section to squeeze (convergence) or collapse. The accelerator's efficiency is related to many parameters such as cement class, environmental conditions (humidity, temperature), concrete mix design and aggregate type. A limited number of papers have been published on the effects of these factors on the accelerating properties of alkali-free accelerators. In this paper, the influence of the aggregates chemical nature is studied. Setting time and mechanical strength development of mortar samples containing calcareous or siliceous sands, with the addition of an alkali-free accelerator, are analysed. It is discovered that calcium-carbonate-based aggregates strongly improve accelerator performances. In order to better understand this phenomenon, the influence of calcium carbonate on accelerated hydrating cement mortar is investigated through thermo-chemical hydration profiles, thermogravimetry (TG), environmental scanning electron microscopy – field emission gun (ESEM-FEG), induced coupled plasma – atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). From the results, a significant increase of ettringite is evident in the accelerated mortars containing calcite.",

The dimensional stability investigation is focused on the role of adsorbed and interlayer water as shrinkage mechanisms involving menisci effects in capillary pores are eliminated in this humidity range. Length change against mass loss curves and the corresponding d 002 basal spacing change (obtained by X-ray diffraction) with mass loss are assessed and inferences drawn regarding nanostructural models for calcium silicate hydrates in hydrated Portland cement paste. Length changes of the pure phases were significantly greater than those for hydrated cement paste due to the restraining effect of unhydrated cement particles and calcium hydroxide crystals in the paste. The dimensional stability and the role of the removal of ‘structural water' from the systems studied are discussed in terms of its relevance to cement-based materials.",

    "abstract": "Sulfate is present as various phases in Portland cement and these phases have distinct effects on the hydration and hardening of cement-based materials. A set of sulfate phases, with dissolution behaviour to easily soluble sulfates and gypsum, could be studied as a whole. Two chemical extraction methods, the 50% ethanol method and the saturated soda method, are initially proposed and described to study the quantitative distribution of easily soluble sulfates and gypsum in Portland cements. The ethanol method proposed can selectively dissolve easily soluble sulfates in cements and clinkers in a 1·5–2·5 min extraction process; and is more efficient than 1·5–2·5 min water extraction. The determination of gypsum depends on completely extracting the gypsum in a 2 h extraction with saturated soda solution at 300:1 (ml:g) of liquid–solid ratio. The gypsum determined is an overall phase, which would include anhydrite, semihydrate, dihydrate and other calcium sulfate in Portland cements.",

    "abstract": "Efforts are being made to reduce carbon dioxide formation in the cement industry, and studies continue to show the effectiveness of blast furnace slag (BFS) as a cement substitute. BFS is well known for its hardening mechanism in ordinary Portland cement or for alkali activation owing to its latent hydraulic property. This study accurately analyses the mechanism of initial hydration delay caused by the latent hydraulic property of BFS, with the aim of establishing a basic theory to extend the use of BFS based on this initial hydration delay mechanism analysis. The concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, used as an alkali actuator, are 0, 0·01, 0·1, and 1·0 M. To understand the early hydration, the leaching concentrations of calcium, aluminium and silicon ions are measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. To confirm the hydration products formed by the leached ions, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric differential thermal analyses are conducted. For the BFS, calcium ions are leached in very high amounts when the sodium hydroxide concentration is ≤ 0·1 M. At sodium hydroxide concentration &gt; 1·0 M, the leaching of calcium ions decreases noticeably, and aluminium and silicon ions begin to leach. Ettringite and calcium–silicate–hydrates (C-S-H) are confirmed as reaction products.",

In this study, five cement kiln dusts and three dusts from other sources in cement production were investigated. Shear tests showed that the flowability of most dust is very poor. Furthermore, the flowability depends on the consolidation stress: the higher the consolidation stress, the better the flowability. Three flowability indicators – the angle of repose, the Hausner ratio and Carr's compressibility – were also determined, but these indicators produced very inconsistent results. In most cases, the flowability of the dust was overestimated. Therefore, shear tests are strongly recommended for reliable categorisation of the flowability of dusts from cement plants.",

The presence of caesium within the hydration solution leads to the formation of a zeolitic phase of the chabazite family, which immobilizes caesium within the cementitious mix. A severe leach test shows that the immobilization is efficient. Chabazite is also formed when a Cs solution is in contact with an already hydrated CAC-SF mix. The structure of zeolites involves ceramic bonds that are more stable with heat treatment than hydrate bonds, which explains why chabazite is not destroyed by heat treatment at a temperature as high as 750°C. The presence of chabazite is therefore interesting for any application that requires thermal treatment.",

As to the physico-mechanical properties of the hardened pastes, the addition of the polymer – at a constant water/solid ratio – increased the flexural strength and work of fracture of the material and at the same time lowered its compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and hardness.",

For this purpose three different activators were used: waterglass (Na2SiO2.nHaOH with a SiO2/NaO ratio equal 1·5), NaOH and Na2CO3. The concentration of all solutions was constant = 3% of Na2O by mass of the slag. The pastes were studied through isothermal conduction calorimetry, FTIR and 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR. Results indicate that pastes activated with waterglass develop faster setting due to the formation of an initial calcium silicate hydrate. Setting, in pastes activated with NaOH is due to the formation of a more polymerised calcium silicate hydrate. Pastes activated with Na2CO3 show longer setting times due to the initial formation of a sodium calcium carbonate which retard the reaction processes.",

Ageing in the mild acidic environment did not result in any detrimental effect and in some cases even a positive influence was observed. These differences were discussed in terms of the micro-structural observations. The strength was largely independent of the type of concrete, reflecting their similar water/cement ratio. However, permeability and performance with regard to carbonation and chloride penetration was significantly better in the industrial concretes, and this was attributed to their lower cement content. This trend suggests that the current standards that set the requirements for minimum cement content for durability should be revisited.",

The most efficient powders were those coming from aggregates having high active silica contents (glass, opal). Powders of siliceous limestone were less effective. In a second part, experimental evidence of the pozzolanic activity of RAP was obtained. It was shown that RAP were similar to pozzolan, since they consumed lime and produce calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) having a lower calcium/silica (C/S) ratio than normal C–S–H. The third part showed experimentally that these low C/S C–S–H could increase the redistribution of alkalis of the pore solution, thus reducing the alkalinity of the pore solution to a level that was sufficiently low to limit the attack of coarser reactive aggregates.

    "abstract": "The materials for low heat cement are discussed from the point of view of the relationship between the strength development and the heat of hydration. The strength development due to the hydration of hydraulic materials is understood to be due to the filling by hydrates of the space that was initially occupied by water. The strength of porous materials can be well expressed by the empirical Ryshkevitch's law. When considering the materials to be used for low-heat cement the rates of heat development are the usual criteria, but instead the amount of heat developed should be regarded as most important, and particularly the ratio of the amount of heat liberated to the volume of solid increased by the hydration. The heat required for fill a unit pore volume was evaluated for some materials, such as C 3 S, C 2 S, C 3 A and granulated blast furnace slag. When C 3 S filled a unit volume of space with hydration products such as C–S–H and C 2 S did with C–S–H and CH, C 3 A did with AFt, C 3 A did with AFm18 and slag did with C–S–H and AFt, the amounts of heat liberated were calculated as 225, 136, 266, 326, 177 cal/ml increase in volume, respectively. It was clearly shown that in these materials C 2 S had easily the minimum heat liberation. It was also found that the solid volume obtained by hydration was proportional to the amount of mass of water hydrated; that is, water solidifies as a material with density of approximately 1·17 g/cm 3 . This also means that the amount of chemical shrinkage was proportional to the amount of water required for hydration.",

Carbonic anhydrase (CA) bacteria can promote the early-age carbonation process of γ-dicalcium silicate (γ-C 2 S), which is one of the main mineral phases of steel slag. In this study, one kind of alkali-resistant CA bacteria was chosen to investigate its effects on the carbonation process of γ-C 2 S. Results showed that the bacteria could increase the compressive strength of carbonated γ-C 2 S by 19.0% when compared with carbonated samples without bacteria. The main products of carbonated γ-C 2 S were vaterite, calcite and silicon dioxide gel. The addition of bacteria could only accelerate the deposition of calcium carbonate, while hardly changing the types and properties of the carbonation products. The accelerated carbonation was found to reduce the inward diffusion of carbon dioxide. In addition, reasons for the decline of the accelerating carbonation effect were explained by X-ray computed tomography testing results. However, CA bacteria could change the morphology of calcium carbonated during the carbonation process of β-C 2 S and further accelerate the hydration process of β-C 2 S. The pore structure could also be refined with the incorporation of bacteria.",

The mechanical strength and reaction products formed during the geopolymerisation process were assessed up to 90 days of curing. The use of CKS as the main component of the precursor blend provides a geopolymer with better mechanical properties due to its higher reactivity than BA. The content of soluble silicates in the alkali activator plays an important role during geopolymerisation, improving the mechanical properties due to the formation of a more reticulated and dense structure. The mortars show a compressive strength higher than 55 MPa after 28 days and low water absorption by capillarity. This elucidates the feasibility of valorising these industrial residues as precursors for geopolymer cements.",

Three different LP fineness values were examined and it was found that cement replacement by LP with the smallest median particle size produced the highest density. The compressive strength of the blended cement mortar increased with increasing LP fineness. The packing densities of the blended cement were used to infer the evolution of mechanical strength of the blended cement mortar. The addition of LP with a median particle size smaller than that of cement accelerated the hydration of cement in the acceleration period. Compared with LP with a median particle size smaller than that of cement, the production rate of nuclei of cement blended LP with a median particle size larger than that of cement decreased with increasing amounts of LP replacement, while the growth rate of nuclei increased with increasing amounts of LP replacement.",

The present study was an experimental investigation of test methods that can detect damage in cement composites, by immersion in highly acidic medium and measuring hot water permeability, capillary, water absorption and compressive strength. The applicability of immersion tests of cement paste were investigated and a model of change for physical properties such as porosity and strength due to leaching were constructed. The results indicated that the porosity could be calculated from the solid-phase calcium concentration, and the changes in the compressive strength, flexural strength, permeability coefficient and diffusion coefficient could be predicted for the degradation phenomenon caused by leaching. It was concluded that the porosity of paste after degradation caused by leaching can be predicted by the Powers' model, the model in which the increase in porosity through leaching is added.",

Total chromium was analysed on an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer, whereas Cr(VI) was analysed using the 1,5-diphenyl carbazide method on a UV-visible spectrophotometer. A group of additives was studied to evaluate their effectiveness for Cr(VI) reduction in the cement samples. The additives were incorporated and mixed in cement for experimentation purposes using a disc mill. The difference in Cr(VI) before and after addition for the particular additive was checked using a spectrophotometer by the 1,5-diphenyl carbazide method at 540 nm. The reduction in Cr(VI) due to use of additives was reconfirmed at two wavelengths, 372 and 274 nm, respectively. Sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 ) and stannous sulfate (SnSO 4 ) were found to be the best additives for reducing Cr(VI) in cement among the additives under investigation in this study.",

This behaviour is related to its microstructure, which is denser than that of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). In the case of sodium chloride, the higher decalcification values were obtained for the two TPC and OPC pastes.

POFA obtained from a palm oil mill was treated first by grinding and then by heat treatment. The treated POFA was then utilised to produce ECCs in combination with polyvinyl alcohol fibres with proportions of POFA ranging from 0 to 1·2 from the mass of cement. The performance of the POFA–ECCs was evaluated by means of matrix fracture and direct tensile tests. The experimental results indicate that the ECC mix containing POFA exhibits lower fracture toughness and fracture energy values than a mix without POFA. Nonetheless, the addition of POFA contributes to a greater pseudo-strain hardening index, in particular at higher POFA content. This reveals that the use of POFA should be helpful for achieving strain hardening behaviour. In addition, an increase in POFA content increases the tensile strain capacity of the ECC. Furthermore, the crack width of the ECC decreases significantly with an increase of POFA content. Thus, the overall findings exhibit that the POFA used brings about promising positive effects on the fracture and tensile characteristics of ECCs.",

The properties examined included setting time, compressive strength, flexural strength, alkali–silica reaction, apparent porosity, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity and dynamic modulus of elasticity. The results showed that the compressive strength of all specimens containing hydrated mortar waste (HMW) material was lower than that of the control specimens. However, the values obtained by replacement of 10–20% of Portland cement with HMW were within acceptable limits. The HMW with replacement ratio of more than ∼40% could not be used to replace ordinary Portland cement because the 28 day compressive strength was 29% lower when ∼40% cement was replaced by HMW. Moreover, the expansion of mortars due to alkali–silica reaction was significantly reduced when more than 20% of cement was replaced by HMW. Increasing the replacement ratio of cement gave rise to a longer setting time. When all the experimental results were taken into consideration, it was concluded that ground HMW can be used as a cementitious material to partially replace Portland cement.",

Filling the annular space around the waste containers with cement grout will support them during placement and seal against ingress of groundwater. The elevated temperature and pressure (∼120°C and 50 MPa) will cause acceleration of grout thickening and setting, so retardation is required. The DBD Research Group at The University of Sheffield has developed grouts based on class G oil well cement that use organic retarders, but their presence may increase the solubility of any radionuclides released from the waste packages. New DBD grout formulations using sodium phosphate and sodium borate as inorganic retarders are reported in this paper. To place the wet grout, the onset of thickening needs to be delayed for at least 4 h. Sodium borate was found to provide this retardation at 90°C (0·75% addition) and nearly retarded sufficiently at 120°C (1% addition). Sodium phosphate did not provide sufficient retardation at either temperature. Neither compounds influenced the phases formed, but may suppress the crystallisation of calcium silicate hydrates. This work demonstrates that the performance of these inorganic materials in this application is inferior to that of organic retarders.",

    "abstract": "The early-age mechanical property of belite cement can be improved by the inclusion of the high early-strength mineral calcium strontium sulfoaluminate (C 1·5 Sr 2·5 A 3 $, 1·5CaO·2·5SrO·3Al 2 O 3 ·SO 3 ). In this paper, the effects of strontia (strontium oxide), sodium oxide, potassia (potassium oxide) and their combination on the burnability and phase composition of belite are discussed with the purpose of enhancing hydration activity of dicalcium silicates (C 2 S), which lays the foundation for improvement in the early hydraulic activity for belite-C 1·5 Sr 2·5 A 3 $ cement. Results showed that, contrary to strontium oxide, sodium oxide and potassium oxide can greatly reduce free-calcium oxide (f-CaO) content in dicalcium silicates and lower the calcium carbonate decomposition temperature. The dicalcium silicate polymorphism was influenced by minor elements, α-dicalcium silicate, α′-dicalcium silicate, β-dicalcium silicate and γ-dicalcium silicate coexisting in different proportions for each doping sample and non-doping sample, of which the most abundant polymorphs were β-dicalcium silicate and γ-dicalcium silicate. According to the Rietveld quantitative phase analysis, the β-dicalcium silicate contents in the control sample, 3% sodium oxide-added, 3% potassium oxide-added, 5% strontium oxide-added and a combination of three elements were 16·49%, 70·13%, 59·34%, 72·78% and 91·04%, respectively. The stabilising effect of β-dicalcium silicate for minor elements can be listed as composite, strontium oxide, sodium oxide and potassium oxide. Scanning electron microscope photographs of doped dicalcium silicate showed granular shape β-dicalcium silicate of dimension of 1–10 μm and prism or plate-like shape γ-dicalcium silicate.",

This study investigates the effect of sulfate content in sulfate-rich fly ash on the test results regarding pozzolanic activity by means of the Frattini test and SAI test; three fly ashes with different sulfate contents are used and their sulfate contents are further increased by adding calcined gypsums. There is significant correlation between the test results of the pozzolanic activity and the sulfur trioxide content of the cement–fly ash system, no matter whether the sulfates came from cement or fly ash. However, current methods may confound the test results regarding the pozzolanic activity of sulfate-rich fly ash. It is suggested that the sulfur trioxide content of the cement–fly ash system should be kept constant when the Frattini test and SAI test are selected to evaluate the pozzolanic activity of sulfate-rich fly ash or to compare with other fly ashes and pozzolans.",

The results show that slow hydrothermal reactions in the calcium oxide–quartz–water system can be intensified using sodium oxide additive. In this case, α-C 2 SH was already the dominant compound in the product after 8 h of hydrothermal synthesis at 200°C in stirred suspensions. It was found that tribochemical activation must be combined with thermal treatment in order to obtain a hydraulically active cementitious binder from the mixture of synthesised α-C 2 SH and quartz sand. The heat flow value of such binding material during its main hydration reaction varied from 0·0019 W/g to 0·0028 W/g when the temperature of the thermal treatment was increased from 400°C to 450°C. Strength measurements showed that the addition of sieved quartz sand increased the compressive strength of the mortars, compared with a pure hydraulic cementitious binder, from 10·3 MPa to 13·5 MPa after 3 d, from 12·9 MPa to 16·7 MPa after 7 d and from 19·4 MPa to 22·5 MPa after 28 d of hydration.",

In addition, the effect of possible components in the water phase is studied and results are compared with those of the water phase. Results indicate that it is the addition of cationic emulsifier lignin-amine that retards cement hydration, prolongs its induction period and reduces maximum hydration heat. However, non-emulsifier alkylphenol polyoxyethylene and hydrochloric acid only reduce maximum heat. No significant differences exist in terms of calcium hydroxide content and non-evaporable water content between the plain cement paste and cement paste with the aforementioned chemical components. Zeta potential results show that the adsorption of lignin-amine on the cement grains is quite different from that of superplasticiser. Although cement hydration and calcium hydroxide crystal growth are retarded with the addition of lignin-amine, calcium hydroxide crystals are fully developed and thus show a strengthened diffraction peak.",

The microstructure of samples at different depths was analysed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The calcite content and hardness of samples at different depths were also verified. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction evolution and cross-section evolution of porosity at different depths were demonstrated by X-ray computed tomography. The experimental results indicate that calcite could be formed at different depths with the use of microbe cement. Compared with the structure of the lower region of the sample, fugitive dust particles cemented with microbe cement in the upper region were found to be more dense, of lower porosity and with more calcite formed. The calcite content and hardness significantly decreased with an increase in sample depth: at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mm, the respective calcite content was 10·51%, 8·32%, 4·93% and 1·70% and the hardness was 18·2 GPa, 17·1 GPa, 10·9 GPa and 3·6 GPa. 3D reconstructions and cross-section evolutions of porosity at different depths indicate that the inner structure of the sample was not uniform, with the structure of the upper region better than that of the sample bottom.

    "abstract": "Modern concrete construction involves the use of a variety of special concretes. While the design of such concretes accounts for the achievement of characteristics such as high strength, toughness, flowability, shrinkage compensation and so on, one aspect that is not sufficiently addressed is the heat evolution in such concretes. This can be of particular importance when the concrete mix uses a large amount of cementitious materials. Furthermore, heat development can also be a major problem for regular mixes when the concrete is not properly optimised for the composition and content of the binder. This paper reports on an extensive experimental investigation, using an adiabatic calorimeter that was developed in-house, on heat development in two categories of concretes – special high-strength concretes with compressive strengths of 60–100 MPa and ordinary regularly used concretes with strengths of 30–50 MPa. The relevant hardened properties of the concretes were also evaluated and compared. The results indicate that heat development is a serious issue in high-strength concretes, while suitable selection of materials for ordinary concretes can lead to a major reduction in the level of heat evolution in the early stages.",

Based on MOSC modified with low-calcium fly ash (L-FA), high-calcium fly ash (H-FA) and granulated blast-furnace slag (G-BS), the effects of L-FA, H-FA and G-BS and silica fume (SF) double mixing on the properties of MOSC were studied by characterising the compressive strength, water resistance, hydration heat, hydration products and micropore structure characteristics. The modification mechanism of the mineral admixtures was also investigated. The results showed that L-FA, G-BS and SF double mixing optimised the hydration product composition and the micropore structure of the MOSC, thus improving its compressive strength and water resistance. The hydration reaction rate of MOSC and 5.1.7 phase content in the hydration products was increased by H-FA and SF double mixing, but the micropore structure was not further optimised, which is why the water resistance of MOSC with H-FA and SF was not improved. The research results enrich the basic theory of mineral admixtures for improving the properties of MOSC and provide theoretical guidance for practical applications.",

The relationships among water permeability, porosity and wave velocity of cement mortar were also investigated and it was found that the permeability coefficient of cement mortar increases exponentially with an increase in the s/c ratio. It was also found that there is a critical s/c ratio range (around 5–6), at which the porosity and wave velocity change remarkably. When the critical s/c ratio is exceeded, the critical seepage pressure is reached and seepage failure occurs.

    "abstract": "The mutual inhibition effect of transport of sulfate and chloride in concrete specimens was determined in a macroscopic experiment. A higher concentration of sulfate has a better inhibition effect on chloride transport and the opposite is also true. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to explore the effect of concentration (0, 0.5, 1.0 mol/l) on the transport of mixed solutions (sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 )) in the main hydration products of aluminium-doped cement-based materials (i.e. calcium–aluminium–silicate–hydrate (C–A–S–H) gel). Sulfate was found to promote the aggregation of other ions to form ion clusters, which can reduce the effective width of the channel entrance and create a ‘necking’ effect, thus reducing the overall transport rate of the solution. With the increase of sodium chloride concentration, sulfate ions in the mixed solution can adsorb more Na + and Cl − ions, and then form larger ion clusters to block the nanopores. Moreover, with increasing sodium sulfate concentration, a higher amount of sulfate ions existing in the solution makes it possible to form more ion clusters. The results can provide a reasonable nanoscale explanation for macroscopic experiment.",

Alkali activation of a low-calcium fly ash (FA) binder with slag replacements at 30% and 50% by mass was evaluated. The reactivity and compressive strength gain of the activated binders were evaluated using activating solutions with different sodium hydroxide molarities (SHMs). An increase in SHM produced a higher compressive strength of the activated binder. The primary reaction product formed in the activated binder was calcium silicate hydrate with aluminium substitution (C-(A)-S-H). An increase in SHM led to an increase in C-(A)-S-H content and a reduction in porosity. The slag contributed to early reactivity of the binder and the initial strength development, while the FA contributed to the later age strength by silica enrichment of the C-(A)-S-H. While increasing the SHM produced an increase in early reactivity, the sodium did not directly contribute to the formation of the reaction product. The sodium from the alkaline activator was not chemically bound to the C-(A)-S-H and could be removed by leaching in water. An increase in basicity with SHM enhanced the contribution of the low-calcium FA, leading to higher silica enrichment of the C-(A)-S-H.",

This is very useful for controlling concrete casting in real structures, detecting problems and developing solutions on time. Concrete rheometers used for measuring the rheological parameters of concrete are expensive, not always available and can lead to measurement disparity. To overcome these issues, an effective method is to analyse concrete flow phenomena physically and solve the problem analytically based on L-box measurements. In the first part of this work, fresh concrete was considered as a homogeneous yield stress fluid moving under the effect of its self-weight. By developing momentum equations for an incompressible fluid, a theoretical approach was used to study three probable final shapes depending on the concrete rheology. Expressions were established for predicting the final shape and the yield stress. In the second part, the results obtained were compared with those of previous models and good agreement was found, thus validating the proposed approach. This study provides a consolidation of rheometer results, allowing evaluation and perhaps a calibration to reinforce their validity.",

    "abstract": "Cement–sodium silicate grout (CSG) is widely used to control water inrush disasters, and its apparent viscosity considerably impacts its water-plugging effect. However, traditional grouting materials and methods are inappropriate for high-temperature environments as high temperatures can affect the grout's viscosity. To thicken grout and increase its apparent viscosity, viscosity-modifying admixtures can be used. In this work, two types of bentonite (calcium bentonite (Ca-B) and sodium bentonite (Na-B)) and hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose (HEMC) were used to modify CSG and laboratory tests were performed to evaluate the fluidity, gelation time and rheology. The results showed that both bentonites and the HEMC decreased fluidity and prolonged the gelation time. HEMC, Ca-B and Na-B decreased the fluidity by 46.8–60.4%, 12.5–31.5% and 17.7–39.1%, respectively, at different temperatures. HEMC, Ca-B and Na-B increased the gelation time by 23.8–50.1%, 23.3–71.4% and 20%–57.1%, respectively. Bentonite can partially resist high temperatures and improve the apparent viscosity of grout owing to its water-absorption capacity. Conversely, HEMC has a negative effect on apparent viscosity, which is attributed to the formation of a complex microstructure resulting from intermolecular cross-linking between the cement particles and HEMC, preventing the connection of sodium silicate.",

With different amounts of NFA (25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by weight) replaced with FRAP aggregates, the mechanical qualities of the mortar mix deteriorated. To counteract this, jarosite – a waste from the zinc industry – was used as a partial replacement for cement (replacements of 5%, 10% and 15%). The jarosite improved the microstructural, mechanical and shrinkage properties. For example, compared with the control mix (100% NFA), the mix containing 25% FRAP aggregates showed a 5.5% reduction in hardened density and a 14% reduction in compressive strength. With the addition of 10% jarosite, there was an increase of 4.85% in hardened density and 7% in compressive strength with respect to the mix containing 25% FRAP aggregates. It is thus suggested that 10% jarosite is used when FRAP aggregates are used to make cement mortar mixes. A cost analysis was also performed. The findings of this work are expected to inspire rational mix design recommendations for mortar mixes including FRAP aggregates, as well as bringing environmental and economic benefits by reducing carbon dioxide footprints.",

    "abstract": "In recent years much work has been undertaken to try to understand the mechanical effects of leaching by water on cement paste. One of the major problems is the kinetics of the degradation, which is too slow to allow observation of any significant mechanical effects during the time frame of an experiment. This study attempts to compare the chemical and mechanical results of the migration test on an ordinary Portland cement paste with those from the flowing water test on a C 3 S hydrated paste. Cracks are only observed with the migration test, and seem to be caused by the structural transformation associated with the Ca/Si decrease in C-S-H or by silica gel precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Previous work by the Authors has shown that small gypsum additions to compacted PFA—lime mixes lead to enhanced compressive strength during high-temperature (95°C) curing but that gypsum contents in excess of an optimum level result in a fall in strength. This strength variation is related to the nature of the reaction product formed. At low gypsum concentrations this is principally a fibrous and foil-like C-A-S-H gel; at high gypsum concentrations it is predominantly a colloidal sulphate-containing C-A-S-H product. In the current work the porosity and pore-size distribution of compacted high-temperature cured PFA—lime mixes of varying gypsum content have been determined, and the water absorption and drying shrinkage have been measured. The presence of gypsum leads to a reduction in overall porosity of the cured dry material. At low gypsum contents the pore-size population consists of pores predominantly in the 4-50 nm region, whereas for high gypsum contents porosity shifts towards pore sizes in excess of 500 nm. Also, drying shrinkage is observed to increase rapidly with increasing gypsum content. The observations support the hypothesis that at high gypsum concentrations the formation of a colloidal sulphate containing C-A-S-H product leads to increased water absorption, enhanced drying shrinkage, coarsening of pores and a reduction in strength.",

Four 10-year-old cement pastes were subject to detailed examination of their chemistry: OPC, OPC + 15% microsilica, HAPC (high alkali Portland cement), and HAPC + 15% microsilica. The solid phases were analysed by analytical electron microscopy (AEM), thermogravimetry and X-ray diffraction. The aqueous phase was characterizedfor its content of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Si, Al and SO 4 . AEM showed considerable variation in the Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H within paste samples, indicating persistent compositional disequilibrium. Ca/Si ratios were noticeably lower in the silica-modified pastes, although the mean values were not statistically different; 1·54 ± 0·21 in OPC, compared to 1·36 ± 0·19 in OPC + 15 % microsilica. The presence of microsilica also favours the formation of AF t at the expense of AF m , some of this AF t being relatively Si-rich. Soluble alkali is considerably reduced in the silica-modified pastes owing to the increased amounts of low ratio C-S-H from pozzolanic reaction. Thermodynamic modelling of the aqueous phase shows, in general, good agreement between observed and predicted solubilities. Two areas of weakness were identified: solid solution phenomena may significantly alter the solubility properties of host phases; there is also a lack of a robust thermodynamic model for C-S-H in cement pastes.",

The mechanism of attack was similar for the different cements: initial attack on the hydrated calcium aluminates produced AFt and AFm phases, and subsequent attack on calcium hydroxide resulted in the formation of gypsum. Incorporation ofpfa reduced the rate of attack, due to the finer pore size distribution of the paste, and the formation of Afm in preference to Aft.

    "abstract": "The results of leaching tests are one of the criteria used to evaluate the performance of cementitious materials for stabilisation/solidification of hazardous wastes. The action of water is of special importance due to its effect on the integrity of the cement solid phases. Likewise, the degraded material originated by the water action may facilitate the transport of toxic components from the material to the environment. Therefore, there is an interest in determining the material behaviour under the long-term action of water in representative conditions of a real storage scenario, in particular where radioactive waste storage times of 300 years or more are needed. During this time, the stabilised waste should maintain its properties. In the present paper a new leaching method to test the performance of concretes for long-term behaviour under natural water interaction is presented. An open system and a system of continuous running of natural water flowing at a fixed rate have been used. The system has been applied to test high- and ultra-high performance concretes for over a year. It gives different results to those previously reported using demineralised water or acid solutions. The method was developed to represent real scenarios in contact with granitic groundwater.",

Comparison of the two methods is also made on the basis of a review of the published data. The conduction calorimeters used, which are of the Wexham Developments type, have the capability of measuring heat evolution rates between 10 μW and 200 mW for sample weights in the range 0·1 to 50 g over periods from a few hours up to several weeks. Tests have shown that rates can be measured with an error of less than 1%. The error in the measurement of total heat evolved was less than 1% from 1 J to 10 kJ. The calorimeters have been used successfully between 5 and 60°C. Excellent agreement has been obtained with the heat of solution method but with standard deviations 3 to 5 times lower. It is shown that conduction calorimetry can provide a viable alternative to the heat of solution method for measuring the heat of hydration of hydraulic cements. It is less laborious, more precise and measurements can be continued up to 7 days, and in many cases up to 28 days. It can also provide valuable data on heat evolution rates at early ages.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) is an important accelerator in cement chemistry. The early age hydration of cement was studied in the presence of synthetic C–S–H of different Ca/Si ratios and in different morphologies. Compressive strength, isothermal conduction calorimetry, zeta potential and inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy were employed to investigate the acceleration efficiency. Results show that the extent of the acceleration was dependent on the amount, the morphologies and the chemical composition of the C–S–H, but not in a linear way; however, the acceleration efficiency was closely related to the specific surface area. It is suggested that the specific surface area is the main indicating factor for the acceleration efficiency. The induction period of cement hydration was shortened because the rate and the degree of dissolution of cement were increased while the secondary nucleation process energy of C–S–H was decreased. This paper provides an understanding of the effect of synthetic C–S–H of different Ca/Si ratios and morphologies on cement hydration and also sheds new light on the optimising effect of synthetic C–S–H on cement-based materials.",

These include nitrogen oxides (NO x ) reduction, co-combustion, supercritical steam technology and oxy-fuel combustion. The nine FA samples examined from these technologies were characterised physically, chemically and in terms of their reactivity. Tests were also carried out to determine the consistence (slump) and compressive strength of FA concretes. Comparisons were made with a selection of reference FAs, the requirements of BS EN 450-1 and reported FA studies from the 1980s and 1990s. The results indicated that, for some technologies, the FA tended to be coarser and of higher loss on ignition (co-combustion and in-combustion NO x reduction) while, for others lower carbon contents were found (supercritical steam) or there was little obvious effect. FA chemistry was slightly affected in some cases, but mainly as expected for the coal being used. There was general agreement between water requirement and activity index with FA fineness for the materials tested. For the FA concretes, similar effects were noted in terms of the dosage of superplasticising admixture needed for a target slump and compressive strength. The behaviour of the materials from the new technologies was found to be similar to that reported in earlier studies on FA and suggests suitability for their use in concrete construction.",

A multi r-range analysis approach has been used, where the 3–5 nm r-range allows the crystalline phase contents to be determined and the 0·16–3·5 nm is used to characterise the atomic ordering in the nanocrystalline components. Quantitative phase contents have been also derived from these analyses. Specifically, five stoichiometric ye'elimite pastes with variable anhydrite and water contents have been prepared. For the pastes without anhydrite addition, ettringite was not present and two calcium aluminium monosulfate phases were required for good PDF fits. In addition to crystalline calcium aluminium monosulfate (AFm) (c ≈ 2·86 nm), a nanocrystalline AFm phase with a significantly smaller c-unit cell parameter value, c ≈ 2·68 nm, was required, having about a 6 nm particle size. For a paste obtained with 31 wt% of anhydrite addition, the main crystalline phase was ettringite with the aluminium hydroxide having a nano-gibbsite local structure with quite a small average particle size, ≈3·5 nm.",

    "abstract": "Crystallisation attack is claimed to be a principal reason for failure of and damage to concrete structures in saline and offshore areas. A degradation mode, dividing the degradation process of concrete into four steps, is presented to describe the destruction process and mechanisms of piles subjected to crystallisation attack. A theoretical model for predicting the service life of a concrete pile is proposed, taking both the environmental factors and pile properties into consideration. Laboratory tests of fully or partially immersed concrete specimens are performed to reveal the degradation process and to validate the proposed model. Furthermore, a case study is conducted to analyse the factors that influence crystallisation attack. The results show that the proposed model exhibits good agreement with experimental results and gives a satisfactory prediction. The case study indicates that the sulfate concentration, solar radiation and depth of the groundwater are the key environmental factors that influence the service life of piles. An increase in concrete cover thickness can improve the ability to resist crystallisation attack and hence enhance the service life of concrete structures. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of predicting the service life of concrete piles under crystallisation attack.",

The ternary cementitious system (TCS), which contains ordinary Portland cement, calcium aluminate cement and gypsum, causes rapid hardening and displays high strength, and hence can be used as a building repair material. However, the hydration products of the TCS contain a large amount of ettringite, calcium hydroxide and calcium aluminate hydrate, which can be easily corroded by the inorganic ions in seawater. Owing to its pozzolanic activity and ability to bind chloride, slag is added to the TCS. The content of slag in the TCS is a critical factor; hence, the effects of 0–35 wt% slag on the compressive strength, mass change, apparent porosity, and free and total chloride content of TCS immersed in seawater are investigated. The systems with slag show a higher compressive strength than the TCS in seawater, and the reduction in compressive strength of the system with 25 wt% slag is only 14·14% after 180 d. Also, the addition of slag significantly reduces the free and total chloride content of the TCS immersed in seawater. The optimum amount of slag in the TCS is determined to be about 25 wt%.",

Until now, little has been known about the effect of synthesis conditions and post-synthetic treatments of LiAl-LDH on the performance of CSA cement. The present work shows two methods for the synthesis of LiAl-LDH – a solvothermal method and a separate nucleation and aging steps method (SNAS) – and two methods for the post-synthetic treatments of LiAl-LDH, with and without drying process. The effect of the resultant LiAl-LDH on the performance of CSA cement was studied in relation to the strength, hydration process and products. Results indicate that specimens containing LiAl-LDH showed a greatly enhanced performance with regard to setting time and compressive strength at early and later ages. Compared to LiAl-LDH prepared with the solvothermal method, LiAl-LDH from SNAS synthesis is more effective to increase the compressive strength and shorten setting time. Moreover, the post-synthetic treatments affect the performance of LiAl-LDH. LiAl-LDH without a drying process has better dispersion stability, higher compressive strength and a shorter setting time. Owing to the crystal seed effect, LiAl-LDH enhanced the hydration rate and improved the amount of hydration products, resulting in a higher compressive strength.",

X-ray diffraction and carbon hydrogen nitrogen sulfur-oxygen elemental analysis were conducted on both cements, and variations in the elemental and phase percentages were observed. The number of pores in OPC-53 was 4·51 times greater than that in PPC at 800°C. Additionally, relatively small pore radii ranging from 2·54 μm to 34·80 μm were observed for OPC-53 at 400°C; however, PPC contained pores with radii ranging from 2·54 μm to 67·23 μm.

In this study, this drawback was improved by clinker mineral design. Alite (C 3 S) in Portland cement clinker was used as a seed crystal to induce new C 3 S in CSA clinker. The role of the introduction of C 3 S and the effect of commonly used CSA admixtures on the setting time and hydration properties of alite-modified CSA (AMCSA) are described in this paper. Due to the hydration characteristics of C 3 S, it was found that its introduction effectively improved the bond strength of the mortar and the strength growth persistence in middle and late stages. Commonly used CSA admixtures (e.g. lithium carbonate and boric acid) had the same effect on the setting time and hydration properties of the AMCSA mortar. The addition of lithium carbonate accelerated the cement hydration rate and shortened the setting time, which is beneficial for super early strength of mortar and enabled compressive strengths of up to 4·67, 9·10 and 22·49 MPa at 30 min, 1 h and 4 h, respectively. The addition of boric acid retarded the cement setting time due to a reduction in the hydration rate.",

The fibres used were 12 mm long and the volume fraction varied from 0.3 kg/m 3 (0.03%) to 2.7 kg/m 3 (0.30%). Autogenous, unrestrained and restrained drying shrinkage tests were performed and it was found that the addition of these fibres influenced the different shrinkage behaviours. A significant reduction in autogenous shrinkage was observed in the specimens with 2.7 kg/m 3 of CF, especially in the first few hours of curing. Regarding the unrestrained drying shrinkage, the addition of 2.7 kg/m 3 of CF led to only a slight improvement (by about 8.5%) and lower fibre contents had little or no influence. The addition of PPF slight reduced the unrestrained drying shrinkage (by about 8.13%) for all the evaluated fibre contents. Both fibres delayed the development of cracks and reduced crack opening during the restrained drying tests. The addition of 2.7 kg/m 3 of PPF or CF delayed cracking by 23% and 18%, respectively. The results indicate that discrete CF can be potentially used to restrain the autogenous and drying shrinkage of cementitious materials.",

The effect of replacing limestone with 10 wt% slag on the formation of incipient belite and precursors of the clinker liquid in the temperature range 600–1050°C was quantified using thermogravimetry, X-ray diffraction and equilibrium calculations. The results showed that when calculating the lime saturation factor, slags were favoured to sand, resulting in lower amounts of quartz and C 2 S in the samples containing slag than the reference sample. This suggests that silicon dioxide in slag minerals did not react in this temperature range. The multi-component equilibrium results supported the phase formation sequence established. Allowing for the possible kinetic influences the potential solids solutions offered with the software was a valuable asset. The results showed that the effect of using slags to reduce the carbonate and sand content in a raw meal on potential amounts of incipient C 2 S was negative. At present, more detailed knowledge is needed regarding how blast-furnace slag and basic oxygen furnace slag contribute to the formation of intermediary compounds such as incipient C 2 S, C 3 A, C 2 F and C 4 AF in the solid phase at temperatures over 1050°C and affect the formation of C 3 S.",

In this paper, the effects of Ti on the mineral composition and solid solution characteristics of white Portland cement clinker were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Rietveld quantitative analysis.

Ti elements tended first to be solid soluble in the intermediate phase, then C 2 S, and finally C 3 S. The content of Ti in α′ H -C 2 S was higher than that in β-C 2 S. With the increase of titanium dioxide content, the calcium–silicon ratio of C 2 S decreased first and then increased. In silicate minerals, Ti 4+ replaced Si 4+ to form titanate [TiO 4 ]. The Ca 2+ ion in α′ H -C 2 S was placed in a more electronegative environment, resulting in a larger binding energy of electrons in the 2p orbit.",

    "abstract": "Shrinkage of hardened cement paste is a direct result of its desorption isotherm. The relationship between the desorption isotherm and the relative humidity in a hydrating cement paste is mainly controlled by the pore size distribution (nanopores to micropores). There are several hydration models to describe the microstructure of cement paste, but the desorption isotherm and self-desiccation are not direct outputs from those models as they are usually given as constitutive inputs. In this study an attempt was made to fill this gap by predicting the sorption isotherm, the drying shrinkage and the self-desiccation of cement paste directly from the evolution of its microstructure. A simple hydration model was developed to predict the microstructure of Portland cement pastes, as well as the nanostructure of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), considering its densification during cement hydration. Predictions from the model were compared with some recent experimental findings from studies in the literature where the influence of the water-to-cement ratio was evaluated. The main contribution of this work is the integration of nanoscale and microscale material models towards determining the macroscopic properties of cement paste.",

The results of calcium carbonate content and porosity indicated that bacteria could regulate the mineralisation gradient at the surface of CBMs. Numerical calculations and experimental measurements were also conducted for further verification.",

An experimental study on the chemical and mineral composition of cement paste before and after PSE was conducted. The results indicate that a small part of the alkali contained in the samples was excluded during PSE, depending mainly on the alkali concentration in the pore solution. Due to the expulsion of interlayer water in calcium silicate hydrate under high pressure, PSE reduced the bound water content (measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)). The portlandite content determined by TGA was not affected by PSE, but it led to an overestimation of portlandite by means of quantitative X-ray diffraction, because of the enhanced preferred orientation of the (001) plane under the applied high pressure. In addition, the size of the portlandite crystals decreased to some extent due to the creep caused by pressure. The content of the hemicarbonate phase was found to decrease slightly after PSE, which may be due to increased solubility under high pressure.",

Standardisation of these cements is imminent under BS EN 197-5:2021. Detailed understanding of the hydration and microstructure evolution of LTCs from different alumina-rich supplementary cementitious materials exists in the scientific literature; improved reaction kinetics and additional phase assemblages refine the pore structure. However, understanding of the performance of LTCs under exposure conditions is less prevalent. In this contribution, the available data are reviewed in a way that allows stakeholders to appreciate the capabilities of the different compositions and their performance. The focus is a critical examination of the interplay between cement composition and microstructure and its effect on durability. It is demonstrated that LTCs offer a pathway for reducing the embodied carbon dioxide of concrete without compromising their performance. Resistance to chloride ingress, sulfate attack and alkali–silica reactions are significantly improved in a manner similar to binary cements. Compared with ordinary Portland cement, carbonation and freeze–thaw resistance are generally lower, but adequate air entrainment can offer an improvement in freeze–thaw resistance. The challenge to widespread adoption of LTCs is evidence of durability under field conditions. To this end, large-scale field trialling is recommended to gain understanding of the role of combined exposures on the durability and mechanical properties of LTCs.",

In the samples, 5%, 15% and 25% (by weight) of the Portland cement is replaced with additive. The specimens are then hardened for 28 days in water and then soaked in a 5% sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 ) solution for 6 months at 4°C. It is estimated that under normal conditions, opoka decreases the compressive strength of cement stone. A decrease in strength is the result of the slow pozzolanic reaction; moreover, part of the pozzolana carbonate component acts as an inert filler. In this study, however, pozzolana additive increased the compressive strength of samples after treatment for 3 months in a 5% sodium sulfate solution at 4°C. This effect is related to the ongoing pozzolanic reaction and the formation of a greater amount of calcium silicate hydrates. With increasing maintenance of samples for up to 6 months in a 5% sodium sulfate solution, it is found that pozzolana promotes the formation of thaumasite. This process is initiated by calcite, which is an integral part of pozzolana, and there is a greater formation of calcium silicate hydrates in samples with opoka.",

The Ca(OH) 2 content and composition of pore solution of GGBFS pastes were also determined. The experimental results show that the dissolution rate of the vitreous phase of GGBFS increases significantly with increases in alkalinity of the SPS. The hydraulic activity of GGBFS is relatively low and hydration of GGBFS mainly takes place slowly after 7 days in GGBFS–5%CaO–water paste. In contrast, the hydration rate increases dramatically in the first 3 days. Meanwhile, large amounts of hydration products (mainly C–S–H gel and C 2 ASH 8 ) are generated, indicating the enhancement of hydraulic activity of GGBFS even in low alkaline solution.",

The electrical conductivity of carbon fibre-reinforced cement changes according to the frequency of the alternating current. Tests on samples with fibre fractions below the percolation threshold show similar change pattern in the impedance–frequency curve. The trend of decreasing impedance with increasing frequency becomes less marked as the carbon fibre content increases. An equivalent circuit model of carbon fibre-reinforced cement has been proposed to describe the electrical performance based upon the experimental results. Moreover, using linear regression the correlation coefficients were analysed to show the rationality of the model.

The results show that both the HEMC and the EVA retard the formation of ettringite and postpone the time to reach maximum ettringite content. However, the stability of ettringite is enhanced and the conversion of ettringite to monosulfate (AFm) is delayed by these two organic admixtures to retain a higher ettringite content in cement pastes at later hydration time. With calcite powders contained in EVA as the anti-blocking agents, the formation of two AFm phases, hemicarboaluminate and monocarboaluminate, is promoted by EVA after 3 d of hydration. Accordingly, more types of calcium aluminate hydrates coexist in the cement paste modified with EVA than in the control paste or in cement paste modified with HEMC. Also, having been synchronously mixed in the cement paste, these two organic admixtures have obvious superposition effects on the formation and evolution of calcium aluminate hydrates.",

The influence of the anionic copolymer emulsifier on the properties of the polymer microspheres was assessed and the fluid loss performance of cement slurries modified by ZJD-220 was evaluated. The ratio and amount of AMPS and SSS were found to have an obvious influence on the characteristics of the polymer microspheres, whose particle size distribution was uniform and monodisperse. The ZJD-220 had excellent thermal resistance and a typical core–shell structure. The fluid losses of freshwater- and salt-based cement slurries (18% sodium chloride) modified with ZJD-220 were controlled within 43 ml and 75 ml, respectively, when the mass fraction of ZJD-220 was 3·0% of the total mass of cement under an ultra-high temperature of 200°C (bottom-hole circulating temperature). Evaluation of the performance of ZJD-220 mixed into different kinds of cement systems with other additives showed that ZJD-220 has good compatibility with different cement slurry systems and additives. Cement slurry with added ZJD-220 showed excellent ability to control filter loss due to the ‘adsorption, bridge-building, film-filling and plugging’ synergistic reaction of the ZJD-220 filling gaps between cement particles and the filter cake pores.",

The results show that the hydration reaction rate of C 3 A paste at the initial stage (0–2 h) was promoted by the incorporation of SPs, especially in the C 3 A–SNF paste. Hydration was rapidly reduced at the early stage (2–12 h), but an acceleration in C 3 A–SNF/PCB pastes occurred again at the late stage. The morphology of the C 3 A–SNF/SAF paste changed from thin needle-shaped crystals at the initial stages to thick and coarse rod-like crystals at late stages. In the C 3 A–PCB paste, very few crystals occurred at an early age, while a large amount of prismatic crystals were observed at the later age. Chemical environment studies revealed that the SPs did not visibly change the position or shape of the characteristic bands of aluminates, but only influenced their relative intensities. A predominant resonance, assigned to six-coordinated aluminium as [AlO 6 ] type, was observed for all the pastes with and without SP. The interaction mechanism between SP and C 3 A was also explored.",

Therefore, characterization of the system in relation to the release of ionic wastes through the cement, and consequently the determination of their diffusion coefficients, becomes of strategic importance. Nowadays, diffusion coefficients of some radioactive elements (mainly of Cs + ) can be found in the literature, obtained by natural diffusion tests that are very time-consuming. In the present paper, the calculation of steady-state diffusion coefficients of Cs + , Sr 2+ , Co 2+ and Fe 3+ through concrete has been done by migration experiments. The mutual influence of the diffusion coefficients has also been studied, and transference numbers of the different ions have been calculated. The results have been compared with those obtained by natural diffusion tests, having found for Cs + and Sr 2+ that there is a very good accordance between diffusion and migration tests. In contrast for Co 2+ and Fe 3+ the accordance is not so good, because at migration working conditions they are able to form complex compounds. In consequence, migration tests are reliable for obtaining diffusion coefficients of different elements through concrete, always taking into account the nature of the species that are present at working conditions.",

Monosubstituted calcium aluminosulfate hydrate (monosulfate) (3CaO·Al 2 O 3 · CaSO 4 ·12H 2 O) was the dominant crystalline phase. Other crystalline phases present included ettringite (3CaO·Al 2 O 3 ·3CaSO 4 ·32H 2 O), magnesium aluminate hydroxide hydrate (Mg 4 Al 2 (OH) 14 ·3H 2 O) and calcium aluminate carbonate hydrate (4CaO·Al 2 O 3 ·½CO 2 ·l2H 2 O). The amorphous solids produced include a calcium/iron-rich gel and a magnesium/aluminium/sulfate-rich phase. The calcium/iron-rich gel is the only iron-rich phase observed in the hydrated phase assemblage. SEM indicates magnesium aids in the movement of aluminate from the ferrite phase during hydration, the reason for increased ferrite reactivity. Iron in the ferrite phase exhibits little mobility, since most of the iron is found in residual ferrite grains. SEM also indicates monosulfate can be expansive; a five-fold increase in the lengths of the ferrite grains is observed.",

The results of thermogravimetric analysis show that P FA pastes are more susceptible to inadequate curing with no significant reaction between PFA and Ca(OH) 2 observed in early age pastes nor in pastes stored at low relative humidities (below 80%). For pastes cast at equal water/solid ratios, methanol adsorption studies show that PFA pastes have a larger total porosity than OPC pastes, but with adequate curing the PFA paste develops a more refined pore structure (i.e. smaller volume of large pores). However, in early age or poorly cured (storage at low humidity following short curing periods) pastes with equal water/solid ratios, those containing PFA may have a considerably coarser pore structure. Generally, for pastes stored at low relative humidity, PFA paste required an additional curing period of one day in order for the volume of large pores (&lt; 36·8 nm dia.) not to exceed that ofOPC paste. A comparison of OPC and PFA pastes cast at the water/solid ratios used in equal strength grade OPC and PFA concretes, show the PFA paste to have a more refined pore structure, even under conditions of poorest curing (i.e. stored at low humidity following demoulding at 24 h).",

Considerable changes in microstructure of the hydrated cement pastes were observed in the presence of PAA as compared with the control paste. The physical properties of mortars containing PAA were also studied. The presence of PAA alone in a paste or mortar did not improve the compressive strength. A combination of metakaolin (MK) and PAA significantly improved the properties of the mortar over those of the mortars containing MK only. Furthermore, the combination of MK and PAA much improved the workability of the mortar thus allowing reduction in the water:cement ratio, while aiding its placement and finishing in the moulds as well as considerably increasing the strength developed. The mechanism by which PAA with and without MK alters the hydration of PC is discussed. Possible reasons for the synergistic effect of MK and PAA combination on the cement hydration behaviour are given.",

At the hydrothermal temperature of 280°C, the reaction between the α-Al 2 O 3 phase-based fibre's surfaces and silicate in the cement slurry was responsible for the development of a moderate bonding at the interfaces between the fibres and the SFCB cement matrix. This development improved fracture toughness to 2·7 times more than that of non-reinforced cements. In contrast, adding α-Al 2 O 3 /mullite mixed phase-based fibres did little to improve the fracture toughness because of the transformation of the mullite into Na-P type zeolite. This mullite → zeolite phase transition was caused by the hydrothermal reaction of mullite with the Na in the cement. This transition generated a strong linkage between the fibres and the matrix; however, it also converted the strong, flexible and tough fibres into fragile, brittle fibres. Correspondingly, cracks generated in the cement composites propagated through the fibres, but not at the fibre/matrix interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The role of the silicate ratio in determining the content of calcium hydroxide liberated in the hydration process and the effect of additives on sulphate attack was evaluated. The resistance of Portland cements with varying silicate ratios and blended cements with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) or fly ash (FA) to sulphate attack was assessed by determining the deterioration factor (DF) and length change caused in mortar specimens with immersion to a 5% sodium sulphate solution. Additionally, microstructural investigations were performed by instrumental analysis (XRD, ESEM, EDS, MIP and DTA). Results of this study indicate that the silicate ratio is more influential than C3A content on sulphate attack resistance. The performance of blended cements was better than that of parent cements and is attributed to the lower calcium hydroxide content of blended cements resultant from pozzolanic reaction.",

    "abstract": "Concrete carbonation is one of the main causes of reinforcement corrosion. Determination of the rate of concrete carbonation can be made by exposing specimens in natural atmospheres; however, as this results in too slow a process, testing is usually made by accelerating the process using atmospheres of relatively high CO2 concentration. No general validation exists on how to extrapolate these testing conditions to real performance. This paper tries to contribute to the understanding of accelerated carbonation testing, by making comparisons between natural and accelerated (5 and 100% CO2) conditions in a set of concretes. The results indicate that accelerated testing changes the ranking of concrete resistance towards carbonation and that therefore, the comparison has to be made among concrete with the same additions. The use of calculation methods (service life models) if properly adjusted with natural tests may be a useful complementary tool. The carbonation velocity, VCO2 derived from the square root law is a very useful parameter to compare concretes in any testing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Structural concrete components undergo degradation when exposed to sulphate-bearing environments. Diffusion of sulphate ions through concrete pores causes the formation of expansive products such as gypsum and ettringite in the internal microstructure of concrete. This chemical change leads to a significant reduction of strength in structural components. In the literature it has been reported that in blended cements, because of the reduction of calcium hydroxide, magnesium sulphate ions directly react with the cementitious calcium—silicate—hydrate (C—S—H) gel and convert this into non-cementititous magnesium—silicate—hydrate (M—S—H) gel. However, in the present investigation it was observed that, in low-strength concrete (20 MPa), blended cements show more resistance than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) because of the pozzolanic and dilution effect of added fly ash and slag. In this concrete, the expansive product, namely gypsum, densifies the porous pore structure and does not cause any cracking. In the case of medium-strength concretes (30 and 40 MPa), the pozzolanic and dilution effects of blended cements are not very significant and hence they did not show any increase in sulphate resistance compared with OPC cement. In these medium-strength concretes because of their pore structure, the expansive products cause micro-cracks. The inferior performance of concretes with blended cements due to magnesium ion attack is mainly attributed to the formation of ettringite and gypsum, as in the case of sodium sulphate, and these cause more micro-cracks in comparison with OPC cement. Thermal analysis also confirms this.",

Ground waste glass with an average particle size of 100 μm was used as cement replacement with a class C fly ash. The influence of waste glass and fly ash combination on the physical properties of cement paste such as the initial and final setting time, volume expansion and water requirement for normal consistency were investigated. The compressive and flexural strength measurements were conducted on the mortar samples at ages of 2, 7, 28 and 56 days. The effect of high temperature at 300, 600 and 900°C on the mortar samples was also investigated. Results indicate that cement paste containing the combination of waste glass and fly ash showed longer setting times than the reference Portland cement. The mortars demanded slightly more water mainly due to the high fineness of the fly ash. It was found that the replacement of Portland cement by a combination of waste glass and fly ash had no remarkable effect on the volume expansion. The mortars containing 5% waste glass + 5% fly ash and 5% waste glass + 10% fly ash satisfy the requirement of strength class 42·5 of the related standard.",

Locally lava sills penetrate the diatomaceous rocks causing their diagenesis. In order to identify the nature of lava and related tuffites and the influence that lava intrusion had on the diatomaceous rocks, X-ray diffraction, scanning electrom microscopy, X-ray fluorescence and light microscopy analyses were performed on representative samples. The original diatomaceous rocks are mainly composed of opal-A in the form of broken diatom frustules and well preserved silicoflagellate skeletons. The affected diatomite beds are characterised as porcelanites containing neoformed opal-CT lepispheres, in expense of opal-A. To utilise the diatomites and porcelanite as pozzolanas, measurements on the Blaine, water demand and compressive strength of cements were carried out. Slightly lower strength was measured in porcelanite cement, due to the higher crystallinity of opal-CT compared to opal-A. However, both rocks improve the pozzolanic cement properties compared to that currently produced, using glassy tuffs.",

The chromium calcium hydroxide hydrate was more inclined to form in some pores of the pastes. The presence of chromium and lead resulted in the formation of more ettringite, and the content of ettringite in all doped hydrated pastes, especially the chromium-doped pastes, was much higher than in undoped pastes at the age of 3 d; this content increased as the dosage increased.",

In order to determine the segregation of expanded polystyrene concretes, a class of tests was conducted, and relevant indices including strength, fluidity and the extent of segregation were measured. Compressive strengths in different directions and different volume fractions were employed to define the strength anisotropy index and the segregation index, respectively. The fluidity test results indicated that the miniature slump cone test could be performed as a substitute for the standard slump cone for practical and economic reasons. The fluidity had larger impact on the strength of expanded polystyrene concretes compared with plain concretes. In addition, an approximately linear correlation was found between the segregation and the strength anisotropy index. By comprehensive inspection of the fluidity, strength and extent of segregation of expanded polystyrene concretes, the most reasonable mixture proportion was found. By considering segregation inhibition in the design of mixture proportions, the proposed experimental method can be used in engineering practice relating to expanded polystyrene concretes.",

The transverse relaxation time (T 2 ) distribution curve and CPMG echo train of the cement slurry systems were first obtained. Then, the initial hydration process of grade G oil well cement and microfine cement was characterised by using the peak area and the value and distribution of T 2 .

The hydration products of blended cement were characterised by TGA, XRD and scanning electron microscopy to explain the influence of calcined products on cement hydration. The results showed that calcination treatment destroyed the structure of illite–kaolinite mixed-layer clays from CFT and enhance pozzolanic activity. Moreover, the highest pozzolanic reactivity was obtained at 850°C because the recrystallisation effect increased chemical stability above 900°C. The impact of calcined CFT on the hydration of cement in a blended system was the combination of micro-aggregate effects and the pozzolanic reaction. The experimental results indicated that calcined products of CFT had good pozzolanic activity, which provided the feasibility of large-scale recycling utilisation of CFT.",

Improving the mechanical properties of concrete and developing efficient health monitoring of structures are thus essential tasks to be tackled. The research described in this paper was concerned with the effect of nanofibres on the mechanical properties of concrete as the use of nanofibres such as carbon nanofibres (CNFs) within cementitious materials has been found to be effective in enhancing the mechanical properties of concrete as well as its sensing ability. Most previous works have focused on evaluating the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of nano-reinforced mortar. Only a few studies have attempted to evaluate the mechanical and sensing properties of nano-reinforced concrete made with coarse aggregates. The objective of this work was to fill this gap in the literature by evaluating the mechanical and self-sensing properties of CNF-reinforced concrete (CNFRC). Material tests were conducted on CNFRC cylinders and beams in order to determine the full compressive, tensile and flexural constitutive behaviour, including the post-peak response, as well evaluating the self-sensing capability. The results obtained are valuable for analysis and design of large critical infrastructures employing CNFRC.",

Pore structure is a critical factor that influences the permeability of cement mortar. This study investigated surface fractal dimensions of the pore structure of cement mortars, which were subject to one-time freezing for 7 days after casting. A thermodynamic model was applied to calculate D s on the basis of mercury intrusion porosimetry data. The results show that the pore structures of all specimens exhibit the scale-dependent fractal property, and three distinct fractal regions (I, II, III) are obtained. According to the regression analysis results of fractal dimension and pore structure parameters, it was found that the fractal dimension can characterise the complexity and chaos of pore structure and predict pore size distribution. Based on this, a linear regression between chloride diffusion coefficient (D nssm ) and D s in fractal regions was carried out. The results show that D s of micro pores (region I) have good correlation with D nssm , up to 0.92908, which is more accurate than the porosity. An index of surface fractal dimension is proposed to evaluate the durability of concrete buildings in extremely cold regions.",

These constituents are known to contribute significantly in the formation of clinker mineral phases and, therefore, the jarosite could be an effective mineraliser and activator in the manufacture of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) clinker. This paper highlights the effect of the addition of 0·5–2·0% of typical jarosite in cement raw mixes prepared with different grade limestone samples along with other conventional raw materials. The clinker parameters such as LSF, SM and AM were maintained in the range of 0·92, 2·07–2·18 and 1·01–1·14 respectively. Burnability studies conducted at temperatures of 1300, 1350, 1400 and 1450°C with a retention time of 20 min showed an increase in the rate of lime assimilation and rapid formation of clinker mineral phases. The mineral phase developments and microstructures of laboratory clinkers fired at 1400 ± 5°C were found to be adequate in the presence of the optimum dose of 1·5% jarosite and were comparable to the control clinker (without jarosite addition) prepared at 1450 ± 5°C. The physical performance of the OPC sample thus prepared from the above mineralised clinker showed performance comparable to the control cement. As the jarosite contained heavy elements, a leaching study was carried out by immersing 28 d hardened neat cement cubes in 500 ml distilled water over a period of 24 months in air-tight containers. Leachates such as barium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, zinc, lead and strontium were found to be in negligible amounts.",

    "abstract": "Cement set retarders must assure a predictable time for the cement solidifying at target temperatures to prevent the catastrophic event of cement setting inside a casing and to avoid losses in time and money while waiting on cements with long hardening times. They also must not compromise set cement properties. Calorimetric tests, with sodium lignosulfonate retarder treated at a high pH of 13·4 and temperature of 90°C (SLS-13) revealed a predictable linear change of the class G cement's setting time at temperatures between 50 and 90°C. Comparison of the solid-phase properties of cement hydrated alone or in the presence of several common retarders with those of SLS-13 retarded cement demonstrated that for cements with a similar extent of hydration held at 80°C, SLS-13 improved their compressive strength, decreased the number of voids in the cement body and assured a more compact and less porous morphology. The paper presents comparative thermogravimetric analyses, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy results of the microproperties of cement hydrated in the presence of sodium gluconate, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium salt, sodium lignosulfonate or SLS-13 for 17 h at 80°C.",

A curing agent (hereafter referred to as GSC) is formed by mixing proportions of desulfurised gypsum, steel slag and slag. The strength of the GSC is evaluated by orthogonal tests, enabling it to be optimised. The microscopic features of the hydration products are established by using a scanning electron microscope. The unconfined compressive strengths of soil–GSC and soil–cement mixtures are compared by way of experiments. The strength of GSC is strongly influenced by the amount of steel slag; it exhibits excellent setting time and strength performances. The hydration of GSC behaves similarly to cement. The unconfined compressive strengths of the soil–cement and soil–GSC mixtures increase approximately equally with time, but the early strength of GSC is lower. Additionally, cement can be solidified with GSC by adjusting the GSC mixing ratio or the water–GSC ratio.",

The experimental results indicated that the fractional change amplitude in capacitance of the composite with 0·5% carbon fibre by weight was greatest when the temperature increased from −40°C to 60°C. The fractional change in capacitance with increasing temperature was determined by the change of electron and ion relaxation polarisation. It was found that the reversibility of the temperature capacitance was very good in the heat cycle experiment, and the stability of the temperature capacitance effect was also very good in the constant temperature experiment. Therefore, it was concluded that carbon fibre sulfoaluminate cement composite with 0·5% carbon fibre had the advantage of developing temperature-controlled apparatus, based on its temperature capacitance effect.",

    "abstract": "Loessic sediments, widely distributed in the Argentine plains, are composed mainly of silt particles, transported and accumulated by wind during Quaternary geological times. At that period an important aeolian process took place together with explosive volcanic activity in the western area of the country. The chemical and mineralogical composition of loess and also their pozzolanic behaviour depend upon the predominance of each geological process. The present paper presents a kinetic study of the pozzolanic activity of loessic soils. The kinetics of reaction in loess/calcium hydroxide solution is investigated by means of electrical conductivity measurements and later the kinetic parameters are quantified by applying a kinetic–diffusive model to the process. The kinetic parameters that characterise the process (in particular the reaction rate constant) were determined in the fitting process of the model. The index of pozzolanic activity evaluated according to the obtained values of the reaction rate constant permits the characterisation of the pozzolanic activity of these materials in a rigorous way. The results show the variability and good pozzolanic properties of the loess analysed.",

Gyrolite was synthesised after 48 h at 200°C from a stoichiometric composition (calcium oxide/silica dioxide = 0·66) of calcium oxide and a hydrated silica mixture. Calcium silicate hydrate substituted with cadmium ions (97 mg cadmium ions/g) was added as a partial replacement of the OPC at levels of 0%, 2·5%, 5% and 7·5% by weight of the total cementitious material. Therefore, the water-to-cement ratio of all OPC samples was 0·5. It was found that the additive of a synthetic contaminated with cadmium ions (∼97 mg cadmium ions/g) retained very good adsorption properties for the alkaline and alkaline earth ions that penetrated into the gyrolite structure. It was estimated that this additive accelerates the early stage (5–7 h) of hydration of OPC and its individual compounds. It was found that during the main reaction of calcium silicate, the additive of gyrolite contaminated with cadmium ions had no influence on the apparent reaction rate (W app ) of the hydration process (7–12 h): in all samples, the increase in the degree of hydration (∆α) was almost the same: ∆α = 15%.",

The addition of OS-PCE retarded the hydration process of the cement–SF binder proportionally with the dosage of OS-PCE, but promoted the hydration kinetics of the composite binder. The enhancement in reactivity was attributed to well-dispersed SF by the OS-PCE, which provided more nucleation sites for the reaction of heterogeneous calcium silicate hydrates (C–S–H) and enhanced the contact with water to react with calcium hydroxide forming pozzolanic C–S–H. Well-distributed hydration products were identified in the hardened binder with added OS-PCE, with a large number of hydrated gels uniformly filling the pores and gaps, which densified the hardened structure.",

To study the synergistic effect quantitatively, the hydration heat, hydration products and porosity of cement pastes with different binders were investigated. Test results showed that the synergistic effect between LP and fly ash (FA) or slag (S) improved the hydration degree and increased the total hydration heat of the pastes. When FA or S were incorporated along with LP, the calcium carbonate consumption at 3 days increased from 2.0 wt% to 4 wt%; at 180 days it increased from 2.4 wt% to 9.3 wt% (with FA) and 11.8 wt% (with S). The incorporation of FA or S also increased the diffraction peak of carboaluminate, indicating more carboaluminate was formed. The synergistic effect between LP and SCMs refined the pore structure and reduced the porosity of the cement pastes. The synergistic effect between LP and FA or S increased the density of the cement pastes by 1.04% or 1.41%, respectively, and correspondingly improved the compressive strength of the pastes.",

The early hydration behaviour and mechanical properties of basic magnesium sulfate (BMS) cement were investigated using an electrodeless resistivity test combined with compressive strength measurement, X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. According to the resistivity variation curve, the early hydration process of BMS cement can be divided into three stages (induction period, acceleration period and deceleration period). A linear correlation between resistivity and setting time was established. The initial and final setting times of BMS cement could thus be estimated using two points on the differential resistivity curve – the time when the resistivity growth rate starts to increase and the time of maximum resistivity, respectively. A linear fitting equation between resistivity at 24 h and compressive strength of the BMS cement after curing for 28 days was determined. The correlation coefficient was high (0.9979). Using the equation, the long-term strength (28 days) of BMS cement could be precisely predicted from the measured resistivity at 24 h. This study provides a feasible, accurate and in situ method for understanding the early hydration behaviour and quality monitoring of BMS cement.",

However, the low activity of ITP limits its use as supplementary cementitious materials in large amounts. In this work, the activity of ITP treated for different milling times and at different sintering temperatures was studied, as well as the effects on the properties and microstructure of blended cement. It was found that ITP has a filling effect and provides additional nucleation sites. Additionally, ITP exhibits pozzolanic activity and consumes more hydration products at the later stage, which promotes the formation and deposition of C-S-H. All of these factors are related to the specific surface area (SSA) of the ITP and provide the conditions for cement paste densification, laying a foundation for the strength of cement blended with ITP. In summary, the activity of activated ITP is related to its SSA. It takes a long time for ITP to show pozzolanic activity. Activated ITP undergoes a secondary reaction to form a hydration product. The environmental impact and cost of pure cement pastes were higher than those of the cement–ITP pastes.",

    "abstract": "Recycled aggregates, especially the fine (0–4 mm) fraction, are often contaminated with sulfates coming from gypsum residues on demolition sites. When these aggregates are used in concrete, the sulfates can induce internal sulfate attack which causes expansion of the concrete. European standard EN 206:2013 sets the water-soluble sulfate limit at 0.2% by weight of the aggregate, but other studies suggest this limit could be safely increased. In addition to the sulfate content, other parameters, such as the porosity and alkalinity of the mix, have been shown to influence the swelling results. In this study, different proposed sulfate limits were evaluated on concrete made with 100% fine recycled aggregates (FRA). It was also researched whether the mixing parameters could change the swelling amount regardless of the sulfate content. The results showed that the incorporation of FRA with sulfate contents up to 0.8 wt% is safe when combined with coarse natural aggregates. If coarse recycled aggregates are used in the mix, the sulfate content of FRA can be up to 0.3%. The swelling caused by these sulfate levels was not high enough to be influenced by the porosity or alkalinity of the mix.",

    "abstract": "Fluorine-containing silicon residue (FSR) is a solid waste that is harmful to the environment. A new alkali-free liquid accelerator based on aluminium sulfate (LAFS) was prepared using FSR. The addition of LAFS to cement mortar shortened the setting times and significantly improved the early strength. With the addition of 8% LAFS, the initial and final setting times were 2.48 min and 11.83 min, respectively, and the 1-day compressive strength was 14.6 MPa, which was 200% of that of the mortar without LAFS. The mechanism of the action of LAFS was studied using isothermal calorimetry test, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy and other analytical methods. The results showed that the LAFS rapidly generated a large amount of ettringite and promoted the formation of calcium silicate hydrate in the cement paste. A conceptual model of the early hydration process of cement paste with added LAFS was established based on the analytical results.",

However, the influence mechanism of evaporation on recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) remains unclear. In this paper, the effects of curing temperature (20°C, 40°C, 60°C and 80°C), steam curing time (6 h, 9 h and 12 h) and pozzolans (slag powder and fly ash) on the compressive strength and pore structure of RAC were studied. The microstructure characteristics such as pore size and pore size distribution were analysed by mercury injection porosimetry. The results show that steam curing can significantly improve the compressive strength and reduce the most probable aperture and average pore sizes of RAC. Moreover, the effect of slag powder on RAC pore structure is better than that of fly ash. Also, there is a linear correlation between the compressive strength and the average pore size of steam-cured RAC. This could be an important parameter for constructing future steam-cured RAC strength prediction models.",

A thermochemical high-temperature reconstruction method using lime and bauxite as tempering agents to regulate the mineral phase was investigated in this work. Through an array of tests and analytical techniques, including compressive strength tests, activity index evaluation, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and hydration heat analysis, the impacts of the calcium/silicon mass (CSM) ratio and the sintering temperature on the mechanical properties and activity of reconstituted SSS mortar were examined. It was found that, at a CSM ratio of 4.2 and a sintering temperature of 1290°C, the reconstructed slag demonstrated optimal mechanical properties and activity, yielding compressive strengths of 43.69 MPa and 62.58 MPa at 7 days and 28 days, respectively, with remarkable 28-day activity index of 143.49%. The proposed thermochemical high-temperature reconstruction method ingeniously employs high temperature to increase the content of C 3 S while rapid cooling prevents alteration of the C 2 S crystalline structure. This innovation significantly enhanced the mechanical properties and activity of the SSS, offering promising avenues to increase its utilisation rate.",

Concrete properties such as neutralisation depth, mass change, compressive strength and flexural strength were measured. The compositions of different samples were determined by means of X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis and the microstructure of samples was examined using scanning electron microscopy.

The porosity amount, distribution, grain structure of silicate phase crystals, and equivalent crystal diameters and amounts of meta-schist clinker phases (C 3 S, C 2 S, C 3 A and C 4 AF) examined by polarising optical microscope showed that they are suitable for the production of PC. The hydration products of the cement mortars were determined by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis at 2, 7 and 28 days. In addition, the compressive strength test results of (PC)MSC and (PC)Ref mortars after 28 days of curing ranged between 57 and 55.5 MPa, and the cement produced was classified as CEM I 42.5R.",

The aim of this work was to characterise raw and pretreated açaí fibres and analyse their compatibility with Portland cement by different techniques, alongside developing a CBFB. The fibres were subjected to thermal (180, 200 and 220°C), cold and hot water, alkaline (NaOH) and bleaching (NaOH–H 2 O 2 ) pretreatments. The chemical and water pretreatments raised the fibre crystalline indexes (28–57%). The chemical pretreatments individualised the fibre bundles and removed hemicelluloses. Alkali-pretreated and raw fibres had the highest (96%) and lowest (65%) cement compatibility indexes. Portlandite and ettringite appeared after 24 h for most pastes, but were delayed for raw and 220°C-pretreated fibres. In contrast, only the raw fibre specimens reached the required compression strength of 34 MPa after 28 days; hence, they were chosen to produce a CBFB. The boards showed proper thickness swelling (1.4%), but low bending strength (modulus of elasticity = 647.8 MPa; modulus of rupture = 1.9 MPa). Overall, the fibre modifications improved the compatibility with cement, but not the composite's mechanical strength. Açaí-fibre CBFB is a promising building material, but future studies must overcome its poor mechanical performance.",

The BCSA cement made from the waste materials showed a faster early reaction than the one prepared from natural raw materials. At later ages, both cements developed a similar hydrate assemblage, consisting mainly of ettringite, AFm phases and strätlingite. Also the physical properties, namely compressive strength, porosity and volume stability, were rather similar, with the exception that late compressive strength (after 56 days) was significantly higher for the cement made from waste materials.

Setting on demand, while the workability of the material is retained until placement, is an important aspect. A ternary system comprising CSA (calcium sulfoaluminate cement), OPC (ordinary Portland cement) and C$ (anhydrite) was developed to achieve setting on demand in a two-component setup, where two retarded cementitious components were mixed after specific times of storage. The kinetics of the individual systems and the blend were examined by heat flow calorimetry, quantitative X-ray diffraction and pore water analysis. The rheological development was monitored by a penetration test method. The results showed that the performance of the blend was independent of the storage time of the individual components and could be tailored by changes in the retarder dosage in the individual components. The initial reaction in the blend was characterised by the simultaneous dissolution of ye'elimite and C 3 S, resulting in the formation of ettringite as the sole detectable hydrate phase. The fate of silicon remains unclear as, with the methodology at hand, no silicon-bearing hydrate phase could be identified.",

To solve this problem, an attempt is made in this paper to develop a new low-carbon-dioxide green geopolymer cementitious material that is resistant to sulfate attack. The effect of this geopolymer material on sulfate erosion resistance is investigated in terms of alkali admixture, alkali modulus, water–binder ratio and fly ash admixture. In this paper, the geopolymer materials were tested for sulfate erosion resistance by dry–wet cycle sulfate erosion mechanism. It was shown that the contribution to improving the resistance of geopolymer materials to magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ) attack can be ranked as follows: water–binder ratio &gt; fly ash content &gt; alkali content &gt; alkali modulus. Increasing the alkali admixture, water–binder ratio and fly ash admixture and decreasing the alkali modulus will promote the generation of gypsum in the specimen; Mg 2+ in magnesium sulfate solution makes the volcanic ash reaction products decalcify, and the free Ca 2+ and [SO 4 ] 2− combine to generate gypsum, causing gypsum-type erosion damage in the specimen.",

    "abstract": "In coastal and saline environments, the infiltration of chloride and sulfate ions into cementitious materials can result in erosion and deterioration. This research focuses on the impact of temperature-related curing methods on the ion transport properties and microstructure of these materials. The results show the curing method does not alter the hydration products of cementitious materials. High-temperature curing reduces the content of ettringite, resulting in decreased Friedel's salt and gypsum after chloride ion corrosion. Meanwhile, high-temperature curing reduces the content of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ) and silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ), decreasing the content of gypsum after sulfate ion erosion. This indicates that high-temperature curing reduces the binding capacity of both chloride ions and sulfate ions. High-temperature steam curing also deteriorates the pore structure compared to standard curing. As a result, the resistance of concrete to ion corrosion is reduced under high-temperature steam curing. In addition, the surface ion concentration and binding capacity of chloride ions and sulfate ions both increase with the duration of erosion. At the same erosion age, the binding capacity of sulfate ions is significantly higher than that of chloride ions. This research provides new insights into the transport characteristics of eroding ions under high-temperature steam curing.",

    "abstract": "One of the smart and innovative materials used to produce environmentally friendly energy-saving concrete is temperature dependent phase change (PCM) materials. In this study, the fresh and hardened concrete properties of the mortars including PCM in different ratios (0%, 2.5%, 5%) were investigated experimentally. Rheological properties such as slump-flow, specific viscosity, and yield stress tests were determined at different temperatures (from 20 to 50 °C). Time-dependent physical, mechanical, and thermal properties such as ultrasound pulse velocity (UPV), electrical resistivity, dynamic modulus of elasticity, compressive and flexural strength, thermogravimetric (TGA), and thermal conductivity tests were carried out. According to the experimental findings, the workability and hardened properties of mortars were decreased by using PCM. However, the rheological properties of fresh mortar change depending on temperature due to PCM absorbing the heat. Therefore, the fresh properties of mortar with PCM can be controlled by temperature. It was also found that the phase change of mortars with PCM can be obtained by measuring the electrical or UPV tests at different temperatures.",

Three methods of X-ray quantitative analysis have been developed, and the paper reports on the advantages and limits of each. Method A (area measurement) is the fastest and does not require high-speed computers. However, it requires pure reference materials and does not work for belite whose peaks overlap with those of alite. Method B (a Rietveld analysis using structural models) allows good accuracy, although the quality of refinement is affected by the lack of alite crystal models. Method C (a Rietveld analysis using full pattern matching for alite and a structural model for other phases) gives high-quality refinements but is not adequate to determine the alite content, because of the poor accuracy of the Bogue composition. The three methods give nonconflicting data and they can be used to follow the various stages of hydration of cement phases, in particular alite and belite, and to investigate (i) xonotlite formation, and (ii) pozzolanic activity, which is associated with a portlandite decrease.",

In the work reported here the effects of silica fume, water/cement ratio, and the varying moisture conditions of the aggregate on the interfacial zone between cement paste and Liapor 8 were investigated. The incorporation of silica fume reduced the porosity and the thickness of the interfacial zone, but in some areas a concentration of Ca(0H) 2 adjacent to lightweight aggregate particles was still visible. The interfacial zone was also improved hy reducing the water/cement ratio due to reduced bleeding. It was the moisture conditions on the aggregate surface, rather than the total moisture content of the aggregate, which was the important factor concerning the microstructure of the interfacial zone.",

The pastes had 0, 20 and 40% VA as cement replacement by mass and water/binder ratios of 0·40, 0·50 and 0·60 by mass. The ACID test was used to calculate the chloride ion diffusion coefficient D i , of pastes using the Nernst–Plank equation for steady state conditions. In addition, electrical resistivity, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were also conducted. Good correlations were found among D i , total pore volume and electrical resistivity of the pastes. The D i of VA blended pastes was within the range of 10 −7 and 10 −9 cm 2 /s. It was also found that blending cement with VA significantly reduced the long-term chloride ion diffusion coefficient and hence increased the long-term corrosion resistance of pastes. This fact was also supported by the presence of lower quantity of Ca(OH) 2 and higher quantity of Friedel's salt in the VA blended pastes as observed from the DSC tests. Pastes with 40% VA showed better performance in terms of chloride ion diffusivity. W/b ratio was also found to affect the D i at the early ages of curing, but became less important at the later ages of curing.",

Single clinker nodules with an average diameter of 10–15 mm were used in the analyses. Porosity ratios and phase compositions were determined on scanning electron microscope images of polished clinker surfaces by using image processing techniques and, in addition, morphological characterisation of interstitial phases was realised. The results showed that the porosity distribution of a single clinker nodule is heterogeneous and a relationship exists between the average interstitial phase thickness and porosity. A dendritic interstitial phase morphology is associated with porous clinker structure. The porosity ratio depends on the degree of dendritic structure formation. Dendritic structures form because local heat transfer conditions produce an undercooled liquid, which produces an unstable liquid-solid interface and crystallites which propagate in front of such an interface become surrounded by a liquid showing an increasing degree of undercooling. As crystalline solids typically occupy space more efficiently than their liquids, the solidification of the interdendritic regions then produces porosity at that stage of cooling. The morphological variations in interstitial phases and porosity may cause differences in the performance of cements produced from these clinkers.",

    "abstract": "Comb-like polycarboxylate is a superplasticiser possessing a high water reducing rate and excellent molecular design, and has been widely used in the concrete industry. Most research studies have adjusted the effect of the superplasticiser by improving the groups on the superplasticiser molecular chain, but few studies have been carried out that change the structure of the comb molecular chain. AB 2 monomer was prepared by the Michael addition reaction of diethanolamine and methyl acrylate, and hyperbranched polymer was prepared with trihydroxypropane as the core. In this paper, an advanced hyperbranched polycarboxylate, which was modified by a hyperbranched polyamine-ester, was designed as a superplasticiser. The hyperbranched polycarboxylic acid superplasticiser has the advantage of improving the rheological properties of cement slurry and the strength of mortar test blocks, compared with the traditional polycarboxylate superplasticiser; this is attributed to the hyperbranched polymers that provide hydroxyl groups and enhance the molecular spatial structure.",

Impedance measurements were obtained over the frequency range 20 Hz–1 MHz and displayed in the Nyquist format. In addition, the permittivity and conductivity were de-embedded from the measured impedance and presented in both time and frequency domains to elucidate the nature of conduction and polarisation processes. It was found that, over a curing period of 90 days, the ECC displayed a classic impedance response. Both conductivity and relative permittivity were found to be frequency dependent due to bulk relaxation processes operating within the composite. Tensile straining was shown to result in a detectable change in the impedance response, but retained a similar overall profile. When presented in the frequency domain, a downward displacement in both conductivity and relative permittivity profiles was evident with increasing tensile strain. It is shown that the relative permittivity at the high-frequency end could be exploited as a potentially useful indicator for strain/damage detection. The influence of microcracking on the piezo-resistive response of the composite is discussed based on crack patterns obtained from both visual observations and digital image correlation.",

The use of dye simulated the leakage of the system to micro-organisms present in the human mouth. The cements showed material porosity but no leakage was observed at the tooth cavity margins. The cement composites were more stable with less dye taken up by the material in comparison with the respective neat cement. Restorations made up of the dental material showed marginal leakage along their walls and along the restoration floor.

However, knowledge about the geochemical features of mineral genesis in the ITZ is still inadequate. The purpose of this paper is to document the consequences of aggregate variation on the geochemical features of the ITZ. Additionally, ITZ geochemistry is discussed as a function of the aggregate, including analytical evidence of microchemistry characterisation in the vicinity of the ITZ for normal-strength concrete. The analysis indicates that the granitic and limestone ITZs studied act as dynamic substances that facilitate ionic diffusion during the hydration process. Both types of ITZ show some degree of variation in Si 4+ and Ca 2+ distribution. The atomic ratio of specific elements in the hydration products also revealed a significant difference between the granitic and limestone ITZs.",

The durability of mortars after electrochemical treatment was evaluated by examining water absorption, carbonation depth, sulfate resistance and chloride diffusion. In addition, microscopic observations were made using scanning electron microscopy, mercury intrusion porosimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicated that the resistances to water absorption, carbonation, sulfate and chloride diffusion were improved by use of the electrochemical technique. The improvement in mortar durability was attributed to the combined actions of densification and the coating layer produced on the mortar surface during the electrochemical treatment.

    "abstract": "The effects of heating temperature, cooling method, re-curing time and water-to-cement ratio (w/c) on the natural restoration of mechanical properties of concrete exposed to high temperature were experimentally studied. The fire-damaged concrete specimens were re-cured in ambient conditions after they had been rapidly cooled in water and naturally cooled in air. Below 500°C, the natural restoration of the compressive strength of water-cooled concrete was more evident than that of air-cooled concrete. The natural restoration of the compressive strength of air-cooled concrete with low w/c ratio was more obvious than that of concrete with high w/c ratio. After being subjected to 500°C and re-cured for 3 months, the splitting tensile strength decreased to below 26% of the initial value. The splitting tensile strength of water-cooled concrete recovered more evidently than that of the air-cooled concrete. The restoration of elastic modulus was mainly affected by the heating temperature and cooling method. The elastic modulus of water-cooled concrete which had been subjected to 200, 300 and 400°C was obviously restored after being naturally re-cured for 3 months. The effects of w/c on the tensile strength and elastic modulus were not significant.",

Aleppo pine wood is a compound of cellulose, hemicelluloses and more than 25% lignin. The latter belongs to the admixture family used as plasticiser in concrete. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the rheological and mechanical properties of mortar containing the coupons of Aleppo pine wood (in liquid form) at different dosages. According to the results, the main rheological parameters of cementitious pastes (shear stress and plastic viscosity) decreased with increasing dosage of waste Aleppo pine. The cementitious pastes containing 5% waste, became more fluid, compared to the reference cement paste (containing 1·0% superplasticiser). Also, compared to the reference mortar prepared with superplasticiser, a decrease in compressive strength of mortars with increasing dosage of Aleppo pine wood was found. However, the resistance values obtained by the mortars (5% of Aleppo pine) were very close and gave a mortar with 30 MPa strength, which is an acceptable value for construction.",

The dispersion quantity, D, is measured by the particle size rather than the free-path spacing between particles. The particle sizes are given in terms of the true length/nm rather than pixels. A Gaussian function is used as the probability density function (PDF) fits a Gaussian distribution better than a lognormal distribution depending on the statistical data and the true diameter of CNTs. Higher D values indicate a better dispersion of CNTs in the matrix. The method works well to quantify the dispersion of particles, especially for filaments such as CNTs, and is simple and useful.",

Using the modified model, this paper predicts the hydration degree of cement paste at different curing temperatures, different water to cement ratios and different curing conditions. The agreement between model predictions and experimental results demonstrates that the modified model is quite effective, especially for the study of the effects of temperature, water to cement ratio and curing conditions on the hydration kinetics of cement paste.",

The activation mechanism of SCMs in cement was also studied. Similar to Portland cement, the addition of SCMs was found to decrease the yield shear stress and viscosity of alite-barium calcium sulfoaluminate paste, prolong its setting time and lower the early compressive strength. It was also found to reduce the shrinkage of alite-barium calcium sulfoaluminate mortar. With an increase in the replacement ratio of slag for fly ash, the yield shear stress and plastic viscosity of paste with SCMs decreased in stages due to the ‘ball bearing' effect of fly ash and the initial and final setting times of paste with SCMs increased, with lime significantly restraining ettringite formation. Owing to hydraulic reactions at a later curing age and the close aggregate packing effect of SCMs, the mechanical properties of paste with SCMs increased significantly. Moreover, it was found that fly ash is activated more effectively than slag in alite-barium calcium sulfoaluminate cement at long-term curing ages, which is different from SCM activation in Portland cement.",

The fluidity and water-reducing ratio of cement paste containing PCE with a long chain weakly depended on the salt dosage, but properties of compressive strength and setting time were strongly influenced by the salt dosage. However, the fluidity, water-reducing ratio, compressive strength and setting time of cement containing PCE with both long and short chains were strongly influenced by alkaline sulfate. PCE with a long side chain has a good compatibility with cement paste. The ionic responsive properties are attributed to the change of the PCE adsorption ratio, which results directly in a variation of the dispersing force of superplasticiser.",

As curing temperature increases the proportion of ettringite-type hydrates decreases, while those associated with monosulphate become more predominant. Sulphate concentrations were about twice as large in the light outer C-S-H as in the dark inner C-S-H for specimens cured at 80°C and, within the hydrate rims of the Hadley grains, the sulphate content at 80°C was about twice that observed at 60°C.",

The combination of calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) and tobermorite phases was responsible for strengthening and densifying the autoclaved cement. At 300°C, an excessive growth of wellformed tobermorite and xonotlite crystals generated an undesirable porous microstructure, causing the retrogression of strength and enhancing water permeability. Although all the phases formed in the autoclaved cements were vulnerable to reactions with H2SO4, so depositing bassanite scales as corrosion product over the cement's surfaces, the C–S–H phase played an important role in retarding the rate of acid erosion. Thus, after the uptake of Ca by the H2SO4, Ca-destitute C–S–H preferentially reacted with the Mg from the slag to form the lizardite phase that not only retarded the rate of acid erosion, but also retained the integrity of the cementitious structure. Therefore, SSAS cement has good potential as an acid-resistant geothermal well cement at temperatures up to 200°C.",

It was found that the additives strongly affected the content and microstructure of the α-hemihydrate, and consequently the properties of its dihydrate. The physical and mechanical properties of the hydrated plaster were investigated in conformity with dental stone (type III). The additives, in an appropriate concentration, favoured the increase in α-hemihydrate phase but they tended to reduce the aspect ratio (c/a axis) of both the α-hemihydrate and its dihydrate crystals. Hence the morphology of the α-hemihydrate changed from long and prismatic towards a short and thick rod, and that of the dihydrate, from a long and thin plate to a small and thick plate. In comparison, the effect of the additives on the FGD gypsum was more drastic, and between the two additives, the effect of succinic acid was stronger.

The simulation without tyre combustion shows a high flame temperature, high NO x emission, and good quality product. Replacing 20% of the total kiln heat with tyres as fuel and dropping them in to the kiln at 50 m from the burner tip results in a reduced flame temperature, a 33% reduction of NO x emission and good clinker quality. Further investigations show that up to 30% replacement of fuel with tyres is acceptable to maintain the clinker quality with reduced NO x emissions. When the tyre replacement is 40% or more, NO x emission can be further reduced, but the clinker quality becomes poor. The tyre drop-in location is another critical parameter. For the kiln studied tyres can be dropped in within 50 m of the burner tip. Further downstream dropping-in reduces kiln efficiency and clinker quality. The actual replacement of tyre combustion and the drop-in location depends on the kiln design and operating conditions. The developed comprehensive simulation tool can be used to reach an optimised kiln design under a specified operating condition.",

The long-term performance of these cement types in extreme conditions such as acidic or basic environments in cold regions may, however, be problematic if the blend includes a large amount of limestone powder. In the present study, the effects of different pH environments on the mechanical performance of limestone-blended cement mortars at normal (20°C) and low (5°C) temperatures were investigated. For this purpose, prismatic mortar samples (40 mm × 40 mm × 160 mm) were prepared with limestone-blended cements (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% limestone powder was replaced by cement) and cured under different solutions (acidic, neutral and basic) at 5°C. In addition, standard curing at 20°C was also performed. Compressive and flexural strength developments of mortars were monitored at different ages and microstructure studies using scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were performed on selected samples. It was concluded that the addition of limestone decreased both the strength and rate of strength development of the mortars at standard conditions. For cold and acidic solutions, the compressive strength loss was more significant than flexural strength loss as the amount of limestone replacement increased. The possible causes of strength loss were investigated using microstructure analysis.",

Their chemical structures and molecular weights were determined by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance and size exclusion chromatography, respectively. Their dispersion ability, adsorption behaviour and retardation effect in cement hydration were investigated. Results of the cement paste tests indicated that the phosphonated small molecule superplasticisers with longer polyether chain and fewer phosphonate groups exhibited better initial water-reducing ability but weaker retarding ability, and those with shorter polyether chain and more phosphonate groups turned out to be more effective in slump-retaining ability and retarding ability. These findings provide useful information for optimising the performance of phosphonated small molecule chemical admixtures in the future.",

    "abstract": "The effect of polycarboxylate superplasticiser (PCS) architecture in terms of a flexible or rigid backbone and repartition of side-chains along the backbone on the hydrodynamic radius, adsorption properties, flow behaviour and rheological behaviour was systematically evaluated. PCSs with different architectures were found to affect the flow behaviour of cement paste differently, mainly due to difference in PCS surface coverage area on cement particle surfaces. The PCS surface coverage area on cement particle surfaces was determined by the adsorption layer thickness of a single PCS molecule and the adsorption amount. The adsorption layer thickness of a single PCS molecule is correlated with the hydrodynamic radius in solution. The PCS with a rigid structure in the main chain had a more coiled conformation, with an inevitably smaller hydrodynamic radius and thus a thinner adsorption layer. The adsorption amount is closely related to the exposed density of carboxylic groups. A more extended solution conformation facilitates the exposure of carboxylic groups, which is beneficial for the adsorption of PCS onto cement particle surfaces. As a consequence, the thicker the adsorption layer thickness of a single PCS molecule and a larger adsorption amount results in larger PCS surface coverage area on cement particle surfaces, producing better workability of cement paste.",

However, the effect of the side-chain length (SCL) in PCSs on the properties of cement-based materials (CBMs) has not gained enough attention. To fill this research gap, five types of PCSs with different SCLs were synthesised through a redox initiator system. The workability, hydration behaviour, microstructure formation and cracking sensitivity of CBMs containing PCSs with different SCLs were thoroughly examined. The results showed that, with an increase in the SCL of the PCS, the initial fluidity of the cement paste increased first and then decreased but fluidity losses decreased gradually. Compared with PCSs with short side-chains, PCSs with long side-chains improved the hydration heat peak value and shortened the dissolution period, thus accelerating the hydration and microstructure formation of cement. The 28 d strength and anti-cracking behaviour of the CBMs increased first and then decreased with an increase in SCL. The results of this study suggest that there is an optimum SCL for PCSs that produces good workability and the lowest crack sensitivity in CBMs.",

The chloride binding capacity and compressive strength of the CAC were also determined. The results showed that the chloride binding capacities of all the CAC samples increased with an increasing sodium chloride content, but the trend of growth gradually slowed. The influence of sodium chloride on the hydration of CAC was found to be highly dependent on its dosage and the curing temperature. At 5°C and 20°C, the early hydration of CAC was accelerated by a small amount of sodium chloride, leading to greater amounts of CAH 10 . Additionally, the pore structure of hardened cement paste was optimised for a higher compressive strength. However, excessive sodium chloride was found to delay the early hydration to some extent. When the curing temperature was increased to 40°C, sodium chloride accelerated the phase conversion, accompanied with an increase of harmful pores and a sharp decrease in compressive strength. The findings indicate a potential application of CAC-based constructions made with sea sand, especially at temperatures below 20°C.",

The addition of limestone powder has a significant influence on the hydration and microstructure of cement paste and therefore affects the strength and durability of concrete. This paper examines the hydration and microstructure of cement paste blended with limestone powder using multiple techniques. The results reveal that when the content of limestone powder is up to 50 wt%, the compressive strength, cumulative heat and portlandite show a significant reduction. However, the addition of limestone powder has no effect on the species of hydration products and pore solution composition in cement paste specimens. The porosity and relative threshold diameter of cement paste samples increase while the pore volume (&lt;50 nm) decreases with the increase in limestone powder content. The total electrical resistance of continuously and discontinuously connected pores in cement paste samples has an exponential relationship with the threshold diameter and a linear relationship with the pore volume (&lt;50 nm) and porosity.",

In this work, copolymers poly(AANa-co-DMAA) with a variation of their charge densities (monomeric molar ratios) were synthesised by aqueous solution polymerisation and characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Then the copolymers were used to optimise the setting behaviour of cement paste in the presence of alkali-free accelerator. The setting times of cement pastes with a combination of alkali-free accelerators and copolymers were tested. Isothermal calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis and total organic carbon were also performed to obtain the comprehensive optimisation effects of poly(AANa-co-DMAA). The results clearly show that the capacity of the alkali-free accelerator for shortening the setting time of cement paste was enhanced significantly by introducing poly(AANa-co-DMAA). More AA units in the copolymers have better adsorption capacity, leading to a faster dissolution rate of tricalcium aluminate and the formation of massive ettringite crystals, thus finally the setting time of the cement paste with a combination of alkali-free accelerators and copolymers was shortened markedly compared with that containing alkali-free accelerators alone. The good synergy effect of the copolymers and alkali-free accelerator indicates great potential for practical applications.",

The results showed that when the α-MgO/MgSO 4 .7H 2 O/H 2 O molar ratio was constant, the concentration of magnesium sulfate and the uniformity of magnesium oxide particles in the slurry were the main factors determining the composition of the hydration products and the microstructure of MOSC. Spherical FA was found to improve the uniformity of magnesium oxide particles in the slurry and exert a nucleation effect, thereby increasing the formation of the 5.1.7 phase of the hydration products. Polyhedral SP with a certain fineness increased the concentration of magnesium sulfate in the slurry and had a filling effect, thus promoting formation of the 5.1.7 phase and optimising the microstructure.

The molecular structure of AH polymers was characterised by infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. A study was made of the surface properties of cement particles with AH polymers, such as surface tension, foaming properties and ξ-potential. The test results show that the surface tension of the solution decreases as AH polymers and aminosulfonate phenol formaldehyde condensate (AS) superplasticiser concentration increases. The solution with AH polymers has a lower surface tension than the solution with AS superplasticiser at the same concentration. The foaming capacity of AH polymers and AS superplasticiser, however, has a better foam stability than the solution with AS superplasticiser. The ξ-potential of cement particles with AH, AS polymers and AS superplasticiser increase as AH polymers and AS superplasticiser concentration and time are increased. The excellent dispersing properties of AH polymers on cement particles are attributed to the combination effect of adsorbing lubricate, electrostatic repulsive force and steric hindrance.",

The group velocity of ultrasonic wave propagation (v G ) is suggested to be a more sound parameter characterising the material under study than the generally employed ultrasound velocity determined from the ‘time of flight' parameter.

In order to evaluate the importance of pore openings and total porosity in the critical time gap, a suitable experimental technique was tested on some neat oil well cement slurries. The hydration was effectively stopped every 30 min at 20°C and every 20 min at 60°C by dropping plastic tubes containing the cement slurry into liquid nitrogen (i.e. quenching), cracking the tubes open and letting the frozen bits of paste thaw in ethanol. The change in porosity and pore size distribution was determined by helium pycnometry and mercury intrusion porosimetry as a function of time in the setting period for a plain API class G cement slurry (w/c = 0·50) at both 20°C and 60°C. These data were compared with the amount of chemically hound water in the same samples, and used to predict the total porosity at a given degree of hydration. The excellent correspondance of experimental and theoretical porosities validates the experimental procedure, which can also be used in explaining the variation in gas migration between commercial oil well cement slurries.",

Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) investigations were used to obtain a non-destructive description of statistically representative microstructures (nanometre and micrometre scale). The results obtained illustrate the possibilities of using SANS to monitor the time-dependent microstructural changes that occur during the hydration process. All samples were made from ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with a water/cement ratio of 0·38. By controlling the volume ratio of D 2 O in the hydration water (C dw ), a variation in contrast is achieved. In the special case of C dw = 0·38 the scattering length densities of the hydration products are nearly homogeneous and the contrast between them is drastically reduced. In order to study the influence of the hydration conditions, the sample thickness, temperature, the size fraction of the cement clinker and C dw were varied. The hydration products and inner surfaces formed by the separated microstructural objects were found to show a fractal behaviour. The fractal dimension obtained from the scatt~ring curves reflects the microstructural changes that occur during the hydration process within the size range of a few nanometres up to a few micrometres, depending on the chosen hydration parameters.

Monosulphate and C 3 AH 6 were the only phases observed for hydration in 0·5 and 1·0 M magnesium sulphate solutions. Ettringite was the dominant crystalline phase after hydration in 3·0 M solution, regardless of temperature. Gypsum was the only other crystalline phase observed after hydration in 3·0 M solutions. Hydration rates are faster than those observed in previous studies using similar sources of tricalcium aluminate and calcium sulphate. This indicates the hydration rate of tricalcium aluminate is enhanced by the presence of magnesium in solution. No crystalline magnesium containing phases were detected, regardless of temperature or magnesium sulphate concentration.",

Experimental results indicate that alkali-activated slag pastes are corroded more slowly than Portland cement pastes in these acid and salt solutions. Alkali-activated slag pastes are carbonated very quickly during an accelerated carbonation test because of shrinkage cracking, while no carbonation can be detected on Portland cement pastes after 75 days of exposure to 15% CO2 at a relative humidity of 52%. Detailed analyses indicate that all these differences can be attributed to the difference in hydration products in the two types of hardened cement pastes.",

The present paper is directed towards a specific understanding of the efficiency of fly ash in cementitious materials systems by considering the independency of fly ash and its dependency on the characteristics of the cementitious materials system. A new method of quantitatively evaluating the strength effect of fly ash is proposed, in which two parameters, the strength-effect index and the strengthening factor, are employed to study strength development in fly ash mortars and concretes and to further analyse the influences of water to binder ratio (w/b) and the replacement amount of fly ash on strength. Results indicate that the strength effect of fly ash in mortar systems is different from that in concrete; the strength effect of fly ash varies with both amount of fly ash and w/b. Furthermore, in a concrete system, two different optimal w/b ratios are used to maximise the strength-effect index and the strengthening factor of fly ash, respectively. An optimum amount of fly ash exists for an optimal unit strength-effect index in concrete. It is shown that the method presented in this paper is reasonable and effective in assessing the efficiency of fly ash. This information will strengthen the effective utilisation of fly ash in cementitious materials and design of fly ash concrete.",

    "abstract": "Day by day the increase in environmental pollution is playing a major role in the corrosion of concrete reinforcement, requiring researchers to focus on its prevention. Among the various corrosives, chloride ions produce major impact by virtue of their small size, high penetrating power, mobility and low activation energy for depassivation. The present research work is aimed at reducing the free chloride content in concrete using lead oxide as an admixture. Different proportions of admixture, varying between 5% and 20% (by weight), with regular increments of 5%, were adopted for concretes with varying curing times (3–28 days). An optimum percentage of chloride reduction was arrived at based on these proportions. The experiments revealed a 13% reduction of free chloride in cement grout and a 35% reduction in concrete with the lead oxide admixture. An increase of 30–60% in compressive strength was also observed for varying curing periods. This admixture, being economical compared with other admixtures such as zirconium oxide and titanium oxide, was found to reduce a higher amount of free chlorides, making it a feasible admixture to adopt. It can be concluded that lead oxide may effectively reduce the free chloride content in concrete, thereby reducing the risk of reinforcement corrosion.",

It was determined that thaumasite can be formed from a mixture of gypsum, calcite, portlandite, quartz and water. C—S—H phases can also react with gypsum and calcite to form thaumasite. Pure carbon and cement pastes seem to be immune. It is indicated by the calculations that thaumasite can not be formed from a reaction of C—S—H phases with ettringite and calcite. A precipitation of thaumasite is estimated to be possible at very low sulphate concentrations from an aggressive environment, even below those that are specified as moderate sulphate attack.",

The effects of phosphoric acid on the hydration process, hydration products and microstructure of MOS cement were studied in detail using isothermal calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the incorporation of phosphoric acid could retard the hydration process and increase the setting time of MOS cement.

The amount of dicalcium silicate, tricalcium silicate and portlandite decreases with the increase in curing temperature, indicating the activation of the pozzolanic reaction. The results show a significant increase in the density and compressive strength early in the curing process due to the higher pozzolanic reaction of GP at elevated temperatures.

However, the small fraction of CNTs in the cementitious materials may not be sufficient to provide strong piezo-resistive signals for monitoring the materials’ performance accurately in the field. In this study, a theoretical transfer function is developed to analyse the dispersing effectiveness of CNTs in order to search for a stronger piezo-resistance effect in smart cementitious materials. The theoretical transfer function model introduces a dispersing effectiveness coefficient into the intrinsic resistance and the inter-tube resistances of CNTs in the cementitious mix matrix. To validate the developed model, two different dispersing methods, including direct mixing and surfactant methods, were investigated through laboratory experiments. The experimental data showed that the developed transfer function can distinguish the dispersing effectiveness well for the two different methods investigated. This model can be used to guide evaluation regarding the quality control of CNT-based smart cementitious materials and investigation of the effectiveness of new developments of dispersion methods in the future.",

The study included four commercial superplasticisers, three adjuncts (a de-foaming agent, biocide and viscosity modifier) and a bespoke, synthesised superplasticiser from which residual monomer had been removed by dialysis. The commercial products (0·5% w/w dosage) had a much greater effect on metal solubility than the dialysed equivalent, increasing solubility by 2–3 orders of magnitude. As the adjuncts alone showed no effect, the difference between the commercial and synthesised superplasticisers is attributed to small molecules, primarily residual monomers, in the commercial formulations owing to incomplete polymerisation. The distribution of radionuclides in hardened cement pastes corresponds closely to the distribution of superplasticiser, as shown by 14 C-labelling in combination with digital autoradiography and accounting for the bleed observed for certain slag-rich formulations.",

By varying the number of mercapto groups of the star CTA, star-comb PCEs with a similar acid/ether ratio, molecular weight and anionic charge density but different arm numbers were prepared. The synthesised PCEs were characterised by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatography with a triple-detector system. It was proved that PCEs with star-comb topological structure could be successfully applied as superplasticisers. The effects of star-comb PCEs with different numbers of arms on cement paste fluidity, zeta potential and adsorption were studied. A theoretical model was developed to explain the differences in adsorption behaviour of linear-comb and star-comb PCEs on the surfaces of cement particles. This work provides useful guidance for the exploration of new topological structures of PCEs in future studies.",

To obtain the ideal process conditions and to monitor the optimal product quality of the binder, it was necessary to develop a measurement system for the online determination of certain quality parameters. A method for the direct calculation of different quality parameters of both precursor and final product from online measured near-infrared (NIR) spectra is presented in this article. A successful transformation between calibration models gained with laboratory and online NIR is also demonstrated. This enables optimisation of the calibration models on a laboratory scale and a seamless transfer to industrial scale due to changes in composition of the raw materials, formulation or processing parameters.",

The mechanical properties of HECCs can be obtained from tensile and compressive experiments. The mechanical properties of PVAF -ECC (mixed with only PVAF), BF-ECC (mixed with only BF), SF-ECC (mixed with only SF), HECC-PB (mixed with PVAF and BF) and HECC-PS (mixed with PVAF and SF) with additions of 65%, 70% or 78% fly ash (FA) at room temperature were investigated. The mechanical properties of the above five materials mixed with 70% FA were also investigated after high-temperature exposure. In these tests, the mixtures were heated to 200°C, 400°C or 600°C and then cooled to room temperature. According to the appearance change, strength change, mass loss, ductility loss and failure form of the specimens, HECC-PS was found to have the best tensile and compressive behaviours after high-temperature exposure. This material is thus suitable as a plastering layer on the surface on masonry structures to ensure the safety of masonry in high-temperature environments.",

This study investigated the effects of mixing procedure (sequence mixing method (SMM) and conventional mixing method (CMM)) on the properties of a geopolymer made from LRFA blended with calcined kaolinite clay as a precursor. A mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium metasilicate was used as the alkaline solution. It was found that the SMM was required to obtain LRFA geopolymers with sufficient strength for engineering applications. Using the CMM, the geopolymer had high porosity and low strength because gas bubbles were generated in the reaction between the alkaline solution and impurities in the LRFA during the hardening process. By contrast, in the SMM, the generated gas bubbles were released before the geopolymer hardened. As a result, the porosity was reduced and the strength was thus significantly increased. The 7-day strength of the geopolymer fabricated using the SMM was higher than the minimum requirement for Portland cement. In addition, the SMM reduced the setting time of the LRFA geopolymer, which is advantageous for rapid repair applications.",

However, in terms of strength, the replacement amount of Portland cement with LBD is limited due to the low reactivity of calcite in LBD. In this study, metakaolin used as a modified material was incorporated into blended cements containing LBD to improve the reactivity of calcite in the LBD. The results showed that the incorporation of LBD and metakaolin decreased the hydration heat and strengths of Portland cement at early ages, but the strength increased with increasing the mass ratio of metakaolin to LBD at later ages. In particular, the strengths of the blended cement containing 20% metakaolin and 20% LBD were even higher than those of Portland cement. This was mainly related to the formation of a compact pore structure with decreased porosity owing to the improvement of the reactivity of calcite in LBD and the pozzolanic reactivity of metakaolin. In addition, in comparison to Portland cement, the incorporation of LBD and metakaolin could produce a certain expansion due to the high hydration reactivity of magnesium oxide in LBD, and mitigated the shrinkage.",

In some cases (e.g. the presence of superplasticiser), the bleed water becomes turbid due to dispersion of the finest particles, and the boundary between the bleed water and the consolidated paste becomes difficult to detect. A Turbiscan device allows this boundary to be detected more accurately than in traditional tests. The role of superplasticiser and solid volume fraction in bleeding is examined. The bleeding measurements highlight the role of the superplasticiser in bleeding and its kinetics. The effect of superplasticiser may be explained by better dispersion leading to the release of water trapped between agglomerates. Furthermore, the existence of a critical volume fraction is shown, above which no bleeding occurs, and close to that corresponding to the appearance of contacts between particles. Finally, using rheological measurements, the correlation between the yield stress and bleeding has been possible.",

    "abstract": "Wet stored fly ash is increasingly being considered as a cement component in concrete. However, the effect of these conditions on the material's reactivity is uncertain. The research described here investigated this property for wet laboratory-stored (10% moisture) and site stockpile fly ashes, using lime consumption (BS EN 196-5, Frattini) and activity index (BS EN 450-1) tests. Progressive reactivity losses occurred with laboratory storage up to 730 days. This was influenced by dry fly ash fineness and holding period, suggesting that the formation of agglomerates/products (assessed by scanning electron microscopy) affects lime's access to particle surfaces, with similar type behaviour for stockpile materials. Compressive (cube) strength reductions were also found between dry and wet stored fly ash concretes. Stockpile fly ash reactivity following laboratory- (drying/ball milling) and pilot-scale (flash drying/de-agglomerating, air classifying, micronising and carbon removal) processing was then investigated. Exposure of reactive material using these methods appears to be important, with greater improvements generally noted as the fly ash particle size is reduced and at later test ages. To meet activity index requirements, fly ash sub-10 μm contents, with the Portland cement used, needed to exceed about 30%, irrespective of the storage conditions/processing used. Minor benefits to concrete strength were obtained with increasing sub-10 μm contents, particularly beyond 28 days.",

In this paper, this issue is addressed though the application of two-point electrical impedance measurements taken within the frequency range 100 Hz–10 MHz. Data are presented for a range of industry-standard cement-based concrete mixes with and without supplementary cementitious materials. Nyquist plots (−iZ″(ω) against Z′(ω)) and Bode plots (Z*(ω) and θ against frequency) clearly highlight the frequency dependence of the electrical response. However, when presented in the form of permittivity and conductivity, a region of dispersion was evident over the entire frequency range for all concretes. The features of this response, which could be gainfully exploited as durability indices for assessing the long-term performance of concrete, are identified and discussed. A range of formalisms is presented and it is shown that, within this frequency range, conductivity was found to obey Jonscher's universal power law. Two novel durability parameters are presented based on features of Jonscher's model; from a practical viewpoint, the power-law model can be evaluated using conductivity measurements obtained at three, easily measured, spot frequencies (10 kHz, 1 MHz and 10 MHz).",

The synthesis process was optimised using orthogonal experiments. The colloidal interfacial chemistry results showed that the OA-PCE was more capable of reducing the surface tension of aqueous solutions than an unmodified traditional polycarboxylate superplasticiser (JS-PCE) and its adsorption capacity on cement particles was greater. The isothermal adsorption behaviour of the two kinds of PCEs on cement conformed to the Freundlich isothermal adsorption equation; it was a physical adsorption process by electrostatic action. The effect of OA-PCE dosage on the flowability of cement slurry was preliminarily investigated by rheological behaviour tests. According to the yield stress, plastic viscosity and thixotropic ring area of the slurry, a dosage of 0.35 wt% OA-PCE produced the optimum effect. The compressive strength of concrete made with 0.35 wt% OA-PCE at 4 h and 7 days was, respectively, 117.1% and 88.3% higher than that of the control group and met the standards for the use of concrete in metro pipe sheets. OA-PCE synthesised by emulsion polymerisation is therefore significant for the development of PCEs both in terms of the polymerisation method and practical applications.",

Currently there is no rapid and accurate method available to measure it. This paper reports on a laboratory investigation of AC impedance measurement as a means of assessing the chloride diffusion resistance of sealers and coatings on mortar. Five surface treatments are studied. It was found that due to the difference in dielectric properties of the surface treatment materials and cementitious mortar, the impedance spectrum of a surface-treated mortar specimen consists of two individual spectra located at high and medium frequencies corresponding to the mortar substrate and the surface treatment layer, respectively. An equivalent circuit for surface-treated mortar/concrete is proposed. Hence the dielectric properties of a surface treatment layer and substrate can be analysed and their individual properties can be studied. The electrical resistance of a surface treatment obtained by impedance analysis was found to correlate well with the chloride diffusion resistance measured by a long-term diffusion cell test. The results suggest that the rapid and non-destructive AC impedance test has great potential in performance monitoring and deterioration mechanism studies of surface treatments.",

The permeability is expressed in function of porosity, tortuosity, constrictivity factor and critical pore radius of the material. The modelling is based on the use of a tridimensional cubic pore network. Two types of measurements are carried out on mortars and cement paste: (a) mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) measurements so as to determine the model entry parameters which allow calculation of the ‘theoretical’ permeability; (b) direct water permeability measurements by the application of the Darcy's law so as to validate the model. The calculated and measured permeabilities are globally in the same order of magnitude. However, some differences are noted. They can be explained by the complexity of correctly estimating some model entry parameters (e.g. tortuosity).

The investigations were carried out with X-ray powder method on the chemically modified technical GBS. During the heating merwinite first crystallised at approximately 750°C and converted to melilite with rising temperatures. The concentrations of the crystallised mineral phases merwinite and melilite depend on the CaO content. The merwinite concentration increases and the melilite concentration decreases with rising CaO content. Depending on the chemical composition the structural parameters of the melilite vary in the range between gehlenite and åkmernite. Due to the good correlation between the gehlenite concentration and the reactivity of the GBS the gehlenite concentration can be regarded as an indicator for the reactivity of the GBS.",

Cement paste specimens admixed with a fixed quantity of sodium chloride and varying dosages of sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate were prepared.

The chloride concentration increased with increasing quantity of sodium sulphate contamination. In the specimens admixed with magnesium sulphate, a marginal increase in the Cl − concentration was noted up to 1% SO 4 2− . The increase in the Cl − concentration in the specimens admixed with more than 1% SO 4 2− was minimal. In plain cements the chloride binding was influenced by the C 3 A content of cement. The Cl − /OH − values in plain cements admixed with sodium chloride and sodium sulphate increased marginally with increasing sodium sulphate concentration. However, the Cl − /OH − ratio in plain and blended cements admixed with sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate increased with increasing quantity of magnesium sulphate up to 1% SO 4 2− . For SO 4 2− concentrations of more than 1%, a decrease in the Cl − /OH − was noted.",

Analysis of test results showed that the decomposition profile of amorphous hydrates and portlandite was independent of mix design, degree of hydration and inclusion of pozzolana. An equation which addresses limitations in existing models is proposed to predict non-evaporable water loss at elevated temperature based on the volumetric ratio and decomposition profile of amorphous hydrates and portlandite in hardened cement paste.

This advancement covers all aspects of the concrete industry, from mixing to curing. The study presented here contains the results of an investigation of various concrete curing methods used recently in the region. Specifically, the study investigates the influences of the environment and curing methods on the compressive strength of silica fume high-strength concrete. Specimens were kept at five different curing conditions and in two different environments for a period of 9 months. The curing conditions used were water curing (control), no curing (NC), sprinkle curing (SC), plastic curing (PC) and burlap curing (BC). Eeach of the last four conditions was exposed to two different environments: indoor (ID) environment and outdoor (OD) environment. The strength results were determined at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 270 days. The results reveal that the effects of the curing methods on the compressive strength of the specimens are highly influenced by the exposure conditions, and the different curing schemes have varying effects on the compressive strength of the specimens. This suggests that careful and more efficient curing practices and techniques are required when curing concrete in the hot dry environments such as in the climate of the Gulf region.",

The follow-up of the evolution of the chromium content along the cement chain of production showed that clay was the raw material, most contaminated by chromium and that the correction additions, mainly brick scrap, contributed significantly to the concentration of chromium in the kiln feed. It was also shown that the abrasion of the crushing bodies contributes slightly to the increase in the chromium content and that the clinkerisation process increases the chromium content in the clinker considerably, due to its presence in the fuel (petroleum coke).",

Four types of cements, namely Type I, Type V, Type I with silica fume, and Type I with fly ash, were evaluated. Cement mortar specimens were exposed to six sulphate concentrations, namely 0, 1, 1·5, 2, 2·5 and 4%. The sulphate attack was evaluated by visual inspection and change in length. The results indicated that the intensity of sulphate attack is a function of: (a) cement type; (b) sulphate concentration, and (c) exposure period. Expansive cracking was the main mode of failure of mortar specimens exposed to sodium sulphate solution. Among plain and blended cements, sulphate resistance of Type I cement mortar specimens was very low, even at low concentration of sodium sulphate. Type V, Type I blended with silica fume, and Type I blended with fly ash cements performed better than Type I cement. Among the blended cements, the sulphate resistance of fly ash cement mortar specimens was better than that of silica fume cement mortar specimens. This can be attributed to the reduction in Ca(OH) 2 and C 3 A due to a higher replacement (20%) of cement, which are essential for the formation of the secondary ettringite.",

The 1 h carbonated paste showed a more porous region near its external surface, surrounding a much higher inner non-porous homogeneous phase, while the 24 h carbonated specimen showed a single and more porous phase. The longer the carbonation time, the higher was the microstructural porosity of the carbonated regions and the higher the condensed silicate structure of the matrix, as characterised by morphology modifications.

The CMA particles in the cement paste samples constituted 5, 10, 15 and 20% of the total cement mass. The apparent viscosity of cement paste was measured with a rotational viscometer; the yield stress and plastic viscosity were calculated by fitting method. Correlations between CMA particle size distribution and some rheological properties (especially steady flow properties) were tested using a grey correlation analysis. The results of the correlation analysis show that: increasing the particle content of 3–32 μm and 32–65 μm size, especially the former, reduces the yield stress value, and increases the plastic viscosity of the slurry viscosity, except for at the level of 15% addition.",

    "abstract": "The durability of concrete against penetration of chloride ions is one of the most important factors that can affect the serviceability of structures. Many tests can measure or predict the durability of concrete structures during their lifespan. Recently, many researchers have tried to provide different relationships and correlations between durability tests. The rapid chloride migration test, the electrical resistivity test and the water absorption test are some of the common and practical tests that may be used for studying the durability and permeability of cementitious materials. Providing an empirical correlation among these tests could yield the opportunity to estimate the durability parameters. This study presents relationships between durability tests and their correlations with the compressive strength in mortars containing rice husk ash, nanosilica and sugar cane bagasse ash. The empirical correlation between electrical resistivity and the migration coefficient followed the Nernst–Einstein equation. A strong linear correlation between electrical resistivity and compressive strength of binary mixtures was found, whereas a weak correlation was found for ternary mixtures. Moreover, a strong power correlation between electrical resistivity and capillary absorption of mortars was found.",

They were then assessed for carbon dioxide uptake and compressive/bending strength. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was sequestrated into the concrete as simulated carbonation weathering occurred, and the carbon dioxide uptake was measured using thermogravimetric analysis. Carbon dioxide uptake increased when CDP amine sorbents were mixed into the concrete specimens, with 5-amino-1-pentanol and piperazine showing the best efficiency, with carbon dioxide uptakes of 2·44% and 2·24%, respectively. The compressive and bending strengths also increased with carbonation. The strengths of the concretes with CDP sorbents were higher than that of ordinary concrete due to the microstructural densification, indicating that urban carbon dioxide sequestration can be performed using concrete structures without damaging their structural strength.",

The samples were subjected to different curing regimes at 20°C and 40°C at a constant water to cement ratio of 0·5. Hydration reactions were stopped using a freeze drier. To study the effect of grinding, samples were either roughly crushed or finely ground. Although the amount of water measured from the dehydroxylation of portlandite was not affected by grinding, the total BWC increased with grinding. This increase in the measured BWC was not affected by the studied curing regimes and degrees of hydration of C 3 S. Fine grinding before hydration stoppage using a freeze dryer produced a BWC similar to that of crushed samples. It is proposed that the increase in measured BWC after grinding is due to the confinement of physically bound water in the interlayers of calcium silicate hydrate.",

However, despite such high demand, only 60% of the fly ash generated in India is consumed. One of the major reasons for this under-utilisation appears to be the lower quality of Indian fly ashes compared with fly ash generated elsewhere. Fly ashes produced in Indian power plants are generally low-calcium class F fly ash, with a low amorphous fraction (&lt;50%). In the study reported in this paper, an attempt was made to try to understand the impact of low amorphous silica fly ashes on hydration and microstructure variations in blended cement systems using isothermal calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Durability characteristics were studied by sorptivity measurements. The results showed that the low amorphous silica fly ashes improved both the durability and mechanical performance of the blended cements. These results will be useful in improving fly ash utilisation rates in India by the cement and ready-mix concrete industries.",

The compressive and splitting tensile experiments of this concrete with different water temperatures (5, 10, 20, 30 and 40°C) and ages (7, 24, 72, 168, 336 and 672 h) are carried out to reveal the corresponding strength change laws and the relationship between strength and curing parameters. The failure modes and internal cracks evolution of the phosphorus slag-based concrete are depicted through strength tests and acoustic emission (AE) tests. The results show that water temperature and age effects on the development of compressive strength of the phosphorus slag-based concrete are very significant. The relationships between compressive strength and curing age of concrete under different water temperatures can be described by a logarithmic model based on the experimental data. Finally, the effectiveness of the test results has been confirmed by comparing the results from AE location with the macroscopic failure mode of concrete. The present results can provide a reference for engineering application in underwater buildings repair, such as discharge holes and spillways.",

It was found that, with the addition of 1%, 3% and 5% C–A–S–H seeds, the hydration process was brought forward by about 2 h, 3 h and 7 h, the initial setting time was reduced by 16.4%, 25.5% and 34.5%, and the final setting time was reduced by 16.8%, 35.1% and 41.1%, respectively.

However, the major challenges of using CNTs in cement are their agglomeration, poor dispersion and weak interaction with the cement matrix, which can nullify the potential benefits of CNT addition. A method for increasing the interaction between the CNT surface and cement matrix using magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) nanoparticles, which increases the roughness and dispersibility of CNTs, was investigated. Nanocomposites of multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) and magnetite were prepared by electrostatic attraction and added to the cement matrix to produce a novel cementitious composite. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed the successful preparation of the MWCNT–magnetite hybrid structure. The mechanical, electrical and microstructural features of nanocomposite-reinforced cements were tested. The results revealed that increasing the weight fraction of the nanocomposite reinforcement improved the mechanical properties of the cement paste. Compared with the control, the compressive, flexural and tensile strengths of cement loaded with 0.3 wt% MWCNTs and 0.3 wt% magnetite at 28 days increased by 83%, 104% and 98%, respectively; the porosity and electrical resistivity were reduced by 31% and 48%, respectively.

    "abstract": "The inertisation of cadmium (Cd 2+ ) ions in various cement matrices is investigated using the solidification/stabilisation technique. The different cement pastes used in this study are neat Portland cement and Portland cement blended with 20 and 40% blast furnace slag or metakaolin. Two ratios of heavy metal ion, namely 1·0 and 2·0% by weight of solid, are used. The hydration characteristics of the cement pastes are tested by way of determination of the combined water content, phase composition, compressive strength and X-ray diffraction analysis at different time intervals up to 90 d. The metal salt used causes a retarding effect on the hydration of all the investigated cement pastes. The degree of immobilisation of the added Cd 2+ ions is evaluated by determining the leached ion concentration after time intervals extended up to 90 d. The leachability experiments are carried out by using the static mode leaching process. It is observed that Cd 2+ ions show a high degree of immobilisation for the cement pastes investigated.",

This includes detection and structural investigations of fluoride ions incorporated in the model compound boehmite (AlOOH) and in four samples of kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 ) from different sources and experiments, which follow the thermal transformation of kaolinite into metakaolin. Furthermore, the structural environments of fluoride ions incorporated into calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) phases, either synthesised or originating from hydration of fluoride-mineralised Portland clinkers, are investigated. The favourable NMR properties of 19 F provide the basis for a range of double-resonance NMR techniques, such as 27 Al{ 19 F} and 29 Si{ 19 F} cross-polarisation (CP) and 19 F{ 29 Si} 19 F forth and back CP, which probe internuclear connectivities by way of dipolar couplings. The information gained from these experiments facilitates a reliable assignment of the resonances from the fluoride guest ions in the studied model compounds and calcium-silicate-hydrate phases. It is proposed that fluoride ions may deliberately be introduced into a cement system as a structural probe in model studies that follow the reactivity and structure of specific sites that fluoride substitutes for.",

It is thus important to determine whether the mixing uniformity of a sand–cement mixture has an effect on the dielectric properties. In this study, the dielectric properties of a sand–cement mixture were measured using the neural network inversion method. The results indicate that the mixing uniformity of a sand–cement mixture has no obvious effect on its dielectric properties and the measured results were approximately in agreement with values calculated using the Maxwell–Garnett formula. Therefore, when measuring the dielectric properties of a sand–cement mixture, the volume ratio is important but mixing uniformity is not.",

The pozzolanicity of the glass powder (GP) hydration with and without calcium hydroxide (CH) (lime) is assessed using different methods. A comprehensive experimental programme is carried out to investigate the chemical and physical properties of the hydrated activated GP with CH, as a cement hydration product, on the microstructural level. The experimental work focuses on the degree of hydration, pH and the alkalinity nature of the pore solution to evaluate the performance of the GP when it reacts with the CH. A flame emission spectroscopy test was used to quantify the alkali release from the GP as well as determining the rate of alkali release with time. It was found that the GP releases a small fraction of sodium ions into the solution. Test results showed that the finely ground GPs exhibited very high pozzolanic activity. It was observed that the GP–lime pastes show high non-evaporable water content. Moreover, the best performance of the GP reactivity can be obtained in the range of 10·5 &lt; pH &lt; 11·5 depending on the CH/GP ratio. According to the scanning electron microscope analysis, the gel product of the GP hydration precipitates on the surface of the large particle of the GP, at which the very small micro particles and the outer layer of the large GP particles react with CH.",

The resulting experiments show a joint three-step reaction sequence for saccharides and sugar alcohols, accompanied by one set acceleration and two retardations of the cement hydration. The step-wise setting courses are explained by the spontaneous anion formation of polyhydroxy compounds owing to the Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda van Ekenstein rearrangement (keto-enol tautomerism) and charge neutralisation, as well as by well-known traditional organic–inorganic interactions. Furthermore the paper underlines the high relevance of temperature adjustment and cement aging on the course of setting of well cements.",

    "abstract": "It is of immense scientific and engineering interest to know the crystalline nature (amorphous and well crystallized) of calcite forming in concrete structural elements subjected to long-term atmospheric carbonation attack. The present study re-examines the crystalline nature of calcite, and also the mechanism controlling its formation in concrete slabs carbonated by exposure to an internal drying environment on a long-term basis. The influence of chloride penetration on the crystalline nature of calcite is also investigated. The crystalline nature of calcite forming in the above slabs was examined at the end of the exposure period at three different locations: at the cast face of the slabs, below the cast face, and immediately below a surface coating used on some of the slabs. Techniques such as differential thermal analysis, X ray diffraction and Volhard's method for the acid-soluble chloride content were used. The results showed that well-crystallized and amorphous calcite form in concrete slabs subjected to a long-term internal drying environment similar to the interior of a building. The concrete close to the cast face of the slabs, on long-term carbonation, showed the presence of a significant proportion of well-crystallized calcite together with well-crystallized vaterite in trace quantities. On the other hand, only amorphous calcite was found to be present on long-term atmospheric carbonation of concrete below the cast face of the slab. In contrast, all the above three carbonate phases, that is, well-crystallized calcite, amorphous calcite together with well-crystallized vaterite, were present in the concrete immediately below the surface coating on exposure to similar conditions. The formation of well-crystallized and amorphous calcite in concrete slabs subjected to long-term carbonation is shown to be related to the flux of atmospheric carbon dioxide through the concrete cover; well-crystallized calcite forms in concrete with a high carbon dioxide flux while amorphous calcite forms in concrete with a restricted carbon dioxide flux. The acid-soluble chlorides present in the concrete cover appear to have no influence on the mechanism leading to the formation of both well-crystallized and amorphous calcite.",

In addition to inspecting the specimens visually, the performance of both plain and blended cements was evaluated by measuring the strength development, reduction in compressive strength, expansion, weight change, reinforcement corrosion and conducting chemical and mineralogical analyses. The visual inspection and compressive strength results indicated that the sulphate attack was somewhat hindered in plain and blended cements despite the high sulphate concentration in the marine environments. The data on reinforcement corrosion confirmed the superior performance of silica fume cement in sea water, followed by blast furnace slag and fly ash cements. The corrosion resistance of Type I cement was marginally better than that of Type V cement. Even though the Cl−concentration and Cl−/OH−ratio in the SF and BFS cements were the highest and much more than the threshold values, the intensity of reinforcement corrosion in these cements was less than that in the plain cements.",

    "abstract": "The scope of manufacturing blended cements in India and the resultant saving in energy consumption were identified. The characterisation of the two main mineral admixtures, namely fly ash (FA) and blast furnace slag (BFS), was based on their chemical and mineralogical composition and their particle characteristics. It was found that all the three factors are important from the point of view of selection of appropriate mineral admixture for blending with cement. The durability performance of concrete with blended cements was improved in terms of its resistance to the three deteriorating factors, namely alkali±silica reaction (ASR), sulphate attack and the corrosion of steel reinforcement. The improved resistance towards the ASR was due to the higher retention of alkalis and the refinement of pore structure, and is due to formation of secondary calcium silicate hydrate (C-SH) during the hydration of FA or BFS components in cement. Its resistance towards the Na2SO4 expansion is on account of lower content of free Ca(OH)2, besides the refinement of pore structure. Its lower resistance towards the strength reduction in MgSO4 environment, like ordinary portland cement (PC), is attributed to the deleterious reaction of Mg++ cations with C-S-H. In general, blended cements having tricalcium aluminate (C3A) contents in the range of 5–8% and the FA content of 25–30% or the BFS content above 60%, show moderate to good sulphate resistance. The higher corrosion resistance is attributed to the refinement of pore structure resulting in lower chloride and oxygen diffusivity, greater chloride binding capacity and higher electrical resistivity of the concrete made with blended cements. In comparison to concrete with OPC only, early and extended curing are required to obtain higher long term strength and better durability performance: the economic considerations show that the use of blended cement in concrete is the cheapest alternative available to control reinforcement corrosion.",

Marker experiments in conjunction with electron microprobe analyses were used to elucidate reaction mechanisms. Two distinct patterns of mineral zonation were observed in altered cement paste: sharply banded and irregularly banded. Reasons for the differences in microstructure are explained in terms of differing reaction mechanisms, which are primarily related to matrix permeability. The mineralogy of the degraded cement was determined; besides gypsum and an M-S-H phase, two phases hitherto unreported in Portland cement occurred: magnesium hydroxysulphate, Mg 6 (OH) 10 SO 4 ·3H 2 O, and, in one blend composition, a clinohumite-like phase. Observations are made on the probable durability of conventional concretes in contact with MgSO 4(aq) .",

Fly ash is an industrial waste obtained from the coal-fired thermal generating power plant and it is used in the production of additive construction materials. In Turkey more than 15 million tonnes of fly ash is produced each year, but only a small amount is utilised. The industrial waste fly ashes used in this study came from the power plant at Iskenderun Sugozu, Cayirhan, Tuncbilek and Seyitomer. Lightweight aggregate manufactured from the fly ash and Na-bentonite was used in a pelletisation process. The lightweight concrete manufactured from fly ash aggregate was analysed in terms of the slump and density of fresh concrete and the density, compressive strength and tensile splitting strength of hardened concrete. In the present study, the effects of fly ash aggregates from different power plant when used for lightweight concrete production purposes were investigated and the results obtained were quite satisfactory for the related design requirements.",

This work examines the effects of waste ash on clinker phase composition and crystalline structure (microstructure). Clinkers were prepared from mixtures of industrial raw mix with coal ash and waste ash, respectively. The coal ash was substituted on a calorific basis by 50% and 100% of waste ash originating from refuse-derived fuel (RDF). The thermal treatment of the mixtures was monitored by differential thermal analysis (DTA). The phase composition and microstructure of the produced clinkers were investigated by X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy and the level of trace element content was measured. According to the results of DTA, the addition of waste ash shifts clinkering reactions to lower temperatures. The unit cell volume calculations of clinker phases suggest only limited alterations in the crystal lattice of alite and cubic tricalcium aluminate compared to the reference clinker. Free lime tends to increase when moving from coal to RDF ash but decreases with increasing RDF addition. The microscopic study of clinkers did not reveal significant differences. Finally, clinkers produced with waste ash addition meet environmental criteria relating to trace element content.",

Accelerated degradation of ammonium nitrate is represented by finite-elements methods (FEM). This method made it possible (a) to simulate the diffusion and chemical degradation of cracked concrete, incorporating into the mesh a real geometry crack and (b) to study the influence of the crack geometric parameters (unit segments length, deviation angle, opening, etc.) on the diffusion and chemical degradation. The influence of the crack mesh on the simulation results is computed using FEM. In spite of this, and particularly when coupled phenomena are concerned, the various transfer proprieties present in the structure of the material, as diffusion, are badly represented by this kind of approach. It is demonstrated that only the resolution of the conservation equation of calcium in solution may be sufficient accurately to determine the degradation profiles of cementitious materials, and the theoretical results correspond with experiments.",

In this study, methods of measuring the setting time of cement pastes with mixed AAs were evaluated using the Gillmore and Vicat needle test methods. It was found that for both test methods, regardless of initial and final setting, the setting time when the admixture was simultaneously added was faster than the post-addition method. For the Gillmore needle test method, two types of measurement methods were evaluated and it was observed that the setting time with cement type varied even when the same AA was used. Accordingly, manufacturing companies should develop AAs that are less influenced by cement type. For the Vicat needle test method, six types of measurement methods were evaluated and the following conclusions were obtained: (a) the temperature of materials should be controlled exactly and (b) to evaluate the performance of AA, an admixture usage of 5% (ratio of cement weight) was recommended.",

A naphthalene-type resin was effective over a shorter time, but pastes containing a melamine-type resin stiffened too rapidly to be useful. The stiffening was generally less rapid at 5°C than at 20°C, and is attributed to the precipitation of alumina gel in the paste.",

The CN dosages tested at 5°C were 0·00%, 1·55%, 3·86% and 7·73% of the cement weight. The optimum dosage was found to be 1·55%, 1·55%, 3·86%, 3·86% and 1·55% CN for cements nos 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. However, optimum CN dosages less than 1·55% cannot be excluded for cements nos 1, 2 and 5. The accelerating efficiency of CN is higher at 5°C than at 20°C. In addition to shortening the overall setting time, the CN accelerator often reduced the time gap between initial and final set, indicating a more rapid strength build-up. Isothermal calorimetry revealed a good correlation between the extra heat output during the first five hours and the effectiveness of 1·55% CN (fixed dosage) in accelerating initial set at 5°C. The efficiency of CN as set accelerator for the different cements seems to increase with increasing β-C s S, as partly confirmed by X-ray diffraction, or other cement characteristics promoting belire formation in the clinker process.",

When unmodified cement was exposed for 20 days to hot acid, its surface was covered with the crystalline bassanite (CaSO4:1/2H2O) phase as the acid corrosion product of cement. Bassanite was formed not only by reactions between H 2 SO 4 and calcite or monocalcium aluminate, but also by reaction of HOAp with acid.

The porosity was measured with helium intrusion, mercury intrusion and by calculation from weight loss observations. A wide range of durability related properties were measured and the results correlated with the porosities. It is concluded that the porosity is an excellent predictor for the transport properties but less good for actual corrosion rates.

The verification of the proposed model is carried out with several groups of experimental data on concrete at different water to cementitious material ratios and initial temperatures. This numerical model is able to predict the adiabatic temperature history of HSC with SF and superplasticiser.

The feasibility of using the fly ash derived from the incineration of MSW as supplementary cementitious material was explored. It was shown that the reactivity of fly ash was lower and the addition of fly ash to cement may lead to retardation of cement hydration and, furthermore, that ettringite can be formed during the hydration process, which is beneficial for strength development. It was also shown that the immobilisation effect of cement on this fly ash is good and that heavy metals can be immobilised within the structure of the hydration phases through addition, substitution or sorption mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Pulverised fuel ash is a by-product of burning coal during the generation of electricity. In many places, the collected pulverised fuel ash has to be processed through a classifying stage before it can be used as a construction material. The rejected portion of the classifying process has remained unused due to its high carbon content and large particle size (&gt; 45 μm). However, the rejected ash may be used in certain areas, such as in solidification and stabilisation processes of hazardous waste, and materials for road base or sub-base construction, which require relatively lower strength and reactivity. This paper presents the results of a study on the pozzolanic properties of cementitious materials prepared by blending rejected fly ash (rFA) with calcium hydroxide. The effects of adding chemical activators, elevating curing temperature, and grinding of the ash particles on the activation of rFA were compared by means of compressive strength, differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry tests. The results show that the addition of Na 2 SO 4 can significantly accelerate the strength development both at 28 and 90 days. K 2 SO 4 is only effective at 28 days. The addition of flue gas desulphurisation sludge (a low-grade gypsum) and grinding can only increase the strength at 90 days. Pretreatment by steam curing decreases the 90 day strength of the samples. The compressive strength results correlate nicely with the results of the porosity and the thermal analysis tests. Adding chemical activators seems to be an effective and economical method to accelerate the hydration of rFA.",

The zeta potential of the fly ash particles in the alkaline solution with dissolved silica is lowered on decreasing its M S . The yield stress of the AAF paste increases sensitively on decreasing the M S of the activating solution due to the combined influences of reducing the zeta potential of fly ash particles and increasing the viscosity of the activating solution. There are counteracting effects of increasing the viscosity of the activating solution and raising the zeta potential of fly ash, produced by increasing the silica content in the activating solution. The yield stress of AAF paste is less sensitive to the silica content in the activating solution.",

The replacement rate of cement by GP varied from 10 to 20% and the proportion of slag was fixed at 10%.

Proper identification and exploration methods are crucial in relation to their technical and economical purposes. In this paper, a two-phase study is employed, based on geochemical data processing and experimental investigations. Chemical and petrography of natural pozzolans were utilised to develop the proposed method. This method proposes three geochemical indexes: the limiting values of silica/calcium oxide (SiO 2 /CaO), alumina saturation and alkali content to qualify the natural pozzolan according to the supplementary cementitious requirements. Then, based on ASTM C618 and EN 196-5 standards and complementary tests, the chemical and physical properties of two natural pozzolans were assessed to validate the proposed method. The results showed that this method could be used as a robust and direct way to identify natural pozzolans.",

It is based on the geometrical modelling of a porous structure as a tri-dimensional cubic pore network, which contains an association of n types of pores with radii Ri and lengths li. This geometrical configuration gives the model the ability to be applied to all types of pore size distribution. The permeability is expressed in function of porosity, tortuosity, critical pore radius and constrictivity, which depends on pore size distribution. These parameters are obtained from mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements. The predicted permeability values were compared with experimental ones obtained by direct measurements according to Darcy's law. The experimental validation concerns three mortars chosen for their polymodal pore size distribution. Theoretical and experimental results are in the same order of magnitude. However, the model could be improved by a better estimation of the material morphological parameters. This would be possible by using further investigation methods, in addition to mercury intrusion porosimetry tests.",

The ESEM micrographs showed that metakaolin particles were packed loosely at 10 min after mixing, with many large voids.

At a later stage, the particles were wrapped by thick gel layers, and their interspaces were almost completely engulfed. The corresponding EDXA results showed that the molar ratios of K/Al and Si/Al gradually decreased with the development of hydration. As a result, the molar ratios of K/Al and Si/Al of hydration products after 9 h were 1·28 and 6·54, respectively, and these were close to the theoretical values (K/Al = 1·0, Si/Al = 6·0 for K-PSDS geopolymer cement paste).

The specimens are then hardened for 7, 28 and 90 d under normal conditions. It is found that the AFA additive accelerates the initial hydration of blast-furnace cement and promotes hydration of the slag component, but has a negative effect on the early compressive strength of samples. Nevertheless, at a later period of hardening (after 28 and 90 d of hydration), AFA additive (up to 10 wt%) increases the compressive strength of the samples. This effect is related to the formation of gismondine (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 ·4H 2 O) and a significant amount of calcium silicate hydrates. It is determined that AFA activates the latent hydraulic properties of blast-furnace slag, but the slag pozzolanic reaction in blast-furnace cement samples with the AFA additive proceeds slowly and occurs more intensively at a later period of hardening.",

The reaction products with varying calcium oxide to silicon dioxide molar ratio (Ca/Si), concentration of sucrose, reaction temperature and time were characterised by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and acid-insoluble residue analysis. The concentration of Ca 2+ , pH value and viscosity of the reaction solutions were determined and the influence mechanism of sucrose was then clarified. The results reveal that the phase composition and morphology of the products changed due to the incorporation of sucrose. There was a critical concentration of sucrose (e.g. the sucrose/calcium oxide molar ratio was 0·05 at Ca/Si = 0·8) for the formation of tobermorite. Sucrose promoted the formation of tobermorite when its concentration was lower than the critical value, and retarded the formation once its concentration exceeded the critical value. The morphology of tobermorite changed from plate-like to lath-like or lance-like as the concentration of sucrose increased. In the presence of sucrose, the transformation of tobermorite into xonotlite was inhibited at Ca/Si = 1·0 and the tobermorite phase remained stable even at higher reaction temperatures or for longer reaction times.",

It was therefore considered worthwhile to study the influence of the temperature of raw material entering a rotary kiln on temperature field distribution of the kiln inlet system, including cyclone preheaters and a calciner. The characteristics were investigated by comparison of the calcination condition between a ‘six-level preheater + calciner’ and a ‘five-level preheater + calciner’ process. The data regarding temperature field distribution were obtained through numerical simulation. The results showed that when the ratio of calciner feed coal of the ‘six-level preheater + calciner’ process increased from 60 to 80%, the temperature of the raw material into the rotary kiln rose from 915 to 1220°C. The appropriate ratio of calciner feed coal for this was about 70%, and the temperature of raw material into the rotary kiln could reach 1070°C.",

These SSMs will seal the waste containers within a disposal zone and provide physical support during package placement. The ambient temperature and pressure will be 80–130°C and 30–50 MPa, respectively, depending on depth and local geological conditions. This will accelerate grout thickening, so retardation is required to facilitate slurry placement. Certain inorganic materials suppress cement hydration and retard thickening under ambient conditions. However, their retardation characteristics are unknown at elevated temperature and pressure. Inorganic compounds of borate, phosphate, tin and zinc were investigated as retarders, and a summary of the work is provided in this paper. All retarders were found to delay thickening, with only borate providing sufficient retardation, but only at 90°C (0·75% addition); retardation was nearly sufficient at 120°C (1% addition). The effect of all the retarders on wet paste properties was not consistent but, generally, plastic viscosity and yield stress peaked at specific addition levels. None of the retarders influenced phase composition, and each retarding ion was evenly distributed throughout the hardened microstructure. The results of this study led to the conclusion that no inorganic retarder is appropriate for use across the whole DBD temperature range.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive research into sustainability of geopolymers, end-of-life aspects have been largely overlooked. A recycling scenario is examined in this study. This requires an investigation of alkali leaching potential from a geopolymeric matrix. To study the feasibility of geopolymer cement (GPC) recycling, the migration of alkalis was evaluated for the first time on a microstructural level through energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) elemental mapping and leaching tests. Macroscale impacts were assessed through an investigation of Portland cement (PC) mortar properties affected by alkali concentration. Leaching tests indicated that alkalis immediately become available in aqueous environments, but the majority remain chemically or physically bound in the matrix. This type of leaching accelerates the initial setting of PC paste. Elemental mapping and EDX/SEM analysis showed a complex paste–aggregate interfacial transition zone. Exchange of calcium and sodium, revealed by the maps, resulted in the migration of sodium into the PC paste and the formation of additional calcium–silicon-based phases in the geopolymeric matrix. Strength values of mortars with 25% and 50% recycled aggregates (RA) showed negligible differences compared with the reference sample. Screening tests indicated a low potential for GPC RA inducing alkali–silica reaction. Transport of GPC RA alkalis and the underlying mechanisms were observed. This transport phenomenon was found to have minor effects on the properties of the PC mortar, indicating that recycling of geopolymers is a viable reuse practice.",

The deformation behaviour in the CCM, which was different from any previously functionally graded material, coincided well with the TGD. The scaled-up mean stress and strain of the CCM were, respectively, over 97% and less than 120% of the values obtained in the K 0 DCGF test. A simulated TGD profile from the CCM was used to characterise the thermal-gradient-induced heterogeneity. A linear response between peak strength or volumetric strain and heterogeneity was observed in the K 0 DCGF test, and this was independent of the selection of the describing variable. The use of CCMs to model and reconstruct TGD profiles offers potential advantages because it can prevent problems arising from measuring deformation in a non-transparent environment.",

The current paper presents a study of the changes in the interfacial transition zone that forms between geothermal cements and volcanic rocks, after hydrothermal treatment at 290°C. Cement slurries were poured into cavities drilled into ignimbrite blocks and allowed to set at 90°C. The assemblages were autoclaved under typical geothermal conditions, both with and without a carbon dioxide overpressure at 290°C. The addition of silica to the cement dictates the phases that form in cement. When exposed to carbon dioxide, these calcium silicate hydrate phases carbonate, at distinct carbonation rates. The rate at which these phases form and/or carbonate affects the reaction extent of the cement with the rock and, eventually, the cement durability.",

A simple concept is established which outlines these complications. In this context, the interactions of particles lead to a high degree of consolidation of the cement powder and an increase of adhesion force due to the small size and the large surface area of the cement particles. The results from the consolidation test and the flow properties (cohesion) show that the cement powder flow is mainly controlled by internal forces (Van der Waals and adhesion forces) and external forces. These forces have a direct influence on the powder structure, leading to a variable packing behaviour. Since the problem is attributable mainly to interparticle forces, before storage of the cement powder in the silo, the powder should be fluidised with air at a high velocity to disintegrate the cohesive structure and to overcome this undesirable property of cement flow.",

Free lime, periclase, unreacted silica, and secondary alite should be easy to recognize, but were not observed. Chlorine or sodium were not detected in the clinker. More potassium sulphate was associated with belite, than with a lite, and the texture of the interstitial potassium sulphate suggests that at high temperature, molten potassium sulphate wets the belite crystals, but not the alite crystals.",

    "abstract": "To confirm the resistance of sodium polyphosphate-modified class F fly ash/calcium aluminate blend (SFCB) cements to an H 2 SO 4 solution (pH 1·6) at 90°C, various different organic polymer dispersions were incorporated into the cements. It was found that acrylic-styrene copolymer (ASC), with a pH ∼4, was the most effective in mitigating acid erosion of the cements. The reasons for making them less susceptible to acid attack are due to the following two major roles of ASC. The first is ASC's chemical affinity for the Ca 2+ ions liberated from monocalcium aluminate (CA) and calcium dialuminate (CA 2 ) in the calcium aluminate cement (CAC) reactant, so forming Ca-complexed carboxylate compounds in the interfacial contact zone between ASC and CAC. The other role is related to the coverage of the reaction products by the ASC film and the unreacted CAC and fly ash particles, generating a network structure. These roles significantly restrain the formation of gypsum yielded by the reaction between H 2 SO 4 and CAC. Gypsum is detrimental to the cements because it expands, making them vulnerable to acid erosion, because of its expansion nature. The loss in weight of ASC-modified SFCB cements after exposure for 25 days to hot acid was only 2·6%, compared with 27·3% in unmodified cements after the same exposure time.",

Moreover, the degree of degradation of a solution with sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 ) as the cathode and magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ) as the anode was higher than that of a solution with magnesium sulfate as both cathode and anode; also the degradation degree of a magnesium sulfate solution under full immersion was higher than that of a sodium sulfate solution under full immersion.",

The use of a reduced alkali concentration could thus be promising, especially for road subgrade stabilisation, where long-term serviceability (controlled by plasticity index (PI) and unconfined compressive strength (UCS)) is not overly demanding. The aim of this research was thus to evaluate the possible usage of low alkali solutions to fulfil the minimum requirements of UCS &gt; 1033 kPa and PI &lt; 30% for stabilised road subgrade at room temperature. For a constant fly ash (FA)/solid (soil + FA) ratio, 1, 4 and 8 M sodium hydroxide solutions and a residue cleaning solution (RCS) containing sodium hydroxide (≤ 1 M) were employed to treat a natural clay with UCS = 188 kPa and PI = 32.1%. Mechanical, characterisation and microstructural tests were conducted to assess how the various alkali concentrations promoted alkaline activation and affected the inherent properties of the clay. The activators containing ≤1 M sodium hydroxide successfully satisfied the design criteria, although they required a longer curing time than the 4 M and 8 M sodium hydroxide activators. Furthermore, compared with the 1 M sodium hydroxide activator, the RCS was found to perform better in terms of mechanical strength gain and particle connections due to its initial aluminium content.",

The results of hydration heat evolution, hydrates analysis and mechanical properties indicate arcanite (K 2 SO 4 ), thenardite (Na 2 SO 4 ), aphthitalite (3K 2 SO 4 ·Na 2 SO 4 , K 3 NS 4 ) and Ca-langbeinite (K 2 SO 4 ·2CaSO 4 , KC 2 S 3 ) in clinker could activate the pozzolanic activity of fly ash and slag, facilitating the appearance of the second hydration peak in the initial hydration period, and promote the hydration and hardening properties of blended cement. The adverse effects of alkali sulfates in clinker are alleviated with the addition of fly ash and slag; this can be attributed to the dilution and filler effects of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), as well as the effect of the alkali sulfates activating fly ash and slag. Arcanite, thenardite and aphthitalite (K 3 NS 4 ) provide a better activating effect on mortar with slag than fly ash mortar to increase compressive strength and reduce drying shrinkage when the content of alkali sulfates is less than 0.6% sodium oxide equivalent (Na 2 O eq ).",

It was found that sintering SAC clinker with Ba and I-AH as alumina carriers accelerated the rate of the solid-phase reaction, promoted the formation of the target phase and led to the formation of ye'elimite with a small grain size. The compressive strength at each age was thus higher. However, when amorphous alumina was used as the alumina carrier to sinter SAC clinker, the solid-phase reaction rate was slow, which hindered the formation of the target phase, free alumina appeared and ye'elimite with a large grain size was formed, so the compressive strength at each age is lower. Aluminium oxide with finer particle size can be decomposed from I-AH and Ba during calcination, which can accelerate the solid-phase reaction rate and promote the formation of the target phase. The associated element in Ba (titanium) can lead to the formation of more α′ H -C 2 S, but obstructed the formation of ye'elimite.",

The findings this work indicated that physical, mechanical and microstructural damage of the specimens due to acid attack increased with an increase in the percentage of WGC.

    "abstract": "To better understand the hydration of slag, various combinations of slag–anhydrite–lime were investigated, mainly by conduction calorimeter. Compressive and bending strength were also measured. The following conclusions were obtained: in the case of existing calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ), hydration products were calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) and aluminium-rich (Al, Si, Ca)OH gel. C–S–H had a calcium/silicate ratio of 1·4 and the aluminium-rich (Al, Si, Ca)OH gel was located on the surface of unreacted slag particles to hinder the hydration of slag. A mixture of slag and anhydrite (without lime) reacted to produce C–S–H and ettringite, but the initiation time of reaction was very long – as much as 400 h. In this case, the calcium oxide/silica (CaO/SiO 2 ) ratio of the calcium-silicate-hydrate was considered as low as 0·6 to 0·8. Monosulfate (AFm(SO 4 )) was not produced from slag hydration, as the solubility of slag is lower than that of monosulfate. The compressive strength of mortar without gypsum was 25 N/mm 2 at 91 d, whereas that containing gypsum of 15% by mass was 70–80 N/mm 2 at 91 d. In the case of 2% calcium hydroxide, the compressive strengths with gypsum were all less than 15 N/mm 2 at 91 d and they were lower than that without gypsum of 25 N/mm 2 at 91 d. Reducing the addition of calcium hydroxide was very effective for mortar strength with gypsum but addition in excess of 2% retarded the hydration. The strength of mortar without formation of ettringite (slag–lime system) had lower bending/compressive strength ratio.",

Using the SVM algorithm and GLCM theory, the internal average crack width of concrete and the contrast, correlation, angular second moment (ASM) and inverse difference moment (IDM), which characterise the change in slice texture information, were used as degradation parameters. Using the average internal crack width and IDM as the degradation index, a reliability degradation competition failure analysis was conducted to study RMOCC's law of internal crack formation. The results showed that the SVM algorithm had a greater than 95% accuracy in recognising cracks. In the entire corrosion-induced crack formation process, IDM and the average internal crack width values were consistent with the normal distribution. Through reliability degradation competition failure analysis between IDM and the average crack width value, the average crack width calculated with SVM is more suitable for the degradation analysis of internal corrosion-induced cracks in RMOCC.",

It was found that the addition of EV resulted in an increase in the standard-consistency water consumption and setting times. As a consequence, excessive addition of EV resulted in a larger amount of harmful pores, which was detrimental for the compressive strength of the paste. However, geopolymer pastes with an appropriate amount of EV (2–7 wt%) showed a slight increase in compressive strength because of the filler effect. Mg 2+ and Fe 3+ diffused from the EV interlayers through ion exchange between the EV and the geopolymer, and participated in geopolymerisation. This was reflected by the formation of N-(M)-A-(F)-S-H, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. In addition, Na + /Mg 2+ or Na + /Fe 3+ ion exchange reduced the mobility of Na + the ions and therefore decreased the extent of efflorescence. Moreover, EV addition favoured an improvement in moisture content and the thermal conductivity properties of the geopolymer paste.",

    "abstract": "Compressive strength, a crucial mechanical property of cement mortars, is typically measured destructively. However, there is a need to evaluate the strength of unique cement-based samples at various ages without causing damage. In this paper, a predictive framework using a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for estimating the compressive strength of ordinary cement-based mortars based on their dynamic elastic modulus, measured non-destructively using the impulse excitation technique. By combining the Popovics model (PM) and the Lydon–Balendran model (LBM), the static elastic modulus of samples was calculated using constant coefficients, representing an equivalent compressive strength. A GA was then employed to determine optimal values for these coefficients. The results showed that the LBM-based strength was dominant in the middle range of the dynamic Young's modulus while the PM-based strength was dominant for higher and lower values of the dynamic Young's modulus. The model was found to have a small root mean square error (3.1%). The findings suggest that this non-destructive model has potential for predicting the mechanical properties of cement mortars. It allows efficient evaluation of compressive strength without destructive testing, offering advantages for reliable assessments of cement-based materials.",

The compressive strength of the hardening cement pastes decreased remarkably for the pastes with C SG &gt; 0.05 wt%. Ultrasonic waveforms appeared after 2 h of hydration and the waveform amplitudes of cement pastes with SG contents of 0.15 wt% and 0.20 wt% were obviously larger than those of cement pastes with C SG = 0.05 wt% in the early hydration stage. The hydration process of the cement paste over 300 h was classified into three stages based on the head wave amplitude variation – the fluctuation period, the rapidly increasing period and the smoothly increasing period. The acoustic propagation time changed greatly with hydration before a hydration age of 48 h, indicating that the hydration and hardening process of the cement paste was intense in the first 48 h. The proposed ultrasonic monitoring method opens a new perspective for studying the hydration behaviour of SG-blended cement paste.",

This study investigated the effects of compound polycarboxylate superplasticiser (PCE) and early strength agent, calcium nitrite (Ca(NO 2 ) 2 ), on flowability and early strength of belite calcium sulfoaluminate (BCSA) cement. Variation patterns of setting time, fluidity, strength and polycarboxylate superplasticiser (PCE) adsorption of the paste were measured; the hydration products and microscopic morphology were also analysed by the heat of hydration, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that calcium nitrite effectively enhanced adsorption of PCE onto the surface of BCSA cement particles, leading to notable improvement in the fluidity of the paste (reaching up to 275 mm). In the initial hydration stage, 0.7% PCE compounded with 1.2% calcium nitrite inhibited the formation of ettringite (AFt), resulting in prolonged setting time. However, it deepened the degree of hydration of BCSA for 3 days and refined the hydration product, AFt crystals. Consequently, the compressive strength was increased to 95.75 MPa and 107.13 MPa for BCSA cement at 3 days and 28 days, respectively.",

The 517 phase with 94.56% purity was synthesised and the erosion effect of different calcium salts on the 517 phase was characterised. Results show that, in the solution, Ca 2+ combined with SO 4 2− in the 517 phase, resulting in an increase in the spacing between the MgO 6 octahedron layers in the 517 phase, thus destroying the structure of the 517 phase. Moreover, when ions diffused, the MgO 6 octahedron and Cl − recombined into the 518 phase (5Mg(OH) 2 ·MgCl 2 ·8H 2 O). In addition, insoluble weddellite was found to erode the 517 phase to a certain extent, whereas the 517 phase blended with gypsum was stable. The simulation results of molecular dynamics also showed that Ca 2+ had better adsorption ability for SO 4 2− and Cl − than Mg 2+ . When it was in contact with the 517 phase, Ca 2+ was absorbed near SO 4 2− and Cl − was brought into the system.",

A mixture of kaolin, quartz and sodium hydroxide was calcined to prepare SSC by grinding clinkers with lime and gypsum. Preparation factors were investigated and multiple characterisation methods were adopted to explore the calcination and hydration mechanisms. The sodium hydroxide additive was found to reduce the activation temperature of the kaolin and a moderate addition of sodium hydroxide improved the compressive strength of SSC made from calcined kaolin. Quartz added into the kaolin calcined with a moderate amount of sodium hydroxide also promoted the compressive strength. Comprehensive characterisations indicated that the alkali-added calcination of the kaolin generated pozzolanic zeolite and sodium aluminosilicates along with inert nepheline at a calcination temperature ≤950°C. The hydration of SSC pastes tended to produce C(N)–A–S–H/N(C)–A–S–H gels and crystalline ettringite. During sodium hydroxide-added calcination, quartz added into the kaolin hindered the generation of inert nepheline and produced cementitious N–S gels. The research facilitates the utilisation of the massive discharged coal gangues rich in kaolinite and quartz by synthesising SSCs economically.",

The structural evolution during the heating process of waste cement paste powder and the carbonation process of RBMs were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy and 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, and the compressive strength of the carbonated RBM samples was measured. The results show that the differences in carbonation reactivity, carbonation products of the RBMs and properties of carbonated RBMs can mainly be attributed to the differences in the degree of structural order of newly formed β-dicalcium silicate (C 2 S), the content of β-C 2 S, free calcium oxide (f-CaO) and incompletely decomposed calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) in RBMs. The strength of the carbonated sample of RBM prepared at 1050°C was the highest, followed by that prepared at 950°C, which was significantly higher than those prepared at 650, 750 and 850°C. The content of highly ordered β-C 2 S in RBMs with high carbonation reactivity and the dense stacking of the carbonation products are beneficial for the mechanical properties.",

New phases, brucite and basic magnesium chlorides, were formed, the latter principally in microcracks. In the otherwise unaltered internal zone the concentration of chloride ions was high, being equal to the concentration in the external layer. But the C/S was unchanged and the concentration of magnesium ions was very small, The beginning of the densification process of C-S-H phase can be observed in the transition zone.",

Analytical electron microscopy has also been carried out on pure iron powder dispersed in the same mix formulations. All specimens were cured under conditions which mildly accelerate corrosion: 40°C and 100% relative humidity (RH). Anion inhibition efficiency is found to vary with cure duration, but after 180 days their inhibition is in the order nitrite &lt; borate &lt; molybdate. Both impedance spectroscopy and electron microscopy analyses indicate that molybdate inhibition is achieved through surface layer formation involving molybdenum participation during the normal thickening of the passivating iron oxide film. Similarities between the modes of inhibition of molybdate and borate are inferred and overall mechanisms are discussed; borate is, however, a less satisfactory additive because it inhibits cement hydration.",

The resultant strength increases with increasing pressure of compaction and is higher if high-strength, rather than ordinary Portland cement, is used as a starting material. The strength also increases if silica fume or natural wollastonite with acicular crystal morphology is added to the starting mix",

The composition of cement in turn, depends heavily on the raw materials, the geological origin thereof and the manufacturing process. In previous research, the major element composition of cement has been well-characterised, but the minor and trace element composition in many cases has not. This investigation is an attempt to analyse some of the materials comprising cement, cement clinker and gypsum, for a suite of trace elements that will provide a unique fingerprint of the final product. It was found that for both the clinker and the gypsum a suite of trace elements can be successfully employed to uniquely characterise the materials. The contribution of such a fingerprint is that it can provide valuable information in the case of a forensic analysis for discrimination purposes and also predict the behaviour of these species with regard to their immobilisation in a cementitious matrix.",

    "abstract": "The overall aim of this paper is to establish the engineering properties and material durability of Portland limestone cements, particularly when they are exposed continually to an environment rich in magnesium sulphate ions, and conducive to thaumasite formation. In particular, non-destructive and destructive tests were used to identify and examine the interaction of the changes in mechanical properties with the onset of sulphate attack. To achieve these objectives, 40 × 40 × 160 mm mortar specimens were subjected to air curing at 5°C and 20°C, and also immersed in 1·8% MgSO4 solution, again at 5°C and 20°C. The limestone content in the test specimens was kept at 0%, 5%, 15% and 35% replacement of cement by mass. The formation of thaumasite was checked and confirmed by x-ray diffraction supported by thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The non-destructive tests used in the study included pulse velocity, dynamic modulus, shrinkage, expansion and changes in mass. In addition, flexural and compressive strengths were determined. All the tests were carried out up to one year. The results obtained from the tests have then been critically analysed. It is shown that mortar prisms containing 35% limestone and exposed to magnesium sulphate solution at 5°C suffered extensive damage and deterioration within one year. In addition, prisms containing 15% limestone gave strong signs of impending damage due to sulphate attack. The results of the non-destructive and destructive tests were highly complementary, and confirmed each other. The major mechanical deterioration occurred through the loss of compressive strength of almost 75% of that of the original unaffected mortar, whilst the loss in flexural strength was relatively small. The results strongly indicate that compression members, containing 35% limestone and exposed to aggressive sulphate environment at temperatures of about 5°C, can be seriously at risk in their ability to carry loads. On the other hand, it is unlikely that flexural members under these conditions would suffer the same degree of serious structural damage.",

The relative intensities for the resonances from the calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) phase in these spectra show that addition of kaolinite results in a C–S–H phase that on average has longer chains of SiO4 tetrahedra as compared to the results for pure WPC. On the other hand, addition of bentonite results in a C–S–H with slightly shorter average SiO4 chain lengths. Furthermore, the 29Si MAS NMR spectra demonstrate that the basic structure of the kaolinite admixture is not affected by the hydrating cement and that kaolinite is not consumed during hydration. This observation is supported by 27Al MAS NMR which also shows that the rate of formation of ettringite is very similar for the pure WPC and the WPC–kaolinite mixture. Finally, the 27Al quadrupole coupling parameters and isotropic chemical shift are reported for octahedrally coordinated aluminum in kaolinite.",

The soil to cement ratio was 1 : 12·5 and CSF was added at 3, 5 and 8% of cement by weight to mixtures during specimen preparation. The tests carried out included compressive strength, water absorption and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. At early curing ages, heavy metals-contaminated soil intensively decreased the compressive strength from 12·3 N/mm 2 in cement mixture to 0·14 N/mm 2 in the soil–cement mixture; and CSF had no noticeable effect on compressive strength but increased the consolidation of the relevant mixtures which satisfied the minimum US Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory limit for safe land disposal. During ageing, CSF gradually enhanced the retarded and diverted cement hydration reactions and the relevant solidified mixtures met the ACI 299R-99 requirement for controlled low strength materials in limited constructions. As an important result, the 28-day-cured soil–cement mixture which included CSF (8% by cement weight) achieved compressive strength of 45 N/mm 2 , which was greater than UK transportation requirement for pavement concrete. Leaching results showed that CSF with a particle size finer than 150 μm and at the added amounts had no significant and noticeable effect on the leaching characteristics. Based on X-ray diffraction patterns, the hydration reactions appeared to be diverted through the production of subsidiary products and as a result, major crystalline phases grew and developed irregularly and consequently coated the aggregates poorly, as observed in scanning electron micrographs. CSF decreased the water absorption of the solidified mixtures in which it was included and their structure became dense.",

MLR model indicates that volumetric ratios of microstructural phases in cement paste are effective in predicting w/c ratios of cement pastes.",

Tests on high alumina cement pastes show that turbulence is likely to occur at Reynolds numbers exceeding 13 which leads to errors in the quantitative determination of yield stress and plastic viscosity.

It was found that the initial setting time obtained by the ‘knife’ test coincides with the end of the induction period, during which the degree of hydration is zero. Initial setting time obtained by the Vicat test coincided with the time when the degree of hydration was 10%. The length change curves could be interpreted in terms of four stages. Shrinkage occurred when water was consumed in the hydration reaction during the time of the Vicat initial setting; a high rate of expansion was initiated when the degree of hydration was about 20% and it was accompanied by a high rate of heat evolution. These two processes terminated at about the same time.",

Subsequently, the semidry acid-anhydrite technique was adapted to the calcining of the precleaned FGD gypsum to reduce the transition temperature of the anhydrite. Accordingly, low-temperature multiphase plaster was prepared using a two-step calcination. The FGD gypsum with sulphuric acid was first calcined at 60°C for 1 h and then recalcined at 150°C for 3 h. The obtained multiphase plaster consisted of 29% hemihydrate, 60% anhydrite II, 10% anhydrite III and 1% dihydrate. At a water to plaster ratio of 0·6, its viscosity and initial and final setting times were 3633 centipoises and 16·28 and 27·83 minutes, respectively. The flexural strength and hardness of the plaster specimens were 5·07 and 10·79 N/mm2. However, the remaining impurities imparted a buff colour to the multiphase plaster. Anhydrite (95% anhydrite II) with crystal morphologies ranging from prismatic to plate-like shapes was achieved by calcining at 100°C for 3 h. Its whiteness measured according to the CIE system was 92·64%.",

The influences of various factors on the exothermic hydration process are taken into consideration. The applicability of the proposed model is verified by a series of adiabatic temperature rise tests.

    "abstract": "Structural concrete components undergo degradation when exposed to sulphate-bearing environments. Diffusion of sulphate ions through concrete pores causes the formation of expansive products such as gypsum and ettringite in the internal microstructure of concrete. This chemical change leads to a significant reduction of strength in structural components. In the literature it has been reported that in blended cements, because of the reduction of calcium hydroxide, magnesium sulphate ions directly react with the cementitious calcium—silicate—hydrate (C—S—H) gel and convert this into non-cementititous magnesium—silicate—hydrate (M—S—H) gel. However, in the present investigation it was observed that, in low-strength concrete (20 MPa), blended cements show more resistance than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) because of the pozzolanic and dilution effect of added fly ash and slag. In this concrete, the expansive product, namely gypsum, densifies the porous pore structure and does not cause any cracking. In the case of medium-strength concretes (30 and 40 MPa), the pozzolanic and dilution effects of blended cements are not very significant and hence they did not show any increase in sulphate resistance compared with OPC cement. In these medium-strength concretes because of their pore structure, the expansive products cause micro-cracks. The inferior performance of concretes with blended cements due to magnesium ion attack is mainly attributed to the formation of ettringite and gypsum, as in the case of sodium sulphate, and these cause more micro-cracks in comparison with OPC cement. Thermal analysis also confirms this.",

The pastes had 0, 20 and 40% VP as cement replacement and water to binder ratios (W/B) of 0·40, 0·50 and 0·60. The accelerated chloride ion diffusion test was used to calculate the chloride ion diffusion coefficient (Di) of pastes using the Nernst–Plank equation for steady-state condition. In addition, electrical resistivity, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were also conducted. Good correlations were found between Di, total pore volume and electrical resistivity of the pastes. The Di values of VP-blended pastes were within the range of 10−7–10−9 cm2/s. It was also found that blending cement with VP significantly reduced the long-term chloride ion diffusion coefficient and hence increased the long-term corrosion resistance of pastes. This fact was also supported by the presence of lower quantity of Ca(OH)2 and higher quantity of Friedel's salt in the VP-blended pastes as observed from the DSC tests. Pastes with 40% VP showed better performance in terms of chloride ion diffusivity. The water to binder ratio was also found to affect the Di at the early ages of curing, but became less important at the later ages of curing.",

For the optimisation of the quality of GBFS it is recommended to maintain Al2O3 over 10·5% and CaO over 40%. It was found by27 Al NMR investigation that aluminium in GBFS is mainly tetrahedrally coordinated. However with rising Al2O3 so-called ‘tricluster’ is formed in the slag glasses.

This paper presents the effect of nano-silica on the properties of magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC), such as setting time, the hydration process, compressive strength, composition and microstructure of the paste. Results show that nano-silica can promote the hydration process and shorten the initial and final setting times of MOC, which were shortened by 14% and 8% when 5% nano-silica was incorporated in the MOC. In addition, nano-silica can increase the compressive strengths and make the pore structure of MOC denser. The compressive strengths at 3 days and 28 days increase by 29.5% and 18.0%, respectively, when 5% nano-silica is incorporated in MOC. Compared with the pure MOC paste, nano-silica yields no new hydration products in MOC besides P5 and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2 ). The higher compressive strength is mainly attributed to the water absorption and filling effect of nano-silica in MOC slurry.",

    "abstract": "Various strategies have been developed to mitigate the autogenous shrinkage of cement-based materials (CBMs), including internal curing and shrinkage compensation. However, the sole use of internal curing or shrinkage compensation is insufficient in many cases. In this study, magnesia-based expansive additives (MEAs) coupled with a superabsorbent polymer (SAP) were investigated as internal curing agents to mitigate the autogenous shrinkage of cement pastes. The internal relative humidity (RH), autogenous deformation and compressive strength of cement pastes containing two different types of MEAs and SAP were examined. The results showed that, with the incorporation of SAP, the RH in the cement paste was maintained at a higher level than that in cement pastes without SAP, and hence autogenous shrinkage was reduced. The combination of SAP and MEA provided very effective compensation for the autogenous shrinkage of cement paste. Moreover, the cement paste containing 8 wt% MEA and 0.2 wt% SAP produced a gentle expansion of 111 microstrain rather than shrinkage. This was attributed to the increased hydration degree of magnesia owing to the additional water supply provided by the SAP. This study provides a novel and efficient way to mitigate the autogenous shrinkage of CBMs.",

The structure and molecular weights of these two synthesised phosphated superplasticisers (PSPs) and a commercial polycarboxylate superplasticiser (PCE) were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The dispersing, adsorption and hydration behaviours with the addition of potassium sulfate (K 2 SO 4 ) to the cement paste were also analysed. The experimental results showed that, compared with the conventional comb-shaped PCE, the linear structure of the PSPs provided lower dispersing ability but better fluidity retention. The addition of potassium sulfate had an obvious negative effect on the dispersing ability of PCE, while the effect on the PSPs was slight. The adsorption isotherms indicated that, with the addition of 2 wt% potassium sulfate, the competitive adsorption between sulfate ions and PCE was enhanced: the saturated adsorption of PCE decreased by 10.37%, whereas the PSPs were less affected, with the saturated adsorption of SMD-1 only decreasing by 2.32%.

Cement–pozzolan hydration development was studied using isothermal calorimetry. The concretes were subjected to mercury intrusion porosimetry and compressive strength tests.

The water absorbed internally by the preserved RHA pore structure (D 50 ≈ 20 μm) in the high cement replacement (12% RHA) mixes reduced the final autogenous shrinkage of concrete without a decrease in compressive strength.

The pastes had 0, 20 and 40% VA as cement replacement by mass and water/binder ratios of 0·40, 0·50 and 0·60 by mass. The ACID test was used to calculate the chloride ion diffusion coefficient Di , of pastes using the Nernst–Plank equation for steady state conditions. In addition, electrical resistivity, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were also conducted. Good correlations were found among Di , total pore volume and electrical resistivity of the pastes. The Di of VA blended pastes was within the range of 10−7 and 10−9 cm2/s. It was also found that blending cement with VA significantly reduced the long-term chloride ion diffusion coefficient and hence increased the long-term corrosion resistance of pastes. This fact was also supported by the presence of lower quantity of Ca(OH)2 and higher quantity of Friedel's salt in the VA blended pastes as observed from the DSC tests. Pastes with 40% VA showed better performance in terms of chloride ion diffusivity. W/b ratio was also found to affect the Di at the early ages of curing, but became less important at the later ages of curing.",

This observation was confirmed by the determination and comparison of CH content, TGA results, surface area and pore-size distribution of samples hydrated with and without applied stress. Environmental SEM examination provided the evidence that microcracking occurred only in samples hydrated under applied stress. It is suggested that this facilitated the migration of water into the protective layers (around cement grains) that form in the early stages of hydration accelerating the reaction with the unreacted cores of the particles.",

The study shows that resorcinol formaldehyde resin cement pastes possess superior chemical resistance (a minimum of 95% retention of compressive strength after immersing the composites in acid, base and kerosene at room temperature for 24 h) in comparison with virgin cement pastes and its composites with phenol formaldehyde and m-cresol formaldehyde. Microstructural studies reveal that the properties of phenolic resin cement pastes depend on the molecular interactions between the resins and cement particles in the polymer cement matrix. The resulting interpenetrating polymer network in the composite matrix is responsible for protection against external chemical environments.",

Estimates of the compressibility of the solid hydrates using scanning curves obtained from methanol adsorption isotherms are similar to those obtained from reconstructed ‘reversible’ water adsorption isotherms satisfying the requirement for thermodynamic reversibility. Calculations of the modulus of elasticity as a function of the equilibrium partial pressure of both methanol and water adsorbates are in agreement with measured values.

Depending on their use, the cement-based materials can be exposed to different types of aggressive environments. For instance, damage to concrete structures in contact with a sulfate and saline environment are of most importance. Belite cements have excellent durability against determined expansive attacks and lower heat of hydration than that of Portland cements. These properties convert belite cements into good candidates for the immobilisation of low-level liquid waste and medium-level liquid waste. In this work, the authors present a long-term durability study at 40°C of a kind of belite cement from coal fly ash class C as alternative raw material. The aggressive was a 0·5 mol/l sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) solution, which is common in some evaporator concentrate solutions of medium-level liquid waste and low-level liquid waste. The attack was evaluated by means of flexural strength changes of mortars over 180 days. Furthermore, the changes in microstructure were followed by mercury intrusion porosimetry and mineralogy by X-ray diffraction.",

The nitrate solution attacks the structure of the pastes, temporarily increasing the proportion of AF t and AF m phases, and increases the polymerization of the silica anions. X-ray diffraction of the pastes immersed for a long time showed that amorphous calcium silicate hydrates were formed and peaks were identified as belonging to the ferrite phase. In immersed OPC/csf pastes, some minor crystalline components were found which were derived from the added silica fume.",

None of these, however, is satisfactory for a more scientific and fundamental investigation of the hydration process, since the hardening process could not be followed continuously. These indirect and empirical measurements led to many misconceptions on the hydration process and on the effect of accelerators and retarders, etc. The measurement of conductance provides a non-destructive and continuous method for studying the hydration of cements. The kinetics can be described by two parameters: an induction period, t 0 , and one or two first-order reaction rate constants, k and k′, for the decrease of conductance. The influence of additives on both parameters has been studied extensively.",

With increasing amounts of AS residue, the setting time of the pastes shortened and the compressive strength of the mortar increased at all ages. The hydrated phases in pastes were determined using X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy. Observations indicated that Ca(OH)2 decreased or disappeared and C-S-H gel appeared in large quantity at early ages due to the addition of AS residue. The results obtained from the research confirmed that AS residue has a remarkable pozzolanic activity. It can be used as a supplementary cementing material and will significantly improve some basic properties of cement.",

Brownmillerite and MB were prepared using different raw meals and the effects of MB on the mechanical and hydration properties of cement after replacing cement with MB at 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% by weight at a constant water/binder ratio of 0·44 (25°C) were investigated. The results showed that the optimum temperature for the preparation of brownmillerite was 1350°C (held for 100 min). The addition of MB improved the compressive strength of cement. Specimens with 4 wt% MB (M4) had the highest compressive strength and the tensile strength and toughness of M4 specimens were better than those of specimens without MB (M0). In addition, MB prepared using calcium carbonate (CCMB; elastic modulus 3150 MPa) showed better mechanical properties than MB prepared with calcium hydroxide (CHMB; elastic modulus 4002 MPa) and calcium oxide (COMB; elastic modulus 3765 MPa). A model of the strength enhancement effect of MB on a cement matrix was established. Heat of hydration test results showed that the normalised heat flow of M4 was smaller than that of M0 and the cumulative heat of mortars was in the order M0 (160·29 J) &gt; M4 (154·07 J, COMB) &gt; M4 (152·25 J, CHMB) &gt; M4 (151·98 J, CCMB).",

However, there is little reported research on the hydration expansion properties of magnesia in steel slag. In this work, the effects of the fineness of over-burnt magnesia on the expansion properties and hydration characteristics of blended cement paste (BCP) were investigated and their correlations were studied. The results indicated that the fineness of the over-burnt magnesia was the intrinsic factor controlling the expansion properties and hydration characteristics of the BCPs. At 20°C, the expansion rate of the BCPs gradually increased with an increase in magnesia fineness increase; however, at 60°C, the expansion rate of the BCPs gradually decreased with increased magnesia fineness. The incorporation of magnesia reduced the cement hydration heat, with a lesser reduction for a greater fineness of magnesia. Furthermore, no great difference in the hydration degree of cement was observed with the use of magnesia of different fineness.",

In this work the impact of carbonation on the chloride penetration rate was investigated by exposing normal cement paste specimens and pre-carbonated paste specimens with different water/binder ratios and mineral admixtures to the same cyclic wetting–drying conditions. It was found that either a denser pore structure or a higher chloride binding capacity can slow down chloride penetration. The chloride penetration rate thus depends on the combination of the pore structure, which determines the general permeability of cement pastes, and the chloride binding capacity. However, carbonation is more likely to accelerate chloride penetration regardless of the pore structure, due to the overwhelming decrease in the chloride binding capacity as a result of carbonation.",

The results indicate that the inclusion of fly ash or slag enhances the degree of carbon dioxide uptake.

Electrical resistivity is increased after carbonation curing due to carbonation-induced hydrate formation disrupting carbon nanotube-based conductive networks.

Results show that the sulfate resistance of mortars mixed with SRCMs at a replacement percentage of 74 wt% is superior to that of mortars with 30 wt% fly ash when exposed to drying–wetting cycles in sodium sulfate solution, because adding SRCMs decreases the calcium hydroxide content, causing a reduction in gypsum formation. Moreover, reducing the water-to-binder ratio (W/B) from 0.50 to 0.35 increases the loss of compressive strength ratio (L f ) of mortars with SRCMs immersed in ammonium–magnesium sulfate complex solution. Specifically, the L f values of mortars with W/B of 0.50 and 0.35 are 42.7% and 36.0% after 100 days of immersion, respectively. Furthermore, the main component of samples subjected to complex solution is identified as gypsum. In addition, both L f and porosity exhibit a strong linear positive correlation with W/B. Finally, the findings confirm that optimising the composition of cementitious materials and lowering W/B could improve the sulfate resistance of concretes used for a sulfate-rich sewage environment.",

Their layer structure is derived from that of portlandite (calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 )), but with one third of the Ca 2+ ions replaced by a trivalent ion, nominally Al 3+ or Fe 3+ . The resulting charge imbalance gives the layers a positive charge, which is compensated by intercalated anions; the remaining interlayer space is filled with water (H 2 O). Hydrated cements will contain mixtures of AFm phases and their solid solutions. Portland cement is often modified by addition of soluble nitrate or nitrite salts to protect embedded steel or to shorten the setting time. These nitrate and nitrite ions are capable of entering and occupying AFm anion sites, hence impacting overall phase balances between cement hydrates. In this study AFm phases and solid solution formations were investigated between AFm phases containing SO 4 2− , CO 3 2− , OH − , Cl − and NO 2 − NO 3 − ions.

Mineralogical characterisation was carried out on three samples taken from different layers of the same build-up. Qualitative and quantitative X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that ternesite is the key mineralogical phase responsible for the growth and consolidation of build-up. Its appearance is governed by solid–solid reactions promoted by the available sulfate liquid phases, mainly calciolangbeinite, as well as C 12 A 7 and C 4 AF. The hot-powder calcination degree, amount of sulfur trioxide, lime saturation factor, silica ratio and alumina ratio are the operational data that were correlated to the mineralogical analysis of build-up. Based on this correlation, it is possible to predict the reaction kinetics involved in each layer formation and to estimate the development time of each.

The performance of Mg/Al-LDH modified with polycarboxylate superplasticizer (PCE) adopted into cementitious materials was vitally important, which was urgently necessary to be thoroughly revealed. In this paper, the adoption of four kinds of Mg/Al-LDH-PCE into cement paste has been conducted. The rheological performance and hydration process of cement paste have been analyzed. The results showed that LDH-PCE was advantageous for modifying rheological performance of fresh cement paste. With increased content of LDH-PCE, the viscosity and the yield stress of fresh binder decreased gradually. And LDH3-PCE contributed to the lowest yield stress. The adoption of LDH-PCE prolonged the introduction period of cement paste, but contributed to elevated exothermic peak in the acceleration period and enhanced cumulative hydration heat flow, indicating enhanced hydration of silicates. Due to the enhanced cement hydration with the adoption of LDH-PCE, more hydration products formed in the matrix, and contributed to improved compressive strength. Among the four kinds of LDH-PCEs, the application of LDH3-PCE led to the highest compressive strength of cement mortar at 28d, with 15.6% increment compared with the blank sample.",

The formation of ettringite from additons of C 4 A 3 S and gypsum prevents the hydration of β-C 2 S unless free lime is also present in the mixture.",

The results presented compare the determination of the carbonation front made by spraying a freshly broken surface with phenolphthalein, with those determined from calcium hydroxide determination by thermogravimetry (TG), and from the analysis of silicate anions in calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) using trimethylsilylation (TMS). TG and TMS analyses gave similar results for OPC and PFA concrete and indicated in both cases the presence of a carbonating zone of finite width, although the results of using these methods for the OPC concrete showed carbonation to a greater depth than is indicated by phenolphthalein. For the PFA concrete, however, the different methods gave comparable results. Carbonation affected calcium hydroxide and CSH simultaneously within the carbonating zone. A residue of partially carbonated CSH remained in the carbonated zone, indicated by phenolphthalein, although the calcium hydroxide had completely carbonated. It is concluded that the chemical processes of carbonation are very similar for OPC and PFA concrete.",

This conclusion is supported by SEM examination and porosimetry determinations. It is demonstrated that differences in the value of R 2 (the diameter of the high-frequency arc) for pastes with and without fibre reinforcement can be explained by the contribution to pore structure of both the fibre-cement interface and the cement matrix.",

The leaching of heavy metals Cr (total chromium and of Cr6+), Pb, Cd, Zn, Mn, Co, V, Ti, Ni and Cu in fly ash cement mortars has been investigated by tank leaching and shaken extraction test methods; comparisons are made between the leachability of heavy metals under different pH conditions and of metals from specimens at different curing ages. In addition, a pH controlled shaken extraction test method is proposed; an advantage of this method is that leachant pH remains nearly constant at 6.6 ± 0.3 throughout the extraction process, leading to the diminution of the impact of pH variation of leachant on the leachability of heavy metals. The results of this study mainly indicate that: (a) heavy metals do leach from the tested cement mortars, but the amount leached is small; with increasing fly ash addition and water to binder ratio the leaching of heavy metals from cement mortars increases; (b) in a tank leaching test, the leaching of heavy metals from fly ash cement mortars is also a diffusion controlled process; compared with the tank leaching test, a shaken extraction test can extract more toxic heavy metals from hardened mortars; (c) the leachability of some heavy metals is greatly dependent on leachant pH: for example at pH around 7, leaching of Mn, Zn, total Cr (Cr for short in the following), Cr6+ and Pb will be much increased in comparison to that at pH over 12; (d) the leaching of Co, total Cr and Cr6+ from cement mortars is reduced with curing age, but no evident effect of curing age on the leaching of Cd, Ti, Ni, Mn, Zn and V has been observed; and (e) increased leaching of both Cr and Cr6+ will occur when cement mortars have been carbonated.",

Additionally, they are cost effective because of their less-restrictive raw meal composition compared with that of calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA), in which expensive bauxites are used as the alumina source. Diverse mining residues have been proved to be reliable alumina sources for BCSA production, including the clay residues that cover bauxites (Belterra Clay (BTC)) in the Brazilian Amazon region. The clinkering settings of BCSA using a different (less alumina) BTC were examined in this work. The mineralogy of the BCSA clinkers was optimised by a design of experiments and studied using X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and thermal analysis. The raw meal composition, boron doping and firing temperature were investigated to obtain the optimal clinker composition. Hydration of the cement pastes was investigated by calorimetry and the strength development of mortars was tested and compared with that of a commercial OPC. The BCSA mortars produced with gypsum additions developed compressive strength comparable to that that OPC within 28 days.

In the scheme, gel pores are included in the solid skeleton, composed of calcium hydroxide, unhydrated cement and calcium silicate hydrate, while capillary pores and the solid skeleton constitute pure cement paste. In combination with percolation theory, the effective medium method was modified to formulate the chloride diffusivities of the solid skeleton and pure cement paste sequentially. Detailed analysis was conducted to calibrate the percolation exponent for the high-diffusivity phase and the chloride diffusivity of the pore solution. Comparisons with various test results were made to verify the proposed scheme. Unlike existing analytical methods, the physical properties, volume fractions and morphological relationships of various phase constituents and the shapes, percolation behaviour and different roles of gel and capillary pores are all taken into account simultaneously. The calibrated chloride diffusivity of the pore solution was found to be considerably close to that derived by molecular dynamics simulation, suggesting that the scheme represents a more realistic pure cement paste. The scheme can reasonably evaluate the chloride diffusivity of pure cement paste at medium and long curing ages.",

Under hydrothermal conditions the hydrogarnet phase is formed as the main reaction product, together with tobermorite and anhydrite. Depending on the composition of the ashes, the strength of the hardened material can be enhanced by the addition of some other cementitious constituents, particularly blast furnace slag. Due to the favourable strength-to-bulk density ratio, the hardened material may be considered a lightweight cementitious product.",

Modelling requires the identification of two parameters (permeability of the fresh cement paste and a source term) that describe water requirements during setting. The permeability coefficient is examined through a drainage experiment, coupled to the inverse analysis for identification of the coefficients resulting from the solution of the Richard's equation.

Ultra-lightweight cement pastes (such as foamed cements) are appropriate for formation damage prevention in fractured and depleted reservoirs. In this work, foamed cements were prepared at high shear rates using a foaming agent primarily composed of sodium lauryl ether sulfate, boric acid and a retarder (JR120). This formulation was called FBJ. The samples were subjected to tests for density, rheology, free water, settling, thickening time, compressive strength (CS), fluid loss, porosity and permeability, along with microscopic photography and computed tomography scanning. Compared with other drilling cements, the FBJ was found to have one of the lowest densities (1200 kg/m 3 ), a CS of 8963 kPa and a thickening time of about 3 h. The rheology of the FBJ improved under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. Examinations of the set FBJ also showed that the pores were not interconnected, the porosity of the FBJ was greater than 73% and 28% of the FBJ was matrix. Moreover, cement permeameter tests indicated that the permeability of the FBJ was just 0.0109 mD (1 mD ≈ 1 × 10 −12 cm 2 ). All of these results show that the formulated FBJ has acceptable properties for oil/gas wells cementing applications.",

Given that residual carbon is usually present to some degree in CGA, its effects on the formation of tobermorite were specifically studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption–desorption tests. The results showed that tobermorite can be prepared from a CGA/calcium oxide mixture at 160°C without additional alkaline material. However, residual carbon can retard the transformation of calcium silicate hydrate into tobermorite and thus increase the required formation temperature while prolonging the formation time.

Factors contributing to the performance of ground fly ash in cementitious composites were investigated. It was found that grinding significantly crushed large cenosphere particles and increased the specific gravity and surface area of fly ash, which led to a higher filler effect and improved the rate of cement hydration, contributing to strength development. The comparison of strength of quartz-blended pastes and fly ash-blended pastes showed that the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash marginally contributes to strength development. The major influence of ground particles was seen in the region near aggregates. Ground fly ash significantly increased the microhardness of the interfacial transition zone near aggregates. Since this zone has a direct influence on the failure of mortars and concrete, its improvement resulted in a comparable strength of fly ash-blended mortars to the reference ordinary Portland cement mortar.",

    "abstract": "This study is undertaken to explore, first, the dispersibility of dual-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by way of non-covalent modification. Various non-ionic and ionic surfactants were employed and mutually combined with varying relative proportions. Then, the best few combinations from the dispersion test were used further for producing mortar mixtures reinforced with CNTs. These samples were later assessed for their mechanical strength and chloride resistance. A suite of morphological, thermal and microstructural characterisations was carried out to understand the underlying mechanisms. The results show that, compared with the single modification, the dispersibility of CNT could be improved more significantly by way of the dual modification. In particular, 70–90% of non-ionic surfactant, in proportion to the total surfactant addition, imparted the best dispersibility to CNTs in an aqueous solution. In addition, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy outputs reveal that the enhanced dispersion of CNTs by dual modification promoted the hydration process and the ensuing microstructure evolution of mortar specimens. Together, these offset the strength reduction imparted by entrained pores when introducing chemical surfactants and, more importantly, empowered the chloride resistance of CNT-reinforced mortars.",

The method was established on the basis of 1D and 2D diffusion tests for different concrete strengths, different concentrations of sodium sulfate solution and different immersion periods. Based on the test results, a new 1D diffusion coefficient model, related to concrete strength, sodium sulfate concentration and immersion period, was established. It was found that 2D sulfate diffusion was not simply the superimposition of two 1D diffusions. Under the multi-factor conditions, the average diffusion coefficient in the 2D case (D 2D ) was found to be approximately 1.33 times that of the 1D case (D 1D ). Based on the 1D diffusion coefficient model and the D 2D /D 1D = 1.33 relationship, a new 2D diffusion coefficient model was developed. Complying with Fick's second law, based on the 2D diffusion coefficient model established, the sulfate ion concentration at each point under muti-factor conditions for 2D diffusion could be obtained, which also verified the proposed diffusion coefficient model.",

The microscopic mechanism of the electro-injected silane treatment was determined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results indicated that the resistance to water absorption, sulfate diffusion and chloride diffusion were improved by the EOT of silane.

In this study, a numerical model of autogenous shrinkage of rice husk ash blended cement mortar was proposed. The proposed numerical model was based on Pickett model and improved by taking visco-elastic behaviour of rice husk ash blended cementitious materials into account. Final setting time, chemically bound water, compressive strength, internal relative humidity (RH) and autogenous shrinkage of pure Portland cementitious materials and rice husk ash blended cementitious materials were experimentally studied. Liquid absorption capacity and water vapour desorption isotherm of rice husk ash were also measured. The comparison between the simulated and measured autogenous shrinkage showed that the autogenous shrinkage of rice husk ash blended cement mortar can be predicted accurately with the proposed numerical model.",

Excavated LC spoils are typically landfilled or used for landscaping purposes with minimal value. This study investigates the feasibility of producing belite–ye’elimite–ferrite (BYF) cements using LC in combination with kaolin or low-grade bauxite. Six cement clinkers with varying compositions were synthesised at 1300°C. The phase composition of the synthesised clinkers was quantified using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) coupled with Rietveld refinement. The hydration behaviour, phase assemblage evolution and mechanical performance of the cements were examined using isothermal calorimetry, XRD, thermogravimetric analysis and compressive strength testing, respectively, up to 90 days of curing. It is demonstrated that LC can be used either on its own or with kaolin or low-grade bauxite to produce BYF cements with a wide range of composition: 31 to 64 wt% belite, 9.3 to 27 wt% ye’elimite and 2.1 to 31 wt% ferrite. The use of LC as the sole alumina source resulted in low compressive strength at early stages. Nevertheless, the strength developed over time, reaching 27.8 MPa at 90 days (0.5 w/b). Possible approaches to develop LC further for producing viable BYF cements are discussed.",

In this study, an unsteady numerical calculation model was developed, incorporating the porous media model and the local thermal non-equilibrium model, to describe the flow and heat transfer processes in the grate cooler. The reliability of the calculation model was verified using thermal measurement data. The simulation was carried out, and the effects of the cooling gas mass flow rate on the distribution of clinker temperature and exhaust gas temperature was discussed. The results show that both the gas and clinker temperatures decrease along the lengthwise direction of the grate cooler and increase along the direction of clinker layer thickness. As the cooling gas mass flow rate increases, the cooling effect of the clinker increases. However, the magnitude of this increase weakens as the air volume increases. Recirculating low-temperature air to the front chamber can improve the heat recovery efficiency of the grate cooler while ensuring effective clinker cooling.",

A study of the behaviour of cement slurry during the curing period has been performed in order to relate to slurry properties such as intrusion and migration of gas in the cement. A new method for measuring the permeability and the strength of a curing cement has been developed. At specific times during the curing, water is pumped into the cement paste at a very low rate while pressure is recorded. The pumping is then stopped for a short time while the pressure drops back to normal pressure. The pump is then restarted at maximum rate causing the curing cement to fracture. The fracturing pressure appears as a sharp peak in the pressure against time curve. Using the flow rate and the pressure recording during the first low-rate pumping period, the permeability is calculated. The tensile strength of the cement is proportional to the peak pressure of the second high-rate pumping pressure. The method can be used throughout the whole time interval of interest from initial to final set, and has shown good reproducibility. The behaviour of three parameters has been found to be of importance regarding gas tightness: the permeability development, the build up of tensile strength and the hydrostatic pressure drop.",

These treatments always enhanced the performance, their effectiveness depending on the type of dispersion and fibre. In composites reinforced with alkali-resistant (AR) glass fibres, both dispersions were equally effective in eliminating almost any loss in strength during accelerated ageing, but the silica fume treatment was more effective in limiting the loss in toughness. The treatment of E glass fibres with polymer latex enhanced the ageing performance to levels better than those of untreated AR glassfibre reinforced composites, although the polymer did not completely eliminate chemical attack of the E glass. The influence of the two treatments is discussed in terms of their effectiveness in providing a barrier to chemical attack and their ability to preserve the flexibility of the reinforcing strands by slowing down or preventing enhanced fibre-matrix bond due to growth of hydration products around the filaments in the strand.",

The onset of silicate anion condensation, calcium hydroxide precipitation, and final set occurred almost simultaneously once the poisoning effect of sucrose had been overcome. The superiority of cellobiose over sucrose as a retarder was attributed to its better calcium solubilizing ability, and the poor performance of starch was due to the low solubility of its alkaline degradation products. Although the kinetics of hydration are altered, the silicate anion distribution of C-S-H at a given degree of hydration is unaffected.",

The expansion of the mortar due to alkali-silica reaction is reduced, and it is found in all cases that alkali dilution due to the replacement can play only a minor role in the reduction of expansion. It is hypothesized that a major mechanism of this reduction is an increase in the effective SiO 2 /Na 2 O ratio to values in excess of the pessimum value; it is found that the greater is the deviation of this ratio from the pessimum value, the less is the expansion, the order of effectiveness of the replacements being PS &gt; PFA &gt; ggbs. The replacements are more effective in reducing the expansion due to alkali-silica reaction than they are in reducing the loss in bending strength of mortar bars. Observations by transmission electron microscopy of the microstructure of PFA/OPC/SG mortars show that the glass particle surfaces develop a layer of CSH reaction product of lower thickness than that of equivalent mortars without replacement, and that the PFA particles also develop a surface layer of CSH reaction product, but of different morphology to that of glass particle reaction product layers.",

The mechanical properties of these organo-mineral cements depend on the types of sodium silicate and isocyanates that are combined, and on the accelerating and modifying agents that may be added. The flexural strength of the pure hardened cements can reach 10 M Pa, and the compressive strength 30 M Pa. The setting times vary from a few seconds to several weeks. The hardened cement seems to be an intimate mixture of at least two phases: an organic phase consisting of a polyisocyanate resin, and an inorganic phase consisting mainly of an amorphous silica gel and various carbonates of alkali and earth alkali metals. Thus, the hardening process takes place simultaneously in the two phases. The isocyanates react to a polymeric material, liberating CO 2 . This in turn acts as a catalyst for the setting of the alkali silicates, yielding an SiO 2 gel and various carbonate phases as reaction products. Five different carbonates have so far been identified. The paper summarizes results obtained to date in a current research programme sponsored by the German Research Foundation for pure organo-mineral cements and some mortars made therefrom.",

    "abstract": "The results of a study on creep of D-dried hydrated C3S paste after exchange of water in saturated samples with organic solvent are presented. Length and mass changes were also measured when saturated C3S paste prepared at a water-solid ratio of 0·4 was immersed in both methanol and isopropanol. A differential thermogravimetric technique was used in order to determine the effect of solvent treatment on dehydration of C3S paste, and its correlation with pore structure, modulus of elasticity and microhardness. Methanol and isopropanol exchanges prior to drying reduce the magnitude of creep in the dry state, suggesting an irreversible interaction of solvent with C-S-H.",

    "abstract": "In this paper the recrystallisation reactions of granulated blast-furnace slags (GBS) with different chemical compositions were studied. The investigations were carried out with X-ray powder method on the chemically modified technical GBS. During the heating merwinite first crystallised at approximately 750°C and converted to melilite with rising temperatures. The concentrations of the crystallised mineral phases merwinite and melilite depend on the CaO content. The merwinite concentration increases and the melilite concentration decreases with rising CaO content. Depending on the chemical composition the structural parameters of the melilite vary in the range between gehlenite and åkmernite. Due to the good correlation between the gehlenite concentration and the reactivity of the GBS the gehlenite concentration can be regarded as an indicator for the reactivity of the GBS.",

    "abstract": "The role of the silicate ratio in determining the content of calcium hydroxide liberated in the hydration process and the effect of additives on sulphate attack was evaluated. The resistance of Portland cements with varying silicate ratios and blended cements with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) or fly ash (FA) to sulphate attack was assessed by determining the deterioration factor (DF) and length change caused in mortar specimens with immersion to a 5% sodium sulphate solution. Additionally, microstructural investigations were performed by instrumental analysis (XRD, ESEM, EDS, MIP and DTA). Results of this study indicate that the silicate ratio is more influential than C3A content on sulphate attack resistance. The performance of blended cements was better than that of parent cements and is attributed to the lower calcium hydroxide content of blended cements resultant from pozzolanic reaction.",

We show that the water retentivity may be characterised by a well-defined and reproducible parameter, the desorptivity. Two methods of measurement are investigated: a capillary suction technique and a pressure cell technique. The pressure cell technique proved to be the better method, capable of measuring the water desorption behaviour of mortars over the full range of pressures which represent the suctions of typical masonry materials. Values of desorptivities of cement/sand, lime/sand and cement/lime/sand mortars are presented. The empirical test to assess the water retentivity of cement mortars included in BS 4551 is evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The final composition of cement is of great importance for both the manufacturer and the consumer, since the behaviour of the cement and its application depend largely on it's composition. The composition of cement in turn, depends heavily on the raw materials, the geological origin thereof and the manufacturing process. In previous research, the major element composition of cement has been well-characterised, but the minor and trace element composition in many cases has not. This investigation is an attempt to analyse some of the materials comprising cement, cement clinker and gypsum, for a suite of trace elements that will provide a unique fingerprint of the final product. It was found that for both the clinker and the gypsum a suite of trace elements can be successfully employed to uniquely characterise the materials. The contribution of such a fingerprint is that it can provide valuable information in the case of a forensic analysis for discrimination purposes and also predict the behaviour of these species with regard to their immobilisation in a cementitious matrix.",

However, recent work has suggested that by adjusting the chemistry and the cooling rate to generate a substantial glassy phase, the potential for hydration and strength development for the granulated product is enhanced. In order to better understand the role of glassy phases in the hydration process, isothermal calorimetry was used to determine the heat release and the rate of hydration within the 25–70°C range. Synthetic slags, of varying glass:crystal ratios, were used along with Portland cement as a reference. The reactivity of the synthetic slags was found to increase with glassy content which is in agreement with the lower activation energies calculated for these slags. Activation energies for slags were found to be greater than for Portland cement.",

    "abstract": "When I was first introduced to concrete in the early 1960s, it seemed to be a relatively 'simple' material, produced using only Portland cement, aggregate and water.Chemical admixtures were mostly confined to air-entraining admixtures and primitive water reducers, and supplementary cementing materials were not commonly used.Cement and concrete were inexpensive, both selling in North America for about $20-25 per tonne.There were then no concerns about 'sustainability', or greenhouse gas emissions, and hence little interest in other (non-Portland) cementing systems.Studies on the hydration mechanisms, or the detailed structure of hydrated cement were considered to be the province only of a few eccentric academics, and were not thought to be of much practical importance.So much has changed since then!The seven papers presented in this issue of Advances in Cement Research would have been largely incomprehensible to the cement researchers of that time, and are excellent exemplars of how much cement science has advanced in the last 50 years.",

A significant and stable ettringite (AFt) content was found in all pastes, perhaps close to 6·5% in certain mixes. The morphology of AFt depended on the initial mix design. Monosulphate (AFm) was detected, the amount present increasing with increasing initial H 2 O content.

Chloride ions react weakly with the cement; however, the addition of superplasticizer produces a marked decrease in Cl ion concentrations in pore fluid, suggesting that chlorination of the superplasticizer (or its degradation products) is occurring, accompanied by precipitation or adsorption of the organic admixture by cement hydration products. Partial chloride removal from the aqueous phase is accompanied by a decrease in the corrosion rates of embedded mild steel, suggesting that chemical factors within superplasticized cement paste may play a useful role in controlling chloride-induced corrosion.",

The effect of sulfates on the early cement hydration evolution in the presence of PCEs with different carboxylic densities was also analysed. It was found that a higher proportion of carboxylate groups in the PCE backbone contributed to more intense adsorption of PCE onto cement grains, which contributed to lower sensitivity to the competitive adsorption of sulfate ions and hence produced higher resistance to the negative impacts of sulfates on fluidity and zeta potential. The addition of sulfates partially eliminated the retardation effect of PCE on cement hydration and boosted the nucleation of hydrates with increased cumulative hydration heat and higher heat evolution peak in the acceleration period. A higher concentration of sulfates led to a greater acceleration effect on cement hydration. However, PCEs with higher carboxylic density showed enhanced resistance to the impacts of sulfates on cement hydration.",

The characterisation of SBML-II showed that the synthesised latex presents a typical core-shell structure and possesses better dispersibility, stability and thermal stability than conventional latex (SBML-I). At the same time, the SBML-II latex forms a membranous morphology more easily than SBML-I at the same temperature and has better compatibility with additives and resistance to ions. Performance evaluation in cement slurry and cement matrix showed that the SBML-II has a good dilution effect on cement slurry and excellent potential to improve the mechanical properties of the cement matrix.

The goal of this study was to investigate the use of multiple biological surface treatments (BSTs) on cement-treated bricks to enhance their resistance to water erosion. Calcite crystals were precipitated on the surface of cement-treated sand bricks by the microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) technique. Multiple BSTs with MICP were used to enhance the properties of the cement-treated bricks further. The experimental results showed that, after a single BST, the flexural strength of the cement-treated bricks increased from 500 kPa to 750 kPa and the compressive strength increased from 3000 kPa to 4000 kPa. Erosion and water absorption were reduced by 71.2% and 16.3%, respectively. Compared with cement-treated bricks without any BST, the cement-treated bricks with triple MICP BSTs showed increases of nearly 140% and 100% in peak flexural and compressive strength, respectively. In addition, the triple BSTs resulted in 32% less water absorption compared with cement-treated samples without any BST. The surface of cement-treated bricks with triple BSTs was found to resist accelerated erosion over a 60 min time period. Overall, the results showed that BST can strengthen the erosion resistance of cement-treated bricks.",

The model is based on the general effective media (GEM) theory and multifractals, considering both the bridging of microcracks and capillary pores and the filling of nano gel pores of cement pastes reinforced with nano-admixtures. To validate the model, water permeability experiments were conducted using a cementitious composite reinforced with graphene oxide and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The calculated results showed good agreement with the experimental measurements, with a decrease in the maximum error from 67.8% to 9.7% compared with the previously proposed GEM theory. Moreover, the theoretical calculations suggest that the reinforcing roles of nano-admixtures in cement paste to improve permeability-related properties may be mainly due to bridging effects in microcracks and capillary pores, rather than the filling of nano gel pores. The findings of this study enrich understanding of the mechanism of reinforcing cement-based materials with nano-admixtures. In addition, the permeability of cementitious composites can be measured directly, rather than the use if other using time-consuming methods.",

In this study, a calcium aluminate clinker was prepared from steel ladle slag by modifying its mineral composition. The slag paste, prepared by mixing slag with water, exhibited flash setting behaviour due to the presence of C 12 A 7 and C 3 A phases. In contrast, the slag clinker, developed by sintering a mixture of a pre-determined quantity of slag and aluminium oxide at 1400°C for 2 h and 4 h, contained CA, CA 2 , gehlenite and ‘Q’ phases. Hydrated slag clinker contained stable C 3 AH 6 , AH 3 and stratlingite with preferential growth of calcium aluminate hydrate prisms along the c-axis, which provided a well-defined raceme-like morphology with an interlinked structure. This improved the setting time and crushing strength of the clinkers after 6 h and 24 h of curing at room temperature. Additionally, the presence of the Q phase, with lamellar prismatic crystals, also helped to enhance strength. The developed clinker also exhibited superior crushing strength as compared with commercially available calcium aluminate cement of medium purity.

To investigate the strength parameters of the specimens, the mechanical strength and mass loss of the specimens at ambient temperatures and after exposure to elevated temperatures were determined. Petrographic image analysis was also conducted to analyse the microstructures of the specimens. The Matlab image processing toolbox was used to calculate the pore area of the samples at room temperature. The results showed that the addition of MWCNTs improved the mechanical properties of the AAS mortars at both ambient and elevated temperatures: the compressive and flexural strengths of the mortars were improved by up to 69% and 85%, respectively. At 400°C, the compressive strength increase of the specimens compensated for the deterioration rate of about 3% mass loss. This temperature should be considered the maximum tolerable degree for AAS mortars.",

    "abstract": "Hydrating cement paste (HCP) may be considered as a kind of porous material. The changes of its pore system and internal moisture state with cement hydration certainly influence its thermal expansion response. This study investigated the influence of hydration time on the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of HCP. Specimens (inner diameter 8 mm × 50 ± 0·5 mm long) were prepared using two water/cement ratios of 0·32 and 0·42. The linear thermal expansion of HCP was measured by a fused silica dilatometer after the HCP had been cured for different periods. The CTE–temperature curves of HCP were plotted from 30 to 60°C at intervals of 5°C. The results demonstrated that the CTE–temperature curve showed an approximately linear decrease, and its linear slope can be regarded as a strong logarithmic function of hydration time. Moreover, its linear slope showed a linear relationship with the degree of hydration. This evidence may potentially be used to show that the hydration development of pure ordinary Portland cement paste can be estimated on the basis of its thermal expansion characteristics over different hydration periods.",

    "abstract": "Portland cement (PC) is one of the world's most important building materials, as it is a fundamental component of concrete. However, the manufacture of PC is highly energy intensive and leads to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). One promising control measure is the use of industrial wastes and by-products as supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) in order to minimise PC consumption, thereby producing greener cement-based products. This study investigates mechanical properties and phase development of hydrothermally treated cement–ground quartz sand blends with the incorporation of fired clay-brick (CB) waste and reactive magnesia (MgO). The addition of CB waste in autoclaved PC–quartz mortar mixes showed that the alumina–silica rich CB waste was pozzolanic when the Al 2 O 3 accelerated formation and increased crystallinity of Al substituted 1·1 nm tobermorite, resulting in the observed strength gain. Autoclaved mortar specimens incorporating reactive MgO showed a reduction in strength with increasing MgO addition. This was a result of dilution when the relative proportion of PC available for the formation of the strength contributing hydration products including tobermorite is decreased.",

Some attempts were also made to apply the kinetic model for interpreting the ASTM C1260 test results obtained when an appositely modified version of this test method was used to assess the capability of lithium nitrate additions in suppressing or mitigating deleterious ASR with a given aggregate. It was found that the kinetic model is capable of discriminating the alkali-reactivity of the sands investigated, through the use of a plot of the two kinetic parameters, M and ln k, derived from the model and assuming ln k as a reactivity criterion. Differently from what was observed using a percentage expansion criterion for defining potentially reactive aggregates, the use of ln k as a reactivity criterion yields an ASR diagnosis for every sand that is independent of the type of Portland cement used in the ASTM C1260 test. A modified version of the ASTM C1260 test procedure can be successfully used to assess the capability of lithium nitrate additions in suppressing deleterious ASR. Application of the kinetic model provides a suitable means of determining effective lithium dosages for deleterious ASR suppression in ASTM C1260 tests.",

Setting times were measured using an automatic Vicat apparatus as an average of five parallel pastes for each sample. The effect of concentration of equimolar K:B mixing water on setting was also assessed for seven different total concentrations ranging from 0 to 0·3125 mol K + B/300 g cement. Phase equilibria of mixing waters calculated by PHREEQC showed a strong relationship between setting times and stability fields of coexisting phases. Each marked change in setting times corresponded to the replacement of the hitherto stable (calcium)-potassium borate hydrate by another. Correlation was observed between the water demand of the precipitating potassium borates and the constituent phases of mature hydrated cement stone.",

Furthermore, porosities of RHA pellets were determined. BSE and Ca maps show the formation of a reaction product layer within the space formerly occupied by RHA. This layer is composed of C-S-H and is thicker in RHA/hydrated lime (125–150 μm) than in RHA/OPC (20–40 μm) pellets after 7 days. Its thickness does not much increase after 7 days. In a fixed time, reaction extends to greater depth at 20°C than 40°C, indicating that the pozzolanic reaction rate is not accelerated by temperature in this range.",

By using X-ray diffractometry, mercury intrusion porosimetry, thermogravimetry and scanning electron microscopy, it was revealed that the hydration of tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) is significantly retarded by the lack of gypsum; the renewed hydration of tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) was retarded in cement pastes containing a high amount of C 4 A 3 $. The dosage of C 4 A 3 $ and the ratio of gypsum/C 4 A 3 $ both have a notable influence on the hydration heat, hydration products and the compressive strength and linear expansion. The cement paste containing 3% C 4 A 3 $ at gypsum/C 4 A 3 $ ratio of 2 exhibited the best performance, in terms of both high early and long-term compressive strength and acceptable linear expansion (0·04% on 300 d); the cement can therefore be adopted in industrial structures.",

The polymer concrete cured at an elevated temperature showed a higher rate of compressive strength and elastic modulus gain than that cured at room temperature (20°C). For cylinders that were cured at an elevated temperature (70°C) and silane-treated, both the ascending and descending branches of the compressive stress-strain1 curve became steeper and more linear. A stress-strain model was developed to represent the stress-strain relationship of polymer concrete under compression.

The application of this curing method enables very high early strength, as high as 420 MPa to be obtained after 1 day by a total microwave curing duration of 2 h. In addition it was observed that the achieved strength depended on the kind of nanoscale pozzolan (oxide) used and on the microwave energy, time of treatment and treatment duration. In comparison with the oven curing method this method has the advantages of much shorter curing times and better curing efficiency. The microwave curing of ultra-high performance concrete seems to be very advantageous for applications where extreme concrete strength in very short time is required.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties and fracture mechanism of quasi-brittle materials are considered to be largely reliant on the mechanical properties of meso-components and the structure formed when these components are combined. In recent numerical simulation practice, a trend has developed whereby the real structure of materials is considered in as accurate a way as possible. In this paper, the macroscopic and mesoscopic bending behaviours of steel fibre-reinforced reactive powder concrete (RPC) slabs with fibre volume content between 0.0% and 2.5% were investigated using both experimental tests and numerical simulations. Images obtained from X-ray computed tomography (CT) were input into a program named RFPA 3D -CT to build a modified three-dimensional finite-element method model. The results indicate that the steel fibres can help to convert a brittle failure pattern of RPC into a ductile one. Compared with specimens without fibres, the crack tortuosity and bending strength of specimens with fibre content of 2.5% are increased by 20.25% and 308.80%, respectively. The bending performance according to numerical results obtained by the modified model are in good agreement with the experimental results. Moreover, the acoustic emission (AE) parameters and AE curves obtained in RFPA 3D -CT can be used to reveal the initiation and propagation process of cracks in RPC.",

However, the shear-thickening Portland and volcanic cement pastes studied here showed apparent thixotropic behaviour when step-up tests were performed. This unexpected result was tentatively justified assuming that, just at the beginning of the step-stress, virtually instantaneous particle aggregation (for step-up tests) and disaggregation (for step-down tests) take place. In other words, the existence of fast jamming or unblocking mechanisms developed by shear-thickening cement pastes was hypothesised. Then, it was supposed that the initial reorganisation of cement particles was followed by a progressive erosion of the jammed state (step-up) or progressive aggregation of the unblocking state (step-down) due to the constant action of shear stress. These ideas were used to model an empirical equation for the dependence of viscosity on shear stress, which can be used for cement applications.",

The results showed that hydroxyethyl dibutyl phosphate reduced the residues of 45 μm and 80 μm grinding sieves by 68.67% and 98.67%, respectively. Compared with triethanolamine, the grinding effect of hydroxyethyl dibutyl phosphate was not only better but also the optimal mixing amount was less (only 0.167%). For the same amount of grinder, the grinding time was shortened by 30% and, for the same grinding time, the grinding output was increased by at least 20%. The polymer grinding aids significantly improved the fluidity of cement paste (by 40.06%), meaning the water-reduction rate of cement mortar could reach over 20%. The experimental results show that, as a new generation of grinding aids, phosphate esters not only have a significant grinding effect but also have high molecular designability, which will significantly enrich the grinding aids market and effectively promote energy conservation and emissions reductions in the grinding process.",

Herein, the first database of Sr and Nd isotope ratios investigated in OPCs, stemming from 29 cement plants located worldwide, was created. The results show that the Sr isotope ratios of OPCs are higher than those of seawater from the observed geological period. The spread of 143 Nd/ 144 Nd in OPCs is not as large as the spread for 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios. However, the combination of both Sr and Nd isotope ratios provides the potential for distinguishing between cements of different production sites. Most of the OPCs investigated have measurable differences in their 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotope ratios, which can be employed as a valuable analytical fingerprinting tool. In the case of equivocal results, divisive hierarchical clustering was employed to help overcome this issue. The construction of geochemical profiles allowed the computing of suitably defined distances between cements and clustering them according to their chemical similarity. By applying this methodology, successful fingerprinting was achieved in 27 out of the 29 ordinary Portland cements that were analysed.",

This study focused on the precise monitoring of early-age hydration with the incorporation of nanoalumina (nAl) in tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) and Portland cement paste and mortar. The dosage of nAl was varied from 1 to 5% (by weight) in C 3 S and from 0.1 to 1.0% in Portland cement, with a water/cement ratio of 0.4. The hydration studies showed that the nAl increased the cross-linkage in calcium silicate hydrate gel through substitution of aluminium by silicon, which was responsible for the enhancement of the modulus of elasticity (by 40%) with 1.0% nAl) after 7 days of hydration. In summary, the incorporation of nAl modified the concrete microstructure in the initial days of hydration, leading to higher concrete performance and longer service lives of concrete structures.",

Iran is among the top ten cement manufacturing countries in the world. Therefore, many of these problems have occurred in Iranian cement factories. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of studies in this field over the last couple of decades, with a particular focus on advances in Iran. The most important findings in the literature are summarised in order to suggest the best possible solutions for improving the performance and lifetime of GCTs and decreasing common problems such as dust build-up and wet bottom.

Plant fibres retard the setting times of cement due to their hydrophilic nature and the thermal properties of raw cement mortar containing plant fibres can be problematic.

The first part of this study focused on structural and morphological aspects. Scanning electron microscopy showed a tiny calcium layer around the sisal fibre treated with sodium hydroxide and paraffin oil on the adhesion surface. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed a disparity in the peaks of the absorption bands of calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide. The treatment slowed the alkaline hydrolysis and mineralisation of the fibre cell walls in the interfacial transition zone, thus promoting cement hydration. The second part of this work was a thermophysical study of the composites. The inclusion of sisal fibres led to remarkable decreases in thermal conductivity and heat capacity. The best thermal properties were obtained for the composite with sisal fibre immersed in paraffin oil. Biomortars with treated sisal fibre are thus promising from an insulation point of view.",

X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, mercury intrusion porosimetry, differential thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy were used for the microstructural analysis and quantification of phases within each sample. The results indicated that concrete with magnesia waste contains magnesium silicate hydrate (M–S–H) and brucite ((Mg(OH) 2 ) products. Brucite causes strength loss in concrete. Up to 90 days, specimens with magnesia showed increasing compressive and flexural strength. As the amount of magnesia waste increased, the porosity, depth of water penetration under pressure and water absorption by capillary increased. Incorporating more than 10% of magnesia waste in the SCC mixtures resulted in declining strength. The addition of magnesia waste enhanced the expansion of SCC.

    "abstract": "On the one hand, calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) eco-cements release about 40% less carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) than Portland cement during fabrication; on the other hand, phase change materials dispersed in a cementitious matrix can help to optimise the indoor temperature of buildings, reducing carbon dioxide emissions related to heating/air conditioning. However, this is only economically viable if it is used as a thin layer (a coating). In addition, the combination of both materials supposes a double environmental benefit. Consequently, the main objective of this work is the preparation of a suitable homogeneous and well-adhered bilayer sample, composed of CSA and CSA-MPCM. To achieve this, in the first step, the effect of pH, temperature and stirring was studied for microencapsulated phase change material (MPCM) aqueous suspensions (47.3 wt%); second, the MPCM (45 wt% with respect to dry cement) was dispersed in a CSA paste; then, in a third step, a homogeneous well-adhered coating of CSA-MPCM, with undamaged MPCM, was obtained on a CSA matrix. This was achieved through rheological measurements and checked by microscopy. Finally, the corresponding CSA and CSA-MPCM mortars were characterised through their mechanical properties (compression) (70 and 13 MPa at 7 days, respectively) and thermal conductivity (2.06 and 1.19 W/mK, respectively).",

However, RC, especially in coastal seaside or humid environments, can suffer reinforcement corrosion with the result that the reinforcement fails to perform its function over time. The effect of a retarder additive used to eliminate loss of consistency in hot, windy and humid weather on the corrosion of RC elements was investigated in this work. Four different concrete types were assessed, with 0%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% additions of the chemical additive. Along with accelerated corrosion and pressure tests, physical properties such as electrical resistivity, water absorption, porosity, unit weight and capillary water absorption were also determined. The results of this work indicate that the use of up to 2% of the setting retarder did not pose a problem in terms of the physical and mechanical properties of the concrete. However, in terms of the frequently encountered corrosion problem, the use of 1.5% is more appropriate. Many chemical additives are used for different purposes in concrete and it is suggested that, alongside physical and mechanical properties, durability characteristics should also be examined when determining the suitable ratios of these additives.",

The development of alternative activators, such as sodium silicate based on the dissolution of rice husk ash (RHA), could partially overcome these disadvantages. However, to maximise the mechanical performance of AAMs, the production of RHA-based sodium silicate (RHA-SS) needs to be fully understood. The production process of an alternative RHA-SS activator was thus investigated through experimental evaluations of RHA grinding time, RHA dissolution time and thermal curing temperature and time. Mechanical performance was evaluated through compressive strength tests carried out on alkali-activated pastes made up of metakaolin, as a precursor, and two different activators (RHA-SS and a commercial sodium silicate). Microstructural features were evaluated through X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetry analyses. Optimal production was obtained for a grinding time of 30 min, a thermal curing temperature of 40°C, dissolution time of 6 h and a thermal curing time of 8 h. The results show the efficiency of the alternative alkaline activator, which may represent a technically viable solution for larger scale application to AAMs.",

Furthermore, a synthetic fused clinker without foreign ions and fused clinker produced by a mixture of both materials was studied. The hydraulic reaction of the fused clinker from BOFS was considerably slower than that of OPC. However, the reaction can be accelerated by adding gypsum as a sulfate carrier. Furthermore, the results showed an increased reaction rate with decreasing content of foreign ions such as Fe, P or Mn.",

The expansion of the cylinders and their unconfined compressive strengths were measured at various stages of the curing cycle; lime consumption was determined at each stage using thermogravimetric analysis. The raw materials and the reaction products formed during curing were analysed using X-ray diffraction analysis, thermogravimetric analysis scanning and transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The last two techniques were also employed to follow the development of microstructure during curing. When moistened with water, the PFA wasfound to contain 1·34wt% of gypsum. In the dry P FA this gypsum was present on the particle surfaces, mainly as anhydrous calcium sulphate, and it was possible to remove this surface layer by acid treatment. The presence of this surface layer has been shown to be a critical factor in controlling the reaction rate, irifluencing the reaction mechanism and hence affecting the strength development and expansion behaviour of the cured PFA-lime composites.",

Experiments under steady shear at constant rate, supported by thermogravimetry, gave information on the breakdown of structure. The rheology of non-shrinking cement pastes is broadly similar to that of ordinary Portland cement pastes. However, the rapid formation of ettringite increases the yield value and plastic viscosity. Prolonged mixing results in accelerated formation of ettringite and consequent stiffening of the paste which is also associated with reduced expansion in service. Structural breakdown takes place under continuous shear and the changes can be explained by the effect of shear on the amount of water bound in the ettringite crystals.",

    "abstract": "Oilwell cement thickening times are measured by mixing cement and additives and placing them in a consistometer in the laboratory to simulate downhole behaviour. This procedure is often unrepresentative of the practical operation on the rig. There will normally be variations in temperature, additive concentration and slurry density. All of these affect the thickening time in some way. However, unless each slurry is tested in the laboratory it is impossible to predict the result. Failure to identify excessively sensitive slurries has resulted in instances of lost rig time in practice. In an attempt to prevent such sensitive slurries from being pumped in the future, work has been undertaken on the feasibility of a model to predict thickening time based upon the cement hydration chemistry. Although the model described is still in the early stages of development, the indications are encouraging that such a model could be put to practical use. Correlation between experimental and predicted thickening times for three different class G cements and two different types of lignosulphonate retarder over the temperature range 27-120°C was shown to be generally good.",

New information on the hydration products has been gained by an examination of the composition of hydrates in GS cement pastes. Electron probe microanalysis has been used to study the composition of hydration rims around alite and slag grains in two GS cement pastes. The results are expressed in terms of atomic ratios, depicted graphically and compared with published probe data for GGBS and PFA cement pastes. The presence of GS modifies the composition of the hydrates in the rims around alite grains, particularly by the incorporation of aluminium. The composition of the hydrate around the GS grains is shown to be more similar to that around PFA than to that around GGBS grains.",

Their expansivity is correlated with pore fluid analyses, mercury intrusion porosimetry and microstructure, determined by electron microscopy. Afler 180 days, the chemistry of the pore fluid becomes very similar in all mortars made with reactive aggregates. Much transport of silica away from the aggregate occurs and is believed to exert a levelling effect on pore fiuid alkali contents. Microsilica curbs expansion over the first six months, but it is concluded that considerahle potential for further expansion exists. The presence of microsilica as well as a reactive aggregate decreases the effective water/reactive solid (cement + pozzolan) ratio, with the result that the mortars undergo self-dessication and cease to expand. In real situations, where water uptake may occur, dessication is unlikely to occur; differences in the availahility of water constitutes an important distinction between laboratory simulations and ‘real-life’ materials.",

The emulsion was found to have high stability and good heat resistance, with the latex particles exhibiting a typical core–shell structure. Its performance as an oil-well cement was also evaluated. The results showed that the XY-5–cement slurry has good temperature resistance, salt resistance, low water loss and low permeability. Furthermore, the use of XY-5 effectively improved the cementation strength. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the XY-5 latex forms a three-dimensional network structure inside the cement, with cement particles linked together by latex particles.

The study showed that the hydration process of a cement paste could be influenced significantly by alkali content and caution must be exercised to control its influence on the early age properties of cement-based materials.",

    "abstract": "Preliminary studies on the effects of autoclaving cellulose fibre pulp used in fibre-cement building materials were conducted by Fourier transform infrared. Autoclaving at 180°C at different times in tap water showed little spectral differences. The use of lime solution under the same condition showed significant spectral differences in the regions of 3020 to 3800 cm−1 and 800 to 1600 cm−1. The former is the region corresponding to O—H stretch where the differences are the result of variations in the hydrogen bonding. The differences in the latter region correspond mainly to C—O stretching modes in COH and the acetal O—C—O—C groups. These results are rationalised in terms of susceptibility of the cellulose fibres to alkaline hydrolysis and oxidative alkaline hydrolysis under high temperature autoclaving conditions. Results from differential scanning calorimetry and environmental scanning electron microscopy also showed similar trends, confirming that only under the adverse alkaline and autoclave environment does the cellulose undergo significant degradation.",

The usefulness of the autoclaved SSASF cements as acid-resistant geothermal well cements was evaluated by exposing them for 15 days to 90°C CO2-laden H2SO4 (pH 1·1). Among the combination of these two parameters, the most effective one in inhibiting acid erosion consisted of 50/50 slag/fly ash ratio cement and 2·50 SiO2/Na2O ratio activator. The weight loss by acid erosion of this cement was less than 7%. The major contributor to such minimum acid erosion was the zeolite phase formed by interactions between the mullite in fly ash and the Na ion liberated from the activator. Further characteristics of this cement included a long setting time for its slurry of approximately 1770 min at room temperature, and a water permeability ranging from 2·4 × 10−4 to 1·9 × 10−5 Darcy, and a compressive strength from 4·0 to 53·4 MPa after autoclaving at 100–300°C for 24 h.",

    "abstract": "Day by day the increase in environmental pollution is playing a major role in the corrosion of concrete reinforcement, requiring researchers to focus on its prevention. Among the various corrosives, chloride ions produce major impact by virtue of their small size, high penetrating power, mobility and low activation energy for depassivation. The present research work is aimed at reducing the free chloride content in concrete using lead oxide as an admixture. Different proportions of admixture, varying between 5% and 20% (by weight), with regular increments of 5%, were adopted for concretes with varying curing times (3–28 days). An optimum percentage of chloride reduction was arrived at based on these proportions. The experiments revealed a 13% reduction of free chloride in cement grout and a 35% reduction in concrete with the lead oxide admixture. An increase of 30–60% in compressive strength was also observed for varying curing periods. This admixture, being economical compared with other admixtures such as zirconium oxide and titanium oxide, was found to reduce a higher amount of free chlorides, making it a feasible admixture to adopt. It can be concluded that lead oxide may effectively reduce the free chloride content in concrete, thereby reducing the risk of reinforcement corrosion.",

Active silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) and aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) were obtained from the bagasse ash and aluminium sulfate, respectively. The synthesis involves the dissolution of amorphous aluminosilicate releasing [SiO 2 (OH) 2 ] − 2 and Al(OH) − 4 , the formation of sodium aluminosilicate gel and the crystallisation of zeolite. Results showed that amorphous silica obtained from ash dissolved completely during the first hour of the crystallisation stage. With the increase in crystallisation time up to 4 h, a slight change in the composition of zeolite crystals was observed, due to the dissolution of zeolite-A. The synthesised zeolite showed an excellent adsorption capacity for heavy metal cations from aqueous solutions, especially for Pb ++ (187.25 mg/g), followed by Cu ++ (63.22 mg/g). This observation indicates that the zeolite-A synthesised from bagasse ash can be used as a low-cost and relatively effective adsorbent for the remediation of heavy metals from the effluents of chemical industries before being released to the environment.",

The kinetics can be described by two parameters: an induction period, t0, and one or two first-order reaction rate constants, k and k′, for the decrease of conductance. The influence of additives on both parameters has been studied extensively.",

As to the physico-mechanical properties of the hardened pastes, the addition of the polymer – at a constant water/solid ratio – increased the flexural strength and work of fracture of the material and at the same time lowered its compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and hardness.",

The RTC method was applied to determine chloride permeability when silica fume is incorporated into cement mixes. Also, the porosity and absorptivity of these mortars and the corrosion activity of embedded reinforced specimens were measured. A good correlation was found between the coefficient obtained by the RTC method and that determined from the increased chloride concentration, and on the other hand, a good correlation was also found between pozzolanic characteristics and this last chemical parameter and/or its direct and indirect related parameters.

However kaolin from natural sources may be notably impure, even after beneficiation. During heating, essential to convert unreactive kaolin to reactive metakaolin, impurities present in the precursor kaolin may become activated with respect to dissolution in alkaline cement pore fluid. The most important impurities in this context are muscovite and potassium-rich felspar. Potassium felspar and muscovite, heated and unheated, were slurried with Ca(OH)2 and water at ∼22°C for up to 28 days. Significant alkali releases were obtained even from unheated minerals. However, the extent of release increased with increasing calcination temperatures in the range 500–700°C. The results indicate that supposedly 'inert' aggregate minerals may become reactive towards cement. In cement–metakaolin mixes, much of the alkali liberated from mineral impurities is probably incorporated into cement solids but the overall effectiveness of metakaolin in decreasing the alkali contents of cement pore fluid is reduced. However, alkali release may also be beneficial: metakaolin may release sufficient alkali to enhance slag hydration in slag–Ca(OH)2–metakaolin blends.",

Different materials at the wall are shown to have significant effects on the values of yield stress and plastic viscosity, and results show it is reasonable to presume that the boundary layer is paste. It was found experimentally that the height of the gap between the top and bottom plates affects the measured torque and measured strain rate but has little effect on apparent viscosity.",

The heat curing by microwave energy together with the very low amount of water and restriction of the available space for hydration products, favour the formation of the nanocomposite (C–S–H/CHnm) in the CPMW sample.",

The AC impedance spectra of loaded and unloaded Ca(OH)2 compact specimens were also monitored in real time. This was achieved by the coupling of the impedance analyser to the creep experiment.

The effect of concentration of equimolar K:B mixing water on setting was also assessed for seven different total concentrations ranging from 0 to 0·3125 mol K + B/300 g cement. Phase equilibria of mixing waters calculated by PHREEQC showed a strong relationship between setting times and stability fields of coexisting phases. Each marked change in setting times corresponded to the replacement of the hitherto stable (calcium)-potassium borate hydrate by another. Correlation was observed between the water demand of the precipitating potassium borates and the constituent phases of mature hydrated cement stone.",

Subsequently, the semidry acid-anhydrite technique was adapted to the calcining of the precleaned FGD gypsum to reduce the transition temperature of the anhydrite. Accordingly, low-temperature multiphase plaster was prepared using a two-step calcination. The FGD gypsum with sulphuric acid was first calcined at 60°C for 1 h and then recalcined at 150°C for 3 h. The obtained multiphase plaster consisted of 29% hemihydrate, 60% anhydrite II, 10% anhydrite III and 1% dihydrate. At a water to plaster ratio of 0·6, its viscosity and initial and final setting times were 3633 centipoises and 16·28 and 27·83 minutes, respectively. The flexural strength and hardness of the plaster specimens were 5·07 and 10·79 N/mm2. However, the remaining impurities imparted a buff colour to the multiphase plaster. Anhydrite (95% anhydrite II) with crystal morphologies ranging from prismatic to plate-like shapes was achieved by calcining at 100°C for 3 h. Its whiteness measured according to the CIE system was 92·64%.",

Some attempts were also made to apply the kinetic model for interpreting the ASTM C1260 test results obtained when an appositely modified version of this test method was used to assess the capability of lithium nitrate additions in suppressing or mitigating deleterious ASR with a given aggregate. It was found that the kinetic model is capable of discriminating the alkali-reactivity of the sands investigated, through the use of a plot of the two kinetic parameters, M and ln k, derived from the model and assuming ln k as a reactivity criterion. Differently from what was observed using a percentage expansion criterion for defining potentially reactive aggregates, the use of ln k as a reactivity criterion yields an ASR diagnosis for every sand that is independent of the type of Portland cement used in the ASTM C1260 test. A modified version of the ASTM C1260 test procedure can be successfully used to assess the capability of lithium nitrate additions in suppressing deleterious ASR. Application of the kinetic model provides a suitable means of determining effective lithium dosages for deleterious ASR suppression in ASTM C1260 tests.",

    "abstract": "The results of leaching tests are one of the criteria used to evaluate the performance of cementitious materials for stabilisation/solidification of hazardous wastes. The action of water is of special importance due to its effect on the integrity of the cement solid phases. Likewise, the degraded material originated by the water action may facilitate the transport of toxic components from the material to the environment. Therefore, there is an interest in determining the material behaviour under the long-term action of water in representative conditions of a real storage scenario, in particular where radioactive waste storage times of 300 years or more are needed. During this time, the stabilised waste should maintain its properties. In the present paper a new leaching method to test the performance of concretes for long-term behaviour under natural water interaction is presented. An open system and a system of continuous running of natural water flowing at a fixed rate have been used. The system has been applied to test high- and ultra-high performance concretes for over a year. It gives different results to those previously reported using demineralised water or acid solutions. The method was developed to represent real scenarios in contact with granitic groundwater.",

At the hydrothermal temperature of 280°C, the reaction between the α-Al2O3 phase-based fibre's surfaces and silicate in the cement slurry was responsible for the development of a moderate bonding at the interfaces between the fibres and the SFCB cement matrix. This development improved fracture toughness to 2·7 times more than that of non-reinforced cements. In contrast, adding α-Al2O3/mullite mixed phase-based fibres did little to improve the fracture toughness because of the transformation of the mullite into Na-P type zeolite. This mullite → zeolite phase transition was caused by the hydrothermal reaction of mullite with the Na in the cement. This transition generated a strong linkage between the fibres and the matrix; however, it also converted the strong, flexible and tough fibres into fragile, brittle fibres. Correspondingly, cracks generated in the cement composites propagated through the fibres, but not at the fibre/matrix interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The rational use of surfactants based on their effect on the grinding process should also take into consideration the subsidiary effects of surfactants on the handling (flow characteristics) and curing processes (hardening) of the obtained cements. The hardening behaviour of admixed cements on grinding has therefore been investigated with regard to chemical behaviour, that is, the evolution of the hydration process, and structural—mechanical behaviour, that is, the consequent structural evolution of mechanical strength of the hardening cement. Two kinds of cement were used in this investigation; ordinary Portland cement (D) and ferro-Portland cement (M). The surfactants used were dihydroxy compounds (dialcohols and dihydroxy ethers) and aminoalcohols. Information on the fundamental processes that take place on hardening of cements with additives is obtained, in particular their interaction with water and development during hardening, including their mechanical strengths. It was ascertained that the presence of grinding additives influences the kinetics of hydration processes, with delaying effects in the early stages and acceleration of the kinetics subsequently, correlated with the nature of the surfactant. The effects of grinding additives on the microstructure of hardened cements differ according to their nature; among the surfactants used, aminoalcohols and diethylene glycol affect the porosity of hardened cement. Our studies prove that the mechanical strength of hardened cements is a relatively complex result of the effects of grinding additives on both hydration processes and structural development as well as on the proportion of mixing water, and is correlated with the nature of the cement and surfactant.",

A cement substrate with a circular hole in the middle was used as a permeability test specimen to assess bond by checking the bond appearance and testing the permeability. According to the results of the mechanical properties and penetration tests, the MKG with 4% MS-3 exhibited the best bond properties. The EAs significantly improved the expansion properties and reduced the tensile stress at the interface; these were the main reasons for the improvement in bond properties between the MKG and cement stone. Favourable bond property is an important basis for MKG as an inorganic crack repair material.",

Measurements at regular intervals were taken at six different depths from the exposed drying surface of each specimen. It was found that the internal temperature at all depths in the mortar and concrete samples followed the variations of ambient temperature closely, irrespective of the w/c ratio. While the effect of the w/c ratio on the mean internal RH in mortar was statistically negligible, it became discernible in concrete at points where the material had relatively lower saturation levels and when the effect of evaporation was low due to a low ambient temperature. A higher dosage of polycarboxylic ether based superplasticiser was found to delay the drop in internal RH. The recorded values of internal RH over the period of study were found to be conducive for the onset and propagation of carbonation-induced corrosion. A two-parameter linear model for the prediction of critical drying time with respect to spatial distance from the drying surface was developed.",

The chemical reactions and resulting microstructures and properties of the alkali-activated glass inorganic binders (AAGIBs) were affected by the aging temperature and duration. An activation energy approach was used to evaluate the effects of aging temperature and duration on the 4-day compressive strengths of the AAGIB specimens. When the amount of sodium hydroxide in the activators was low, the activation energies for the dissolution and polycondensation reactions of the AAGIBs were 83.3 kJ/mol and 44.6 kJ/mol, respectively. As the weight fraction of sodium oxide (F SO ) in the activators was increased, the microstructure of the hardened binder was destroyed because of vigorous stirring during aging. Consequently, the activation energy of the AAGIB polycondensation reaction increased to 76.2 kJ/mol when F SO &gt; 5%.",

The specimen is subjected to bending stresses by applying a concentrated load to the centre of its top surface, and the load is increased gradually until the disc fails. A theoretical basis for using this loading configuration as a strength test is derived. This so-called disc-bending point load test is used in this paper for testing the strength of API Class G hardened cement paste specimens of various curing ages. The measured disc-bending point load strength index (I db ) is used for computing the rupture moduli of the test specimens, and for estimating their compressive strengths. The test results are compared with data from conventional strength tests such as the uniaxial compression test, as well as the diametral and axial point load strength tests. Correlations between Idb and uniaxial compressive strength are shown jor disc specimens of various thicknesses, and the effect of indentor penetration and disc thickness is investigated.",

In this Paper the prescriptions and properties of the new cement are investigated, and its hydration features are also studied by means of XRD, SEM and the determination of reaction kinetics, as well as other methods. It was found that glauberite: accelerates the formation of AFt and increases AFt content in cement paste; improves the dissolvability of slag; and expedites the hydration of clinker.

The behaviour of the selected material was studied in parallel in two different liquids: water and a lime-saturated solution. The granulometric evolution of the materials with pozzolanic activity was different from that of the inert materials when exposed to a reactive liquid such as a lime-saturated solution. These findings prove the effectiveness of this method for assessing the pozzolanic activity of d(lferent materials.",
