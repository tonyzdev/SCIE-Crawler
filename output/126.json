    "abstract": "Abstract The Pannonian basin is an extensional back-arc basin that has undergone neotectonic inversion and is currently shortening. The understanding and quantification of present-day deformation processes during this inversion are still incomplete. To this end, we investigate the active deformation of the Circum-Pannonian region via the interpolation of GNSS-derived velocity field and the derivation of the strain rate fields. For the interpolation of the velocity field, we use ordinary kriging, a strochastic interpolation method. Our results show that estimating a strain rate field that is virtually free of short-wavelength noise requires the scaling of the velocity uncertainties, i.e. assuming a minimum standard deviation of 1 mm/yr in our case. The deformation of the Circum-Pannonian region is defined by the 2–3 mm/yr, NNE-directed motion of the Dinarides, and by the 0.5–1.5 mm/yr, WSW to SSW directed motion of the eastern areas (European foreland, East Carpathians, South Carpathians, Transylvanian basin). These opposite-sense motions define a large-scale, on average NE-SW shortening and transpression-type deformation in the Dinarides as well as in the Pannonian basin, while the East and South Carpathians undergo regional N–S extension. Neotectonic structures generally show good agreement with the strain rate field, for example in the Dinarides, Eastern Alps, or in the western Pannonian basin. However, the presence of fault-parallel shortening or biaxial shortening along sinistral neotectonic structures in the central and eastern Pannonian basin show some discrepancy between current geodetic and observed neotectonic deformation. The vertical velocity field shows dominantly 100 and 1000 km wavelength signals, the former is probably related to the response of the Pannonian lithosphere-asthenosphere system to neotectonic basin inversion, while latter can possibly be explained by far-field subsidence patterns induced by the mantle response to melting of the Fennoscandian ice sheet during the current interglacial period.",

    "abstract": "Abstract El-Bakriya area is situated in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt. It includes several mineral occurrences and/or deposits. Data from remote sensing and airborne geophysics (gamma-ray and magnetic) were combined to identify the hydrothermal alteration zones and structures related to these occurrences. Various processing of ASTER satellite images revealed fifteen zones of high probability for metallic mineralizations. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometric data clarify K-enrichment zones, which are correlated geologically with the distribution of calc-alkaline, alkali feldspar granites (Younger granites), and calc-alkaline quartzdiorites to granodiorites (Older granites), as well as basement metavolcanics and metasediments. An integrated hydrothermal alteration map was constructed, based on both ASTER remote sensing and airborne gamma-ray spectrometric data. This map delineates some metallic mineral occurrences and/or deposits, which are located in the detected hydrothermal alteration zones. Besides, it displays new potential zones for mineralization, such as: Gabal (G.) El-Shalul, G. El-Bakriya, G. Siwat El-Arsha and G. Umm Bisilla. The geologic and airborne magnetic maps demonstrate five structural lineament trends of E–W, ENE–WSW, NE–SW, NW–SE, and NNW–SSE directions, which might act as pathways to transport the hydrothermal solutions in the study area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Debrecen area, as part of the Great Hungarian Plain (GHP), is associated with a multi-aquifer system that is overly exploited to fulfill the development plans. This research aims to jointly interpret and model gravity and magnetic data to map the subsurface geology and structures that govern groundwater occurrence. Various potential field techniques, including spectral analysis, anomaly derivatives, analytical signal, and Euler deconvolution were employed to map the distribution and depth of the buried geological structures. The combination of the potential field techniques enabled the construction of a detailed lineament map, providing valuable insights into the distribution of the subsurface structural features. It was indicated that the main structural trend is NW–SE and NE–SW, that coincides with the main structural trends in Hungary. Subsequently, a lineament density map is derived, indicating that the eastern, central, and northwestern parts of the area form the most promising zones for groundwater prospection. The joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data has further enhanced the understanding of subsurface geology. The depth to the basement rock varied between 1.18 and 2.2 km. The highest depth to the basement meets with thick sedimentary sequences bounded by normal faults forming graben and horst structures. Moreover, the distribution of these sediments is investigated using lithological logs indicating the thickness of the main hydrostratigraphic units in the Debrecen area. These units include Nagyalföld Aquifer, Algyő Aquitard, Endrőd Aquitard, and Miocene Badenian Aquifer units, which mainly consist of sand, silt, marl, and gravel. The recent study demonstrated the effectiveness of the joint interpretation in enhancing the knowledge of lithology and geological structures. However, a detailed geophysical survey is recommended to characterize the hydrostratigraphic units in the Debrecen area.",

    "abstract": "The power of Machine Learning is demonstrated for automatic interpretation of well logs and determining reservoir properties for volume of shale, porosity, and water saturation respectively for tight clastic sequences. Random Forest algorithms are reputed for their efficiency as they belong to a class of algorithms called ensemble methods, which are traditionally seen as weak learners, but can be transformed into strong performers and they promise to deliver highly accurate results. The study area is located offshore Australia in the Poseidon and Crown fields situated in the Browse Basin, which are gas fields in tight complex clastic reservoirs. There are 5 wells used in this study with one well manually interpreted which is subsequently used in developing a machine learning model which predicts the output for the other 4 wells. The basic open hole logs namely Natural gamma ray, Resistivity, Neutron Porosity, Bulk Density, P-wave and S-wave sonic travel-time, are used in interpretation. One of the wells has a missing S-wave travel-time log which was also predicted by developing a Random Forest Machine Learning model. The results indicate a very robust improvement in performance when Random Forest algorithm was combined with Adaptive Boosting when interpreting the well logs. The training accuracy using Random Forest alone was 98.21%, but testing was 77.62% which suggested over-fitting by the Random Forest model. The Adaptive Boosting of the Random Forest algorithm resulted in the overall training accuracy of 99.40% and an overall testing accuracy of 97.03%, indicating a drastic improvement in performance. S-wave travel-time log was predicted by preparing a training set consisting of Natural gamma ray, Resistivity, Neutron Porosity, Bulk Density, and P-wave travel-time logs for the 4 wells using Random Forest which gave a training accuracy of 99.79% and a testing accuracy of 98.54%. Machine learning algorithms can be successfully applied for interpreting well log data in complex sedimentary environment and their performance can be drastically improved using Adaptive Boosting.",

For historic and other sparse data sets, the reconstruction of TEC images is often performed using multivariate interpolation techniques. In this paper, a quantitative comparison of the ability of artificial neural networks (ANN), polynomial fitting and kriging interpolation was carried out in order to model the spatial variations of TEC using GPS data over Iran. These methods are suitable for handling multi-scale phenomena and unevenly distributed data. The observations collected at 25 GPS stations from Iranian permanent GPS network (uniformly spread all over Iran with sampling rate of 30-seconds). Dual frequency carrier phase and code GPS observations were used. A smoothed TEC approach was used for absolute TEC recovery. Evaluation of the methods has been applied with single GPS station in Tehran equipped with ionosonde instrument. The minimum relative error for ANN, polynomial and kriging are 4.37, 6.35, 9.13 % and the maximum relative error are 8.61, 29.06, and 20.14 % respectively. Also root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.7 TECU is computed for ANN method which is less than RMSE of other mentioned methods. The results show that ANN method has higher accuracy and compiles speed than kriging and polynomial. As well as, it is found that polynomial and kriging methods required many computational points in adjustment step.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previously drilled boreholes of a host rock for a potential nuclear waste repository in Hungary revealed a highly fractured claystone rock body. A crucial step for characterizing the hydrodynamic behavior of such a fractured reservoir is fracture identification and accurate calculation of the fracture density. Although acoustic borehole televiewers provide a reliable base for determining the fracture density, older boreholes usually lack such data. However, conventional borehole geophysical measurements are often accessible in such cases. The aim of this study was to identify any correlations between well log data and fracture density. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed on data from two boreholes penetrating the Boda Claystone Formation in southwest Hungary. The upper section of the BAF-4 borehole was used for training, where the fracture density was estimated with a fit of R 2 = 0.767. The computed regression function predicted the fracture density with high accuracy in both boreholes for all intervals with typical lithological features. However, in some sections where anomalous well log data indicated changes in the lithology, the prediction accuracy decreased. For example, the function underestimated the fracture density in sandy intervals.",

The better understanding of the Apennines–Alps–Carpathian–Dinarides system is the main target of the AlpArray European international initiative in which more than 50 institutes are involved. The core of AlpArray is the AlpArray Seismic Network (AASN). With its $$\\sim $$ 600 broadband seismic stations ( $$\\sim $$ 280 of which are temporary) the AASN is, so far, the largest passive seismic experiment in Europe. The MTA CSFK Geodetic and Geophysical Institute, as a Core Member of the AlpArray project, contributes to the AlpArray Seismic Network with its entire permanent network as well as with 11 temporary broadband seismic stations deployed in Western Hungary. Three additional station equipment were provided by the Swiss-AlpArray SINERGIA program. The average station distance together with the permanent stations is around 40 km in the area of interest. The temporary network has been installed between December 2015 and July 2016 and the planned operation period is 3 years. In this paper we describe the characteristics of the 29 permanent and temporary stations, introducing not only the equipment, but the location, housing and geological setting, as well. We present median power spectral density curves in order to characterise the noise conditions at each station.",

    "abstract": "The paper concerns assessing the accuracy of some variants of robust R-estimates, namely the Hodges–Lehmann estimates, which can be applied, for example, in deformation analyses. Such estimates are robust against outlying observations and in some cases they are a good alternative for more conventional methods of estimation, for example, in testing stability of the potential reference points. Considering such an application, or in general estimation of displacements of network points, one should of course know accuracy of the estimators. Since R-estimates are based on ranks it is not obvious how to compute their accuracy (the law of variance propagation cannot be applied here). This paper presents one of the possible approaches, namely application of Monte Carlo simulations. If we make certain assumptions concerning the distribution of observation errors, we can assess the accuracy of chosen R-estimates. Usually, we assume that the observation errors are normally distributed, however, we can also consider some distributions with positive or negative kurtosis, and in the latter case we may apply the system of Johnson's distributions to simulate the observations. In the paper, the accuracy of R-estimates was computed in relation to the accuracy of LS estimates, which is advisable from a practical point of view. It turned out that the accuracy of R-estimates is a little bit worse than the accuracy of LS estimates in most of the cases. However, there are also some cases when R-estimates are more accurate, for example, for leptokurtic distributions of the observations. An example application of R-estimates in deformation analysis was also presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Pannonian Basin is one of the best natural laboratories in the world to study the lithospheric response to continental extension and subsequent tectonic inversion. Here we address the topic of lithospheric structure by a combined geochemical and magnetotelluric analysis, which has been carried out in the framework of the Pannon LitH 2 Oscope project. The main objective was to detect the resistivity distribution over the entire lithosphere by magnetotelluric measurements, considering the lithological resistivity properties and relate the results to the structure and evolution of the Pannonian Basin. The Pannon LitH 2 Oscope MT array was used to estimate the depth of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB), considering the legacy MT data and compared to previous estimates for the region. Using the MT and geomagnetic response functions, major structural zones of the Pannonian basin, such as the Mid-Hungarian Shear Zone or fault systems like the Makó Trough and the Békés Basin, were also imaged. In addition, we used the apparent resistivity soundings to compare 1D resistivity models computed from geochemistry and obtained from field MT measurements. This comparison provided new constrains for the composition, fluid and melt content variations at the local lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. The Pannon LitH 2 Oscope MT dataset and the results presented in this paper provide input for more complex 3D inversions and further investigations of the lithospheric structure in the Carpathian-Pannonian region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The identification of lithology, fluid types, and total organic carbon content are of great priority in the exploration of unconventional hydrocarbons. As a new alternative, a further developed K-means type clustering method is suggested for the evaluation of shale gas formations. The traditional approach of cluster analysis is mainly based on the use of the Euclidean distance for grouping the objects of multivariate observations into different clusters. The high sensitivity of the L 2 norm applied to non-Gaussian distributed measurement noises is well-known, which can be reduced by selecting a more suitable norm as distance metrics. To suppress the harmful effect of non-systematic errors and outlying data, the Most Frequent Value method as a robust statistical estimator is combined with the K-means clustering algorithm. The Cauchy-Steiner weights calculated by the Most Frequent Value procedure is applied to measure the weighted distance between the objects, which improves the performance of cluster analysis compared to the Euclidean norm. At the same time, the centroids are also calculated as a weighted average (using the Most Frequent Value method), instead of applying arithmetic mean. The suggested statistical method is tested using synthetic datasets as well as observed wireline logs, mud-logging data and core samples collected from the Barnett Shale Formation, USA. The synthetic experiment using extremely noisy well logs demonstrates that the newly developed robust clustering procedure is able to separate the geological-lithological units in hydrocarbon formations and provide additional information to standard well log analysis. It is also shown that the Cauchy-Steiner weighted cluster analysis is affected less by outliers, which allows a more efficient processing of poor-quality wireline logs and an improved evaluation of shale gas reservoirs.",

Based on the dual-frequency observation data of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations and Global Ionosphere Maps (GIM) data products, the sliding interquartile range method was applied to detect and analyze the changes of ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies before the earthquake. The results show that the TEC anomalies over five GNSS stations show the common existence of anomalous times, which are July 28, August 1, August 2, August 7, and August 13, 2021, respectively. Combining space weather parameters and GIM, it is tentatively concluded that the TEC anomaly that appeared on August 1 (i.e., the 13th day before the earthquake) was not disturbed by geomagnetic storms and solar activity, and may be related to the breeding earthquake. An ionospheric anomaly close to 6 TECU was present near the epicenter 13 days before the earthquake, which is strongly associated with the peak variation of the equatorial anomaly. This suggests that an anomalously increased vertical electric field may have been generated before the earthquake, which in turn enhanced the “fountain effect” and created a strong northern hump.",

    "abstract": "The deformation pattern in active orogens is in general diffuse and distributed, and is expressed by spatially scattered seismicity and fault network. We select two relating datasets in the region encompassing Switzerland and analyse how they compare with each other. The datasets are not complete but are the best datasets currently available which fully cover the investigated area at a uniform scale. The distribution of distances from each earthquake to the nearest fault suggests that about two-thirds of the seismicity occurs near faults, yet about 10% occurs far from known faults. These numbers are stable for various selections of earthquakes and even when considering location uncertainties. Earthquake magnitudes in the catalogue are smaller than what could be expected from faults lengths. This suggests that the deep fracture pattern is more segmented than the superficial one, or mostly partial rupture during earthquakes, and (partly) the impropriety of the scaling law. Statistics on the distances from each fault to the nearest earthquake reveal that all supposedly-active faults in Switzerland have experienced a typically felt (magnitude 2.5 or larger) event, and only one out of six has not done so in the past four decades. Future applications of the presented approach to more complete or comprehensive fault databases may result in revised numbers regarding the connection between deep and superficial fracture patterns, representative of the stress regime of the region. The public and educational message: (1) in the region of Switzerland, earthquakes can happen in areas without known or mapped faults; (2) not all faults produce earthquakes within a human lifetime, but they seem to do so over long times.",

The analysis takes into consideration the relations between the number of geodetic control points and land cover type (built-up, agricultural, and forest) as well as the effective legal regulations in Poland with regard to the issues. The analysis results were referred to geodetic sections classified by the k-means method with respect to the number of the control points and the built-up, agricultural and forest areas. The research indicates that the number of the geodetic control points in an area depends to the extent of 35 % on the type of land cover (building, agricultural and forest land). Having this in mind, the authors recommend taking the land cover into consideration already in the phase of designing a geodetic control network.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We develop a new inversion approach to construct a 3-D structural and shear-wave velocity model of the crust based on teleseismic P-to-S converted waves. The proposed approach does not require local earthquakes such as body wave tomography, nor a large aperture seismic network such as ambient noise tomography, but a three-component station network with spacing similar to the expected crustal thickness. The main features of the new method are: (1) a novel model parametrization with 3-D mesh nodes that are fixed in the horizontal directions but can flexibly vary vertically; (2) the implementation of both sharp velocity changes across discontinuities and smooth gradients; (3) an accurate ray propagator that respects Snell’s law in 3-D at any interface geometry. Model parameters are inverted using a stochastic method composed of simulated annealing followed by a pattern search algorithm. The first application is carried out over the Central Alps, where long-standing permanent and the temporary AlpArray Seismic Network stations provide an ideal coverage. For this study we invert 4 independent parameters, which are the Moho discontinuity depth, the Conrad discontinuity depth, the P-velocity change at the Conrad and the average Vp/Vs of the crust. The 3-D inversion results clearly image the roots of the Alpine orogen, including the Ivrea Geophysical Body. The lower crust's thickness appears fairly constant. Average crustal Vp/Vs ratios are relatively higher beneath the orogen, and a low-Vp/Vs area in the northern foreland seems to correlate with lower crustal earthquakes, which can be related to mechanical differences in rock properties, probably inherited. Our results are in agreement with those found by 3-D ambient noise tomography, though our method inherently performs better at localizing discontinuities. Future developments of this technique can incorporate joint inversions, as well as more efficient parameter space exploration.",

Data evaluation and their accuracy estimation were of major importance to ascertain compatibility among data sources. In this study, data from neighboring countries were used as they were essential for the completeness of the model developed. The technique remove–compute–restore was adopted for the separation of the gravity signal in the heterogeneous data utilizing EIGEN 6C4 (full degree and order 2190), since the global geodynamic model was found to fit best in the Greek region. Mean gravity residual contribution to the local geoid model was calculated using Stokes' theorem in the frequency domain and implementing the Fourier transform using the Wang and Core modification. The final surface of the resulting gravimetric geoid was adapted to the existing height system of the State utilizing the Least Squares Collocation method by fitting points of known orthometric and geometric heights, distributed throughout Greece. The external accuracy of the estimated geoid model was estimated at the level of 6 cm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Transylvanian basin is one of the major Tertiary sedimentary basins in the Carpathian-Pannonian region. Its thick sedimentary fill contains prominent Middle Miocene age salt that forms major diapir structures at the basin margins. The microstructural characteristics of the rock salt represent one of the main factors that determines the potential of a salt body for storage of hydrogen. The main aim of this study is to extend our understanding of the deformation mechanism of Praid rock salt located at the eastern margin of the Transylvanian basin. Based on petrography, we identified two types of rock salt: (1) layered salt with rather uniform grain size distribution showing alternation of greyish (clay mineral bearing) and white (clear halite) layers, and (2) massive grey salt with large, elongated halite crystals, accompanied by sub-micrometer size grains of halite. To shed light on the microstructure of the rock salt, we performed electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping, and studied gamma-irradiated samples both in the massive and layered salt samples. Dislocation creep and pressure solution creep were identified which acted concurrently in the Praid rock salt. The total strain rate falls between 1.2 and 1.3×10 −10 s −1 . The results of this study reveal a complex deformation history of the salt body where coexisting and migrating fluids have played an important role. The outcome of this project contributes to the hydrogen storage potential assessment for the Transylvanian salt and to a better understanding of the structural evolution of the Transylvanian basin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) are intended to improve precision of orbit determination and satellite clock estimation. The ISLs provide a precise pseudorange measurements between satellites in a specific constellation. The study is a preparatory assessment of exploitation of seven connectivity schemes in the terms of the precise orbit determination for three types of constellations—Galileo-like with 24 satellites on three orbital planes, GPS-like with 24 satellites on six orbital planes, and GPS with real positions. The first part of the study focused on detailed analysis of the various ISL connectivity schemes, considering the geometry of ISL observations. The selected results of ranging were examined in the context of the precise orbit determination based on weighted least squares adjustment. The second part of the analysis was based on simulated measurements with two approaches. First approach focuses on geometrical dependencies and the second is performed with ISL measurement biases estimation. It was found that the use of the ISL technique with GNSS measurements in orbit determination improves the results by reducing the RMS error in the along-track and cross-track components. Choice of connectivity schemes does not have a significant impact on the total results of orbit determination, but give different contribution to particular components. Introducing constant bias in ISL measurements occurs in slightly worse estimation results. However, the relations between connectivity schemes is very similar to approach without simulation of ISL bias, the differences are at the level of 10%. Satellite and station clock estimation errors are almost equal for all used connectivity schemes. Results of clocks are also not influenced by ISL bias. This study showed that the ISL technique is a highly promising addition for future generations of satellite navigation systems and that sequential and ring connectivity schemes can be recommended for use in future navigation constellations.",

    "abstract": "Temporal variations of geoid heights are vitally important in geodesy and Earth science. They are essentially needed for dynamic and kinematic updates of the static geoid model. These temporal variations, which substantially differ for different geographic locations, can successfully be determined using the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission data. So far, statistical decomposition methods, e.g. the Principal Component Analysis/Empirical Orthogonal Function (PCA/EOF) method, have not been implemented for the analysis and modelling of temporal mass variations within the Earth's system over the area of Poland. The aim of this contribution is to analyse and model temporal variations of geoid heights obtained from GRACE mission data over the area of Poland using the PCA/EOF method. Temporal variations of geoid heights were obtained from the latest release, i.e. release five, of monthly GRACE-based Global Geopotential Models. They can reach the level of 10 mm. The PCA modes and their corresponding EOF loading patterns were estimated using two different algorithms. The results obtained revealed that significant part of the signal of temporal variations of geoid heights over Poland can be obtained from the first three PCA modes and EOF loading patterns. They demonstrate the suitability of the PCA/EOF method for analysing and modelling temporal variations of geoid heights over the area investigated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The well-known, traditional way to extend P-wave acoustic impedance data between and beyond the well log locations is the post-stack inversion of seismic data usually available in the surroundings of the boreholes. A relatively new trend in the seismic exploration is based on the pre-stack inversion of the seismic CDP gathers providing both the P- and S-wave acoustic impedance sections (and volumes), as well as the estimated density data. This methodology is often called as simultaneous model-based inversion and can be utilized not only for hydrocarbon exploration, but it might also be a useful tool for the investigation of geothermal resources. In this study, we will compare the results of post-stack and pre-stack acoustic impedance inversions utilizing the same seismic volume. We will demonstrate and analyze the inverted attribute sections (and some of their derivatives) obtained by the pre-stack algorithm in detail. Finally, we will draw the conclusions about the lithological discrimination of the studied complex carbonate geothermal reservoir located in the pre-Cenozoic basement of the Little Hungarian Plain.",

    "abstract": "The Pannonian region is a back-arc basin located within the arcuate Alpine–Carpathian mountain chain in central Europe. Beneath the basin both the crust and the lithosphere have smaller thickness than the continental average. During the last few decades several studies have been born to explain the formation of the Pannonian Basin but several key questions remain unanswered. In this study we construct a new high-resolution 3D P-wave velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle in the Pannonian Basin which may help us to understand better the structure and evolution of the region. For the 3D P-wave velocity structure estimation over 32 thousand traveltime picks have been derived from the ISC bulletin and the local Hungarian National Seismological Bulletin, and altogether we used more than 3200 seismic events (local, near-regional and regional) and more than 150 seismic stations from the time period between 2004 and 2014. For the 3D velocity field inversion we used the FMTOMO software package which uses the so called Fast Marching Method for calculating the traveltime estimations, and the subspace inversion method to recover the model parameters. We also performed several checkerboard tests both to select the appropriate regularization parameters and to help the interpretation of the resulting P-wave velocity model. On the resulting tomographic image the seismic velocity anomalies well resolve the effects of deep sedimentary basins and also Moho topography and the associated updomings of the asthenosphere below the Pannonian Basin. Different major tetonic units and fault zones separating those seem to show characteristic velocity anomalies. Subrecent volcanic activity or associated melt and fluid percolation, heat transfer in the upper mantle and crust may also have an impact on the propagation of seismic waves.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive robust inversion-based Fourier transformation algorithm has been proposed based on the advantages of Hermite functions for processing even in random-walk data known as the iteratively reweighted least squares fourier transformation (IRLS-FT) method. By using Hermite functions as the basis functions of discretization, the Fourier spectrum was discretized using a series expansion of which the expansion coefficients were given by a solution of a linear inverse problem. The method enabled a quicker determination of the Jacobi matrix as the Hermite functions were considered as the eigenfunctions of the inverse fourier transformation. The process was robustified using the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method with Steiner weights. The result was a very efficient, robust and resistant procedure with a higher noise reduction capability irrespective of the data acquisition protocols, thus, whether regular or irregular sampling procedure was used in acquiring the data. The Fourier transformation operation was employed in developing the new method because it facilitated data conversion from time to frequency domain. To reduce the noise sensitivity of the IRLS-FT as characterized by the traditional DFT method, the Fourier transformation was formulated as an overdetermined inverse problem permitting the required noise reduction tools to be applied. Traditionally, geophysical data are acquired on a regular equidistant grid, but the continual improvement in survey equipment’s and processing tools permits non-equidistant measurements. The new applicability of the IRLS-FT is demonstrated in the reduction to the pole of synthetic magnetic data generated in the regular equidistant array and subsequently randomized to produce non-equidistant measurements along a survey line. In one dimensional study, the IRLS-FT processed waveforms were similar for both equidistant and non-equidistant sampling. An application on magnetic data showed a similar anomaly generation for DFT processed equidistant sampling and IRLS-FT processed non-equidistant sampling, indicating the new method is applicable irrespective of the sampling protocol applied in the field survey or data acquisition process. This data processing abilities of the IRLS-FT method simplifies and fasten field data acquisition as measurements are not necessarily taken on a regular grid, which gives it a competitive advantage over the traditional DFT method.",

Among the primary aims are the imaging of the Earth’s crustal, lithospheric and upper mantle structure, including joint inversions; monitoring and mapping of seismic activity; and interpretation of the data from seismotectonic and geodynamic perspectives. The base of the cooperation is a high-quality, broadband seismic network covering the very centre of Europe: the Eastern Alpine and Western Carpathian Mountain ranges, the Bohemian Massif, and the sedimentary Molasse and Pannonian Basins. In this overview, we focus on the implementation and achieved field goals of PACASE, such as seismic station configuration, general network organization, data availability and access to the dataset. With selected seismological examples, we demonstrate the good usability of the records of earthquake detection, and a first publication attests to the structural imaging capability of the PACASE data. We assess the background noise level at various stations and its variations in time and space. Our aim is to collect all practical information relevant to serve as a long-term reference for the PACASE.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An earthquake of local magnitude M L = 4.6 occurred on November 7, 2010, 4.5 km northwest of the Aswan High Dam on the Spillway Fault. In the Aswan metropolitan region this earthquake was felt intensely. As no surface rupture was found, the focal mechanism and the distribution of seismic activity was one of the tools used for finding fault dimensions. The composite fault-plane solutions for the observed events on the Spillway Fault showed a left lateral strike-slip faulting with normal-fault component striking NNW-SSE. Also, remote sensing techniques were applied for the detection and identification of the geomorphology and geometry of the Spillway Fault. In this research, sub-surface layers and structures are delineated utilizing near-surface seismic techniques. Furthermore, the area’s supposed path and position of the Spillway Fault are also investigated. Two active seismic techniques, Seismic Refraction and Multi-Channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW), are utilized for recording near-surface seismic wave data at 9 sites. The seismic refraction profiles are conducted as a 2D cross-section on the trace of the detected Spillway Fault in the study area to evaluate the maximum depth of penetration of the P-wave for fault investigation. The constructed 2D seismic and structural sections from P-wave results show that the obtained average depth of about 30 m. In addition, the estimated P-wave velocities extend from 600 m/s to over 6500 m/s. Some lateral variation in the seismic wave velocities in all layers may represent fault zones. Moreover, the 1D MASW technique is conducted to estimate the velocities of the shear wave for the upper 30 m (Vs30) to provide the site classes and soil characteristics along both sides of the detected Spillway Fault trace in the study area. The calculated Vs30 values emphasized the idea of the existence of a normal dip-slip fault trace which divides the study area into two different lithological parts. The first part is located on the eastern side and characterized by almost class B (hard rock, according to NEHRP classification), while the other part is located to the west, and shows almost class type C (denoted as dense soil and soft rock soil).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, high accuracy and low-cost navigation hardware is becoming increasingly available that can be efficiently used for the control of autonomous vehicles. We present a sensor fusion method providing tightly coupled integration of pseudorange, carrier phase, and Doppler satellite measurements taken at multiple vehicle-mounted GNSS antennas with onboard inertial sensor observations. The key of accurate GNSS position and orientation estimation is the successful integer ambiguity resolution. We propose a method that uses the quaternion states as constraints to improve ambiguity resolution and to increase the accuracy of the GNSS based attitude determination. Generally, the low-cost hardware neither allows a hardware-level time synchronization between the GNSS receivers due to a lack of a common external oscillator nor provides the clock steering function available in geodetic GNSS receivers. The lack of observation synchronization causes several degrees of error in attitude estimation. To eliminate this effect, a dynamics-based solution is presented that synchronizes the observations by taking the dynamics of the moving platform into account. Compared to common external oscillator based sensor setups, our solution allows to increase both the number of rover receivers on the platform and the baselines between them easily, thus it opens up new possibilities in the attitude determination of large vehicles. We validate our approach against a tactical grade inertial navigation system. The results show that our approach using low-cost sensors provides the ambiguity success rate of 100% for the moving baselines, and the positioning and attitude error reached the centimeter and half a degree level, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we introduce the novel Chebyshev Polynomials Least-Squares Fourier Transformation (C-LSQ-FT) and its robust variant with the Iteratively Reweighted Least-Squares technique (C-IRLS-FT). These innovative techniques for Fourier transformation are predicated on the concept of inversion, and the C-LSQ-FT method establishes an overdetermined inverse problem within the realm of Fourier transformation. However, given the LSQ approach’s vulnerability to data outliers, we note the potential for considerable errors and potentially unrepresentative model estimations. To circumvent these shortcomings, we incorporate Steiner’s Most Frequent Value method into our framework, thereby providing a more reliable alternative. The fusion of the Iteratively Reweighted Least-Squares (IRLS) algorithm with Cauchy-Steiner weights enhances the robustness of our Fourier transformation process, culminating in the C-IRLS-FT method. We use Chebyshev polynomials as the basis functions in both methods, leading to the approximation of continuous Fourier spectra through a finite series of Chebyshev polynomials and their corresponding coefficients. The coefficients were obtained by solving an overdetermined non-linear inverse problem. We validated the performance of both the traditional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the newly developed C-IRLS-FT through numerical tests on synthetic datasets. The results distinctly exhibited the reduced sensitivity of the C-IRLS-FT method to outliers and dispersed noise, in comparison with the traditional DFT. We leveraged the newly proposed (C-IRLS-FT) technique in the application of low-pass filtering in the context of gravity data. The results corroborate the technique’s robustness and adaptability, making it a promising method for future applications in geophysical data processing.",

For that reason, the old data were revised and additionally, in spring 2015, the new GNNS campaign was carried out at tide gauges in Swinoujscie, Ustka and Wladyslawowo. The study concerns computation of the local average geopotential value $$ W_{0}^{L} $$ using water level data at the three tide gauges, geoid undulations from a global geopotential model EGM2008 and ellipsoidal heights from GNSS observations, which were obtained using revised data from three campaigns of Baltic Sea Level Project and from the new campaign conducted in 2015. Results obtained indicate that the best estimation of $$ W_{0}^{L} $$ was achieved from the campaign carried out in 2015, where the mean value of $$ W_{0}^{L} $$ calculated for three investigated tide gauge stations is equal to 62636857.45 m2 s−2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this paper is to present a new approach for forecasting NAO index (NAOi) based on predictions of sea level anomalies (SLAs). We utilize significant correlations (Pearson’s r up to 0.69) between sea surface height (SSH) calculated for the North Atlantic (15–65°N, basin-wide) and winter Hurrell NAOi, as shown by Esselborn and Eden (Geophys Res Lett 28:3473–3476, 2001). We consider the seasonal and monthly data of Hurrell NAOi, ranging from 1993 to 2017. Weekly prognoses of SLA are provided by the Prognocean Plus system which uses several data-based models to predict sea level variation. Our experiment consists of three steps: (1) we calculate correlation between the first principal component (PC1) of SSH/SLA data and NAOi, (2) we determine coefficients of a linear regression model which describes the relationship between winter NAOi and PC1 of SLA data (1993–2013), (3) we build two regression models in order to predict winter NAOi (by attaching SLA forecasts and applying coefficients of the fitted regression models). The resulting 3-month prognoses of winter NAOi are found to reveal mean absolute errors of 1.5 or less. The choice of method for preparing SLA data for principal component analysis is shown to have a stronger impact on the prediction performance than the selection of SLA prediction method itself.",

    "abstract": "Brittle basement and sedimentary rocks, in particular if these are underlain by radiogenic crust, are considered a prime target for enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). They are marked by high geothermal gradients, caused by radiogenic heat production, and are well suited to be used for geothermal doublets after hydraulic stimulation. Critical conditions for successful EGS projects are: (a) tectonic stresses close to failure, allowing creation of induced fractures by means of hydraulic stimulation; (b) sufficient high temperatures >150 °C, preferably in excess of 200 °C, at depths of less than 5 km; (c) sufficient high water flow rates, to be sustained through induced fractures. For geothermal production, knowledge on thermo-mechanical properties of the lithosphere provides critical constraints on crustal stresses and basement temperatures. We developed a freely available 1D thermal and rheological model for basement-sedimentary areas. This tool helps to understand variability of deep temperatures, as an effect of uncertainties in thermal and rheological properties and tectonic constraints for the lithosphere, important for assessing geothermal prospectivity. The tool is demonstrated on the Central System in Spain and the adjacent Tajo and Duero basins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the results of research and analyses related to the development of a new quasigeoid model fitted to GNSS/levelling data for the area of Poland (PL-geoid2021). The model was determined employing two procedures based on the Geophysical Gravity data Inversion technique (GGI method): procedure A consisted of the determination of the gravimetric quasigeoid model in the first step and its subsequent fitting to GNSS/levelling data in the second step, and procedure B consisted of a one-step determination of the model fitted to GNSS/levelling data. Both models were developed using the global geopotential model SGG-UGM-2 and gravity data covering the area of Poland, and slightly extend beyond Poland's southern and northern borders. The average model was adopted as the final model. It was demonstrated that the accuracy of the gravimetric quasigeoid model had a very low dependence on the reference topographic mass density model used. On the basis of this model, the GNSS/levelling datasets were also assessed and outliers were identified. The estimated accuracy of the gravimetric model, determined based on four GNSS/levelling datasets, was in the range of ± 1.2 to ± 1.7 cm, in terms of the standard deviation of the differences between the measured and model-determined height anomalies. Due to partial lack of gravity data just beyond the Polish border, the edge effect was also analysed. The accuracy of the final quasigeoid model (estimated in the same way as the gravimetric model) ranges from ± 1.0 to ± 1.2 cm. It should be noted, however, that this assessment is not fully independent because three of the four sets of GNSS/levelling points used for it, were also used to build the final model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mud volcanoes are geological structures observed throughout the world that arise from the upwelling of deep fluids along discontinuities in the subsoil. The detection of mud fluid migration pathways can be challenging, even when using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) as detectability issues may arise from complex geological settings. This paper presents new results from 2D and 3D ERT synthetic modelling for the investigation of the shallow, internal structure of terrestrial mud volcanoes. This study revealed the internal structure of the ‘Cenerone-Pineto’ mud volcano (Central Italy) and provided further clues as to its internal structure. The main results of the study are: the presence of a mud chamber, which represents the last phase of mud accumulation before final emission, not located beneath the crater but laterally offset, as well as the presence of a narrow, shallow feeder channel; these findings represent evidence of a much more complex structure than one would expect. This means that the mud volcano is not supplied with mud fluids directly from below as would be the case with an uprising of deep fluid along a near-vertical open fracture and that the shallow mud fluid reservoir is not correlated to the distribution of any mud volcano observed on the surface. Findings from this study are consistent with the observed structural features already noted in ERT and seismic field data collected at the ‘Cenerone-Pineto’ mud volcano and may be helpful in explaining the mechanisms and processes involved in mud volcanism in similar geological settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The detection of deformation is one of the major tasks in surveying engineering. It is meaningful only if the statistical significance of the distortions is correctly investigated, which often underlies a parametric modelization of the object under consideration. So-called regression B-spline approximation can be performed for point clouds of terrestrial laser scanners, allowing the setting of a specific congruence test based on the B-spline surfaces. Such tests are known to be strongly influenced by the underlying stochastic model chosen for the observation errors. The latter has to be correctly specified, which includes accounting for heteroscedasticity and correlations. In this contribution, we justify and make use of a parametric correlation model called the Matérn model to approximate the variance covariance matrix (VCM) of the residuals by performing their empirical mode decomposition. The VCM obtained is integrated into the computation of the congruence test statistics for a more trustworthy test decision. Using a real case study, we estimate the distribution of the test statistics with a bootstrap approach, where no parametric assumptions are made about the underlying population that generated the random sample. This procedure allows us to assess the impact of neglecting correlations on the critical value of the congruence test, highlighting their importance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, a set of machine learning (ML) tools is applied to estimate the water saturation of shallow unconsolidated sediments at the Bátaapáti site in Hungary. Water saturation is directly calculated from the first factor extracted from a set of direct push logs by factor analysis. The dataset observed by engineering geophysical sounding tools as special variants of direct-push probes contains data from a total of 12 shallow penetration holes. Both one- and two-dimensional applications of the suggested method are presented. To improve the performance of factor analysis, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to give a globally optimized estimate for the factor scores. Furthermore, by a hyperparameter estimation approach, some control parameters of the utilized PSO algorithm are automatically estimated by simulated annealing (SA) to ensure the convergence of the procedure. The result of the suggested ML-based log analysis method is compared and verified by an independent inversion estimate. The study shows that the PSO-based factor analysis aided by hyperparameter estimation provides reliable in situ estimates of water saturation, which may improve the solution of environmental end engineering problems in shallow unconsolidated heterogeneous formations.",

Within this research we analyzed the Global Positioning System vertical position time series acquired in the vicinity of the superconducting gravimeters. We estimated of noise character of GPS and SG by comparison of the satellite and terrestrial measurements collected at 18 globally distributed neighboring sites. The comparable results were provided by applying the appropriate and corresponding models of geophysical phenomena to obtain residual time series, and by unifying the sampling rate since the noise characteristics may depend on it. The deterministic part of the series was assumed to follow the Polynomial Trend Model and was subtracted prior to noise analysis. Then, a combination of power-law and white noise was presumed and the Maximum Likelihood Estimation implemented in the Hector software to investigate the stochastic part was applied. Within the paper, we show that the spectral indices for all SG time series fall in the area of fractional Brownian motion (− 2 < κ < − 1), while GPS data are best characterized by fractional Gaussian noises (− 1 < κ < 0). The estimated ratio between spectral indices of GPS and SG is stable worldwide with a global median value of about 0.5. Concerning the power-law amplitudes, these are very consistent worldwide for the GPS position time series and fluctuate around 15 mm/year−κ/4, while in the case of SG records they spread between 60 and 300 nm/s2/year−κ/4. The fraction of power-law noise employed in the assumed combination is equal to 100% for almost all SG stations, while in case of GPS it varies between 26.1 and 99.9%. The main finding of this research is that the assumption of power-law noise is much more preferred for SG data than the assumption of a pure white noise being used until now.",

The main event was preceded by four foreshocks and followed by four aftershocks.

The resulting spectral source parameters for the investigated events agree well with the results of earlier research. We have also shown that our recently developed probabilistic waveform inversion techniques applied in this study are suitable to retrieve the source mechanism for weak local earthquakes. We have successfully estimated the focal mechanism for the mainshock, a foreshock and an aftershock. Each earthquake was a thrust faulting event with a sub-horizontal P-axis pointing towards N-NE, coinciding with the general trend of the compressional stress field in the epicentral region.",

This effective tool of the joint seismic and well-log data processing enables to predict and analyze fluid saturated porous geological formations. AVO methodology is based on the anomalous behavior of the pre-stack reflected amplitudes observed from fluid bearing rocks. However, the potential of AVO methodology is still unexploited in geothermal exploration, although the lithology and rock physical properties are very similar. In this study, we summarize the theoretical backgrounds and calculate synthetic AVO responses of a known geothermal reservoir located in the fractured carbonates of the Mesozoic basement. We demonstrate that the AVO response of a deep geothermal reservoir can be quite different from the amplitude response observed from a hydrocarbon bearing clastic formation. AVO attributes of the investigated geothermal reservoir are presented, and the potential of its detection by seismic amplitude data are discussed.",

With the help of large number of available measured data, these changes can be examined with advanced mathematical methods. In the outlined research we were able to collect long precipitation datasets from two different climatical regions, one sample area being Ecuador, the other one being Kenya. Using the methodology of spectral analysis based on the discrete Fourier-transformation, several deterministic components were calculated locally in the otherwise stochastic time series, while by the comparison of the results, also with previous calculations from Hungary, several global precipitation cycles were defined in the time interval between 1980 and 2019. The results of these calculations, the described local, regional, and global precipitation cycles can be a helpful tool for groundwater management, as precipitation is the major resource of groundwater recharge, as well as with the help of these deterministic cycles, precipitation forecasts can be delivered for the areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new histogram-based robust filter developed for noise reduction of digital elevation model data is presented. When large percentage of data points in data matrices are contaminated with outlier noise, the noise reduction process can give better results than traditional median filtering, if elements with a potentially higher chance of being noise are eliminated by weighting from the input dataset before the median value is calculated. However, on the same matrices, there are likely to be subsets of data where unfiltered input is more reasonable for the calculation. The new method implementing weighting between these two cases is presented below, with its initial tuning and a comparison with both standard median filtering and the Most Frequent Value (MFV) method, as the latter being much more efficient than the usual methods. Following the description of the procedures, their effectiveness is compared for noise reduction in digital elevation model data systems, at various noise levels. The comparison is done mainly by three measures, with most of the focus on the $${L}_{1}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>L</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:math> norm data distance results. Finally, a modified version of the method—which includes Steiner’s MFV filter as a core part—is also introduced, with similar examination. The method to be presented has been shown to be superior to conventional median filtering for most noise rates, and in many cases also to Steiner' MFV, for handling non-zero mean noises. The modified version of the method—with the help of Steiner's MFV—has also achieved this in handling zero mean noise, in the field of application described in the paper.",

The mathematical model of a benchmark displacement process was worked out to estimate the maximum deformation velocity and the time of maximum velocity occurrence. The comparison between the measured and calculated data was presented. The displacement velocity value was compared to the seismic activity recorded during the exploitation period. Four cases were thoroughly investigated as they represent types of relation between the seismic activity and the deformation velocity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Salt crystallization is the most important weathering processes that causes problems for rocks used as building stones. Therefore, assessment of the physico-mechanical properties of stones against cyclic salt crystallization is a critical issue for rock engineering applications in salty environmental conditions especially prone to abrasion. This research aims at investigating the relationship between the degradation of various physico-mechanical properties including apparent porosity, point load index, unconfined compression strength and abrasion loss rate for rocks during salt weathering process. For showing rock weathering in the salt crystallization process, five kinds of carbonate rocks were sampled from different areas of Egypt and subject to cyclic salt crystallization, up to twenty cycles. The variation rates of their physico-mechanical characteristics and abrasion loss values were calculated after each five cycles of salt weathering. The results showed that the studied rocks are suitable for use as building and decorative stones in areas prone to crystallization of salts, but attention must be paid to rocks with high porosity and low strength characteristics such as El-Minia limestone specimens. It was also found that there are strong linear correlations between the physico-mechanical degradation parameters and the abrasion loss rate of the studied rock samples at the end of the twentieth cycle of salt weathering. These relationships may be used to estimate the abrasion loss rate of the studied rock types against the cyclic salt weathering conditions and hence to make a rapid evaluation of the stone durability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper concerns a novel concept based on the iterative approach applied for solving the nonlinear satellite-fixed geodetic boundary value problem (NSFGBVP) using the finite element method (FEM). We formulate the NSFGBVP that consists of the Laplace equation defined in the 3D bounded domain outside the Earth, the nonlinear boundary condition (BC) prescribed on the disretized Earth’s surface, and the Dirichlet BC given on a spherical boundary placed approximately at the altitude of GOCE satellite mission and additional four side boundaries. The iterative approach is based on determining the direction of actual gravity vector together with the value of the disturbing potential. Such a concept leads to the first iteration where the oblique derivative boundary value problem is solved, and the last iteration represents the approximation of the actual disturbing potential and the direction of gravity vector. As a numerical method for our approach, we implement the FEM with triangular prisms. High-resolution numerical experiments deal with the local gravity field modelling in the Andean, Himalayan and Alpine mountain range, where we focus on the contribution to the disturbing potential solution by solving the nonlinear geodetic boundary value problem in comparison with the solution to the oblique derivative geodetic boundary value problem. The obtained results showed the maximal contribution of the presented approach 0.0571 [ $${\\text{m}}^{{\\text{2}}} {\\text{s}}^{{{\\text{ - 2}}}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>2</mml:mtext> </mml:msup> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>s</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mspace/> <mml:mtext>- 2</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ] (Andes), 0.0702 [ $${\\text{m}}^{{\\text{2}}} {\\text{s}}^{{{\\text{ - 2}}}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>2</mml:mtext> </mml:msup> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>s</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mspace/> <mml:mtext>- 2</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ] (Himalayas), 0.0066 [ $${\\text{m}}^{{\\text{2}}} {\\text{s}}^{{{\\text{ - 2}}}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>2</mml:mtext> </mml:msup> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>s</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mspace/> <mml:mtext>- 2</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ] (Alps) in the disturbing potential, that is located in the areas of the highest values of the deflection of vertical.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water vapour is a critical atmospheric parameter to understand the Earth's climate system and it is characterized by a complex variability in time and space. GNSS observations have become an important source of information of the water vapour, thanks to its high temporal and spatial resolution. However, the lack of meteorological sites collocated with the GNSS site could hamper water vapour retrieval. The empirical blind models can fill this gap. This study analyses the temporal and spatial distribution of the water vapour using nine GNSS sites located on the Atlantic coast of Spain and France, with the empirical blind model GPT3 as the source of meteorological information. The observations were processed with Bernese 5.2 software on a double difference approach and validated with Zenith Total Delay EUREF REPRO2 values. Consequently, four-years series of water vapour was determined and validated using two matched radiosonde sites. The characterization of the water vapour on the area shows clear seasonal characteristics that the technique captures, using an empirical blind model for the whole process. Maximum values are observed in summer season and minimum in winter. The PWV tends to decrease with increasing latitude in the area of the study. The short-term variations can be reproduced by the high temporal resolution of the GNSS-retrieved water vapour and show a different behaviour over the area, but a similar pattern with a peak in the afternoon and minimum at night was found. Also, less variability is observed in winter season and higher in summertime.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new inversion based Fourier transformation technique named as Legendre-Polynomials Least-Squares Fourier Transformation (L-LSQ-FT) and Legendre-Polynomials Iteratively Reweighted Least-Squares Fourier Transformation (L-IRLS-FT) are presented. The introduced L-LSQ-FT algorithm establishes an overdetermined inverse problem from the Fourier transform. The spectrum was approximated by a series expansion limited to a finite number of terms, and the solution of inverse problem, which gives the values of series expansion coefficients, was obtained by the LSQ method. Practically, results from the least square method are responsive to data outliers, thus scattered large errors and the estimated model values may be far from reality. A definitely better option is attained by introducing Steiner’s Most Frequent Value method. By combining the IRLS algorithm with Cauchy-Steiner weights, the Fourier transformation process was robustified to give the L-IRLS-FT method. In both cases Legendre polynomials were applied as basis functions. Thus the approximation of the continuous Fourier spectra is given by a finite series of Legendre polynomials and their coefficients. The series expansion coefficients were obtained as a solution to an overdetermined non-linear inverse problem. The traditional DFT and the L-IRLS-FT were tested numerically using synthetic datasets as well as field magnetic data. The resulting images clearly show the reduced sensitivity of the newly developed L-IRLS-FT methods to outliers and scattered noise compared to the traditional DFT. Conclusively, the newly developed L-IRLS-FT can be considered to be a better alternative to the traditional DFT.",

    "abstract": "Abstract QDaedalus is an automated, computer-controlled astro-geodetic measurement system. Astronomical deflections of the vertical measured by the QDaedalus system are significantly influenced by atmospheric refraction. Therefore, the measuring system was further improved by recording the environmental parameters influencing the refraction (air pressure, temperature, humidity) with accurate and high time resolution. In addition to meteorological parameters, refraction also depends on the spectrum of the stars. Both the continuously measured meteorological parameters and the color of the stars were taken into account in the calculation of the refraction. To control the method, we used the deflection of the vertical values of the Pistahegy point in the southern part of Budapest which were determined over 7 years during 260 night measurements. The corrected measurements fit within 0.01\" with the average value of previous Pistahegy measurements. The standard deviation of the differences due to the corrections, however, may reach 0.015\" for the DOV components.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Sirente main crater is a ≈ 130 m wide, in plan view droplet-shaped depression with an elevated rim, surrounded by 30 smaller depressions. It was proposed to be of meteorite impact origin. Given the age of formation in the 3rd to 5th centuries A.D., the inferred catastrophic origin was related to the celestial sign (“Chi Rho”) said to have been seen by Emperor Constantine in 312 A.D. and suggested to have changed the course of both Roman and Christian history. However, the meteoritic origin is not yet confirmed. This paper presents new results from synthetic modelling of Electric Resistivity Tomography field data collected at the Sirente main crater which provide further clues around the controversy of its origin. This study arises from the need to validate the observed structural features which include possible upturned strata (i.e., overturning of strata below impact crater rims) and compaction-fissure-like features below and just outside the crater rim, well-developed “breccia lens”, as well as an ejecta layer, and provide key indicators for objective and quantitative interpretation of the measured resistivity pattern. The results from this study are consistent with the hypothesis of a small impact crater in a low-strength target, with a relatively shallow apparent crater and do not support other proposed mechanisms of formation such as karst, mud volcano or merely anthropogenic origin.",

The non-Gaussian noise distribution—especially the outliers in the data sets- can cause appreciable distortions in the tomographic imaging. To reduce the noise sensitivity well-developed tomography algorithms can be used. On the other hand, the quality of the tomogram can further be improved by using image processing tools. In the paper, a newly developed robust filter is presented, in which the Most Frequent Value (MFV) method developed by Steiner is applied. To analyze the noise reduction capability of the new filter (called Steiner-filter) and to compare it to smoothing filters based on arithmetic- and binomial mean, as well as median, medium-sized tomographic images are used. The MFV-based filter is successfully tested also in edge detection procedures.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the determination of gravity gradients from the orbital ceiling to the depth of the Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho) for Central Europe. Components of the Eötvös tensor were derived from “Heterogeneous gravity data combination for Earth interior and geophysical exploration research” project (“GOCE+”) by using the gridded data with a resolution of 0.2° per 0.2°. Gravity gradients to Moho boundary depth were modelled forward to the 255 km orbital height. We calculated gradient sensitivity using a 3D model divided into: sediments and consolidated crust including the precise location of the Moho boundary. To define tesseroids as mathematical model we need to set two parameters of the crust: density and thickness for each spherical layer separately. Altitudes for topography/bathymetry were derived from ETOPO1 model, sediments thickness from EuCRUST-07 model, and Moho boundary from Grad and Tiira (Geophys J Int 176(1):279–292, 2009. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246x.2008.03919.x ) seismic map. For high latitudes, we noted the largest changes for the gradients towards the poles, with particular values of 689.07 mE (milli-eotvos) and 1138.19 mE for VXX and VZZ gradients, respectively. We obtained extreme values for the location of the deep and shallow areas of the crust (Alps, North-Eastern Poland and areas of seas) equal to − 3 E and + 1.5 E, respectively. Most of the gradients showed strong correlation with anomalies in crustal density of − 2.5 E for VZZ and + 1.5 E for VYY in the extreme cases. We showed that changes in crust density and thickness by respectively 50 kg/m3 and 10 km entail changes in gradient values by 15% for density and 10% for depths. Numerical analysis considering Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) showed importance of density modeling for determination of gravity gradients.",

First, the mathematical form of a global spherical harmonic model is presented. Second, the necessary conversion from global (geocentric) into local rectangular coordinates is given. Third, Laplace’s equation is solved by the method of separation of variables in local rectangular coordinates and its solutions in different functional forms are presented. Then, the estimation of the coefficients of these mathematical models by a least squares’ adjustment process is described, using as data the values of the disturbing potential of the Earth’s gravity field. The strategy for the selection of the best mathematical model for a successful transformation is described and validated in different case studies. These refer to areas in Greece, China and Germany and include comparisons with other models or methods. The results show the applicability of the presented transformation and confirm its advantages.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since the Moon is less flattened than the Earth, most lunar GIS applications use a spherical datum. However, with the renaissance of lunar missions, it seems worthwhile to define an ellipsoid of revolution that better fits the selenoid. The main long-term benefit of this might be to make the lunar adaptation of methods already implemented in terrestrial GNSS and gravimetry easier and somewhat more accurate. In our work, we used the GRGM 1200A Lunar Geoid (Goossens et al. in A global degree and order 1200 model of the lunar gravity field using GRAIL mission data. In: Lunar and planetary science conference, Houston, TX, Abstract #1484, 2016; Lemoine et al. in Geophys Res Lett 41:3382–3389. http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014GL060027 , 2014), a 660th degree and order potential surface, developed in the frame of the GRAIL project. Samples were taken from the potential surface along a mesh that represents equal area pieces of the surface, using a Fibonacci sphere. We tried Fibonacci spheres with several numbers of points and also separately examined the effect of rotating the network for a given number of points on the estimated parameters. We estimated the best-fitting rotation ellipsoid’s semi-major axis and flatness data by minimizing the selenoid undulation values at the network points, which were obtained for a = 1,737,576.6 m and f = 0.000305. This parameter pair is already obtained for a 10,000 point grid, while the case of reducing the points of the mesh to 3000 does not cause a deviation in the axis data of more than 10 cm. As expected, the absolute value of the selenoid undulations have decreased compared to the values taken with respect to the spherical basal surface, but significant extreme values still remained as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The gravity field of the Earth is time-dependent due to several types of mass variations which take place on different time scales. Usually, the time-variability of the gravitational potential of the Earth is expressed by the monthly determination of a static geopotential model based on data from gravity field missions. In this paper, the variability of the potential is parameterized by a functional approach which contains a polynomial trend and periodic contributions. The respective parameters are estimated based on the monthly solutions derived from the GRACE and GRACE-FO gravity field mission up to a maximum degree of expansion $$n_\\text {max}=96$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>n</mml:mi> <mml:mtext>max</mml:mtext> </mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>96</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> . As a preliminary data analysis, a Fourier analysis is performed on selected potential coefficients from the available monthly solutions of the GFZ. The indicated frequency components are then used to formulate a time-dependent analytical approach to describe each Stokes coefficient’s temporal behaviour. Different approaches are presented that include both polynomial and periodic components. The respective parameters for modelling the temporal variability of the coefficients are estimated in a Gauss-Markov model and tested for significance by statistical methods. Extensive comparative numerical studies are carried out between the newly generated model variants and the existing monthly GRACE, GRACE-FO and the existing time dependent EIGEN-6S4 solutions. The numerical comparisons make it clear that estimated models based on all available monthly solutions describe the essential periods very well, but such monthly events that deviate strongly from the mean behaviour of the signal show less precision in the space domain. Models that are estimated based on fourteen consecutive monthly solutions, covering one selected year, represent the amplitudes much more precise. The statements made apply to four initial data used, which are filtered to varying degrees. In particular, DDK2, DDK5 and DDK8, as well as unfiltered coefficients were used. For all the model approaches used, it can be seen that the potential coefficients contain up to about $$n\\approx 40$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>n</mml:mi> <mml:mo>≈</mml:mo> <mml:mn>40</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> in case of DDK5 periodically signals with annual, semi-annual or quarterly, as well as Luna nodal periods and do not vary significantly beyond that degree. Only an offset can be estimated significantly for all Stokes coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The number of devices equipped with global satellite positioning has exceeded seven billion recently. There are a wide variety of receivers regarding their accuracy and reliability. Low cost, multi-frequency units have been released on the market latterly; however, the number of single-frequency receivers is still significant. Since their measurements are influenced by ionospheric delay, accurate ionosphere models are of utmost importance to reduce the effect. This paper summarizes how Gauss process regression (GPR) can be applied to derive near real-time regional ionosphere models using raw Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations of permanent stations. While Gauss process is widely used in machine learning, GPR is a nonparametric, Bayesian approach to regression. GPR has several benefits for ionosphere monitoring since it is quite robust and efficient to derive a grid model from data available in irregular set of ionospheric pierce points. The corresponding instrumental delays are estimated by a parallel Kalman filter. The presented algorithm can be applied near real-time, however the results are offline calculated and are compared to two high quality TEC map products. Based on the analysis, the accuracy of the GPR modell is in 2 TECu range. The developed methods could be efficiently applied in the field of autonomous vehicle navigation with meeting both accuracy and integrity requirements.",

The method allows the determination of lateral changes of the layer-thicknesses together with the vertical and lateral variations of petrophysical parameters along a 2D cross-section of several boreholes. The method is assessed using noisy synthetic measurements of a petrophysical model made of two-layers structure related to hydrocarbon bearing formations. The numerical experiments aided to investigate the stability and convergence of the 2D interval inversion procedure. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the inversion results, the misfit of data and model distance are tested, beside the calculation of estimation errors and correlation coefficients. A large amount of input data relative to the number of unknowns results in a high overdetermined ratio, consequently more precise estimates are obtained in stable and convergent procedure than in conventional local (1D) inversion schemes. The feasibility of the 2D interval inversion method is shown by analysing in-situ well logging data acquired in four wells situated in an Egyptian hydrocarbon field.",

For the interpretation of the key section, observations from raw magnetotelluric data and inversion results were used. In addition, other geophysical-geological information was also considered to confirm the conclusions based on the electrical resistivity sections. All this information was combined to identify the main structural lines and geologic units along the profile. Main structural lines observed on the resistivity sections are the Alpokalja line, Rába line, Balaton line, Kapos line, and Mecsekalja line. Geologic units that can be delineated due to their resistivity contrast include the Lower and Upper Austroalpine Units, the Transdanubian Range Unit, the Mid-Hungarian Megaunit, the Tisza Megaunit and sedimentary rocks filling the sub-basins of the Miocene Pannonian back-arc basin.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study outlines the planning, emphases, and proposed implementation of a gravimetric control network for Israel. The establishment of a comprehensive and accurate gravimetric control network is crucial for various geodetic applications, including geoid determination, gravity field modelling, vertical datum establishment, and geophysical studies. This study aims to provide a framework for the development and implementation of such a network in Israel. The proposed network is divided into two orders. The first order, also known as the absolute order or zero order, comprises four stations situated in geologically stable and tranquil locations. The second order, referred to as the first order, is established through relative gravimetric measurements. This order will encompass 29 stations positioned in areas that are both stable and secure. The zero and first order stations will be evenly distributed throughout the country to ensure homogeneous coverage. The proposed gravimetric network is in conjunction with the requirements to improve the geoid undulation model of Israel. Through the establishment of a small gravimetric network and the implementation of relative gravimetric measurements, we were able to determine the optimal control point density and establish a well-structured methodology for measurement, analysis, and the adjustment process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Before performing the inversion process, the original measured data set is often transformed (corrected, smoothed, Fourier-transformed, interpolated etc.). These preliminary transformations may make the original (statistically independent) noisy measurement data correlated. The noise correlation on transformed data must be taken into account in the parameter fitting procedure (inversion) by proper derivation of likelihood function. The covariance matrix of transformed data system is no longer diagonal, so the likelihood based metrics, which determines the fitting process is also changed as well as the results of inversion. In the practice, these changes are often neglected using the “customary” estimation procedure (simple least square method) resulting wrong uncertainty estimation and sometimes biased results. In this article the consequence of neglected correlation is studied and discussed by decomposing the inversion functional to “customary” and additional part which represents the effect of correlation. The ratio of two components demonstrates the importance and justification of the inversion method modification.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the conventional petrophysical interpretation fixed (predefined) zone parameters are applied for every interpretation zone (depth intervals). Their inclusion in the inversion process requires the extension of a likelihood function for the whole zone. This allows to define the extremum problem for fitting the parameter set to the full interval petrophysical model of the layers crossed by the well, both for the parameters associated with the depth points (e.g. porosity, saturations, rock matrix composition etc.) and for the zone parameters (e.g. formation water resistivity, cementation factor etc.). In this picture the parameters form a complex coupled and correlated system. Even the local parameters associated with different depths are coupled through the zone parameter change. In this paper, the statistical properties of the coupled parameter system are studied which fitted by the Interval Maximum Likelihood (ILM) method. The estimated values of the parameters are coupled through the likelihood function and this determines the correlation between them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, a new inversion method is proposed to process laboratory-measured induced polarization (IP) data. In the new procedure, the concept of the series expansion-based inversion is combined with a more general definition of the objective function. The time constant spectrum of the IP effect is assumed a line spectrum approximated by a series of Dirac’s delta function resulting in a square-integrable forward problem formula. This gives the applicability of the generalized objective function. The expansion coefficients as unknowns represent the model parameters of the inversion procedure. We use the new inversion procedure on an apparent polarizability dataset measured on a rock sample originated from the Recsk ore complex, northeast Hungary. The inversion results was compared to those of three additional laboratory datasets, which were measured on samples rich in ore minerals collected from the same area. The results are compared to those given by the traditional series expansion-based least squares method. It is shown that the newly proposed method gives more accurate and stable parameter estimation.",
