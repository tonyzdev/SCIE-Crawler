    "abstract": "The classification of adsorption hysteresis loops recommended by the IUPAC in 1984 was based on experimental observations and the application of classical principles of pore filling (notably the use of the Kelvin equation for mesopore analysis). Recent molecular simulation and density functional (DFT) studies of the physisorption of gases by model pore structures have greatly improved our understanding of the mechanisms of hysteresis and it is therefore timely to revisit the IUPAC recommendations. In this review, we conclude that there is no immediate need to change the IUPAC classification of physisorption isotherms and hysteresis loops. However, in the light of recent advances, we are able to offer a revised checklist for the analysis of nitrogen isotherms on nanoporous solids: this includes a carefully regulated application of DFT in place of a classical procedure such as the well-known Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.",

The Elovich model and the pseudo-second order model both provided a high degree of correlation with the experimental data for most of the sorption process. There was a small discrepancy at the initial stages of sorption which suggested that film diffusion or wetting of the peat may be involved in the early part of the sorption process. Models evaluated included the fractional power equation, the Elovich equation, the pseudo-first order equation and the pseudo-second order equation.

The oxygen-containing groups of activated carbon prepared from CW play an important role in dyes ions adsorption onto activated carbon prepared from CW. The activated carbon is characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Adsorption experiments were carried out as batch studies at different contact time, pH, and initial dye concentration. The dye adsorption equilibrium was attained after 120 min of contact time. Removal of dye in acidic solutions was better than in basic solutions. The adsorption of dye increased with increasing initial dye concentration. The equilibrium data were revealed that Langmuir model was more suitable to describe the congo red adsorption and demonstrated excellent reusability potential with desorption greater than 90% throughout six consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles. Experimental data founded that kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order equation. Thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption was a spontaneous and exothermic process. According to the FTIR analyses, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between dyes and oxygen-containing functional groups on activated carbon prepared from CW are dominant mechanisms for dye adsorption.",

Analysis of equilibrium adsorption data in terms of several isotherm models revealed that Langmuir isotherm with respect to Freundlich isotherm indicates better agreement with the experimental data.

    "abstract": "As a scarce natural resource, the preservation of water quality is of fundamental importance to guarantee its availability for future generations. Due to the increasing industrial activity, effluents are generated with a series of chemical compounds, such as nitrogenous, phosphoric, and organic compounds, heavy metals, and dyes which, if improperly disposed of, contribute to contamination, followed by significant environmental impacts, in addition to the damage to human health. The adsorption technique is an effective approach for removing contaminants from effluents, showing high versatility, due to the use of various materials as adsorbents. Belonging to a wide variety of materials, zeolites reveal to be a promising adsorbent. Zeolites are minerals found in nature or which can be synthesized from industrial residues, standing out in the treatment of contaminated effluents. Zeolite removal efficiency depends on the contaminant to be removed and can reach up to 96% for heavy metals, 90% for phosphoric compounds, 96% for dyes, 80% for nitrogen compounds, and 89% for organics. Aiming at the identification of the more relevant findings and research gaps to advance the use of zeolites in the large-scale treatment of industrial effluents, a review on the recent application of zeolites is needed. This paper presents a global view of zeolites, and a review is conducted on several recent studies using zeolites as adsorbents for the contaminants considered, indicating the main characteristics of the various adsorption systems, demonstrating the particularities of each process, and aiming to reveal useful information to provide future research, in addition to identifying points that need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Adsorption processes often include three important components: kinetics, isotherm, and thermodynamics. In the study of solid–liquid adsorption, “standard” thermodynamic equilibrium constant [Formula: see text]; dimensionless) plays an essential role in accurately calculating three thermodynamic parameters: the standard Gibbs energy change (∆ G°; kJ/mol), the standard change in enthalpy (∆ H°; kJ/mol), and the standard change in entropy [∆ S°; J/(mol × K)] of an adsorption process. Misconception of the derivation of the [Formula: see text] constant that can cause calculative errors in values (magnitude and sign) of the thermodynamic parameters has been intensively reflected through certain kinds of papers (i.e., letters to editor, discussions, short communications, and correspondence like comment/rebuttal). The distribution coefficient ( K D ) and Freundlich constant ( K F ) have been intensively applied for calculating the thermodynamic parameters. However, a critical question is whether K D or K F is equal to [Formula: see text]. This paper gives (1) thorough discussion on the derivation of thermodynamic equilibrium constant of solid–liquid adsorption process, (2) reasonable explanation on the inconsistency of (direct and indirect) application of K D or K F for calculating the thermodynamic parameters based on the derivation of [Formula: see text], and (3) helpful suggestions for improving the quality of papers published in this field.",

It was found that low adsorbate concentration, small particle size of the adsorbent, a temperature of 25°C and a pH value of 7.5 for the medium all favour the removal of dye from aqueous solutions. The percentage of dye adsorbed by sugar cane dust decreased from 96.48% to 83.32% and from 90.78% to 78.02% for Malachite Green and Methylene Blue, respectively, when the concentration of the dye was increased from 6 mg/l to 12 mg/l. Similarly, the adsorption of Crystal Violet and of Rhodamine B also decreased with increasing dye concentration in the solutions. The amount of dye (Malachite Green and Rhodamine B) adsorbed decreased from 3.04 mg/g to 2.57 mg/g and from 2.53 mg/g to 2.17 mg/g when the temperature of the solution was increased from 25°C to 45°C, indicating that the process was exothermic. The values of the adsorption capacity (Q 0 ) of Malachite Green and Rhodamine B on the adsorbent varied from 4.87 to 4.08 and from 4.26 to 3.82, respectively, as the temperature increased from 25°C to 45°C. The equilibrium data obey the requirements of the Langmuir adsorption model, demonstrating the formation of a monolayer of dye molecules on the outer surface of the adsorbent. The variation in the extent of removal with pH has been explained on the basis of surface ionisation and complexation. Various thermodynamic parameters (ΔG 0 , ΔH 0 and ΔS 0 ) have also been determined in order to explain the results.",

Rubidium carbonate was used to prepare Z. jujuba rubidium carbonate-activated carbon by chemical activation using a 1:1 w/w ratio. Our results indicate that the obtained surface area of the activated carbon was equal to 608.31 m 2 /g. The adsorption study of Cr(VI) was investigated under batch conditions at constant stirring speed (220 r/min). Factors such as pH (1–6), temperature (20–40°C), adsorbent concentration (0.5–3 g/l), and initial Cr(VI) concentration (50–500 mg/l) were all studied to attain the maximum removal efficiency. Prior to the adsorption process, the morphology, elementary composition, and loss mass of activated carbon were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the adsorbent demonstrated the presence of key functional groups associated with the adsorption phenomenon such as those of hydroxyl and aromatic groups. The obtained results showed that the optimal conditions for a maximum adsorption efficiency are 2 for pH, 1 g/l for activated carbon dosage and 100 mg/l for Cr(VI) concentration. The removal percentage increased from 27.2 to 62.08%. The kinetic sorption was described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic equation ( R 2 ≈ 0.995). The Tóth ( R 2 = 0.997) and Elovich models were best to explain the sorption phenomenon.

The only practical sources of helium are from certain natural gas (NG) fields. As world demand for helium rapidly increases, the value of NG fields that contain it even in very small amounts is likely to rise significantly if the helium can be recovered efficiently. However, recovering the helium from the NG using conventional cryogenic distillation processes is expensive and energy intensive. We review the scope for improving the efficiency of the conventional helium recovery and upgrade processes, and evaluate the potential of emerging technologies based on adsorption or membrane separations for helium upgrade and purification. Helium recovery and purification processes are comparable in many ways with systems designed for hydrogen purification and thus, many of recent technological advances for H 2 separation from CH 4 N 2 and CO 2 may be applicable to a helium recovery process. Furthermore, some recent patents and pilot plant studies indicate there exist several opportunities for the development of advanced materials, such as helium-selective adsorbents, and optimized process operations for the recovery of helium from NG.",

Results demonstrated that the characteristics of activated carbons strongly depend on the method used for their synthesis.

    "abstract": "In view of the fugitive dusts caused by wind disturbance and material handling in coal bunkers, surface plants, and open-air coal stocking yards of coal businesses, the solidifying dust suppressant based on modified chitosan is synthesized and prepared through the chemical modification of –NH 2 with chitosan as a raw material and –NH 2 was replaced by –CH 2 CH(OH)CH 2 N + (CH 3 )CI − through the technique of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to viscosity experiment results, the viscosity of the modified solidifying dust suppressant increased significantly. The coal particles suppressed by the dust suppressant as observed with a 50,000X scanning electron microscope were coagulated together, which indicated very good cohesion effect. In addition, wind erosion resistance experiment was conducted to analyze the wind erosion rate of coal powders before and after sprayed with the suppressant at different wind speeds, which indicated that the dust suppressant can effectively prevent fugitive dusts at a wind speed of 17 m/s.",

    "abstract": "The use of bottom ash of expired drugs incineration for removal of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solution has been investigated. Analytical techniques have been employed to find characteristics of adsorbent materials. The removal of Cu(II) was conducted in batch system, and the effects of pH, adsorbent dosage, initial concentrations of copper ions, and contact time on adsorption efficiency were studied. Optimum adsorption was achieved at a pH 5 and equilibrium was established within 15 min of the process. The equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed using eight adsorption isotherm models: Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Redlich–Peterson, Dubinin–Radushkevich, Toth, Harkin–Jura and Halsey isotherms. The energy value obtained by application of Dubinin–Radushkevich model was 2.593 kJ/mol indicating that physisorption was the dominant mechanism of sorption. The values of the correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of the isotherms gave the best fit (&gt;0.99) with the Langmuir, Toth, and Redlich–Peterson isotherms. The adsorption capacity (q m ) from the Langmuir isotherm for Cu(II) was found as 13.335 mg/g. The equation constant n of Toth isotherm model is found to be close to 1 (0.945), confirming that the adsorbent studied presents homogeneous surface under conditions used. It is concluded that bottom ash of expired drugs incineration can be used as an effective adsorbent for removing Cu(II) from aqueous solution.",

For this reason, the main purpose of this work is to show that the use of linear least-squares methods for estimating adsorption isotherm parameters leads to some serious drawbacks, which can be readily avoided through proper use of non-linear procedures and posterior statistical analyses of the parameter-estimation results, enhancing the quality of the obtained results.",

The adsorption properties of both activated carbon with gentian violet were conducted at variable stirring speed 100–700 trs/min, adsorbent dose 1–8 g/l, solution pH 1–14, initial gentian violet concentration 5–15 mg/l, contact time 0–50 min, and temperature 299–323 K using batch mode operation to find the optimal conditions for a maximum adsorption.

    "abstract": "Nanotechnology and nanoparticles (NPs) have increasingly been studied as an alternative for antibiotics because of the feasibility to be used in implantable devices both for bacterial detection and infection prevention. The low rate of resistance development against NPs because of its multiple mode of action has contributed to its increased acceptance in clinical setting. Further development of NPs and their anticancer activity against many human cancer cell lines including breast and ovarian have been documented. Fe2O3-NPs could be used for antibacterial and anticancer activity assessment. Iron oxide, apart from being available extensively and cheap, also plays a role in multiple biological processes, making it an interesting metal for NPs. The aim of the present study revolves around generation and characterization of iron oxide Fe2O3-NPs, followed by assessment of its antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Synthesis of Fe2O3-NPs was performed by hydrothermal approach, and its characterization was done by UV-visible, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Antimicrobial activity was checked by agar diffusion assay against Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. Anticancer activity of the NPs was assessed using the human cancer cell lines including cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa) and MCF7. The developed Fe2O3-NPs exhibited a characteristic absorption curve in the 500-600 nm wavelength range by UV-visible analysis, the XRD peaks were found to index the rhombohedral shape, and the FTIR analysis ascertained the bonds and functional groups at wavenumber from 400 to 4000 cm-1. Antimicrobial assay detected significant effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with zones of inhibition: 21 and 22 mm, respectively. Likewise, Fe2O3-NPs show good activity towards tested fungal strain Candida albicans with zone of inhibition of 24 mm. The 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay identified significant anticancer activity of the NPs against both cell lines. Our study documents the successful generation and characterization of Fe2O3-NPs having excellent antimicrobial and anticancer activities.",

This has not only become the key issues in scientific research but also turned to be an important social issues of the public’s life. Therefore, many experts and scholars at different R&amp;Ds, universities, and abroad are involved in lot of research on PM 2.5 pollutant predictions. In this scenario, the authors proposed various machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest, KNN, ridge and lasso, XGBoost, and AdaBoost models to predict PM 2.5 pollutants in polluted cities. This experiment is carried out using Jupyter Notebook in Python 3.7.3. From the results with respect to MAE, MAPE, and RMSE metrics, among the models, XGBoost, AdaBoost, random forest, and KNN models (8.27, 0.40, and 13.85; 9.23, 0.45, and 10.59; 39.84, 1.94, and 54.59; and 49.13, 2.40, and 69.92, respectively) are observed to be more reliable models.

    "abstract": "Presently, hazardous metal and dye removal from wastewater is one of the major areas of research focus. For the elimination of these contaminants, many approaches have been devised and applied. However, the accomplishment of various water treatment processes has largely depended on the medium utilized and the associated problem with the leaching of harmful compounds into the water process with most commercial and chemically manufactured materials for water treatment processes. Hence, this study is aimed at reviewing existing studies on the sorption of heavy metals (HMs) and dyes using bionanocomposites (BNCs). The key focus of this review is on the development of eco-friendly, effective, and appropriate nanoadsorbents that could accomplish superior and enhanced contaminant sequestration using BNCs owing to their biodegradability, biocompatible, environmentally friendly, and not posing as secondary waste to the environment. The sorption of most pollutants was observed to be pH, sorbent dosage, and initial contaminant concentration-dependent, with most contaminants’ elimination taking place in the pH range of 2-10. The sorption process of HMs and dyes to various BNCs was superlatively depicted utilizing the Langmuir (LNR) and Freundlich (FL) as well as the pseudo-second-order (PSO) models, suggestive of the sorption process of a monolayer and multilayer and the chemisorption process, the rate-limiting stage in surface sorption. The established sorption capacities for the reviewed sorption process for various contaminants ranged from 1.47 to 740.97 mg/g. Future prospective for the treatment and remediation of contaminated water using BNCs was also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanomaterials are endowed with novel and magnificent optical, electrical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties, with a promising prospect in different advanced applications such as electronics, batteries, capacitors, wastewater treatment, membranes, heterogeneous catalysis, and medical sciences. However, macroscopic synthesis of carbon materials for industrial use has been a great challenge. Furthermore, structural nonhomogeneity and indefinite fabrication have hindered vigorous and consistent implementation of these materials in extensive technologies. Nevertheless, they offer exotic physics, and as a result, they have continued to attract great interest from the scientific community in an effort aimed to optimize their properties through innovative synthesis techniques, ensuring macroscopic production and discovering new applications. Hence, this study endeavours to provide a conscious review of these materials via the comprehensive discussion of the various allotropes of carbon (fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene), synthesis techniques (arc discharge, laser ablation, and chemical vapor deposition), and their applications in energy-related fields (batteries, capacitors, photocells, hydrogen storage, sensors, etc.) and their impending prospects.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the growth of tannery industries causes a significant volume of waste disposal to the environment due to harmful Cr(VI). Long-time exposure to Cr(VI) imposes serious hazards on all living organisms. Hence, the treatment of tannery waste to remove Cr(VI) is not a choice but mandatory. Therefore, this study focused on the removal of Cr(VI) from the aqueous solutions via a teff ( Eragrostis tef) straw based-activated carbon (TSAC) which was derived from locally available agricultural solid waste, teff straw (TS). The prepared TSAC was characterized using BET, FTIR, SEM, and XRD. A central composite approach-based RSM analysis was undertaken for statistical modeling and optimization for maximized Cr(VI) removal with respect to four important factors, namely, initial concentration of Cr(VI), the dosage of TSAC, pH, and adsorption time. Optimized values for maximizing adsorption of Cr(VI) (95% of removal) were acquired to be initial Cr(VI) concentration: 87.57 mg/L, TSAC dosage: 2.742 g/100 mL, pH: 2.2, and contact time:109 min. The results from the design of the experiment were also analyzed for the significance of the interaction between the selected process parameters. In addition, the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models were found suitable for describing the adsorption data. The adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) on TSAC was 19.48 mg/g. The observed thermodynamic characteristics reveal that Cr(VI) adsorption on TASC is endothermic in nature. From the results, TSAC had shown a potential Cr(VI) efficiency on optimized process conditions that can be exploited effectively as adsorbent for removal of Cr(VI)-contaminated wastes.",

    "abstract": "Contamination of water by ciprofloxacin has become a significant concern due to its adverse health effects and growing evidence of antimicrobial-resistant gene evolution. To this end, a chemically modified bamboo biochar was prepared from bamboo sawdust to effectively remove ciprofloxacin (CIP) from an aqueous solution. Under similar adsorption conditions, the modified bamboo biochar (MBC) has an excellent CIP removal efficiency (96%) compared to unmodified bamboo biochar (UBC) efficiency (45%). Thus, MBC was used in batch adsorption experiments, and the process was optimized with the central composite design (CCD) framework of response surface methodology (RSM). Sorption process parameters such as initial CIP concentration, pH, adsorbent dose, and contact time were studied and found to have a significant effect on CIP removal. The optimal CIP removal (96%) was obtained at MBC dose (0.5 g L -1 ), CIP initial concentration (20 mg L -1 ), pH (7.5), and contact time (46 min). The adsorption kinetic data were well described by the pseudo-second-order model ([Formula: see text]), and both Langmuir ([Formula: see text]) and Freundlich ([Formula: see text]) models gave the best fit in CIP adsorption isotherm analysis. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of the MBC was 78.43 mg g -1 based on the Langmuir isotherm model. These results suggest that CIP adsorption was mainly controlled by chemisorption. Moreover, the CIP adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. Overall, MBC is a low-cost, efficient, and recyclable adsorbent for eliminating emerging contaminants such as ciprofloxacin from an aqueous solution.",

CO 2 is considered an important greenhouse gas and it has to be controlled by diesel engines. In this research, extensive experimental work is done to identify a suitable solution to control CO 2 emissions. For five different mole concentrations (0.1 to 0.5), three types of amino solutions (L-alanine, L-aspartic acid, and L-arginine) were prepared. By passing diesel exhaust through each solution, CO 2 absorption is investigated. For CO 2 absorption, an appropriate CO 2 control system is built and tested. The tests were carried out in a diesel engine which is a naturally aspirated single-cylinder engine with a water-cooled system. It was possible to obtain an effective CO 2 reduction of up to 90%, as well as a simultaneous reduction in HC and CO.",

    "abstract": "Herein this study, pure and manganese- (Mn-) doped ZnO (2 wt. %) nanoparticles have been synthesized using the chemical precipitation method and characterized for the photodegradation of methyl green (MG) pollutant dye under natural sunlight. The structural analysis via XRD patterns has revealed that both intrinsic and Mn-doped ZnO (2 wt. %) samples have hexagonal wurtzite structures with appropriate phase purity, clearly indicating the absence of any external impurity. The incorporation of Mn in the host ZnO lattice has decreased the crystallite size (21.10 → 18.76 nm), and nanoparticle-type surface features with sizes in the 50–100 nm range have been observed through FESEM-based surface morphological studies. Both aforementioned observations have merit in providing more active area and a high surface area to volume ratio for photocatalytic reaction. The investigation of photophysical properties indicates that in Mn-doped ZnO nanoparticles, the absorption peak is blue-shifted by 5 nm (365 → 360 nm), due to the widening of the bandgap. The degradation kinetics of MG dye follow the pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the degradation efficiency has been observed to be 62.78% mediated by pure ZnO and 66.44% by Mn-doped ZnO (2 wt. %) photocatalyst under 60 minutes of sunlight irradiation. Specifically, the rate of photocatalytic reaction (K) ~0.01792 min -1 and [Formula: see text]~0.97992 has been achieved for pure ZnO, whereas slightly higher (K) ~0.02072 min -1 and [Formula: see text]~0.97299 have been observed for Mn-doped ZnO, respectively. Conclusively, the synergistic interactions with multiple charge transfer pathways, improvement of e − /h + pair charge separation, improved surface area, and efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals are supposed to be responsible for the highly efficient photocatalytic activity of the Mn–doped ZnO photocatalyst for MG dye.",

This method differs from the traditional processes for the production of activated carbons. On the other hand, natural zeolites have been used as low-cost adsorbents in industrial pollution control. The extent of their application is not only related to their low cost, but also to the improved properties and performance characteristics which they possess.

Zeolites seem to be a promising material to adsorb pesticides. This paper deals with the removal of mobile pesticides from water on different types of zeolites. Experiments were performed to understand the adsorption mechanisms of bentazon, clopyralid, imidacloprid, isoproturon and metalaxyl-m on zeolites and to determine the most efficient adsorbent for the purification of water contaminated by these pesticides. More immobile pesticides (imidacloprid, isoproturon and metalaxyl-m) tended to associate with the zeolites, whereas more mobile pesticides (bentazon and clopyralid) partitioned in water. According to the adsorption percentage, zeolite of the types BEA and FAU showed the best results for adsorbing the pesticides. Two different kinetic models, namely, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models, were used to fit the kinetics data. The experimental data were best described by the pseudo-second-order model. The rate of adsorption was also in line with the mobility of the pesticides. The adsorption isotherms were determined and modelled based on the observed types according to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. The type III isotherm was most frequently observed in this case. The Freundlich model, which describes this type of isotherm, gave a good fit for the adsorption of the pesticides. Different assumptions, that could describe the meaning of these type III isotherms, are discussed in this paper. These assumptions are based on the particle size of the adsorbates, the water adsorption on the zeolites and the modifications of the crystal structures.",

The first absorbent, KT-1, was obtained by thermal treatment; the second, KT-2, was obtained by thermal followed by acid treatment; and the third, KT-3, was obtained by thermal followed by acid and alkaline treatments. These adsorbents were characterized by powder X ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, and scanning electron microscopy. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms of MB were correlated with common isotherm equations such as Langmuir and Freundlich models. The modified kaolins (KT-1, KT-2, and KT-3) showed different capacities of the equilibrium adsorption in comparison with raw kaolin (KT). The maximal adsorption capacity (111 mg g−1) was observed with modified kaolin (KT-3). The effect of operating parameters such as the initial dye concentration, contact time, adsorbent dose, pH, and temperature were studied onto KT-3. The removal of MB by adsorbent increased with an increase in adsorbent dose and initial concentration. Kinetics models, the pseudo-first-order, and pseudo-second-order rate equations were applied. The obtained results show that the adsorption of MB by KT-3 was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic study revealed that the adsorption process was spontaneous, endothermic, and the positive value of ΔS∘ indicated the affinity of MB molecules to the adsorbent surface. This study showed that this new adsorbent could be a good candidate for some activated carbons.",

Besides, the adsorption kinetics study showed that the adsorption of methylene blue onto the two VACFF samples could be best described by the pseudo second-order model. Moreover, the intraparticle diffusion modelling showed that intraparticle diffusion is rate-controlling for both VACFF-1300 and VACFF-1600, and external diffusion is also a rate-controlling step for the latter.",

Chemical treatment with (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride under basic condition was applied in order to alter the surface properties of the raw kenaf core fiber. Adsorption studies were carried out to delineate the effect of initial dye concentration, temperature and pH on removal of dyes. The results show that the percentage removal of Acid Blue-25 and Acid Green-25 dyes were increased by increasing the concentrations of dyes. In addition, the maximum percentage removal was 99.8% and 99.65% for Acid Blue-25 and Acid Green-25, respectively. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models were applied to analyze the data for dye adsorption at 15℃, 25℃, 35℃, and 45℃. The experimental data were best represented by the Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacity of 303.03 mg/g and 344.83 mg/g for Acid Blue-25 and Acid Green-25 dyes, respectively, at 15℃, and the kinetic data for both dyes were best represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic studies indicated that the reactions of Acid Blue-25 and Acid Green-25 dyes were endothermic. It was concluded that QKCF adsorbent can be utilized as an efficient low-cost adsorbent for removal of anionic dyes.",

The composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra, Fourier transformation infrared, Raman spectrometer, N 2 adsorption–desorption, vibrating sample magnetometer, and zeta potential analyses. The impacts of pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, temperature, and foreign substances on Pb(II) adsorption performance were investigated. The adsorption mechanism, kinetics, and thermodynamics were analyzed. The results indicate that Fe 3 O 4 is homogeneously anchored inside the thin graphene sheets, with a particle size of 15–20 nm, resulting in a very low remanence and coercivity. The composite shows excellent and efficient adsorption performance toward aqueous Pb(II): adsorption equilibrium was reached in 10 min with the adsorption percent and quantity of 95.77% and 373.14 mgċg −1 , respectively, under a condition of pH = 6, adsorbent dosage 250 mgċL −1 , and Pb(II) initial concentration 97.68 mgċL −1 , with the subsequent magnetic separation taking only 10 s. The adsorption performance is dependent on adsorbent dosage. A lower dosage favors a higher adsorption quantity, implying a strong adsorptive potential for partially reduced graphene oxide-Fe 3 O 4 . The adsorption quantity reached 777.28 mgċg −1 , given the dosage 100 mgċL −1 . The adsorption is monolayer chemisorption, the whole process of which is controlled by chemisorption and liquid film diffusion. In terms of thermodynamics, the adsorption is an exothermic and spontaneous process.",

Both pristine- and oxidized-hydrochars were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmet–Teller-specific surface area, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and mass titration.

Six adsorption mechanisms were elucidated, in which the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding were identified as the primary methylene blue-hydrochar adsorptive interaction; furthermore, because the nitric acid modification process enhanced oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds on the surface of oxidized-hydrochars, the π– π and n– π interaction became minor pathways for methylene blue adsorption onto oxidized-hydrochars. Our results suggest that modified hydrochars could be used as environmentally friendly adsorbents alternative to activated carbon in dealing with methylene blue contamination in aqueous solutions.",

Currently, researchers are attempting to improve the efficiency of metal recovery from tailings using bioleaching, a more sustainable method compared to traditional methods. In this work, the research status of using biological leaching technologies to recover heavy metals from tailings was reviewed. Furthermore, CiteSpace 5.7.R2 was used to visually analyze the keywords of relevant studies on biological leaching of tailings to intuitively establish the current research hotspots. We found that current research has made recent progress on influencing factors and microbial genetic data, and innovations have also been made regarding the improvement of the rate of metal leaching by biological leaching combined with other technologies. This is of great significance for the development of bioleaching technologies and industrial production of heavy metals in tailings. Finally, challenges and opportunities for bioleaching provide directions for further research by the scientific community.",

    "abstract": "In the current scenario, natural fiber-based biodegradable composites have increased because natural composite fibers are very cheap, biodegradable, lightweight, fireproof, and nontoxic. The present research work was carried out to optimize the mechanical properties of hybrid composites reinforced by Calotropis gigantea and hemp. To achieve these objectives, the following process parameters were determined, and RSM carried out optimization with the Box-Behnken experimental setup at three different levels: compression molding temperature (°C), pressure (bar), and time (min). The fibers were pretreated for 4 hours with a 5% NaOH solution to prevent moisture absorption. Regression equations were constructed to evaluate the mechanical properties, and the best process parameters were established. The results reveal that a pressure of 35 bar, a time duration of 7 minutes, and a temperature of 176°C are the best conditions for compression molding. The second aim was to compare CGF and hemp fiber-derived activated carbon adsorbents by determining physical adsorption properties, chemical compositions, and scanning electron microscope. Natural fibers were shown to be ideal candidates for manufacturing mesoporous activated carbon adsorbents with high surface area (1389–1433 m 2 /g), high mesopore percentage (63–68%), and high carbon content (80–87%). Even though hemp activated carbon had a greater mesoporous structure (69%) than CGF-derived activated carbons, the CGF-derived activated carbons had larger surface areas and higher C content.",

On the other hand, the behaviour of Al 2 O 3 is described more accurately by the Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) model ([Formula: see text]), and the maximum adsorption capacity was 53.64 mg/g. The isotherm analysis proved that the limiting step of the adsorption process is the film diffusion mechanism. In addition, studying the heat of adsorption of Pb(II) implied that the adsorption is endothermic due to the positive values of enthalpy ([Formula: see text]) for all adsorbents. The absorbents were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to study the morphology of surfaces and the chemical characterization of the adsorbents to ensure that adsorption is achieved. ZnO showed better performance for the uptake of lead followed by TiO 2 then Al 2 O 3 .",

    "abstract": "The disposal of biological waste into water bodies is a major global concern as it leads to water pollution resulting in the loss of plenty of revenue in the cleaning of water bodies. Here, in the present research work, sacred flowers were collected, segregated, sun-dried, and powdered. The dried floral powders (marigold and rose) were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), electron diffraction spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microscopy revealed the irregular spherical shape of the sheet-like structure whose size varies in microns. The EDS revealed the elemental composition which was dominated by mainly carbon and oxygen. The XRD shows the presence of carbon (10-25 ɵ ) in the amorphous form and the absence of any crystalline phase in the biosorbents. The FT-IR showed peaks that conformed to the presence of functional groups like -OH and a carbonyl group. The dried powders were used as an economical and eco-friendly biosorbent for the removal of methyl red (MR) dye from the aqueous solutions by batch adsorption study. After 60 minutes of contact time, the marigold powder (MGP) and rose petal powder (RPP) showed decolorization of 61.16% and 56.08% for 2 ppm of MR dye. The kinetic revealed that the dye removal reaction does not follow the pseudo-first-order as well as the pseudo-second-order. The utilization of such waste-based biosorbents will minimize solid waste and also will provide an economical biosorbent for the removal of environmental pollutants.",

The silver-based matrix metals are gained significance in various applications like bearing, ratchet, and electrical contacts due to their high frictional resistance and good thermal and chemical stability compared to traditional metals. The present research is to develop silver-based hybrid nanocomposites containing alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) and silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles of 50 nm mixing with the ratio of 0 wt% Al 2 O 3 /0 wt% SiC, 5 wt% Al 2 O 3 /0 wt% SiC, and 5 wt% Al 2 O 3 /5 wt% SiC via the semisolid vacuum stir-cast technique. The vacuum technology minimizes casting defects and increases composite properties. The casted composite samples are subjected to study the effect of reinforcement on thermal adsorption, conductivity, diffusivity, and frictional resistance. The composite containing 5 wt% Al 2 O 3np /5 wt% SiC np is to find optimum thermal and frictional behaviour. The thermal adsorption and frictional resistance are increased by 30% and 27% compared to unreinforced cast silver. The Ag/5 wt% Al 2 O 3np /5 wt% SiC np hybrid nanocomposite is recommended for automotive friction-bearing applications.",

In this study, Basic Fuchsin was efficiently removed from synthetic wastewater using natural clay of Gankawa (GC) from Sulaimanyah city, and the effect of the presence of high concentrations of phenol in the adsorption mixture is demonstrated. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), N 2 gas adsorption analyzer, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were used to characterize the natural clay. The clay was found to be mostly calcite, with a minor percentage of smectite, and contaminated with low percentages of illite. The adsorption kinetics show a relatively fast equilibration time (60-70 minutes). A second-order pseudokinetic model better fits the experimental kinetic data. The effect of the initial pH of the solution mixture was negligible at the experimental concentration range of the study. Freundlich and Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm models were applied to the equilibrium experimental data using nonlinear regression curve fitting. Both kinetics and isotherm studies point to a chemical adsorption mechanism for the process. For adsorption in the mixture, phenol molecules were found to compete with BF molecules for the active adsorption sites, while a synergetic effect of BF exists on phenol adsorption. As a naturally abundant cheap material, GC shows a superior adsorption capacity toward BF (287.0 mg g -1 ) over all natural materials and most of the synthetic or modified materials found in the literature.",

The adsorption of Congo red was studied by varying dye concentrations (5–50 mg/L), times (30–240 min), pH (6–9), and dosages (0.5–2 g/100 mL). X-ray diffractometer results show that the structure of biochar is amorphous.

RSM-BBD design results showed maximum removal efficiency of 99.96% for Congo red at pH 6.37, dye concentration 45 mg/L, time 105 min, and dosage 1.92 g, respectively. The adsorption of Congo red by biochar was successfully modeled using the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order model. The biochar produced from breadfruit leaves exhibited a high adsorption capacity of 17.81 mg/g for Congo red adsorption.

The following study is also about the formation of 2D heterojunction tellurium-doped zinc oxide composite with sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (Te-ZnO@S-g-C 3 N 4 ) by adopting a low-cost, simple, and ecofriendly coprecipitation technique. Thiourea was calcined to prepare S-g-C 3 N 4 using the thermal degradation method. The characterization of synthesized photocatalysts was carried out by using SEM-EDX, FTIR, and XRD. The results obtained showed that the incorporation of tellurium caused an alteration in the wurtzite structure of ZnO. SEM-EDX analysis validated the purity of the synthesized samples due to the absence of any additional peaks. The decrease in the bandgap was also noted by the formation of composites. Using methylene blue as a reference dye, the UV-vis spectrophotometer was utilized to calculate the absorbance for photocatalytic degradation behavior. As a result of tellurium doping into the ZnO lattice, photocatalytic oxidation/reduction was improved, according to the results. 3Te-ZnO NPs showed the best degradation rate among dopant series, while an excellent overall degradation rate was noted by fabricated composite 3Te-ZnO@40S-g-C 3 N 4 . The best doped ZnO and composites were also used as sorbents for the abstraction of heavy metal (Cr(VI)) from water via adsorption. A definite rise in the removal efficiency percentage of chromium ions was observed by using these sorbents. The overall photo degradation rate and adsorption behavior noted were in ZnO&lt;Te-ZnO&lt;Te-ZnO@S-g-C 3 N 4 order. When compared to ZnO, Te-ZnO, SCN, and Te-ZnO@40SCN, the 3Te-ZnO@40SCN NCs have outstanding antifungal potential. The improved dispersibility and interaction of 3Te-ZnO@40SCN with membrane and intracellular proteins of fungi may be the cause of the greater effect of Te-ZnO@40SCN.",

Equilibrium biosorption of the heavy metal ions was attained in 4 h. The binding of heavy metal ions to P. canescens was clearly pH-dependent. Under acidic conditions, the heavy metal ion loading capacity increased with increasing pH, presumably as a result of heavy metal speciation and competition with hydrogen ions for the same binding sites. The adsorption of heavy metal ions attained a plateau value at ca. pH 5.0. The maximum adsorption capacities of the heavy metal ions studied onto the fungal biomass under non-competitive conditions were 26.4 mg/g for As(III), 54.8 mg/g for Hg(II), 102.7 mg/g for Cd(II) and 213.2 mg/g for Pb(II), respectively. The competitive adsorption capacities of the heavy metal ions were 2.0 mg/g for As(III), 5.8 mg/g for Hg(II), 11.7 mg/g for Cd(II) and 32.1 mg/g for Pb(II), respectively, at a 50-mg/l initial concentration of the metal ions. The same affinity order was observed under non-competitive and competitive adsorption conditions, i.e. Pb(II) &gt; Cd(II) &gt; Hg(II) &gt; As(III). The equilibrium loading capacity of Pb(II) was greater than that of other metal ions, the fungal biomass showing preference towards the binding of Pb(II) over Cd(II), Hg(II) and As(III). Elution of heavy metal ions was performed using 0.5 M HCl. The fungus Penicillium canescens could be used for biosorption over six cycles.",

The adsorption of Methylene Blue onto the prepared activated carbon demonstrated its very high adsorption capacity. The adsorption of lead ions on both carbons, i.e. activated and chemically-modified, was studied under different conditions. The experimental results showed that both types of carbon gave a relatively large maximum lead ion uptake, the increase in the uptake as a result of chemical modification being insignificant. Lead ion uptake was found to increase by increasing the solution pH — whereby the maximum adsorption of lead ions was obtained at pH 5.2 — and by increasing the initial lead ion concentration. Equilibrium studies showed that the adsorption of lead ions on both adsorbents could be described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption of lead ions on the prepared activated carbons followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The presence of EDTA, acetic acid or citric acid led to a significant decrease of lead ion uptake by the activated carbons.",

Interfacial water plays an important role in a number of physical phenomena that include protein-folding, structure/function relationships in enzymes, the design of nano-fluidic devices, and even macroscopic effects including drag reduction. Interfacial water is attracting renewed interest because of applications such as electrical double layer capacitors, and also for the microbial conversion of cellulose to biofuels. Current scientific explorations regarding interfacial water take advantage of innovations in experimental capabilities, theoretical models and computational tools. Particular attention has been devoted recently to uncovering the relationships between macroscopic properties, often summarized under the hydrophobic/hydrophilic characterization of solid surfaces, to the atomic-level behaviour of water near interfaces. The goal of the present review is to compile recent results obtained along these research objectives, for the most part obtained by simulation studies, to discuss some experimental techniques that appear most adequate to validate the simulation results (specular X-ray reflectivity, ultrafast IR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and others), and to propose possible research topics to further develop this field. Because of our recent interests, the surfaces considered herein are mainly oxides.",

    "abstract": "This work reports the preparation of activated carbons via the hydrothermal treatment at 523 K/30 bar of two common winemaking wastes: bagasse and cluster stalks. The hydrothermal carbons produced by the above treatment were turned into activated carbons via their exposure to KOH and carbonization at 1073 K. These were then subjected to Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy examination, and the determination of their Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area. The ability of the activated carbons to adsorb methylene blue in aqueous solution was then examined, determining the influence of time, methylene blue concentration, and temperature. Equilibrium conditions were reached for reaction times between 180 and 240 min at pH 7. The adsorption isotherms were found to better fit the Langmuir than the Freundlich model, and the adsorption kinetics fitted a pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption at 303 K was 714–847 mg g−1. Thermodynamic studies revealed the adsorption of methylene blue to be spontaneous and exothermic. These results show that high-quality activated carbons can be produced from winemaking waste.",

The synthesis route has been analyzed in detail and the surface interactions involved in the adsorption process has been studied and discussed using different characterization techniques, given a special emphasis on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. A proper selection of the pyrolysis conditions improved the metal uptake of bone chars by 143% where the adsorption capacities ranged from 68.3 up to 119.4 mg/g. The removal performance followed the trend Cd 2+ &gt; Zn 2+ &gt; Ni 2+ . However, the multicomponent removal of Zn 2+ , Cd 2+ , and Ni 2+ ions in both binary and ternary mixtures was a strong antagonistic adsorption process. XPS analysis confirmed that the ion exchange between the calcium, from the hydroxyapatite structure of bone char, and the heavy metals in solution played an important role in the adsorption process. These findings are useful to enhance the efficacy of heavy metal removal from aqueous solution using bone char.",

The results showed that the adsorption uptake is directly proportional to the phosphate ion initial concentration and inversely proportional to the adsorbent's dose and temperature. A maximum adsorption capacity of 16.2 mg/g was observed at neutral pH. The addition of sodium and potassium chlorides has decreased the adsorption uptake. The adsorption isotherms agree better with the Langmuir model. The negative values of (ΔG) and (ΔH) obtained from the thermodynamic study, indicted that the adsorption process is spontaneous and exothermic.

In this regard, optimum temperature and humidity zones are established for various air-conditioning applications which include (i) humans’ thermal comfort, (ii) animals’ thermal comfort, and (iii) postharvest storage of fruits/vegetables. Honeycomb-like desiccant blocks composed of PS-I/PS-II are assumed for numerical simulation analysis. The numerical simulation model is programmed into MATLAB which utilizes the scientific relationships of adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics, isosteric heat of adsorption, and thermophysical properties for each sorbent. A particular desiccant air-conditioning system design is proposed, and numerical simulation has been conducted for the performance evaluation of PS-I and PS-II. According to the results, PS-I enables higher dehumidification than PS-II at low regeneration temperature (50℃) and cycle time of 60:90 min. It is because the PS-I possesses better water vapor sorption kinetics as compared to PS-II. Although the PS-II enabled higher steady-state adsorption amount but it could not influence the overall system performance. On the other hand, the optimum performance by the PS-II is limited to relatively long cycle time and higher regeneration temperature (≥80℃). It has been concluded that the PS-I is relatively better choice for desiccant air-conditioning, and consequently can be considered for various air-conditioning applications. Furthermore, effects of mass flow rate, isosteric heat of adsorption, regeneration temperature, and cycle time on air humidity ratio and air temperature profiles have been discussed in order to highlight the performance variability of desiccant air-conditioning system.",

To study the pore structure characteristics and adsorption characteristics of different destruction types of coal, nondestructive coal, destructive coal, strongly destructive coal, pulverized coal, and fully pulverized coal are selected based on the coal and gas outburst mine identification specifications. The experimental methods used are liquid nitrogen adsorption, mercury intrusion porosimetry and CH 4 isothermal adsorption. The results show that the pore volume obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method and the specific surface area increase with increasing destruction type. For all tested coal samples, the N 2 adsorption/desorption hysteresis loop is not closed when the relative pressure is low, indicating the existence of ink-bottle pores, an elastic structure of the coal and nitrogen affinity in the coal. With increasing tectonic stress, it becomes more advantageous to produce micropores. The pore volume obtained by the mercury intrusion porosimetry experiment increases with increasing destruction types except for the case of fully pulverized coal. High-pressure mercury causes pore deformation and collapse. When the f value is &lt;0.5, the compression effect of the pores is obvious. The smaller the value of f is, the wider is the pore range affected by the high-pressure mercury. The degree of destruction is positively correlated with the porosity, specific surface area, and Langmuir volume. However, the degree of destruction is negatively correlated with the f value and mercury extrusion efficiency.",

The process was carried out using chemical activation (H 3 PO 4 ) process.

Langmuir model was found to fit the equilibrium data for methylene blue adsorption with 6.82 mg/g at 30°C. The adsorption process follows the pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamics analysis showed that the adsorption of methylene blue on to the activated coffee husk was a spontaneous and endothermic process.

    "abstract": "Wastewater has a high concentration of dyes and heavy metals, which are the two most significant contaminants. Due to their high toxicity and vulnerability, they possess a potential threat to human health as well as the ecosystem. There are many ways to eliminate these pollutants from water but adsorption has attained much interest because of its low cost, easy application, and no secondary pollutants. Biomass is considered an ecological burden and a reason for the reduction in the earth’s carrying capacity. These materials may be used as cost-effective adsorbents to remove dyes and heavy metals from wastewater. This paper highlights recent advances made in dye and heavy metal adsorption in the last 10 years. The prime focus of this review paper is on the direct application of these biomasses without any chemical or physical alteration. The removal efficiencies and adsorption capabilities of different biomass-derived adsorbents for the removal of dyes and heavy metals from wastewater are summarised in this study. Additionally, the adsorption mechanisms underlying the removal of dyes and heavy metals using biomass-derived adsorbents have been discussed, with a focus on two kinetic models: pseudofirst-order and pseudosecond-order. Furthermore, the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were utilised to verify the experimental findings and to quantify the amount and degree of adsorption favorability. Based on what has been covered in the literature, the conclusion has been drawn. The future research needs are proposed in the area of biomass-derived adsorbent development, their modification for improved efficiencies, and application on large-scale wastewater treatment plants.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen and phosphorus are commonly recognized as causing eutrophication in aquatic systems, and their transport in subsurface environments has also aroused great public attention. This research presented four natural clay minerals (NCMs) evaluated for their effectiveness of NH 4 + and PO 4 3- adsorption from wastewater. All the NCMs were fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET analysis, and adsorption kinetics and isotherms to better understand the adsorption mechanism-property relationship. The results show that the adsorption efficiency of the four NCMs for phosphate was better than that for ammonia nitrogen. The removal rate of phosphate was higher than 65%, generally in the range of 80%-90%, while the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen was less than 50%. The adsorption kinetic behavior followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The ammonia nitrogen adsorption isotherm was in good agreement with the Freundlich isotherm equilibrium model, and the phosphate adsorption isotherm matched the Langmuir model. Among all the NCMs studied, bentonite (7.13 mg/g) and kaolinite (5.37 mg/g) showed higher adsorption capacities for ammonia nitrogen, while zeolite (0.21 mg/g) and attapulgite (0.17 mg/g) showed higher adsorption capacities for phosphate.

The adsorption of heavy metal ions was highly dependent on the operating parameters where pH and temperature showed the highest impact. Maximum adsorption capacities of these biomaterials were up to 1.33 and 1.40 mmol/g for chromium ions using human hair and sheep fur, respectively. Adsorption kinetic rates of tested heavy metal ions were calculated via a pseudo-second-order model, and they ranged from 0.054 to 0.261 g/mmol·min. A detailed thermodynamic analysis of lead ion adsorption was performed showing an endothermic removal of this adsorbate with both human hair and sheep fur with adsorption enthalpies of 84.5 and 97.1 kJ/mol, respectively. Statistical physics calculations demonstrated that this heavy metal ion was adsorbed via a multi-interaction mechanism especially for human hair. These keratinous biomaterials showed competitive adsorption capacities especially for chromium ion removal and can outperform commercial activated carbons and other adsorbents reported in literature.",

    "abstract": "Diesel-powered transportation is considered an efficient method of transportation; this sees the increase in the demand for the diesel engine. But diesel engines are considered to be one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution. The automobile sector accounts for the second-largest source for increasing CO 2 emission globally. In this experiment, a suitable postcombustion treatment to control CO 2 emission from IC engine exhaust is developed and tested. This work focuses to control CO 2 emission by using the chemical adsorbent technique in diesel engine exhaust. An amine-based liquid is used to adsorb the CO 2 molecules first and absorb over the amines from the diesel engine exhaust. Three types of amino solutions (L-alanine, L-aspartic acid, and L-arginine) were prepared for 0.3 mole concentrations, and the CO 2 absorption investigation is performed in each solution by passing the diesel exhaust. A suitable CO 2 adsorption trap is developed and tested for CO 2 absorption. The experiments were performed in a single-cylinder diesel engine under variable load conditions. The eddy current dynamometer is used to apply appropriate loads on the engine based on the settings. The AVL DIGAS analyzer was used to measure the CO 2 , HC, and CO emissions. An uncertainty analysis is carried out on the experimental results to minimize the errors in the results. The effective CO 2 reduction was achieved up to 85%, and simultaneous reduction of HC and CO was also observed.",

XRD, ultraviolet diffuse reflectance (UV-DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) were used to characterize the material. In their X-ray diffraction patterns, the titanium dioxide nanoparticles were found to have a high degree of crystallinity, indicating that they were synthesized. Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were used to determine the chemical composition of the plant extract. The DRS spectra in the UV-visible range reveal a high absorption peak at 356 nm, which indicates the existence of TiO 2 nanoparticles in the sample. Shape of nanoparticles was revealed by SEM and TEM morphological investigations, which revealed their irregular and somewhat spherical nature. Only titanium and oxygen compounds were found in the EDX spectrum, indicating that they were present. This demonstrates that the NPs that were produced are devoid of contaminants. Using the produced nanoparticles as catalyst, we presented a photocatalytic degradation method for the dye methylene blue in this paper. The findings showed that 94 percent of the damage occurred within 120 minutes of being exposed to UV radiation.",

    "abstract": "Throughout history, techniques have shifted from mainstream metals and minerals to nanocomposites to generate smaller, more practical elements for particular purposes. Natural fibres have greater advantages than glass fibres, such as being cheaper, recyclable, and nonflammable. The main objective of the current experiment is to determine how the accumulation of graphene to hybrid polyester composites reinforced with woven banana fibre affects their mechanical properties. Composites were constructed utilising the hand lay-up process with the following limitations: (i) graphene filler weightiness, (ii) woven banana fibre thickness in gsm, and (iii) number of woven banana layers, all at three different levels. Using the L 9 (3 3 ) orthogonal design, nine composite samples are generated and tested according to the ASTM standard. According to the grey research, hybrid composites having 5% graphene powder and 350 grammes per square metre of woven banana fibre in three layers have high mechanical strength. Adding fibre content to immaculate polyester increased its mechanical properties in general. As the fibre and filler concentrations grew, more energy was required to break the fibre bundles between the matrix and its resin. The confirmation test by the optimal process value utilising the grey relation analysis is considerably better than the actual test data. Tension strength has improved by 17.14%, bending strength has improved by 96.75%, and impact energy has increased by 16.17%.",

    "abstract": "The application of artificial neural networks on adsorption modeling has significantly increased during the last decades. These artificial intelligence models have been utilized to correlate and predict kinetics, isotherms, and breakthrough curves of a wide spectrum of adsorbents and adsorbates in the context of water purification. Artificial neural networks allow to overcome some drawbacks of traditional adsorption models especially in terms of providing better predictions at different operating conditions. However, these surrogate models have been applied mainly in adsorption systems with only one pollutant thus indicating the importance of extending their application for the prediction and simulation of adsorption systems with several adsorbates (i.e., multicomponent adsorption). This review analyzes and describes the data modeling of adsorption of organic and inorganic pollutants from water with artificial neural networks. The main developments and contributions on this topic have been discussed considering the results of a detailed search and interpretation of more than 250 papers published on Web of Science ® database. Therefore, a general overview of the training methods, input and output data, and numerical performance of artificial neural networks and related models utilized for adsorption data simulation is provided in this document. Some remarks for the reliable application and implementation of artificial neural networks on the adsorption modeling are also discussed. Overall, the studies on adsorption modeling with artificial neural networks have focused mainly on the analysis of batch processes (87%) in comparison to dynamic systems (13%) like packed bed columns. Multicomponent adsorption has not been extensively analyzed with artificial neural network models where this literature review indicated that 87% of references published on this topic covered adsorption systems with only one adsorbate. Results reported in several studies indicated that this artificial intelligence tool has a significant potential to develop reliable models for multicomponent adsorption systems where antagonistic, synergistic, and noninteraction adsorption behaviors can occur simultaneously. The development of reliable artificial neural networks for the modeling of multicomponent adsorption in batch and dynamic systems is fundamental to improve the process engineering in water treatment and purification.",

The structural characterization using XRD, Raman, and FTIR measurements confirmed the incorporation of Fe ions into the SnO 2 lattice without any deviation in the tetragonal crystal system of SnO 2 nanoparticles. SEM and HRTEM images show the spherical-shaped nanoparticles with agglomeration. The values of interplanar spacing ([Formula: see text]-value) calculated from the HRTEM lattice are consistent with the XRD results. Further, optical analysis revealed a red shift in the optical absorption band and a decrease in the band gap energy with an increase in Fe-dopant concentration. The decrease of PL emission peak intensity with Fe doping revealed the generation of singly charged oxygen vacancies. The H 2 O 2 -assisted photocatalytic degradation efficiency of Fe-SnO 2 NPs investigated against crystal violet dye indicated an efficiency of 98% for 0.05 M Fe-SnO 2 NPs within 30 minutes under visible light illumination. In addition, the effects of pH, scavengers, and reusability of the catalyst are tested. The antibacterial behavior of Fe-SnO 2 NPs against Escherichia coli is examined by using the colony count method, and the inhibition rate was found to be 49, 65, 70, and 78% for pure, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05 M Fe-SnO 2 NPs, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This research work reports on pure and acid-treated fennel seed biomaterials for the removal of metal ions of copper Cu(II), lead Pb(II), and methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solution by batch adsorption. Pure fennel seeds were labelled as PFS; nitric and sulphuric acid-treated seeds were designated as NAFS and SAFS, respectively. The adsorbents were characterised by SEM, EDX, FTIR, XRD, and BET. The SEM images revealed that the surface of the adsorbents was porous. However, physicochemical characterization further revealed that BET surface area, pore size, and pore width increased for NAFS and SAFS compared to PFS. FTIR results revealed that the peaks for cellulose −COC and −OH decreased considerably for NAFS and SAFS; this indicated that cellulose was hydrolyzed during acid treatment. Adsorption data showed that all biomaterials had a higher affinity for MB dye more than Pb(II) and Cu(II) metal ions. The maximum adsorption capacities onto PFS were 6.834, 4.179, and 2.902 mg/g and onto NAFS are 15.28, 14.44, and 4.475 mg/g, while those onto SAFS are 19.81, 18.79 and 6.707 mg/g respective for MB dye, Pb(II), and Cu(II) ions. Postadsorption analysis revealed that adsorption of Pb(II) and Cu(II) was controlled mainly by the electrostatic attraction, while that of MB was synergistic of electrostatic attraction, π- π interaction, and hydrogen bond. It was found that the uptake processes of MB dye onto all adsorbents fitted Freundlich while both cations were described by Langmuir model.

Adsorption isotherms of these pharmaceuticals were experimentally quantified at 30 and 40°C and pH 7. Textural parameters and surface chemistry of these MOFs were analyzed, and results were utilized to explain the pharmaceutical adsorption mechanism. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the reactivity of pharmaceutical molecules, and a statistical physics model was employed to calculate the main physicochemical parameters related to the adsorption mechanism. Results showed that the adsorption of these pharmaceuticals on MOFs was multimolecular and exothermic. Both MOFs displayed the highest adsorption capacities, up to 2.19 and 1.71 mmol/g, for NAP and DFC molecules, respectively. MIL-101-Fe showed better pharmaceutical adsorption properties than MIL-100-Fe due to its highest content of Fe-O clusters and mesopore volume. Adsorption mechanism of these organic molecules could involve hydrogen bond, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions with MOF surfaces. In particular, MIL-101-Fe MOF is a promising material to prepare composites with competitive adsorption capacities for facing the water pollution caused by pharmaceutical compounds.",

    "abstract": "The presence of heavy metals in wastewater, such as Ni, Pb, Cd, V, Cr, and Cu, is a serious environmental problem. This kind of inorganic pollutant is not biodegradable for several years, and its harmful effect is cumulative. Recently, semiconductor nanomaterials based on metal oxides have gained interest due to their efficiency in the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water, by inducing photocatalytic ion reduction when they absorb light of the appropriate wavelength. The most commonly applied semiconductor oxides for these purposes are titanium oxide (TiO 2 ), zinc oxide (ZnO), and binary nanomaterials composed of both types of oxides. The main purpose of this work is to critically analyse the existent literature concerning this topic focusing specially in the most important factors affecting the adsorption or photocatalytic capacities of this type of nanomaterials. In particular, photocatalytic activity is altered by various factors, such as proportion of polymorphs, synthesis method, surface area, concentration of defects and particle size, among others. After a survey of the actual literature, it was found that, although these metal oxides have low absorption capacity for visible light, it is possible to obtain an acceptable heavy metal reduction performance by sensitization with dyes, doping with metallic or nonmetallic atoms, introduction of defects, or the coupling of two or more semiconductors.",

    "abstract": "The sorption mechanisms, point of zero charge, and isosteric heats involved in the adsorptive dephenolization of aqueous solutions using thermally modified corn cob (TMCC) were studied at different initial phenol concentrations (100–500 mg/l), TMCC dosage (0.4–2.0 g), contact time (5–60 min), pH (2–10), and temperature (30–60°C). Analysis of the adsorbent material showed that it possessed the properties typical of a good adsorbent. The adsorption experiments revealed that phenol uptake is favored by an increase in TMCC dosage and contact time and a decrease in temperature and concentration of phenol in the solution. The experimental data were well-fitted to the Sips, Langmuir, Toth, and Redlich–Peterson isotherm models. Thermodynamic studies suggested that the sorption of phenol onto TMCC is feasible, spontaneous, and endothermic. The isosteric heats of adsorption obtained are in the range 47.43-79.38 kJ/mol, confirming that the adsorption process is predominantly a physical process depicting the van der Waals interactions, and it is inversely proportional to surface loading. The analysis of the adsorption mechanisms showed that the intraparticle, film, and pore diffusion mechanisms were significantly involved in the phenol adsorption process. The involvement of electrostatic attraction, [Formula: see text] electron-donor interaction, and hydrogen bonding was also demonstrated. The point of zero charge ([Formula: see text]) was obtained at a pH of 5.83; being slightly lower than the optimum pH of 6 indicates that the sorbent surface is obviously not negatively charged at [Formula: see text]. The discoveries of this study have shown that the dephenolization process is feasible, spontaneous, endothermic, dominated by a physical process, and governed by intraparticle, film, and pore diffusion mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we report a simple and scalable synthesis route to prepare Ag-functionalized porous ZnO sheets and their enhanced NO 2 gas sensing properties. Porous ZnO sheets functionalized with well-dispersed submicron Ag particles were prepared by using a hydrothermal method-based one-pot synthesis route from Zn and Ag precursors. NO 2 gas sensing performance (response, selectivity, response time, and recovery time) was optimized at 200°C in the gas sensor fabricated with 3 at% Ag-functionalized porous ZnO sheets. We demonstrated a response ([Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]) of 17.18 to 10 ppm NO 2 gas and also obtained a high response of 14.05 even at 60% relative humidity due to the synergetic effect of improved NO 2 gas adsorption in the presence of Ag particles and increased resistance by the formation of Schottky barrier at Ag-ZnO heterojunctions.",

    "abstract": "Local natural clay from Sulaimani zone-Takiya (TKC), Kurdistan Region of Iraq, was characterized and used for the removal of basic fuchsin (BF) dye from laboratory bacterial wastewater. The characterization of the adsorbent was carried out with XRD, XRF, and FT-IR. The clay sample was dominated by vermiculite. Adsorption tests under different conditions of contact time, pH of the solution, temperature, initial dye concentration, and adsorbent amount were performed to analyze the effect of various experimental parameters. Equilibrium time was reached within 180 minutes, and maximum BF adsorption was achieved at pH 6.8 at a temperature ranging from 20 to 50°C. The experimental data fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, with the activation energy of 22.68 kJ·mol -1 . Adsorption isotherms could be well-fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model. The thermodynamic parameters such as [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] were determined, and the negative values of [Formula: see text] indicated that adsorption was spontaneous at all temperatures. Furthermore, the values of [Formula: see text] indicated an endothermic reaction. Wastewater contaminated by BF dye from the bacterial laboratory was collected (BF concentration: 160 mg·L -1 ) and treated by TKC. The resulting concentration of BF after adsorption was 4.76 mg·L -1 . The maximum amount of dye adsorbed is about 149.2 mg/g or 0.44 mmol/g, which is close to the range of the cation exchange capacity (CEC) value of the vermiculite which indicated that cation exchange was the dominant adsorption mechanism.",

    "abstract": "This study used neem fruit biochar, an inexpensive and environmentally friendly material made from mature neem trees, which was activated chemically using H 3 PO 4 (50% v/v) for three hours at 80°C. It was then pyrolyzed for 1, 3 and 5 h at 500°C. The samples bore the labels NFBC1, NFBC3, and NFBC5, respectively. This adsorbent was used as bioadsorbent to remove the Cr(VI) ion from aqueous solutions. This biochar was characterized using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, DTG, and pH pzc techniques in order to ascertain their fundamental characteristics, including their chemical structure, porosity, and surface characteristics. It was found that activation increased the bioadsorbent's ability to adsorb pollutants and resulted in a more amorphous shape. The percentage removal of Cr(VI) ions was examined in relation to adsorption parameters, including temperature (30, 40 and 50°C), initial concentration of Cr(VI) ions (10–100 mg/L), contact time (5–180 min), and biosorbent dosage (0.01–0.06 g/50 mL). While isotherm investigations fit with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, kinetics studies shown that the adsorption mechanism of Cr(VI) ion employing NFBC1, NFBC3, and NFBC5 follows pseudo-second order. Based on the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption capacities at 30°C were 84.746, 87.470 and 102.696 mg/g, for NFBC1, NFBC3 and NFBC5, respectively.

The solid/solution interface's reduced unpredictability during adsorption was indicated by the negative value of Δ S . According to the results, the modified bioadsorbent is a useful and affordable substitute for removing Cr(VI) ions from contaminated water.",

Characterization of the carbons was undertaken using an alternative linear form of the BET equation and the results of the BET parameters obtained have been compared with those obtained from the usual classical linear form of the equation. The surface areas calculated from the two linear forms were similar while the C values were quite different. The C values obtained from the alternative linear form appeared to be more reasonable, being consistent with and related to the microporous character of these carbons. The alternative linear form gave BET plots which were more sensitive to deviations from linearity allowing the relative pressure range for the application of the BET equation to be determined without any ambiguity and more precisely.",

The esterified products thus obtained were used in the removal of Co(II) and Ni(II) ions from aqueous solutions. The factors affecting the esterification reaction and the adsorption of the metal cations onto the peanut hulls before and after esterification were thoroughly investigated. The results obtained highlighted the following conclusions. The optimum conditions for esterification involve the treatment of peanut hulls (1 g) with 12.4 mmol citric acid in the presence of a very small amount of water for 2 h at 140°C. Similarly, the optimum pH for the adsorption of cobalt(II) ions onto the peanut hulls citrate was 7.0. The adsorption capacity, q e (mg/g), of Co(II) ions onto the peanut hulls citrate increased on increasing the extent of esterification, expressed as mequiv. —COOH/100 g sample. The maximum values for the adsorption capacity, q max , were 28.7 mg/g and 270.3 mg/g on native and peanut hulls citrate, respectively. The q max values for of Ni(II) ion adsorption were 5 mg/g and 175.4 mg/g on native and peanut hulls citrate, respectively.

    "abstract": "The adsorption and desorption of toluene on metal-organic frameworks HKUST-1 and MIL-101 were studied. The adsorption isotherms and kinetic curves of toluene on HKUST-1 and MIL-101 were separately measured by gravimetric method. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments were carried out for estimating the interaction of toluene with the surfaces of HKUST-1 and MIL-101. Our experimental results showed that the isotherms of toluene on the adsorbents were well fitted by the Langmuir–Freundlich equation. The maximum amount of toluene adsorbed on MIL-101 was 15.1 mmol/g, which was much higher than that adsorbed on HKUST-1 (6.6 mmol/g). The high adsorption capacity of MIL-101 can be attributed to its higher surface area. However, the isotherm of toluene at P/P0 < 0.09 on HKUST-1 was much higher than that on MIL-101 owing to the smaller pore size of HKUST-1. It is suggested that HKUST-1 had better adsorption performance than MIL-101 at low concentration of volatile organic compounds. The desorption activation energies, Ed, of toluene on HKUST-1 and MIL-101 were 43.8 and 30.2 kJ/mol, respectively, meaning that the interaction of toluene with HKUST-1 was stronger than that with MIL-101. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of toluene within HKUST-1 was smaller than that within MIL-101. Results of thermal desorption experiments showed that the desorption efficiency of toluene from HKUST-1 and MIL-101 can separately reach above 93% and nearly 100% at 393 K, respectively.",

The method is critically compared with other similar methods such as the Dubinin–Radushkevich, t-plot and those based on density functional theory (DFT). For comparison purposes, several nanoporous materials with different chemical properties were selected. The analysis was segregated into three categories: (i) microporous materials, in which the analyzed samples are activated carbons (ACs) with different pore-size distributions, a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and a zeolite (MS5A); (ii) mesoporous materials, including ordered mesoporous carbons (CMK-3) and ordered mesoporous siliceous materials (MCM-41 and SBA-15); and (iii) micro-mesoporous materials, in which pillared clays (PILCs) obtained with different metals (Al, Si, Fe and Zr) were studied. To apply the αs-plot method, several standard isotherms previously reported by other authors were considered for the analysis of microporous and mesoporous materials. Furthermore, a series of four reference materials for PILCs were synthesized and their high-resolution nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured and reported. The results obtained by the αs-plot method are consistent with those obtained by DFT methods. This consistency highlights the importance of the use of this reliable and versatile method, where the correct selection of the standard isotherm is the most critical aspect to be considered.",

Each molecule was removed from aqueous solution by Type I Langmuir adsorption onto ZSM-5. The quantities adsorbed varied greatly due to their shape-selective adsorption within the pores of ZSM-5. Aniline and 4-NA had maximum adsorption amounts of 161 and 265 mg g −1 , respectively, while the maximum amounts of 3-NA and 2-NA were 94.3 and 37.2 mg g −1 , corresponding to reductions of 64% and 86%, respectively, relative to 4-NA. This outcome was caused by the increase in the effective diameter for adsorption when the nitro group was located at the 2- and 3- positions of the molecule. This significantly reduced their ability to enter into, and diffuse through, the pores of ZSM-5. These findings underpin the importance of choosing the correct substrate when using such materials for water purification.",

With increasing consumption of fossil fuels and development of energy storage systems, the levels of vanadium pollution are expected to increase. Utilizing natural shale and coal waste as adsorbents, batch adsorption, isotherms, and kinetics of vanadium was studied. The adsorption characteristics of shale and coal waste were studied using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The effect of pH, the amount of adsorbent, vanadium concentration, temperature, and contact time between adsorbate and adsorbents were also studied to obtain optimum conditions for maximum adsorption of vanadium. The Fourier Transform Infrared results show little distortion in the vibration of bands, and hence the surface properties remain unchanged for both sorbents after adsorption. The adsorption kinetics are best described by pseudo-second order, while Langmuir model fits the adsorption isotherm for both adsorbents. Maximum sorption capacity is 67.57 mg/g for shale while that of coal is 59.88 mg/g at 298 K and pH 3. For both adsorbents, the adsorption process is spontaneous, endothermic, and chemisorption in nature. Both adsorbents can effectively be recycled twice.",

Specifically, pretreated sodium lignin sulfonate and acrylic acid were first cross-linked, then the graft copolymerization of the intermediate product (the cross-linking product) and acrylamide was conducted and finally the resulting gelatinous substances were crushed. During the reaction process, N,N’-methylene-bis-acrylamide and ammonium persulfate were used as the cross-linking agent and initiator, respectively. Subsequently, the functional groups, crystalline structure, and thermal stability of the dust coagulant were examined by means of Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements, X-ray diffraction spectra measurements, and differential scanning calorimeter analysis. Moreover, single-factor experiments were conducted to explore the optimal synthesis condition. According to the experimental results, the coagulant achieved its optimal dust suppression performance under the following conditions: the mass ratio of lignin to acrylic acid was 1:3, the mass ratio of lignin to acrylamide was 2:7, the content of the cross-linking agent was 0.9%, the mass ratio of initiator to acrylamide was 2:100, the reaction temperature was set as 60℃, and the pH value was set as 7. Finally, the coagulant was measured for its swelling kinetics, viscosity, film-forming hardness, peeling strength, and ability to suppress dust. It can be concluded that the coagulant exhibits a very high standard of both dust suppression and wind resistance.",

Porous media are essential for all these approaches and understanding the nature of the porous structure is important for achieving highly efficient CO 2 adsorption. Porous carbon is considered to be a suitable porous media for investigating the fundamental mechanisms of CO 2 adsorption, because of its simple morphology and its availability in a wide range of well-defined pore sizes. In this study, we investigated the dependence of CO 2 adsorption on pore structures such as pore size, volume, and specific surface area. We also studied slit-shaped and cylindrical pore morphologies based on activated carbon fibers of 0.6–1.7 nm and carbon nanotubes of 1–5 nm, respectively, with relatively uniform structures. Porous media with larger specific surface areas gave higher CO 2 adsorption densities than those of media having larger pore volumes. Narrower pores gave higher adsorption densities because of deep adsorption potential wells. However, at a higher pressure CO 2 adsorption densities increased again in nanopores including micropores and small mesopores. The optimal pore size ranges of CO 2 adsorption in the slit-shaped and cylindrical carbon pores were 0.4–1.2 and 1.0–2.0 nm, respectively, although a high adsorption density was only expected for the narrow carbon nanopores from adsorption potentials. The wider nanopore ranges than expected nanopore ranges are reasonable when considering intermolecular interactions in addition to CO 2 –carbon pore interactions. Therefore, cooperative adsorption among CO 2 in relatively narrow nanopores can allow for high density and high capacity adsorption.",

It was found that bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid/SiO 2 -P had higher adsorption distribution coefficient for heavy rare earth elements than for light rare earth elements. The adsorption capacity of Gd(III) was observed to be 0.315 mmol g −1 by bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid/SiO 2 -P in 0.1 M HNO 3 at 298 K, which increased slightly when increasing temperature from 298 to 323 K. The adsorption isotherms of Gd(III) matched well with the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The obtained thermodynamic parameters (ΔH o and ΔG o ) showed that the adsorption of Gd(III) by bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid/SiO 2 -P was a spontaneous and exothermic process. This study also evaluated the chemical stability of bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid/SiO 2 -P treated with nitric acid at different temperatures and demonstrated that bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid/SiO 2 -P had considerable stability against nitric acid and heat.",

In the process variables evaluation, there was a greater biosorption potential in acidic pH, without a significant influence of size on the biosorbent particles. The equilibrium time was achieved in 360 min, with approximately 93% removal at the evaluated temperatures. The experimental data were best represented by the pseudo-second-order model. Biosorption was characterized as spontaneous and endothermic, with indicative of physical. Considering the equilibrium, the Langmuir isotherm was the one that best fit the experimental data, with a maximum biosorption capacity of 68.75 mg g –1 (at 303 K and pH 2). The removal suffered no significant interference with the presence of another dye nor with the increase of ionic strength.

Various parameters such as the initial dye concentration (110–200 mg/L), adsorbent dose (1–6 mg/L), initial pH (2–9) and temperature (298–318 K) were studied to observe their effects on the BG adsorption.

Herein, clove leaves (CL) were utilized as a biosorbent for the sequestration of malachite green (MG) from a water-soluble solution. The CL was subsequently activated using potassium hydroxide (KOH) and characterized using the FTIR and FESEM to determine the functional groups on the activated clove leaves (CL-KOH) and the morphology of the adsorbent. The adsorption of MG was observed to be relatively dependent on the dosage of sorbent utilized, initial MG concentration, and sorption process contact time. The adsorption process of MG to CL was ideally described using the Dubinin–Radushkevich and Elovich models with the determination of maximum sorption capacity of approximately 131.6 mg·g -1 . Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters calculated showed that the adsorption of MG to the adsorbent was exothermic with the process involving physical sorption as well as chemical sorption processes with negligible adsorption energy. In conclusion, the study has revealed that the CL is a cost-effective biosorbent with high adsorption efficiency for the sequestration of MG from a water-soluble solution and can be recycled for further usage.",

    "abstract": "Plastic particles with a diameter of 5 mm or less are called microplastics. Microplastics are one of the primary sources of pollution in the environment. It has been proven that microplastics are also carriers of heavy metals, but there are few studies on their adsorption mechanism. In this study, the adsorption of Pb, Cu, Cd, and Zn by polypropylene (PP) microplastics was analyzed and discussed. The morphology of PP was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the surface elemental composition of PP was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the functional groups of PP were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that the adsorption behavior of microplastics to different heavy metals could be balanced in 32 hours. Kinetics experiments showed that the adsorption process could be fitted well by a two-stage dynamic model, and the adsorption of Pb and Cu by PP is greater than that of Cd and Zn. The Freundlich model has the best fitting effect on Pb for the adsorption isothermal results. The Langmuir model showed that the process is favorable for adsorption. The adsorption of mixed heavy metals by microplastics showed that when the concentration of the mixed adsorption mass was low, the presence of a coexistence system promoted the adsorption of Zn and Cu by microplastics. With an increasing concentration, the adsorption of 4 heavy metals by microplastics is inhibited.",

The structure and morphology of magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposites were studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy results of magnetic graphene oxide presented that the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles in the size range of 10–25 nm were decorated on graphene oxide nanosheets. The adsorption properties of magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposites for arsenic (V) from water were investigated to study the effects of magnetic graphene oxide mass ratio, contact time, pH, and initial concentration. The suitable magnetic graphene oxide mass ratio of nanocomposites for arsenic (V) adsorption was determined to be 4:1 (FG2). The adsorption process on FG2 followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic and well fitted in to Langmuir isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 69.44 mg/g at pH 3. Accordingly, FG2 could be used as an effective adsorbent for removal of arsenic (V) from water.",

    "abstract": "In this work, magnetized activated Juniperus procera leaves (Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL) were successfully prepared via chemical activation of JPL and in situ coprecipitation with Fe 3 O 4 . A Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL nanocomposite was successfully applied for the elimination of malachite green (MG) dye from aqueous media. The prepared Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL adsorbent was characterized by SEM, EDX, TEM, XRD, FTIR, TGA, and BET surface area analyses. The BET surface area and pore size of the Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL nanocomposite were found to be 38.44 m 2 /g and 10.6 nm, respectively. The XRD and FTIR results indicated the formation of a Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL nanocomposite. Different parameters, such as pH of the solution (3–8), adsorbent dosage (10–100 mg), temperature (25–45°C), contact time (5-240 min), and initial MG concentrations (20–350 mg/L), for the elimination of the MG dye using Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL were optimized and found to be 7, 50 mg, 45°C, 120 min, and 150 mg/L, respectively. The nonlinear isotherm and kinetic studies exhibited a better fitting to second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models, with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 318.3 mg/g at 45°C, which was highly superior to the previously reported magnetic nanocomposite adsorbents. EDX analyses confirmed the presence of nitrogen on the Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL surface after MG adsorption. The calculated thermodynamic factors indicated endothermic and spontaneous processes. The desorption of MG dye from Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL was performed using a solution of 90% ethanol. Finally, it could be concluded that the designed Fe 3 O 4 @AJPL magnetic nanocomposite will be a cost-effective and promising adsorbent for the elimination of MG from aqueous media.",

Using black gram grain storage, the efficiency of carbon dioxide gas against all life stages of Callosobruchus maculatus insects was tested at various concentrations and exposure times. The trials were carried out in pilot bins with a capacity of 25 kg. At a CO 2 concentration of 50%, complete mortality of the egg stage of Callosobruchus maculatus was attained after 72 h of continuous exposure. At a CO 2 concentration of 60% for 48 h, 100% larva mortality was achieved. At the most tolerant stage of pupa, recorded complete mortality is at a CO 2 concentration of 70% for 96 hours of the exposure period. Adult insects are especially vulnerable to the high CO 2 concentration. Adult mortality was achieved at a concentration of 20% with an exposure period of 48 h. The CO 2 -treated black grams were then stored for three months with the optimized CO 2 concentration and exposure period, while physiochemical parameters such as water retention capacity and physiological loss in weight were determined. Grain stored in the silo showing significant 100% mortality of egg was measured after 20-25 days of observation. The use of a controlled atmosphere storage bin increased the mortality of the insect C. maculatus at all developmental stages, by means of increasing CO 2 concentration and exposure time. Grain stored in a controlled atmosphere silo showed minimum losses of grain (4.10%) compared to the gunny bag storage (22.56%).",

    "abstract": "Studies have been carried out to investigate the removal of crystal violet (CV) cationic dye by using rice husk which was used as a raw material to prepare activated carbon (AC) and it was treated with anionic surfactant. In this process, AC was treated with three different anionic surfactants, namely, lauryl sulfate ACMAS, ACSDS, and ACHTAB. Characterization and analysis of optimum ACMAS were done using different techniques which were used which proves the adsorption of the dye by ACMAS. Effects of various physical parameters like time of contact, additive salts, initial dye concentration, effect of pH, and effect of adsorbent dose were studied. Minute changes in the dye removal capacity were observed due to the presence of various cations. Cations like NO 2- caused an increase in the capacity of adsorption but cations like Fe 2+ decreased the capacity of adsorption in the sample solution. The effectiveness of film diffusion and intraparticle has been shown by mass transfer parameters. The various kinetic studies have shown that pseudo second-order kinetic study best suited with the experimental data. Error analysis and studies of isotherms have shown that the adsorption equilibrium was controlled by Langmuir isotherm study with maximum CV dye adsorption capacity of 235.7 mg/g. Thermodynamics studies revealed endothermicity of the process with negative [Formula: see text] values and positive [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] values. Activation energy of 48.31 kJ/mol suggested chemisorption process of the system. Column studies were carried out by using different models to study the variation of bed depth, dye concentration, flow rate, etc. Regeneration experiments have given the ability of the adsorbent to be reused. In this present study, it has been noticed that the use of anionic surfactant-treated activated carbon significantly improved the adsorption of dye and this is a process of adsorption in which not much attention has been given for research till date.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of dye pollutants by the photocatalytic process has been regarded as the most efficient green method for removal organic dyes from contaminated water. The current research work describes the synthesis of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @Ru hybrid magnetic composites (HMCs) and their photocatalytic degradation of two azo dye pollutants, methyl orange (MO) and methyl red (MR), under irradiation of visible light. The synthesis of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @Ru HMCs involves three stages, including synthesis of Fe 3 O 4 magnetic microspheres (MMSs), followed by silica (SiO 2 ) coating to get Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 MMSs, and then incorporation of presynthesized Ru nanoparticles (~3 nm) onto the surface of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 HMCs. The synthesized HMCs were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TEM, EDS, XPS, BET analysis, UV-DRS, PL spectroscopy, and VSM to study the physical and chemical properties. Furthermore, the narrow band gap energy of the HMC photocatalyst is a significant parameter that provides high photocatalytic properties due to the high light adsorption. The photocatalytic activity of synthesized Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @Ru HMCs was assessed by researching their ability to degrade the aqueous solution of MO and MR dyes under visible radiation, and the influence of various functional parameters on photocatalytic degradation has also been studied. The results indicate that the photocatalytic degradation of MO and MR dyes is more than 90%, and acid media favors better degradation. The probable mechanism of photodegradation of azo dyes by Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @Ru HMC catalysts has been proposed. Furthermore, due to the strong ferromagnetic Fe 3 O 4 core, HMCs were easily separated from the solution after the photocatalytic degradation process for reuse. Also, the photocatalytic activity after six cycles of use is greater than 90%, suggesting the stability of the synthesized Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @Ru HMCs.",

For the long-term reliability of environmental conservation, this study illustrates the interlinkage between PIW treatment and the three pillars of sustainable development. Sewage sludge biochar was modified with eggshell, showing a relatively high fixed C content (increase in carbonization degree), and small O/C and N/C ratios. The prepared biochar was employed for TX adsorption in mono-component solutions, giving removal efficiencies of 79.1% (T) and 86.6% (X), at pH =10, adsorbent dosage =2 g/L, and C o =40 mg/L within 60 min. The main adsorption mechanism was physisorption, including precipitation/pore-filling, π- π dispersive interaction, and van der Waals force. The modified biochar also treated real PIW under five adsorption/regeneration cycles, providing essential steps toward large-scale applications. According to an economic feasibility estimation, the biochar application for treating 1 m 3 of PIW would offer a payback period of 6.9 yr. The study outputs could be linked to the restoration of water-related ecosystems, biochar modification for industrial applications, and climate change mitigation, adopting the 2030 agenda and its sustainable development goals (SDGs).",

    "abstract": "Heavy metal wastewater pollution has become an environmental and industrial challenge worldwide. Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is one of the most common forms of chromium metal. Hexavalent chromium pollution is a concern because it was hazardous and can accumulate in the tissues of living organisms and the environment. The adsorption method using activated carbon can be one of the methods to treat hexavalent chromium waste. This study selected Samanea saman as the activated carbon because it contains hemicellulose, lignocellulose, and lignin, which are the requirements for an excellent activated carbon. The study’s objective is to analyze Samanea saman activated carbon (SSAC) to remove hexavalent chromium, measure the adsorption capacity, and determine the appropriate type of adsorption isotherm layer based on the maximum [Formula: see text] and minimum [Formula: see text] values. The process of making activated carbon was activated using K 2 CO 3 through a pyrolysis process and using batch adsorption. The SEM results as characterization of SSAC depicted that the high pore was well developed. The optimal conditions for Samanea saman indicated high efficiency toward hexavalent chromium ions within the following process parameters; pH value 5, adsorbent dosage 5 g, and initial concentration 20 mg/L. The findings demonstrate that SSAC leads to the removal efficiency of hexavalent chromium being 99.90%, with the greatest adsorption capacity of 0.8949 mg/g. Based on the maximum [Formula: see text] and minimum [Formula: see text] values, the most suitable adsorption isotherm model in SSAC was the Freundlich isotherm existing in the monolayer ([Formula: see text]). The experimental results demonstrated that adsorption of Cr(VI) was well performed by SSAC. Thus, the SSAC material is an appropriate adsorbent for the removal of hexavalent chromium in the water and has the potential to be industrial applied.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are emerging water pollutants that have attracted significant attention from the scientific community. Antibiotics are generally released via hospital effluents, industrial production waste, animal manure, and irrigated agricultural land. Antibiotic residues can harm all living organisms, with the most detrimental consequence being the generation of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, commonly known as “superbugs.” Antimicrobial resistance is a concern to the healthcare community as it complicates the treatment of infections. Thus, the development of effective and economical technologies to remove antibiotics from the environment is necessary. Adsorption is a promising technology owing to its effectiveness and high operational feasibility, and carbon-based adsorbents are primitive materials that are particularly suited for antibiotic adsorption. Herein, an overview of the current state of antibiotic pollution will be summarised, including the adverse effects of different antibiotics and challenges associated with antibiotic removal. The adsorption behaviours of tetracycline (TC), quinolone, penicillin, and macrolides on carbon-based adsorbents (i.e., activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene-based materials) are reviewed. The interactions between antibiotics and carbon-based adsorbents, adsorption mechanism, and adsorption behaviour under different conditions are emphasised. In addition, the limitations of adsorption technology are highlighted to direct future research.",

Natural fibres are less costly, biodegradable, and nonflammable than glass fibres. This study explores how titanium oxide affects woven polyester reinforced composite’s mechanical and physical characteristics. Nanocomposites were created by hand utilizing the following terms: (i) TiO 2 nanoparticle filler weight ratio, (ii) fibre content, and (iii) fibre diameter, all at three unique levels. Using the L9 (3 3 ) orthogonal design, nine composite samples are generated and tested according to the ASTM standard. According to the research, hybrid composites containing 4% titanium oxide powder and 15 mm length of bamboo fibre with 0.24 mm of bamboo fibre diameter have high mechanical strength. Adding fibre to pristine polyester increased its mechanical properties. As the fibre and filler percentages grew, more effort was required to break the fragments between the matrix and its resin. The verification test, which uses the optimal processing value and grey relational analysis, outperforms the real test results by a wide margin. Tensile strength increased by 14.76%, flexural strength increased by 14.07%, and hardness increased by 25.55%.",

Optimal parameters of pH 5 and biosorbent dose of 0.80 g L -1 allowed a malachite green removal percentage of 87.7%. Data obtained from kinetic studies were fitted with the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum biosorption capacity was determined using the Langmuir equilibrium model, reaching a value of 214.2 mg g -1 . The biosorption process was thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous at room temperature.

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), a new crystalline form in the carbon family, have been shown to be an effective adsorbent for Cu 2+ ion removal from aqueous solution. After oxidation with nitric acid, the adsorption capacity of the oxidized CNTs towards Cu 2+ ions at a pH of 5.2 reached 27.6 mg/g, compared to a value of only 14.4 mg/g for the as-grown CNTs under the same circumstances. Increasing the pH to 5.4 led to 95% removal of Cu 2+ ions with the oxidized CNTs, whereas with the as-grown CNTs it was necessary to increase the pH to 8.6 to achieve the same extent of removal. The Cu 2+ ion adsorption capacity increased with increasing CNT dosage for the different initial Cu 2+ ion concentrations. The kinetic curve for adsorption of the Cu 2+ ions suggested that not only the outer surfaces but also inner cavities and inter-layers in the structures of the CNTs were responsible for the removal of the ion from aqueous solutions.",

The batch process was used either to remove each metal ion singly or both metals as a multi-component system. The adsorbents used were low-cost materials, viz. palm fruit bunch and maize cob. The adsorption isotherms demonstrated that the adsorbents behaved in a favourable manner towards metal ion adsorption. The adsorption capacities for iron ions on palm fruit bunch and maize cob were in the 57–80% range and for the manganese ion in the 50–79% range for initial concentrations between 1 ppm and 10 ppm. With mixtures of both metal ions, removal of iron ions from the mixture was in the 54–79% range and for the manganese ion in the 54–76% range.

Ammonium ion sorption by the zeolite appeared to be complete within 24 h for all fraction sizes, initial NH 4 + ion concentration and adsorbate volumes. The amounts of NH 4 + ions sorbed increased with increasing initial NH 4 + concentration and decreasing adsorbate volumes, with the maximum sorption capacity exhibited by the clinoptilolite being 0.64 mequiv/g. The sorption effectiveness decreased somewhat with increasing fraction size. The Langmuir and Freundlich models were applied to the data obtained from the batch studies with the first model exhibiting the more satisfactory correlation coefficient value (0.996 and 0.959, respectively).",

    "abstract": "The effect of pore morphology on the hydrogen-storage capacity of carbon materials at room temperature (298 K) has been studied using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) molecular simulation. Prototypical pore geometries such as slit pores and nanotubes were considered along with carbon foams and a random disordered carbon structure. Both physisorption and chemisorption models were considered in order to take into account the most favourable adsorption scenarios. Fluid–fluid and fluid–solid interactions were assumed to follow a Lennard-Jones-type potential. It was seen that physisorption alone cannot account for the adsorption of more than a few weight percentages, regardless of the pore morphology. Under physisorption conditions, the simulation results show that carbons with a slit-shaped pore geometry are more efficient than other geometries at storing hydrogen, particularly at pore distances which allow the formation of fluid layers commensurate with the pore geometry. Slit pores appear to store a maximum of 1.77 wt% hydrogen by physisorption as opposed to carbon foams (1.48 wt%), carbons with a random structure (1.04 wt%) and carbon nanotubes (0.31 wt%). Simulation with hypothetical chemisorption models where the solid–fluid interaction is artificially enhanced showed that the storage capacity is higher in pore geometries with a larger accessible volume. Strong chemisorption gave loadings of up to 17 g/ℓ (1.5 wt%), 91 g/ℓ (13.8 wt%), 57.33 g/ℓ (9.6 wt%) and 42.94 g/ℓ (8.29 wt%) in nanotubes, foams, random structures and slit pores, respectively. Desorption is a problem in this scenario, as only ca. 1–3 wt% hydrogen can be delivered from these structures. Ultimately, the comparison of the different fluid–solid potentials revealed that if solid–fluid interactions could be enhanced beyond the classical dispersion, the more open structures could be ideal candidates for hydrogen-storage materials.",

However, the mechanism of action of this process is unclear. In this paper, field experiment and laboratory tests are described that aim at elucidating this process. Given the sensitivity and accuracy of test methods and their corresponding determination principles, a combination of mercury intrusion porosimetry and nitrogen gas adsorption was proposed as a complementary technique and the pore-size distribution (PSD) was obtained. It is shown that the proportion of minipores decreases remarkably, whereas that of the macropores gradually increases with the decrease in the distance from the slotted borehole. By contrast, the mesopores and micropores present insignificant changes. Meanwhile, the adsorption pore and the seepage pore show a similar variation in tendency with the minipores and macropores, respectively. Moreover, the specific surface area decreases substantially with the decrease in borehole distances. The integration of hydraulic slotting and gas drainage can lower the gas-adsorption properties and enhance the gas-seepage capacity within the disturbed zone significantly. The paper highlights the guiding factors for improving the enhanced coal bed methane recovery.",

The adsorption process was described by Freundlich model (R 2 &gt;0.99) and the maximum adsorption capacity could reach to 53.11 mg g −1 . The experimental results provided a novel approach for the utilization of opal waste rock, which is produced during the mining of opal-rich palygorskite, and for the synthesis of 4A zeolite and the removal of ammonium ion.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of coal to adsorb methane is greatly affected by temperature and, in recent years, temperature-dependent adsorption has been studied by many researchers. Even so, comprehensive conclusions have not been reached and conflicting experimental results are common. This paper reviews the current state of research regarding the temperature-dependent adsorption of methane in coal and catalogs the conclusions from experiments conducted on that subject by 28 researchers, as published between 1995 and 2017. Probability theory and statistics are used to show that the conclusion generally accepted by most researchers is that the amount of methane adsorbed by coal decreases with increasing temperature. It is highly likely that the Langmuir volume decreases as the temperature rises, and it is also probable that the Langmuir pressure increases at higher temperatures. Equations are presented that express the relationships between methane adsorption, Langmuir volume, Langmuir pressure, and temperature. Future research should be directed toward determining the relationship between Langmuir pressure and temperature. The results of the study presented herein provide a theoretical basis for predicting the gas content in coal seams and improving the efficiency of coalbed methane development.",

However, the combined effect of nanoparticles and bacteria on plant growth in heavy metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, and Pb)-contaminated wastewater is greatly limited. Therefore, the recent work was designed to determine the synergistic impact of green synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) (5-10 mg/L) and Bacillus spp. ( Bacillus cereus and Lysinibacillus macroides) on the physiological and biochemical activities of rice seedlings under heavy metal- (HM-) contaminated water. The results revealed that germination percentage (36%), root-shoot length (5.11 and 3.41 cm), fresh shoot-root weight (0.05 and 0.011 g), dry shoot-root weight (0.008 and 0.009 g), Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoid (5.4, 3.2 mg/g, and 4.3 μg/g), total soluble sugar (TSS) (26.44 mg/g), and total soluble protein (TSP) (21.99 mg/g) content considerably reduced in the plant tissues while combined impact of bacteria and ZnO NPs alleviates HM stress in contaminated water and improved seed germination (70%), root-shoot length (9.93 and 11.82 cm), fresh shoot-root weight (0.125 and 0.131 g), dry shoot-root weight (0.0532 and 0.042 g), Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoid (18.8, 13.9 mg/g, and 17.1 μg/g), TSS (57.651 mg/g), and TSP (47.990 mg/g) content.

The successful construction of the nanocomposite was confirmed using different characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The magnetic properties were studied using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) indicating ferromagnetic behavior of the synthesized materials that facilitate their separation using an external magnetic field after adsorption treatment. The addition of N-GO to CaFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles enhanced the BET surface area from 24 to 52.93 m 2 /g as resulted from the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. The adsorption of the synthesized nanomaterials is controlled by several parameters (initial concentration of dye, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and pH), and the RO12 dye removal on the surface of CaFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles and CaFe 2 O 4 /N-GO nanocomposite was reached through the chemisorption process as indicated from the kinetic study.

Their applications as semiconductors make a breakthrough in communication by miniaturizing the communication devices. The main drawback of the SWCNT is found to [Formula: see text] noise. Because of this limitation, high attenuation at the low-frequency band cannot be achieved, limiting its application in terms of selectivity. The spectral density study shows that the noise’s amplitude is directly proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the number of carriers in the nanotube. The SWCNT is mainly synthesized using hydrocarbons which contains carbonaceous impurities. On the removal of impurities, more surface oxygen functional groups are formed. On the other hand, the diameter of the carbon nanotube is very small, increasing the resistance of carrier flow. In this research work, gas adsorption was used in SWCNT by treating the carbon nanotube using nitric acid. Isotherms determine porous size. The adsorbate-adsorbent interaction on carbon nanotube reduces the microporosity in the surface by treating with nitric acid. Therefore, the density of the surface increases and the CNT bundle separation will be reduced, increasing the carbon nanotube’s resistivity. This increase in resistivity reduces the excess carrier flow; therefore, the temperature will reduce the [Formula: see text] noise. The proposed system is cost-effective and has shown 11% improvement by reducing the noise amplitude by increasing carbon nanotube resistance.

Neem biomass-based bioadsorbent having a carboxylic group was prepared by activation using chemical modification by NaOH and citric acid with a very simple method. The optimal activation conditions were determined as 37 min, 120°C, in 0.73 M citric acid, with a sample/acid ratio of 1/100 (mass/volume). To determine the basic properties such as chemical structure, porosity, and surface properties of the neem biomass (NB) and chemically modified neem biomass (CMNB), they were characterized by BET, FTIR, SEM, XRD, and pHpzc methods. It was observed that activation has improved the adsorption capacity of the NB and also caused a more amorphous structure. The effects of adsorption parameters such as pH (2–7), contact time (10–110 min), initial Pb 2+ ion concentration (100–300 g/L), and bioadsorbent dosage (01–1.1 g/L) on percentage removal of Pb 2+ ion were studied. Maximum removal of Pb 2+ ion (97.29%) was recorded at 0.9 g/L bioadsorbent dosage, 50 min contact time, pH of 6, and initial metal ion concentration of 100 mg/L. Kinetics and isotherm studies showed that the adsorption mechanism of Pb 2+ ion using CMNB follows pseudosecond-order while isotherm studies fit with both models but, relatively, Freundlich model better fit having a little higher [Formula: see text]. The outcome specifies that the modified bioadsorbent can be utilized as a good and low-cost alternative for the treatment of effluent containing lead (II) ions in water.",

Portland cement was partially replaced with 1 percent, 1.5 percent, 2 percent, and 3 percent CNT, while SF was substituted with 5 percent, 7.5 percent, and 10 percent. Both CNT and SF outperform conventional concrete in terms of mechanical and durability attributes, according to the findings. CNT produces superior results than SF due to its smaller size.",

    "abstract": "Contamination HM is an important issue associated with the environment, and it requires suitable steps for the reduction of HMs in water at an acceptable ratio. With modern technologies, this could be possible by enabling the carbon adsorbents to adsorb the pollutions via deep learning strategies. In this paper, we develop a model on detection and prediction of presence of HMs from drinking water by analysing the adsorbents from residuals using deep learning. The study uses dense neural networks or DenseNets to analyse the microscopic images of the residual adsorbents. The study initially preprocesses and extracts features using standardised procedure. The DenseNets are used finally for detection purpose, and it is trained and tested with standard set of microscopic images. The experimental results are conducted to test the efficacy of the deep learning model on detecting the HM composition. The results of simulation show that the proposed deep learning model achieves 95% higher rate of detecting the HM composition from the adsorption residuals than other methods.",

The objective of this study was to use a recoverable magnetic zeolite to remove Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. The study investigated the application of nanotechnology to improve surface properties, recoverability, and adsorptive capacity of natural zeolite and the CCD-RSM-based optimization of adsorption process variables. Natural zeolites coated with various fractions of magnetic nanoparticles (25%, 33.33%, 50%, and 75%) were investigated for surface characters, adsorption capacity, removal efficiency, and recoverability. Natural zeolite coated with 33.33% (MZ33) was found a better adsorbent in terms of surface characters, adsorption capacity, and removal efficiency. Thirty batch adsorption experiments designed with CCD were carried out in order to optimize adsorption process variables using response surface methodology (RSM). It was found that [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] were the optimum conditions to achieve 93.57% Cr(VI) removal, which is very close to the experimental result of 94.88%. The adsorption isotherm determined from the operating parameters revealed that experimental data fit to the Langmuir isotherm model with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. This proved that the adsorption of Cr(VI) on magnetic zeolite involved monolayer adsorption on the active sites. The separation factor, [Formula: see text], value lies between 0 and 1 indicating that adsorption of Cr(VI) on the magnetic zeolite is favorable. The adsorption kinetics study follows pseudo-first order in the removal of Cr(VI). FTIR analysis of magnetic zeolite revealed the presence of numerous functional groups participating in Cr(VI) adsorption. The current study confirmed that magnetic zeolite is a cost-effective and favorable material for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution.",

Of those, nanoparticles in particular, the low-cost and the high-strength aluminum oxide nanoparticles showed promising results in pollutant uptake and increase in the adsorption efficiency. This study examined various physicochemical process parameters such as temperature, pH, initial phenol concentration, and adsorbent doses, in addition to the impact of those parameters on the adsorption removal mechanism of phenol. The results highlighted that aluminum oxide nanoparticles successfully exhibited superior phenol removal from an aqueous solution in addition to a high potential regeneration of the consumed nanoparticles by HCl. For the adsorbent mass of 0.5 g, phenol adsorption uptake reached 92%. Kinetic studies performed using several models demonstrated the data best fitting with a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Examining equilibrium studies of various isotherms, the adsorption data of phenol into aluminum oxide nanoparticles was confirmed to be controlled by film diffusion and best represented by the Langmuir isotherm. The maximum capacity of adsorption was 16.97 mg/g. For thermodynamics studies, the results indicated that the adsorption process can vary between endothermic and exothermic reactions. Such relative differences in heat generation and spontaneity in adsorption processes were demonstrated and confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA). This evidence is key for future investigations for the efficiency of adsorption conditions concerning the contaminant type and adsorbate compounds.",

By using a set of analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, EDX, RS, and SEM, the adsorbent was characterized for its physical and chemical properties. Batch study experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the CTASP as an adsorbent. The maximum adsorption capacity of 67.08 mgg -1 was attained at optimum conditions of 3 gL -1 adsorbent dosage, pH 3, contact time of 30 min, and at temperature 303 K. After 30 minutes, the equilibrium was reached, and the experimental data was explained for isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamic processes. The results indicated that pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Freundlich isotherm were the best fits for the data. The findings of the analysis of the thermodynamic parameters for the process showed that the system was an exothermic and spontaneous. According to the desorption studies, 0.1 M NaOH can be utilized as a separating reagent to desorb 90.53% of ARS that was adsorbed. Regeneration experiments were conducted to make the process more practical and affordable, and it was discovered that the CTASP adsorbent could be successfully regenerated up to four times. In comparison with other adsorbents, the current low-cost adsorbent had the exceptional regenerative capability and delivered multilayer adsorption capacity. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the CTASP is an effective material for the detoxification of ARS dye from wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Emerging contaminants (ECs) are substances that have been detected in water but have not been thoroughly tested or regulated. Pesticides, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other medications are examples of compounds in this category. Even at low quantities, these pollutants can harm human health and the environment; therefore, avoiding them is critical. The consequences of EC pollution on the endocrine, hormonal, and genetic systems are causing significant concern. Even with current best practices and available technology, it is difficult to totally eliminate ECs from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants. Adsorption has been the method of choice for EC removal since it is less costly, more effective, and easier to use. To treat ECs, newer generation nanoadsorbents are employed. Adsorption was greatly enhanced by functional changes to the adsorbent surface. Carbon nanostructures are widely used as adsorbents because of their outstanding surface properties, adaptability, large surface area, adjustable structural changes, and high chemical stability. This review reviews and examines recent research on the production and use of carbon-based nanoadsorbents. The emphasis is on carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphene-derived adsorbents. It is being investigated if these adsorbents can be used to extract hormone-disrupting chemicals and other emerging pollutants. The sources and classification of these pollutants, treatment knowledge gaps, and novel prospects for increasing carbonaceous nanoadsorbent utilization were all explored. The environmental and health problems associated with EC use are also studied.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of industrialization, the amount of copper-containing wastewater is increasing, thereby posing a threat to the aquatic ecological environment and human health. Sludge biochar has received extensive concern in recent years due to its advantages of low cost and sustainability for the treatment of heavy-metal-containing wastewater. However, the heavy-metal-adsorption capacity of sludge biochar is limited. This study prepared a sodium pyrophosphate- (Na 4 P 2 O 7 -) modified municipal sludge-based biochar (SP-SBC) and evaluated its adsorption performance for Cu(II). Results showed that SP-SBC had higher yield, ash content, pH, Na and P content, and surface roughness than original sewage sludge biochar (SBC). The Cu(II)-adsorption capacity of SP-SBC was 4.55 times than that of SBC at room temperature. For Cu(II) adsorption by SP-SBC, the kinetics and isotherms conformed to the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir–Freundlich model, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity of SP-SBC was 38.49 mg·g −1 at 35°C. Cu(II) adsorption by SP-SBC primarily involved ion exchange, electrostatic attraction, and precipitation. The desired adsorption performance for Cu(II) in the fixed-bed column experiment indicated that SP-SBC can be reused and had good application potential to treat copper-containing wastewater. Overall, this study provided a desirable sorbent (SP-SBC) for Cu(II) removal, as well as a new simple chemical-modification method for SBC to enhance Cu(II)-adsorption capacity.",

The modified bagasse biochar was used to remove methylene blue (MB) and acid red (AR) dyes. The surface characteristics of the modified bagasse biochars were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to assess the impact of various parameters on adsorption performance. Among the different bagasse biochar samples, Zn-BC-600 exhibited superior adsorption capacities for MB and AR with values of 182.225 and 43.324 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption efficiency was significantly influenced by pH, with optimal conditions at pH = 6.0 for MB and pH = 2.0 and 10.0 for AR. The adsorption process for MB and AR on Zn-BCs followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating chemisorption as the primary mechanism. Adsorption isotherm studies revealed that Zn-BCs conform to the Freundlich model, proposing a multilayer adsorption due to the heterogeneity of the biochar surface. Regeneration experiments indicated that Zn-BCs could be reused for multiple adsorption cycles. In conclusion, the modified bagasse biochar showed strong adsorption affinity for both MB and AR, particularly for MB, making it a promising adsorbent for treating printing and dyeing wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Dry reforming of methane (DRM) offers a promising pathway towards carbon neutrality by converting the greenhouse gases methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable syngas (CO + H 2 ). This sustainable process not only mitigates climate change but also contributes to a circular carbon economy by utilizing waste gases as valuable feedstocks. However, the successful industrial implementation of DRM hinges on the development of stable and efficient catalysts. This study investigated the influence of the ceria support source on the catalytic performance of Ni/CeO 2 catalysts. Three commercially available ceria supports from Germany, Canada, and the USA were employed, denoted as Ni-P, Ni-M, and Ni-C, respectively. These supports were impregnated with nickel and characterized using a suite of techniques, including XRD, FTIR, SEM, N 2 adsorption-desorption, and TGA. Catalytic activity and stability were evaluated within a temperature range of 550 to 750 °C. Our findings revealed that the catalytic performance is significantly influenced by the physicochemical properties of the catalyst. The Ni/CeO 2 (Ni-C) catalyst demonstrated superior activity and stability, exhibiting minimal carbon deposition as evidenced by TGA analysis and a low deactivation factor. This research provides valuable insights into the critical role of support materials in optimizing Ni/CeO 2 catalyst performance for DRM. The development of highly stable and active catalysts, such as the Ni/CeO 2 (Ni-C) catalyst, is crucial for the successful industrial implementation of DRM, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy future.",

The adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K was investigated and the adsorption data interpreted by the application of the Langmuir equation, the BET equation and the α S -method. The adsorption of carbon dioxide at 273 K was also followed and the data analyzed using the DR and DA equations. The adsorption of iodine from aqueous potassium iodide solution, and of Methylene Blue and p-nitrophenol from aqueous solutions at 298 K was also determined. Activation with zinc chloride produced physical and chemical changes which modified the thermal degradation process. Carbonization with zinc chloride restricted the formation of tars with the subsequent formation of solid carbon, the amount of zinc chloride incorporated in the precursor governing the porosity of the resulting carbon. The atmosphere under which activation of samples containing zinc chloride was undertaken was another factor in determining the texture of the carbon. Activation with steam to low burn-offs created new micropores by burning off the more reactive carbon atoms, but at high burn-offs erosion of the pore walls occurred leading to pore widening. Adsorption from solution was determined by the solubility of the solute in the solvent and by competition for this solute between the solvent and the adsorbent. The pore size of the carbon adsorbent and the molecular size of the adsorbate molecule were prominent factors in determining the extent of adsorption from solution.",

    "abstract": "A commercial activated carbon was systematically modified by heat treatment at 450°C and 850°C to obtain a series of carbons with various oxygen contents, porous structures and surface functionalities. The carbons were used to investigate the role of adsorbent properties on the removal of naphthalene from aqueous solution. The results confirmed that the adsorption of naphthalene depended strongly on the pore-size distribution of the adsorbent. DTG analysis of the exhausted samples indicated that adsorption forces were stronger in carbons with pores of dimensions close to those of naphthalene. Functionalization of the carbon also influenced its overall adsorption capacity, with uptake being favoured in carbons of a basic nature. The hydrophilic character of the carbons gave rise to strong water competition due to increasing polarity in the adsorbents. This polarity created hydration clusters that reduced the accessibility and affinity of naphthalene molecules to the inner pore structure.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring kaolinite and its acid-activated form were used to separate the toxic metal ions Cd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Pb(II) and Ni(II) from water by adsorption. Kaolinite was treated with 0.25 M H 2 SO 4 to obtain the acid-activated form. Adsorption onto the calcined forms of the clays was influenced by pH, the solution concentration of metal ions, the amount of adsorbent employed, the interaction time and the temperature. The process followed second-order kinetics very closely. Isotherm-fitting procedures showed compliance with the Langmuir and Freundlich equations suggesting the involvement of strong interactions. The Langmuir monolayer capacity showed some increase between kaolinite and the acid-activated form [Cd(II): 9.9 and 11.4 mg/g; Co(II): 11.2 and 12.1 mg/g; Cu(II): 9.2 and 10.1 mg/g; Pb(II): 11.1 and 12.1 mg/g; and Ni(II): 10.4 and 11.9 mg/g]. The thermodynamics of the rate processes showed that the adsorption of Co(II), Cd(II) and Cu(II) ions was endothermic and accompanied by an increase in both the entropy and the Gibbs' free energy. However, in contrast, the adsorption of Pb(II) and Ni(II) ions was exothermic with a decrease in entropy and an appreciable decrease in the Gibbs' free energy. The results have established that kaolinite and its acid-activated form show a good potential as adsorbents for Cd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Pb(II) and Ni(II) ions from aqueous media.",

Scanning electron microscopy of the PVA-modified nano-clay adsorbent indicated the presence of irregular crystal structures.

This adsorbent was found to have an adsorption capacity of 56.18 mg/g for Pb 2+ ions and 41.67 mg/g for Cd 2+ ions.

The ΔH 0 values for the adsorption of both metal ions onto the PVA–nano-clay were −12.48 kJ/mol for Pb 2+ ions and −13.49 kJ/mol for Cd 2+ ions, with both ions exhibiting negative adsorption entropies. Data-fitting indicated that both the PVA–nano-clay and the unmodified adsorbent possessed homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorption sites. Virtually complete desorption (ca. 99%) of both metal ions occurred from PVA–nano-clay within 3 min.",

The adsorption kinetics were tested using three models, viz. pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion. The experimental kinetic data were best fitted by the pseudo-second-order model for Cu(II) ions (R 2 ≥ 0.98) and for Hg(II) ions (R 2 = 0.99). Higher rate constants (k 2 ) were obtained for the adsorption of Cu(II) ions onto chitosan–GLA [1.40 g/(mmol h)] and for Hg(II) ions onto raw chitosan [5.65 g/(mmol h)]. The adsorption rate depended on the concentration of Cu(II) and Hg(II) ions on the adsorbent surface and on the quantity of ions adsorbed at equilibrium. At 293 K, the Langmuir–Freundlich model provided a better fit to the adsorption isotherms on both raw and cross-linked chitosan membranes.

    "abstract": "Active, or microporous, carbons are established and effective adsorbents for toxic and other organic vapour-phase compounds. Their porosity results predominantly from slit-shaped pores of molecular dimensions (and hence widths &lt; 2 nm) formed by spaces between graphene layers in a turbostratic structure. They are used in a wide range of separation and recovery processes where adequate performance is often routinely achieved using relatively cheap, generic active carbons (ACs) produced from precursors such as coal, nutshells and wood. However, many current, or new, applications require more refined properties, such as greater selectivity or specific surface chemistry, before the full potential of ACs can be realized. Typical examples occur in separations associated with toxic organic compounds, for example in industrial and military respiratory protection or effluent clean-up, where the removal of highly toxic or noxious vapour species, sometimes present at very low concentrations, is required from atmospheric air streams which contain near-saturation pressures of water vapour. In this instance, a hydrophobic carbon with a pore structure which is optimized to the target species is required to solve this problem, but other applications, for example to control other emissions to the environment (SO x /NO x /Hg) or in energy storage (H 2 /CH 4 ) and electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) usage, may require quite different properties. Against this background, it is not surprising that there is currently great interest in active carbons with controllable properties and increased adsorption performance to meet these new challenges. Research workers are now looking beyond conventional ACs to materials with very specific properties which are tailored to meet these more exacting high-performance applications. However, in turn, achieving these goals places greater emphasis on both accurate structure/property characterization and also upon methods by which adsorption properties can be manipulated. In this review, the basic structure and properties of ACs are presented in relation to their adsorption characteristics; this is accompanied by an overview of adsorption theories which underpin quantitative equilibrium isotherm analysis (Polanyi–Dubinin–Stoeckli, Sing-α S , DFT) and allow the derivation of detailed physical and chemical information about carbon adsorbents, and comparison and understanding of the adsorption behaviour of target vapour species. Emphasis is placed on the types of interactions which occur between vapour molecules and the carbon surfaces, and the relative energy of these interactions. Consideration is given to the non-specific (London-type) forces which occur between vapour molecules and graphene basal planes, and the enhancement of these forces, between these planes and within micropores (width &lt; 2 nm), leading to the Type I isotherms characteristic of these carbons. The size of vapour molecules relative to the (slit) width of pores is also discussed, as is the effect of the presence of wider (&gt; 2 nm) pores. In contrast, specific interactions occurring at polar sites, and therefore dominated by the surface chemistry of the carbon structure, are also reviewed; critical in this respect are the interactions which occur between surface oxygen-containing groups — which are mainly present on the edge sites of the carbon planes — and water molecules, the competitive adsorption of which may seriously limit the adsorption of target species in many separation applications which are carried out in humid environments. Discussion of these aspects is followed by some comments on adsorption kinetics and dynamic filtration and, to emphasize the theoretical points which arise, examples are given of how manipulation of carbon characteristics can begin to be used to control and optimize adsorption for a range of more challenging applications.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption capacity of sepiolite towards the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution was studied in this work, with adsorption equilibrium data being obtained with a bath adsorber. The sepiolite sample was chemically stable over the pH range 2–12, but dissolved in acidic solutions with pH values less than 2. The Langmuir isotherm gave a better fit of the experimental adsorption equilibrium data, since the average absolute percentage deviation of the Langmuir isotherm was lower than that of the Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption capacity of sepiolite towards metal ions decreased in the following order: Cr(III) &gt; Cd(II) &gt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II) &gt; Ni(II) &gt; Ag(I). Increasing the temperature from 15 °C to 35 °C led to an increase in the adsorption capacity. The capacity of sepiolite towards the adsorption of Cd(II) ions was diminished considerably on reducing the solution pH from 7 to 3. The effect of the solution pH was attributed to electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged sepiolite surface and the positively charged Cd(II) ions in the aqueous solution. The surface charge of sepiolite became less negative when Cd(II) ions were adsorbed onto the sepiolite surface. This result indicates that electrostatic interaction between the sepiolite surface and the Cd(II) ions in the aqueous solution played a very important role in determining the adsorption capacity of sepiolite. The adsorption of Cd(II) ions onto sepiolite at pH 7 was reversible when desorption was undertaken at pH 3, but not when desorption was undertaken at pH 7.",

The influence of AlCl 3 concentration and pH values as well as the dosage of sorbent and their interactions on adsorption of phosphate was investigated. Therefore, Box–Behnken design coupled with response surface method was adopted to explore the empirical model for phosphate species removal. It was observed that there is an optimal point, C(AlCl 3 )(0.29 mol/l)–pH(6.12)–dosage(6.72 g/l), for the goal of maximizing phosphate species removal. The second-order polynomial model for phosphate reduction was given as Removal(%) = 96.43 +10.82X1 + 4.29X2 − 0.70X3 + 2.06X1X2 − 1.72X1X3 +8.24X2X3 − 13.10X1 2 − 17.26X2 2 − 1.72X3 2 . Contour pictures implied that the interaction between pH values and sorbent dosage was the strongest, followed by C(AlCl 3 ) versus dosage and C(AlCl 3 ) versus pH. The adsorption of phosphate data had a good agreement with the Freundlich isotherm equation at 313 and 323 K. Otherwise, Langmuir–Freundlich model described the best fitness at the temperature of 293, 298, and 303 K. The process of adsorption of phosphate on Al-eggshell fitted a pseudo-second-order kinetic equation, which indicates the exothermic reaction. In conclusion, the present work suggests Al-eggshell as an efficient and environmental friendly sorbent for phosphate species adsorption from aqueous solutions.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a new category of sulfone-modified chitosan derivatives as surface-selective adsorbents for the extraction of toxic Hg(II) metal has been synthesized in good yield. Sulfone-modified chitosan/5–20 based on variable loading of the corresponding phenacyl bromide (5, 10, 15, and 20% with respect to the original weight of the pure chitosan) was synthesized. The β-ketosulfone derivative, namely 1–(4-bromophenyl)-2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethanone, was first prepared by treatment of the corresponding phenacyl bromide with a sufficient amount of sodium benzene sulfinate; its chemical structure was confirmed by spectral analyses, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, and mass spectrometry. Then, sulfone-modified chitosan/5–20 derivatives were synthesized by the interaction of chitosan with a freshly prepared p-bromo-β-ketosulfone derivative in a mildly acidic aqueous solution using the solution-blending technique. Sulfone-modified chitosan/5–20 derivatives were identified and characterized using common characterization techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscope, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermal behaviour. A strong interaction was displayed between chitosan and its corresponding β-ketosulfones in powder X-ray diffraction, which was confirmed by significant 2θ shifts. Sulfone-modified chitosan/5–20 derivatives were detected as catalysts, which efficiently increased the thermal decomposition of pure chitosan. More particularly, the efficiency of sulfone-modified chitosan/5–20 derivatives for Hg(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), Al(III), Sr(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Zn(II), and Mn(II) detection and adsorption was also investigated using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The sulfone-modified chitosan/5 derivative exhibited the highest adsorption efficiency. The most effective quantitative adsorption onto the sulfone-modified chitosan/5 surface was detected at pH = 2. In addition to that, the adsorption isotherm showed that the adsorption capacity of sulfone-modified chitosan/5 for Hg(II) was 122.47 mg g −1 and that its adsorption isotherm was in agreement with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.",

The effects of adsorption time, the amount of sorbent and the concentration of metal ions on the removal percentage and sorption capacities were studied. The sorption percentage increased with the increasing phase contact time and zeolite amount. The adsorption mechanism was also discussed. The results revealed that Na–X–CS adsorbs Cu(II), Fe(III), Mn(II) and Zn(II) ions more effectively than zeolite Na–X and proved that modification by CS leads to an increase in the adsorption efficiency of the zeolites.",

In this work, we report polysulfone, poly(lactic acid), and polysulfone/poly(lactic acid) nanoporous fibrous mats prepared by one-step electrospinning process used as oil sorbents for oil–water separation. The morphology, porous structure, oleophilicity and hydrophobicity, oil sorption capacity, and oil retention of these nanoporous fibrous mats are investigated in detail. It is noticeable that the motor oil and linseed oil sorption capacity of polysulfone and polysulfone/poly(lactic acid) fibrous mats have little difference, but the motor oil sorption capacity (147.8 g g−1) of polysulfone is approximately 2.95 times as much as that (50.1 g g−1) of poly(lactic acid). The linseed oil sorption capacity (131.3 g g−1) is approximately 3.74 times than that (34.6 g g−1) of poly(lactic acid). Besides, they all exhibit quick oil sorption speed and high buoyancy. It is suggested that polysulfone and polysulfone/poly(lactic acid) nanoporous fibrous mats have a better oil sorption capacity than poly(lactic acid) nanoporous fibrous mat, which is contributed to volume expansion, highly micrometer porous structure among fibers, and specific surface area of fiber.",

The environmental mobility of this contaminant is mainly governed by its retention in soil. The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of humic acid (HA), an organic matter (OM) surrogate, to the sorption of FQs in natural soils. Sorption of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was studied in two completely different Spanish agricultural soils with similar pH. The soils tested were amended with different concentrations of HAs (0%, 1%, 3% and 5%; wt/wt). The results showed that addition of HA to the soil samples increased the magnitude of sorption and changed the sorption behaviour. However, the effect was only apparent at 3–5% HA content and its extent was dependent on both the sorbent and the sorbate. At soil pH around 7.5, when zwitterionic species predominate in the solution, sorption of FQs onto the soil seems to be governed by OM content, which provides a source of available sites for cation-exchange mechanisms.",

Thus, the adsorption mechanism was confirmed also by Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction analysis, and it is found to be through the interaction of creatinine by hydrogen bonding on two types of sites on zeolites. Pseudo-second-order equation described well the adsorption kinetics data. Equilibrium isotherms were determined by Fowler–Guggenheim model.

The results show that with time and dosage of steel slag increased, the adsorption capacity of phenanthrene and naphthalene increased and gradually became balanced, but pH had no obvious effect on the adsorption of phenanthrene and naphthalene. The Langmuir isotherm model best describes the phenanthrene and naphthalene removal by the steel slag, which shows the adsorption occurring in a monolayer.

Results showed that the adsorption of phosphorus in the presence of Fe 3+ and Al 3+ was higher than that in the absence of these two cations probably due to the adsorption of phosphorus-bearing anions on opposite charges of these cations. Also, increase in contact time tended phosphorus adsorption to be increased. The addition of base and acid treatments caused an increase and a decrease, respectively, on phosphorus adsorption. The order of effectiveness of treatments on the values of phosphorus adsorption was as follows: acid/base treatment &gt;sorbent to sorbate ratio &gt; modification with aluminium (Al)/iron (Fe) &gt;contact time &gt;phosphorus concentration.

The experiment results showed that the removal property of the composite materials on azo dyes is obviously better than that on non-azo dyes. The varying removal efficiencies of dyes depend on the different degradation mechanisms. Azo dyes removal by nZVI/PANI/APT was mainly due to the reductive cleavage of the N = N of nZVI, while non-azo dyes removal mainly contributes to the adsorption of PANI/APT.

    "abstract": "Adsorption characteristics of the antibiotic meropenem on a novel magnetic material synthesized by surface coating cobalt iron oxide (CFO) with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were systematically investigated. The AuNPs can enhance material adsorption capacity by having high affinity towards the thioether and amine groups in the meropenem structure. Au coverage on the CFO surface decreased the saturation magnetization from 55.8 emu/g to 48.8 emu/g, still allowing synthesized CFO@Au nanomaterials to be magnetically recoverable. The CFO@Au nanomaterials showed enhanced adsorption capacity of 25.5 mg/g at optimum conditions of pH 4.0 adsorption time 120 min, and adsorbent mass 0.05 g. Adsorption equilibrium was in accordance with a monolayer Langmuir isotherm, while the adsorption kinetics followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and intraparticle diffusion models. This work provides a simple method to prepare a magnetic composite material with high adsorption efficiency for meropenem and probably other thioether-containing substances.",

    "abstract": "Pore structure and methane adsorption of coal reservoir are closely correlated to the coalbed gas occurrence and outburst. Full-scale pore structure and its fractal heterogeneity of coal samples were quantitatively characterized using low-pressure N 2 gas adsorption (LP-N 2 GA) and high-pressure mercury intrusion porosimetry (HP-MIP). Fractal pore structure and adsorption capacities between outburst and nonoutburst coals were compared, and their geological significance to gas occurrence and outburst was discussed. The results show that pore volume (PV) is mainly contributed by macropores (&gt;1000 nm) and mesopores (100–1000 nm), while specific surface area (SSA) is dominated by micropores (&lt;10 nm) and transition pores (10–100 nm). On average, the PV and SSA of outburst coal samples are 4.56 times and 5.77 times those of nonoutburst coal samples, respectively, which provide sufficient place for gas adsorption and storage. The pore shape is dominated by semiclosed pores in the nonoutburst coal, whereas open pores and inkbottle pores are prevailing in the outburst coal. The pore size is widely distributed in the outburst coal, in which not only micropores are dominant, but also, transition pores and mesopores are developed to a certain extent. Based on the data from HP-MIP and LP-N 2 GA, pore spatial structure and surface are of fractal characteristics with fractal dimensions [Formula: see text] (2.81–2.97) and [Formula: see text] (2.50–2.73) calculated by Menger model and Frenkel–Halsey–Hill (FHH) model, respectively. The pore structure in the outburst coal is more heterogeneous as its [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are generally larger than those of the nonoutburst coal. The maximum methane adsorption capacities ([Formula: see text]: 15.34–20.86 cm 3 /g) of the outburst coal are larger than those of the nonoutburst coal ([Formula: see text]: 9.97–13.51cm 3 /g). The adsorptivity of coal samples is governed by the micropores, transition pores, and [Formula: see text] because they are positively correlated with the SSA. The outburst coal belongs to tectonically deformed coal (TDC) characterized by weak strength, rich microporosity, complex pore structure, strong adsorption capacity, but poor pore connectivity because of inkbottle pores. Therefore, the area of TDC is at high risk for gas outburst as there is a high-pressure gas sealing zone with abundant gas enrichment but limited gas migration and extraction.",

It was proposed that the aforementioned t-curve be obtained from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at 77 K on a macroporous carbon black by fitting its multilayer part to the calibrated t-curve for nitrogen adsorbed at 77 K on a macroporous silica. To date, the Harkins–Jura or Halsey t-curves have been used to describe the pressure-dependence of the film thickness. This appears to be inaccurate, especially in the range of low relative pressures. It was shown that this inaccuracy makes the pore-size analysis questionable.

    "abstract": "A series of adsorption studies were carried out on a glycidyl methacrylate-modified cellulose material functionalised with imidazole (cellulose–g-GMA-imidazole) to assess its capacity towards the removal of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution. The study sought to establish the effect of a number of parameters on the removal of Pb(II) ions from solution by the cellulose–g-GMA-imidazole. The effect of initial metal concentration, contact time and solution temperature on the removal of Pb(II) ions from solution by the cellulose–g-GMA-imidazole was assessed. Cellulose–g-GMA-imidazole sorbent showed an uptake of ca. 72 mg/g of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution at 23°C. The adsorption process is best described by the Langmuir adsorption model and the thermodynamics of the process suggest that the binding process is exothermic. The kinetics of the adsorption process indicated that the uptake of Pb(II) ions occurred within 40 min and that pseudo-second-order kinetics best describe the overall adsorption process.",

Two kinds of moisture were considered, viz. pre-adsorbed on the AC or present as steam in the gaseous phase, at various relative humidities ranging from 30% to 75%. It is shown that the adsorption of the VOCs depends on the kind of moisture. If the latter is pre-adsorbed, water is just displaced by the VOCs (overshoot). The adsorption capacities of the AC remain unchanged and only some minor changes in the shape of the breakthrough front, corresponding to hindered diffusion, may sometimes occur. In contrast, the simultaneous adsorption of steam and VOC leads to competition between water and the chlorinated compound, with direct consequences on the adsorption kinetics and capacities of the AC. However, the decrease of the water-induced adsorption performances depends strongly on the AC and the VOC (through different VOC/AC and water/VOC interactions), and on the concentration of the VOC.",

The modifications involved the following: (i) oxidation, to introduce oxygen-containing functional groups, and (ii) treatment with aqueous ammonia, to introduce basic nitrogen functional groups. The pristine materials, namely, those after surface modifications and those after adsorption, were characterized by the adsorption of nitrogen, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thermal analyses. We conducted batch experiments to study the effect of initial concentration, pH and temperature on the removal of Pb 2+ . Our experiments showed that adsorption was pH dependent, and any rise in temperature results in increased adsorption, which indicates the endothermic nature of the process. Typical isotherm models were fitted to describe the data. In addition, during adsorption, homogeneous accumulation of lead ions on the carbonaceous surface was observed. The higher adsorption capacity of chemically oxidized mesoporous carbon for lead was mainly due to the presence of functional groups of oxygen and nitrogen on the surfaces of activated carbon, which presumably react with the metal ions to form salt or complexes that deposit on the carbon surface.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a model for analyzing activated carbon micropore structures based on graphene sheet walls of finite thickness and extent. This is a two-dimensional modification of the widely used infinite slit pore model that assumes graphite-like infinitely extended pore walls. The proposed model has two versions: (1) a strip pore constructed with graphene strip walls that have a finite length L in the x-direction and are infinite in the y-direction. Strip pores are open on both sides in the x-direction; (2) a channel pore, i.e. a strip pore partially closed along one edge by a perpendicularly orientated graphene wall. This more realistic model allows pore termination via both physical pore entrances and pore blockage. The model consequently introduces heterogeneity of the adsorption potential that is reduced near pore entrances and enhanced near the corners of pore walls. These energetically heterogeneous structures fill with adsorbate more gradually than homogeneous pores of the same width. As a result, the calculated adsorption isotherms are smoother and less steep for the finite versus the infinite pore model. In the application of this model for carbon characterization, it is necessary to make an assumption about the pore length. In this work, we made this assumption based on high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results. We find the agreement between the experiment and the model significantly better for the finite than for the infinite pore model.",

Results of X-ray diffraction showed that nanocrystallines CeO2 and ZnO phases on the AC support were formed. Removal efficiency of the prepared samples was investigated through adsorption, photodegradation, and wet peroxide oxidation processes using Maxilon Red basic dye (MR). Accordingly, the prepared samples exhibited different removal behaviors towards MR dye depending on the total surface area and type of catalyst; for example, the maximum removal of MR dye was found in the following orders: AC > ZnO-AC > CeO2-AC, CeO2-AC > ZnO-AC > AC, and AC > CeO2-AC > ZnO-AC via adsorption, photodegradation, and catalytic oxidation with H2O2, respectively. It was found that photodegradation process was the best when compared with the other methods. The photocatalytic activity of CeO2-AC catalyst was the highest. The reusability tests showed that CeO2-AC exhibited superior photocatalytic performance and stability till the fourth run as compared to photocatalytic activity of ZnO-AC which decreased from 90% to 78% in the fourth run. Therefore, the prepared CeO2-AC catalyst is more effective than ZnO-AC as confirmed by reusability tests.",

The resulting activated carbons showed a well-developed porous structure with specific surface area in the range of 730–3870 m2 g−1, total pore volume in the range of 0.44–2.07 cm3 g−1 and micropore volume in the range of 0.30–1.59 cm3 g−1. Importantly, these structural parameters can be changed by varying the amount of KOH used for the activation. These carbons showed extremely good adsorption properties towards benzene and methane at 20°C. The best uptakes for benzene and methane (19.6 and 1.68 mmol g−1, respectively) were obtained for the carbon activated using the KOH/C ratio of 4. These values correspond to the gravimetric adsorptions of 1.53 g/g and 27 mg/g, respectively. Benzene adsorption was analyzed using the Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) equation. The micropore volume calculated using the DR equation based on benzene adsorption corresponds well with the micropore volume calculated from nitrogen adsorption by the αs comparative method. The high values of the structural parameters and the resulting high benzene and methane uptakes render the obtained activated carbons as prospective materials for use in environmental remediation and energy-related applications such as volatile organic compound adsorption and methane storage.",

Several models have been proposed for prediction of adsorption equilibrium and all models depend on parameters whose values must be estimated from available experimental data. Although linear parameter estimation procedures can be used for model fitting, through transformation of available experimental data and model parameters, non-linear parameter estimation procedures lead to more reliable results and allow for direct comparison of results obtained with different adsorption equilibrium models. The main objective of this work is to present and compare different non-linear procedures for parameter estimation of adsorption equilibrium models, based on theoretical arguments and also on the numerical estimation of adsorption equilibrium parameters, using available experimental data for adsorption of methylene blue onto activated carbon. The results obtained indicate that the best parameter estimation procedure is the one that relies on available equilibrium concentrations in the bulk phase as a function of the fluid volume, adsorbent mass and initial concentrations in the bulk phase, without transformation of measured experimental values and model parameters. Besides, it is shown that parameter estimates should be obtained through proper minimization of weighted least-squares objective function, in accordance with maximum likelihood procedures.",

Nitric acid concentration, ionic strength, and solid-to-liquid (S/L) ratio were taken into consideration as the influencing factors on the desorption performance. The findings showed that higher desorption efficiency had no necessary connection with the higher concentration of nitric acid, and the highest desorption efficiency was realized for P-EDA and P-DETA at 0.10 mmol/L, and for P-TETA and P-TEPA at 0.25 mmol/L, in the nitric acid concentration range of 0.01–2.00 mmol/L studied. In addition, Ionic strength showed obvious influence on the desorption efficiency, and higher ionic strength resulted in significant lower desorption efficiency. Different S/L ratios studied showed almost no differences on the desorption efficiency. The copper ion desorption kinetics, best described by the Elovich model, was discovered to be very fast that more than 85% of the desorption efficiency was attained within 2 min. A slight decrease in Cu ion adsorption capacity was found through ten cycles of adsorption-desorption-regeneration for all the four adsorbents.",

The adsorption isotherm data were obtained experimentally by volumetric method at room temperature (30 °C) in the pressure range of 0–10 bar. The isotherms were used to determine the selectivity of the absorbents for CO 2 /CH 4 . The single isotherm data showed AC had the highest adsorption capacity for both CO 2 and CH 4 ; however, the CO 2 /CH 4 ideal selectivity of AC was less than that of the zeolitic materials. These results suggest that AC is a suitable material for adsorption of both CO 2 and CH 4 from flue gas, whereas it would not be suitable for selective separation of CO 2 from CH 4 . The zeolitic materials, namely, ZSM-5, Silicalite-1 and SAPO-34, had good adsorption capacity for CO 2 against CH 4 . The molecular sieving property of SAPO-34 showed higher CO 2 selectivity than that of ZSM-5 and Silicalite-1. Further investigations were conducted on SAPO-34 for binary mixtures of CO 2 –CH 4 with different compositions at various total pressures. The results showed that strong adsorption of CO 2 caused significant decrease in CH 4 adsorption, and therefore, the real selectivity of CO 2 /CH 4 was improved more than the ideal selectivity. Real selectivity of CO 2 /CH 4 at 2.5 bar pressure for an equimolar mixture was 20% more than the ideal selectivity and by increasing total pressure up to 4.5 bar its value improved up to 70% more than the ideal selectivity.",

Dummy template strategy is useful when templates like salicylic acid exhibit intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The synthesized adsorbents were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron micrograph (SEM). The adsorption capacity of the adsorbents was investigated as a function of time, concentration of analyte and mass of adsorbent employed and was found to be 500.96 µmol g −1 for the chitosan-based 4-hydroxy benzoic acid molecularly imprinted polymer (4HBACTSMIP), 221.2 µmol g −1 for the salicylic acid MIP (SACTSMIP), 220 µmol g −1 for the non-imprinted polymer (NIP), 149.7 µmol g −1 for chitosan (CTS) and 60.63 µmol g −1 for the granular activated carbon (GAC). The specific binding capacity of 4HBACTSMIP for salicylic acid was found to be 280.96 µmol g −1 . The change in the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the template–monomer complexes formed between the templates and the functional monomer was computed using density functional theory (DFT) to interpret the nature of the interactions between them and to compare their stabilities. A systematic investigation of the molecular recognition abilities of the synthesized adsorbents was carried out using Freundlich (F) adsorption isotherm model. The binding parameters obtained from the F model demonstrate that 4HBACTSMIP exhibited higher specific molecular recognition ability towards salicylic acid.

The effects of various independent parameters, contact time, initial Bisphenol-A concentration, temperature, pH, and Eucalyptus camaldulensis bark/magnetite composite dosage on adsorption were investigated. It was found that the adsorption capacity of Eucalyptus camaldulensis bark/magnetite composite increases with the increasing of Bisphenol-A concentration, temperature, and decreasing dosage of Eucalyptus camaldulensis bark/magnetite composite. The adsorption capacity was found to be 290.6 mg/g with 0.1 g Eucalyptus camaldulensis bark/magnetite composite at pH 7 and 50℃. The Freundlich isotherm model described the adsorption process better (R2 = 0.998) than the Langmuir, Dubinin–Radushkevich, Jovanovic, and Vieth–Sladek isotherm models. According to multiple linear regression analysis, Eucalyptus camaldulensis bark/magnetite composite dosage is the most effective parameter on adsorption capacity at equilibrium and independent variables accounted for 79.4% of the total variability of equilibrium adsorption capacity of Eucalyptus camaldulensis bark/magnetite composite.",

In this work, we conducted methane adsorption experiments at pressures up to 30 MPa and different temperatures on shale samples collected from Longmaxi formation in Sichuan Basin, China. Based on the definition of IHA and Langmuir adsorption model, we proposed a new method to analyze the IHA of methane on shale under four conditions. The calculated results show that the commonly used Clausius–Clapeyron equation overestimates the true isosteric heat of shale, especially under high pressure. IHA under four conditions yield a fixed order as q st,i-va &gt; q st,r-va &gt; q st,i+va &gt; q st,r+va , indicating both the real gas behavior and the adsorbed-phase volume have a negative influence on it, and the effect of adsorbed-phase volume is dominant. Moreover, IHA at zero coverage ([Formula: see text]) in Henry region determined by linear fitting can be regarded as a maximum value in the above four cases, which is independent of pressure and temperature. Therefore, [Formula: see text] can be used as a unique descriptor to evaluate the adsorption affinity of the shale. This work modified the method to obtain the true IHA of supercritical methane on shale more accurately, which lays the foundation for future investigations of the thermodynamics and heat transfer characteristics of the interaction between high pressure methane and shale.",

Adsorption technology is a cost-effective technology for phosphate removal in water for the purpose. Thus, in this study, a novel Fe–Mn–La tri-metal composite sorbent was developed, and then evaluated for phosphate removal. The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity could be approached to 61.80 mg g −1 at 25°C under pH of 6.03. Adsorption of phosphate by Fe–Mn–La tri-metal composite adsorbent fitted better by pseudo-second-order kinetic equation and Langmuir model, which suggested that the adsorption process was surface chemical reactions and mainly in a monolayer coverage manner. The thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption reaction was an endothermic process. The phosphate removal gradually decreased with the increasing of pH from 3.02 to 11.00. The sequence of coexisting anions competing with phosphates was that CO 3 2− &gt; Cl − &gt; SO 4 2− &gt; NO 3 − . Dissolved organic matter, fulvic acid as a representative, would also decrease adsorption capacities of phosphate by Fe–Mn–La tri-metal composite adsorbents. Adsorption capacity would be decreased with increasing addition of adsorbents, while removal efficiency would be increased in this process. The Fe–Mn–La tri-metal composite adsorbent showed a good reusability when applied to removal of dissolved phosphate from aqueous solutions. The Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicated that some hydroxyl groups (–OH) on the surface of adsorbent were replaced by the adsorbed PO 4 3− , HPO 4 2− , or H 2 PO 4 − . Aggregative results showed that the novel Fe–Mn–La tri-mental composite sorbent is a very promising adsorbent for the removal of phosphate from aqueous solutions.",

The chemical modification of raw GMH was done by concentrated H 2 SO 4 to increase the porosity and heterogeneity on the surface. The comparative investigations of physicochemical properties of synthesized adsorbents were examined by point of zero charge (pH pzc ), BET surface area, SEM-EDX, FTIR, and XRD analyses. The results revealed that CT-GMH had around three times higher surface area and more porous structure as compared to TT-GMH. The adsorption experiments were executed in batch mode to examine the impact of parameters governing the adsorption process. For Cr(VI) solution of 25 mg/L, adsorbent dose of 4 g/L, temperature of 25[Formula: see text], and shaking speed of 150 RPM, the maximum removal for TT-GMH was attained at pH 1 and contact time 150 min, while for CT-GMH, maximum removal was attained at pH 2 and contact time 120 min. The experimental results fitted to the rate kinetic equations showed that for both TT-GMH and CT-GMH, adsorbents followed the quasi-second-order kinetic model during the adsorption process. Further, results revealed that the adsorption process was endothermic and Sips isotherm model was followed for both TT-GMH and CT-GMH. Based on the Sips isotherm, maximum uptake capacity for TT-GMH and CT-GMH was noted to be 16 and 22.21 mg/g, respectively. Among the tested mass transfer models, liquid film diffusion model was followed during the adsorption process of both the adsorbents.

The morphological, elemental, and chemical properties of the extracted ferrous fractions were analyzed. In order to achieve surface-modified ferrospheres, the extracted ferrospheres were treated with concentrated HCl followed by sonication. The instrumental analysis reported the ferrous composition is around 16% by weight and belongs to class F. The toxicity of CFA was determined on normal human lung (BEAS-2B) cells using MTS assay. The results showed that CFA’s induced cell toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. The ferrous particles were spherically shaped with various sizes ranging from 200 nm to 7000 nm. It was crystalline in nature and is a mixture of hematite and magnetite. The particles were found to be associated with alumina, silica, oxygen, and traces of Ca, Mg, Ti, and C. The surface-modified ferrospheres were used for the remediation of Azure A dye by batch adsorption study. The removal percentage of dye was 25.03%, within 30 minutes at neutral pH, i.e., 7.2. The surface-modified ferrospheres show potential as an alternate, more economical, and reusable adsorbent for the remediation of Azure A dye in the industries or in common effluent treatment plants. Moreover, the recovery of surface-modified ferrospheres using an external magnet and the reuse of the particles make the material much economical for dye removal at an industrial scale.",

    "abstract": "A hybrid composite based on metal-organic framework (MOF) was chemically fabricated by embedding the magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles within amino-functionalized porous La-MOF (MOF/NH 2 ) to produce a highly efficient and reusable composite of MOF/NH 2 /Fe 3 O 4 . Different proper techniques were used for the characterization of surface morphology and chemical arrangement of the prepared MOF/NH 2 /Fe 3 O 4 composite. The characterization results using various techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller analysis (BET), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) approved the successful fabrication of MOF with amino arms on its surface besides the well magnetization using magnetic nanoparticles. The MOF/NH 2 /Fe 3 O 4 composite showed enhanced adsorption capacity (618 mg/g) toward methyl orange (MO) anionic dye which is higher than many commercial reported adsorbents due to the presence of many types of adsorption sites (NH 2 groups and lanthanum sites), large surface area of MOF, and the synergetic effect of magnetic nanoparticles. Moreover, the MOF/NH 2 /Fe 3 O 4 composite showed selective adsorption of MO dye from dye mixtures owing to the electrostatic attraction. Also, the MOF/NH 2 /Fe 3 O 4 composite retained over 90% of its efficiency for the dye removal even after six successive cycles. So, the present study provided a practical strategy for the design of functional MOF hybrid composites. Furthermore, due to the adaptability of its architectural form, it is a potential adsorbent material for industrial wastewater treatment uses.",

    "abstract": "The usage of dyes has been tremendously augmented due to industrialization and human’s intrinsic fascination with colors. Owing to their excessive usage in industries like textiles, food, cosmetics, paints, printing etc., it is indisputably a contributing factor in aquatic pollution. Dyes effluents have emerged as a burgeoning challenge. Owing to issues such as toxicity, mutagenicity, and disturbed photosynthesis associated with dye contamination, it is crucial to look for an explication to deal with this challenge. Polypyrrole-based biocomposites have been reported as good adsorbents for textile wastewater treatment. In the last decade, numerous studies have stated the effective removal of dyes via Polypyrrole-based biocomposites. This review concentrates on the implication of different Polypyrrole-based biocomposites for decontamination of dyes and synthesis methods, characteristics, and mechanism of dyes degradation by these biocomposites from wastewater.",

The results showed that Dowex m4195 had the highest performance of adsorption capacity for copper removal in both H+-form and Na+-form. Results for Lewatit TP260 and Chelex 100 revealed lower adsorption performance than results for Dowex m4195. The investigation of desorption from chelating resins was carried out, and it was found that 2 M ammonium hydroxide concentration provided the best desorption capacity of about 64.86% for the H+-form Dowex m4195 followed by 52.55% with 2 M sulfuric acid. Lewatit with 2 M hydrochloric acid gave the best desorption performance in Na+-form while Chelex 100 using hydrochloric at 1 M and 2 M provided similar results in terms of the H+-form and Na+-form. As aspects of the selective chelating resins for copper (II) ions in aqueous acidic solution generated from synthetic copper-citrate complexes from bioleaching of e-waste were considered, H+-form Dowex m4195 was a good performer in adsorption using ammonium hydroxide for the desorption. However, chelating resins used were subsequently reused for more than five cycles with an acidic and basic solution. It can be concluded from these results that selective chelating resins could be used as an alternative for the treatment of copper (II) ions contained in e-waste or application to other divalent metals in wastewater for sustainable water and adsorbent reuse as circular economy.",

    "abstract": "In order to explore the influence of coal deformation caused by temperature and desorption on seepage characteristics in the process of heat injection mining of coalbed methane, the permeability test, thermal expansion, and constant temperature adsorption desorption of coal samples under different temperature and stress states were carried out using the high temperature multifunctional triaxial test system, and the influence of thermal expansion and desorption deformation effect on coal permeability in the process of temperature increase is studied. The results show that (1) with the increase of temperature, the sensitivity of coal thermal expansion deformation to temperature decreases gradually. The thermal expansion deformation makes the coal matrix expand, and the seepage channel is squeezed and the permeability decreases. (2) The effect of thermal expansion deformation is related to the porosity of coal. When the porosity of coal is high, the thermal expansion deformation reduces the permeability; on the contrary, the inward expansion of thermal expansion deformation is limited, and the effect on permeability is weakened. (3) The desorption of coal cause matrix shrinkage. The higher the desorption amount, the more obvious the shrinkage and the higher the permeability. Increasing temperature promotes desorption deformation of coal and increases permeability. (4) In the process of increasing temperature, the change of coal permeability is affected by thermal expansion deformation and desorption deformation. With the increase of temperature, when the influence of thermal expansion deformation on coal permeability is dominant, the permeability decreases gradually, and when desorption deformation is dominant on coal permeability, the permeability increases gradually. (5) With the increase of axial pressure, confining pressure, and pore pressure, the decrease of coal porosity is smaller. When the temperature increases, the temperature corresponding to the minimum permeability point is smaller. The research conclusion provides a basis for the technology of heat injection mining coalbed methane.",

The maximum Cr (VI) removal was obtained using an H 3 PO 4 -modified Teff straw biosorbent of 92.5% with 2 M concentration of the modifying agent, 110°C, and 4 h. Similarly, maximum Cr (VI) removal using KOH-modified Teff straw biosorbent of 95.2% was obtained with 1.5 M activating agent concentration, 105°C activation temperature, and 3.5 h activation time. In addition, the effects of adsorption parameters (viz., biosorbent dosage, temperature, initial concentration of Cr (VI), and contact time) were investigated. The maximum removal efficiency was attained at 2 g of biosorbent dosage, 4 h contact, 75 mg/L of initial Cr (VI) concentration, and 25°C sorption temperature. In addition, isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies for Cr (VI) biosorption were studied. The experimental adsorption data were well fitted with the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model with higher correlation coefficient in both untreated and chemically modified Teff straw biosorbent. The investigated thermodynamic parameters ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text]) confirmed that Cr (VI) metal ions’ adsorption process onto Teff straw biosorbent was spontaneous and endothermic.",

In successive batch experiments, the citric acid-treated peels CPWM and CPWC have shown more promising adsorption performance than their raw and untreated peel counterparts due to the availability of additional adsorption active binding sites evidenced through FT-IR and SEM characterizations. In the Langmuir and Temkin models, the correlation coefficients ([Formula: see text]) for the adsorptive removal of CGR on CPWM, PWM, CPWC, and PWC are very close to unity, 0.99 for each case of adsorption performance. Furthermore, the [Formula: see text] nonlinear statistical results for the elimination of CGR on citric acid-treated adsorbents (CPWM and CPWC) are 8.3 and 7.95 mg/g whereas for their unmodified forms (PWM and PWC) are 2.23 and 4.32 mg/g, respectively, reflecting homogenous and monolayer adsorption mechanism. The greater values of [Formula: see text] 1.4 and 1.3 J/mole, for adsorptive removal of dye on CPWM and CPWC, respectively, as compared to their unmodified forms PWM and PWC which are 0.53 and 0.55 J/mole, respectively, indicate the stronger adsorbate-adsorbent associations. The mechanism follows the pseudo second order in the better mode, while thermodynamic statics for ΔH 0, ΔG 0 , ΔS 0 , and ΔE 0 , indicate spontaneous and exothermic behavior of adsorption. This study tends to suggest that citric acid-modified adsorbents CPWM and CPWC may indeed be exploited efficiently to eliminate Congo red dye from wastewater.",

The adsorption capability of the synthesized Zn-adeninate bio-MOF was confirmed by its notable surface area of 52.62 m 2 g −1 and total pore volume of 0.183 cm 3 g −1 . The bio-MOF adsorption profiles of anionic direct red 81 (DR-81) and cationic methylene blue (MB) dyes were investigated under different operating parameters. The optimum dosages of Zn-adeninate bio-MOF were 0.5 g L −1 and 1 g L −1 for MB and DR-81 decolorization, respectively. The pH PZC of Zn-adeninate bio-MOF was 7.2, and maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was 132.15 mg g –1 for MB, which decreased to 82.54 mg g –1 for DR-81 dye. Thermodynamic data indicated the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the decolorization processes. Additionally, the adsorption processes were in agreement with the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The synthesized Zn-adeninate bio-MOF could be reused several times with high decolorization ability. These findings demonstrated that the synthesized Zn bio-MOF is an effective and promising adsorbent material for the removal of both cationic and anionic dyes from polluted water.",

Various characterization methods such as SEM-EDS, BET, XPS, and FT-IR were used to study the structure of the materials, and the adsorption properties of Pb(II) in the materials were analyzed using adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm experiments. The results showed that SN had a specific surface area of 47.05 m 2 /g, which was significantly higher than the 7.56 m 2 /g of NZVI, and the surface passivation was reduced.

The mechanism of Pb(II) removal by SN involved the synergistic effect of electrostatic adsorption, redox reaction, ion exchange, and coprecipitation. Notably, even after 90 days of aging, the removal rate of Pb(II) by SN remained high at 95.39%, demonstrating good reactivity.

When plotted against the percentage nitrogen content of these cottons, variations in the effective receptor site density and the inverse of the adsorbed molecules anchorage number allowed the adsorption process to be described topographically in terms of the parallel or perpendicular adsorption of the dye molecule on to the adsorbent surface. The presence of ionic or van der Waals forces in such adsorption was also considered. The values of the model parameters were found to be related to the magnitude of the steric hindrance arising from the anchorage geometry of the dye molecule. Where the site density was high, a form of dimerization of the dye molecules was favoured. The best conditions for obtaining a high adsorption capacity, necessary for textile dyeing and wastewater depollution, were considered. Through the use of the half-saturation capacity, c 1/2 , it was possible to determine the change in the adsorption energy when the receptor site spacing was decreased and to relate such variation to the rate of steric hindrance, τ.",

It was found that the effectiveness of bentonites towards MBD removal was in the following order: thermal-bentonite &gt; SDS-bentonite &gt; natural bentonite. X-Ray diffraction analysis showed that an increase in the microscopic bentonite platelets on treatment with SDS was the reason behind the higher uptake of MBD. An increase in sorbent concentration or initial pH value of the solutions resulted in a greater removal of MBD from the solution. An increase in temperature led to an increase in MBD uptake by the bentonites studied in this work. The Freundlich isotherm model was employed and found to represent the experimental data well.",

The maximum adsorption capacities of the adsorbents investigated towards Cu(II) ions were in the 1.77–9.35 mg/g range. Isotherms were used to obtain the corresponding thermodynamic parameters. Almost complete Cu(II) ion desorption was achieved using 0.1 M mineral acid solutions. The regenerated adsorbents could be used in several adsorption/desorption cycles.",

In order to increase the positive charge on the surface, sepiolite was modified in the present studies by treatment with dodecylethyldimethylammonium (DEDMA) bromide. After such modification, it was found that the maximum amount of nitrate ion adsorbed occurred at a pH value of 2.0. The chemical composition of natural sepiolite was determined by EDX methods and surface characterization of both natural and modified sepiolite samples was undertaken using FT-IR spectroscopic techniques. The adsorption of nitrate ions onto these adsorbents was determined by ion chromatography. The kinetic parameters of the adsorption process were calculated and it was shown that the reaction kinetic data could be fitted using the pseudo-second-order rate model. The calculated results indicate that both natural and surfactant-modified sepiolite are effective sorbents for the removal of anionic contaminants; however, the surfactant-modified sepiolite (453 mmol/kg) was more effective than the unmodified sepiolite (408 mmol/kg) in this respect.

In particular, the α S -plot method can be used for the characterisation of a porous material when the corresponding standard isotherm has been determined on a well-defined non-porous solid of similar surface structure. The interpretation of α S -plots is based on established principles underlying the mechanisms of physisorption: monolayer–multilayer adsorption, preferential filling of narrow micropores (ultramicropores), monolayer adsorption followed by the filling of wider micropores (supermicropores) and capillary condensation in mesopores. Various distinctive features of α S -plots allow these different processes to be identified and the internal and external areas and effective pore volumes to be quantified. The validity of BET-nitrogen areas can be checked and also, by using probe molecules of different sizes, one can obtain a semi-quantitative evaluation of the micropore-size distribution. The comparison plot is a simple way of comparing the shapes of two related isotherms. This approach has been found useful for investigating textural changes such as those accompanying the thermal decomposition of hydroxides or the activation of carbons.",

The results obtained showed that Cd(II) and Zn(II) ions were adsorbed quantitatively onto modified clinoptilolite over the respective pH ranges of 4.0–5.4 and 3.3–4.5.

The maximum sorption of Pb(II) ions onto the adsorbent surface was achieved from de-ionized water. It was found that the sorption data could be fitted by the Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherms. Values of 1/n = 0.71 ± 0.003 and of A = 15.4 ± 6.86 mmol/g were estimated from the Freundlich isotherm while the D–R isotherm gave β = −0.00478 ± 0.00022 mol2/kJ2, Xm = 23.26 ± 0.10 × 05−2 mmol/g and E = 10.23 ± 0.23 kJ/mol. The influence of temperature on the sorption process over the temperature range 283–323 K under optimized conditions yielded ΔH0 = 24.87 ± 0.44 kJ/mol, ΔS0 = 95.8 ± 1.5 J/(mol K) and ΔG0 = −3.6 ± 0.02 kJ/mol at 298 K. These values demonstrate the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the sorption process. The addition of chloride, calcium or zinc ions to the system enhanced the sorption of Pb(II) ions whereas the corresponding addition of sulphate, cadmium, copper(II) or chromium(III) ions tended to reduce the extent of sorption.",

The diffusion studies were focused on methane whereas the adsorption simulations were performed from methane up to pentane. The results obtained showed that an increase in the number of cations in the structure (exchange of univalent sodium ions by divalent calcium ions) led to an increase in the adsorption of linear alkanes at low and medium pressure, but caused a decrease in adsorption at the highest pressures. An increase in the amount of cations favours molecular attraction and hence results in lower mobility. At higher cation loading the ions block the windows interconnecting the LTA cages, leading to a further decrease in diffusion. Methane self-diffusion coefficients obtained from our simulations were twice as high for the Linde Type 5A zeolite as for the Linde Type 4A zeolite. These results are consistent with previous experimental studies and provide a molecular picture of the influence of the zeolite type, the amount of cations contained and their location in the structure.",

The study showed that, at a phenol concentration of 100 mg/ℓ, the percentage removal of phenol was 95.69% at an optimum dosage of 7 g/ℓ fly ash. The effect of the initial phenol concentration indicated that the percentage phenol removal increased with increasing phenol concentration, being a maximum (98.08%) at a phenol concentration of 700 mg/ℓ. Further increase in phenol concentration (1000 mg/ℓ) resulted in a slight decrease in phenol removal. The adsorption of phenol also varied with the pH and was found to be a maximum at a pH value of 8. Adsorption equilibrium studies indicated that an equilibrium time of 2 h was necessary for the maximum removal of phenol. Isotherm studies showed that the adsorption of phenol onto fly ash was best described by the Langmuir isotherm relative to the Freundlich isotherm. Accordingly, the Langmuir adsorption coefficients, i.e. the maximum adsorption capacity (q 0 ) and the Langmuir adsorption constant (K L ) were evaluated and found to be 142.86 mg/g and 0.0199 ℓ/g, respectively.

Some studies on the removal of furfural by adsorption onto hydrophobic polymeric resins (XAD-4 and XAD-7), activated carbon and the nanoporous material MCM-48 have been published, but none provides information on the adsorption of furfural onto clays. In the present work, we have studied the efficiency of sodium bentonite modified with the cationic surfactant cethyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in the adsorption of furfural. The structures of both natural and modified bentonites have been examined using XRD and FT-IR analyses. Adsorption studies were performed in a batch system, with the effects of various experimental parameters such as the contact time, the organobentonite concentration, pH, the initial furfural concentration and the temperature being evaluated. Kinetic results showed that furfural could be removed by CTAB–bentonite after contact for 6 h, with the adsorption process being well described by the pseudo-second-order reaction model. Furfural sorption onto CTAB–bentonite was characterized by a linear isotherm, with the adsorption capacity towards furfural being reduced by increasing temperature. A comparison of furfural adsorption capacities revealed that the capacities decreased in the following order: CTAB–bentonite &gt; XAD-4 &gt; XAD-7.",

    "abstract": "The suitability and applicability of using Methylene Blue (MB), a cationic dye, for cation-exchange capacity (CEC) and specific surface area (SSA) determinations has been studied extensively. Although many workers have reported satisfactory results between the CEC determined by the MB method and other methods, large discrepancies among CEC values determined by different methods are also found in the literature. The work reported herein was focused at elucidating the interlayer configuration of adsorbed/intercalated MB in SAz-1, a high-charge montmorillonite, using MB adsorption, exchangeable cation desorption, counterion (Cl − ) adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses. A complete balance between the amount of MB cation adsorbed and that of exchangeable cations desorbed at a 1:1 charge ratio for MB uptake by SAz-1 indicated that cation-exchange was the most important mechanism in this case together with supplementary hydrogen bonding. The adsorbed MB molecules associated into dimers and were orientated in the interlayer in a nearly vertical configuration, with the sulphur atom keyed onto the surface. In a vertical orientation, the MB dimer occupies a projected area of 120–130 Å 2 , similar to the surface area of 130 Å 2 previously assumed from SSA determinations for the horizontally aligned MB molecule. Hence, it is the charge density rather than the horizontal configuration of the MB molecules that controls the MB adsorption capacity. As such, the CEC determination of swelling clays using the MB adsorption method is justified. However, SSA determination by the MB method is correct only if the charge density is less than the projected area of 120–130 Å 2 for an MB dimer. This suggests that the previous assumption of the adsorption of a horizontally orientated MB molecule onto the surface of clay minerals is questionable.",

    "abstract": "In this study, trifluoromethane (R-23) has been adsorbed on three zeolites, namely 5A, LSX and 13X, and their adsorption isotherms have been measured at approximately 298 and 323 K using a gravimetric microbalance. All cases belong to the adsorption Type II (one of the six IUPAC classifications), and the adsorption (and desorption) processes are reversible. Three different adsorption models [original Langmuir, multi-site Langmuir and BET equations] have been adopted to analyze the data, with a particular interest in calculating the heat of adsorption (–ΔH), which was found to be about 10, 30 and 40 kJ·mol −1 for zeolite 5A, LSX and 13X, respectively. These values are within the range of typical physical adsorptions. Solubility of R-23 in ionic liquid 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethanesulfonate ([omim][TFES]) has been measured at approximately 298 and 323 K using the same gravimetric microbalance and the value was compared with the adsorption results. The solubility capacity of R-23 in ionic liquid reaches about 3 mol kg −1 around 2.5 MPa at 298 K, while the adsorption capacity on zeolites becomes around 3 mol kg −1 at around 0.25 MPa (ten times smaller). The adsorption on zeolites took more time than the absorption in the ionic liquid to reach thermodynamic equilibrium.",

The chemical and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the diatomite was mainly composed of SiO 2 (95.91%) as cristobalite and quartz. The maximum uptake of Cd(II), Zn(II), Pb(II) and Cr(III) were 0.734, 0.232, 0.169 and 0.162 meq/g at pH of 7, 6, 4 and 4, respectively. The adsorption capacity of diatomite was enhanced by increasing the temperature because the adsorption process was endothermic. The effect of the pH on the capacity was studied, and the maximum capacity augmented 6.3 times while increasing the pH from 4 to 7. This trend was due to the electrostatic interactions between the metal cations in solution and the negatively charged surface of the diatomite. The predominant adsorption mechanism of Cd(II) on diatomite was chemisorption, while ion exchange was responsible for 10% to 50% of the adsorption.",

It is an organophilic and hydrophobic material with molecular sieving property that allows it to be widely used as an adsorbent. In this work, silicalite-1 is synthesized by conventional hydrothermal treatments at atmospheric (T = 80 °C) and high pressures (T = 150 °C), respectively. In addition, the procedure is repeated using ultrasound waves during the mixing and ageing steps to shorten the synthesis time. The high crystallinity and phase purity of high-temperature autoclaved and sonicated samples are confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy results. Moreover, adsorption equilibrium of CH 4 and CO 2 has been studied experimentally to investigate the influence of textural properties of the obtained products on their adsorption performance. The experiments were performed in a batch system on the basis of a volumetric measurement technique at various operating conditions. The sonicated silicalite-1 showed a higher CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity at lower pressures, while the autoclaved sample possessed higher adsorption capacity for both CO 2 and CH 4 . These results are explained on the basis of a difference between the inter-crystalline pore volumes, morphology and surface acidity of the fabricated adsorbents. The experimental isotherms were modelled based on the Toth equation by minimizing the mean relative difference between the model and experimental adsorption capacity.",

Plackett–Burman (P–B) as an experimental design method was applied to investigate the effect of synthesis and activation conditions on specific surface area, relative crystallinity, and production yield of MIL-53(Al) synthesis. Some parameters such as ligand-to-metal molar ratio, synthesis time, synthesis temperature, calcination temperature, and calcination time were selected as the variables. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique was used in order to estimate the specific surface area of samples while the relative crystallinity of the samples was estimated by comparing their X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern. The morphology of the samples was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The yield of final products was determined based on organic ligands. The results revealed the significant effect of synthesis temperature on BET surface area, particle size, yield, and crystallinity. The calcination temperature has significant positive effect on BET and crystallinity. Also, the negative significant effect of molar ratio on yield was concluded from the results. However, negligible effect of synthesis and calcination time on the properties of prepared materials were observed. Furthermore, separation capability of a selected sample for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) was measured. Pure gas adsorption data were successfully fitted to Langmuir, Sips, and Toth models. The selected sample provided high adsorption capacity for both gases. The binary adsorption of gases was also investigated based on extended Langmuir equations and the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) models. Comparing the experimental and models data indicated good agreement between the IAST model and experiments. Finally, high CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 7.6 was obtained experimentally for the CO 2 /CH 4 molar ratio of 0.2/0.8.",

Because the adsorbed phase volume plays an important role, its dependence on temperature and pressure needs to be correctly assessed. In addition, for super-critical gas adsorption, the evaluation of the pseudo-saturation pressure also needs a judicious treatment. Based on the evaluation of carbon dioxide adsorption, it can be seen that sub-critical and super-critical adsorption show different temperature dependences of the isosteric heat of adsorption. The temperature and loading dependence of this property needs to be taken into account while designing practical systems. Some practical implications of these findings are enumerated.",

Analysis indicated that oxygen-containing functional groups, such as C = O, –OH, –COOH, and C–O–C, may be involved in the adsorption process. The adsorption of nitrobenzene was investigated under different operating conditions, including adsorbent dosage, initial nitrobenzene concentration, pH, and contact duration. Four kinetic models were applied to describe the adsorption process. Results revealed that the optimal sorbent mass was 0.3 g/50 mL at pH 5.8 and 25°C. The kinetic data obeyed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model ( R 2 &gt; 0.9965). In addition, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were employed to describe the adsorption equilibrium. The Freundlich model presented better fitting for the adsorption equilibrium, suggesting that the carbonized SCB surface had a heterogeneous nature. The maximum adsorption capacities calculated by the Langmuir model were 38.27, 41.72, and 44.70 mg/g at 25°C, 35°C, and 45°C, respectively.

The fitting analysis of the pure gas Langmuir adsorption model was carried out. The binary gas excess sorption measurement showed that the final sorption capacity of bituminous samples was the same no matter what the gas adsorption order of competitive adsorption and displacement adsorption. Hence, coal gas adsorption is physical adsorption, i.e. the different adsorption and desorption process of gas molecules does not affect the final adsorption amount of coal to each component of gas. Using the fitting parameters obtained by the Langmuir equation, the extended Langmuir equation was used to predict the adsorption capacity for each component of the binary gas. The comparison between predicted adsorption capacity and measured adsorption capacity showed that the extended Langmuir equation can better describe the trend of the adsorption isotherm curves of a binary gas under different pressures. The separation coefficient and displacement coefficient were defined from Langmuir adsorption theory. The separation coefficient involves the proportion of each component in the free phase and the proportion of each component in the adsorption phase. The displacement coefficient involves the displacement ability of gas molecules at adsorption sites by free gas molecules.",

    "abstract": "Natural and cross-linked chitosan spheres were used as adsorbents for oil diesel removal. Natural chitosan was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and epichlorohydrin. The chitosan spheres were soaked in diesel oil at different concentrations using a batch adsorption system. These experiments were carried out to measure the adsorption capacity of the spheres and the percentage of oil removed from the synthetic solutions. The equilibrium data were well described by the Langmuir and Langmuir—Freundlich models, which indicates that after the chemical modification, the maximum adsorption capacity increased significantly. This increase in adsorption capacity could be explained by modifications of surface characteristics (porosity and roughness) or the formation of new bonds after the cross-linking reactions. Our study results show that bioadsorbents based on chitosan is a promising material for diesel oil removal from organic solutions, and thus can be useful in bioremediation.",

    "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds emission has important effects over the environment and human beings health. When these substances cannot be substituted, adsorption systems are still a very common solution to VOCs emission, but for their design, previous laboratory work is necessary: adsorption isotherms and breakthrough curves must be obtained. The first ones establish the maximal amount of adsórbate retained over the solid adsorbent for a certain pressure of the adsórbate, and the second ones define the adsorption process kinetics. Once this information is studied, a theoretical breakthrough time model can be built up, and then the scale up of the adsorption system can be developed. This process is rather complex for multicomponent gas mixtures, where a competition between adsorbates happens. Thus, the aim of this paper is to establish a guide for authors willing to develop breakthrough time prediction models for multicomponent systems through a critical review of different adsorption and kinetic models.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, scanning electron microscopy, low-temperature N 2 adsorption and CH 4 isothermal adsorption experiments were performed on 11 coal samples with R o,max between 0.98 and 3.07%. The pore structure characteristics of coals (specific surface area, total volume distribution) were studied to assess the gas adsorption capacity. The results indicate that there is significant heterogeneity on coal surface, containing numerous channel-like pores, bottle-shaped pores and wedge-shaped pores. Both Langmuir volume (V L ) and Langmuir pressure (P L ) show a stage change trend with the increase of coalification degree. For different coalification stages, there exist different factors influencing the V L and P L values. For low-rank coals (R o,max &lt; 1.1%), the increase of V L values and decrease of P L values are mainly due to the abundant primary pore and fracture within coal. For middle-rank coals (1.1% &lt; R o,max &lt; 2.1%), the moisture content, vitrinite content and total pore volume are all the factors influencing V L , and the reduction of P L is mainly attributed to the decrease of moisture content and inertinite content. Meanwhile, this result is also closely related to the pore shape. For high-rank coals (R o,max &gt; 2.1%), V L values gradually increase and reach the maximum. When the coal has evolved into anthracite, liquid hydrocarbon within pore begins pyrolysis and gradually disappears, and a large number of macropores are converted into micropores, leading to the increase of specific surface area and total pore volume, corresponding to the increase of V L . In addition, the increase of vitrinite content within coal also contributes to the increase of V L . P L , reaches the minimum, indicating that the adsorption rate reaches the largest at the low pressure stage. The result is mainly controlled by the specific surface area and total pore volume of coal samples. This research results will provide a clearer insight into the relationship between adsorption parameters and coal rank, moisture content, maceral composition and pore structure, and it is of great significance for better assessing the gas adsorption capacity.",

Characterization results of the microspheres synthesized indicate that the modified ZnAl–LDHs formed a variety of morphologies, surface areas and pore volumes.

For this purpose, in this study, we synthesized AC from watermelon shells (CAS) and the synthesized carbon was modified with NaOH (CASM) in order to improve its adsorption efficiency. Adsorption kinetic studies of short-chain carboxylic acids (acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid) onto the synthesized ACs were performed. The CASM had an adsorption efficiency of 71%, 70% and 63% for acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, respectively. This efficiency was higher than that of CAS, which presented an efficiency of 32%, 30% and 27% for the respective acids. The AC from watermelon shells was synthesized by chemical activation with phosphoric acid (40% wt/wt), producing a yield of 84%. The carbon was modified by adding 10M NaOH. Finally, the physical and chemical characteristics of the synthesized AC were studied, which gave the following results: The surface area was 710 m 2 /g for CAS and 864 m 2 /g for CASM, a microporous and mesoporous structure, pore-size distribution of 0.39–4.54 nm for CAS and 0.39–6.0 nm for CASM, pore volume of 0.26 cm 3 /g for CAS and 0.55 cm 3 /g for CASM. The CAS modification caused an increase in the pore volume with a distribution below 10 nm, an increase in the number of basic groups on the carbon surface and a decrease in the carboxylic groups. All of these factors favoured the adsorption of the acids.",

The pH parameter, the concentrations of chitosan and its water-soluble derivative and the chelating precipitation time were experimentally investigated, and the optimum conditions were determined. The results revealed that both chitosan and its water-soluble derivative acted as chelating precipitation agents. Rapid chelating precipitation occurred when chitosan was added to real electroplating wastewater containing the chitosan derivative, thereby improving removal efficiency of palladium in different forms up to 95% under the optimum condition of 0.2 g/L chitosan and 0.16 mg/L derivative at pH 2.5. Then, dissolution experiments showed that chelating precipitation products could be dissolved in aqua regia. Additionally, selective chelating precipitation of palladium by chitosan and its derivative was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

In this study, the working mechanisms of LCO 2 -PTF were analysed and relevant equipment was designed to develop and promote the application of this technology. It utilized phase transition equipment (PTE) consisting of a liquid gas container, control unit for the current and gas volume, heating tube, and other components. LCO 2 blasting experiments were conducted in an airtight container to investigate the released energy, pressure, and other technical parameters. The application of LCO 2 -PTF for enhancing gas drainage in coal mines was then evaluated. The results of a blasting experiment showed a maximum energy of 947.12 kJ and revealed that the releasing pressure could be easily changed by varying the plate and heat tube. The releasing pressure remained unchanged within an initial distance and then decreased exponentially. The blasting products were gaseous CO 2 and water vapor, with no sparks or flames. The surface temperature of the PTE ranged from 269.32 to 277.96 K. Application of LCO 2 -PTF in coal mines with low permeability showed gas drainage 3.38 times higher than that achieved with conventional technologies, with methane concentration increasing from 55 to 89%. The attenuation coefficient of gas emissions dropped by 94% and the gas permeability coefficient of the coal body increased more than 23 times after fracturing. The shockwave of the high-pressure gas promoted the development and extension of cracks. The influence radius of the pre-cracking coal seam was 8.1 m, which is 6.75 times that of the original coal seam. The experimental results and the engineering applications indicate that LCO 2 -PTF is a safe and effective technology to enhance gas drainage in coal mines.",

The composites were prepared at a mass ratio from 2 : 1 to 1 : 2, and a composite of 1 : 1 was found to be most suitable for efficient Cr (VI) removal. The influencing parameters, including temperature, adsorbent dose, and pH, were statistically optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) for the removal of Cr (VI). The pH was found to be the limiting factor during the adsorption process, and under the optimal conditions, namely, adsorbent dose of 400 mg/L, [Formula: see text], and temperature of 298 K, 87.61% Cr (VI) would be removed expectantly. The mechanism of Cr (VI) removal by CSBT was discussed, and the protonation of amino groups on chitosan followed by the combination of -NH 3 + and anionic hexavalent chromium was the primary driving force. In addition, the removal of Cr (VI) onto CSBT was monolayer adsorption with a maximum adsorption capacity of 133.85 mg/g by the Langmuir isotherm. CSBT follows a pseudosecond-order kinetic model, and within 1.5 h, adsorption was observed to reach equilibrium. The calculated thermodynamic functions clarified that the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous below 312.60 K. CSBT could be regenerated after desorption by 0.5 mol/L NaOH solutions and exhibited superior reusability after six cycles. This study demonstrated composites of chitosan/bentonite as eco-friendly bioadsorbents for the removal of Cr (VI) from aqueous environments.",

In this study, the effects of pH on the removal mechanism of MB using synthesized δ-MnO 2 were investigated by distinguishing the adsorption and oxidation of MB by δ-MnO 2 during the removal process in the dark. The results show that the total removal efficiency of MB by δ-MnO 2 decreased significantly with an increase in the pH. MB could be removed by δ-MnO 2 via an adsorption mechanism and oxidation mechanism, and the proportion of adsorptive removal and oxidative removal was different under different pH conditions. With an increase in the initial pH from 2.00 to 8.05, the redox potential of δ-MnO 2 decreased, and its oxidation ability for the removal of MB also gradually decreased. In contrast, the surface negative charges of δ-MnO 2 increased with an increase in the pH, and the adsorption ability towards positively charged MB also gradually increased. This indicates that the effects of pH on the removal of MB by δ-MnO 2 are primarily dominated by its influence on the oxidation ability of δ-MnO 2 . In addition, it is further proved that the pH value has a significant effect on the oxidation and adsorption of MB on δ-MnO 2 . Moreover, the significant effects of pH on the oxidation of MB by δ-MnO 2 are further demonstrated by observing the changes in Mn 2+ and the UV-Vis spectra of intermediate products during the reaction, as well as the changes in the FTIR and XPS characterizations of δ-MnO 2 after the reaction.",

    "abstract": "At present, chemical Si/Al sources are mainly used as precursor materials for the manufacturing of zeolites. Such precursor materials are quite expensive for commercial synthesis. Here, we have reported the synthesis of Ca-based zeolite from incense stick ash waste by the alkali-treatment method for the first time. Incense stick ash (ISA) was used as a precursor material for the synthesis of low Si zeolites by the alkali-treatment method. The as-synthesized zeolites were characterized by various instruments like particle size analyzer (PSA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), electron diffraction spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). FTIR and XRD helped in the identification of the microstructure and crystalline nature of the zeolites and also confirmed the synthesis of Ca-based zeolite with two thetas at 25.7°. The microscopic analysis by FESEM and TEM exhibited that the size of synthesized Ca-rich zeolites varies from 200 to 700 nm and they are aggregated and cuboidal in shape. Additionally, structural, electronic, and density of states’ characteristics of gismondine (Ca 2 Al 4 Si 4 O 16 · 9 H 2 O) structures were evaluated by computational simulations (first principle, density functional theorem). The structural optimization of structures was carried out in the first stage under the lowest condition of total energy and forces acting on atoms for the lattice constant, as well as the available experimental and theoretical findings. The present research approach predicted the transformation of ISA waste into a value-added mineral, i.e., zeolite, which was further used for the removal of both heavy metals and alkali metals from fly ash-based wastewater using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide is removed from natural gas via adsorption on zeolites. The process operates very effectively, but there is still potential for improvement. Therefore, in this article, the adsorption of hydrogen sulfide was investigated on eight LTA zeolites with different cation compositions. Starting with the zeolite NaA (4 A), which contains only Na + cations, the Ca 2+ cation content was gradually increased by ion exchange. Equilibrium isotherms from cumulative breakthrough curve experiments in a fixed-bed adsorber at 25°C and 85°C at 1.3 bar (abs.) were determined in the trace range up to a concentration of 2000 ppm mol . From a comparison of the isotherms of the different materials, a mechanistic proposal for the adsorption is developed, taking into account the specific positions of the cations in the zeolite lattice when the degree of exchange is increased. The shape of the isotherms indicates two energetically different types of adsorption sites. It is assumed that two mechanisms are superimposed: a chemisorptive mechanism with dissociation of hydrogen sulfide and covalent bonding of the proton and the hydrogen sulfide ion to the zeolite lattice and a physisorptive mechanism by electrostatic interaction with the cations in the lattice. As the degree of exchange increases, the proportion of chemisorption sites seems to decrease. Above an exchange degree of 50%, only evidence of physisorption can be found. It is shown that this finding points to the involvement of weakly bound sodium cations at cation position III in the chemisorption of hydrogen sulfide.",

The so-treated diatomite has a high specific surface area (77.8 m 2 /g) and a high concentration of isolated silanol groups on the surface, and therefore, its adsorption capacity increases drastically in both the single and binary adsorption systems for rhodamine B and methylene blue. The binary system is more effective than the single system, with methylene blue being adsorbed more than rhodamine B.

TiO 2 photocatalyst is considered as an effective photocatalyst to remove the pollutants. Herein, the mesoporous TiO 2 -SBA-15 was prepared using the rice husk extract as the silica source. The fabricated nanocomposites were characterized using FTIR, small and wide angle XRD, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis, BET surface area analysis, and HRTEM. The photocatalytic efficiency of the composites for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) has been evaluated under UV irradiation. Interestingly, due to the excellent dispersion of TiO 2 on the wall of SBA-15 and good hydrophilicity, the nanocomposites displayed a good catalytic activity. The higher photodegradation performance was achieved by the composite containing 10 wt% TiO 2 by which the MB was fully degraded within 15-20 min of irradiation. Besides, TiO 2 -SBA-15 could effectively inhibit the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These results offer a practical and economic approach in the environmental management industries.",

Antibiotic adsorption on carbon-based materials (CBMs) such as charcoal and activated carbon has been identified as mainly effective for treating the wastewater strategies. Machine learning (ML) approaches were used to create generalized computation methods for tetracycline (TC) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) adsorption in CBMs in this investigation. In the existing system, random forest and ANN methods were used for TC and SMX for predicting the quantities of antibiotics in the CBMs. For reducing the antibiotics from the industrial wastewater, the broadcast efforts of the experiments are a little complicated. In the proposed method, Gaussian process regression (GPR), active learning (AL), and ANN are used for predicting the antibiotic levels in the industrial wastewater. Below a variety of environmental parameters (e.g., warmth, solution pH) and adsorbent varieties, the created Ml algorithms outperformed classic isotherm models in conditions of generalisation. To evaluate TC and SMX adsorption on CBMs, we used comparative significance investigation and partial trust plots based on ML models. The proposed GPR reduces the antibiotics in wastewater; minimal experimental screening and the comparative significance and partial trust plot help in the treatment of wastewater.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of Sb (III) wastewater produced from mining activities is uniquely challenging and has therefore garnered increasing attention. Here, an amino-modified zirconium-based metal-organic framework material (UiO-66-NH 2 ) and its composites were loaded onto graphene oxide (GO@UiO-66-NH 2 ) via the hydrothermal method, after which these materials were used to adsorb Sb (III) in mine wastewater. The effects of adsorption time, pH, initial Sb (III) concentration, temperature, and adsorbent dosage on the removal performance of Sb (III) were then investigated. The adsorption processes of Sb (III) were examined via adsorption kinetic, isotherm, and thermodynamic analyses. XRD, SEM, and FTIR analyses demonstrated the presence of a porous structure and high levels of oxygen-containing functional groups on the UiO-66-NH 2 and GO@UiO-66-NH 2 surfaces. During the Sb (III) adsorption process, the adsorption rates of UiO-66-NH 2 and GO@UiO-66-NH 2 were very fast in the first 10 minutes, and the adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 12 h, with the adsorption efficiencies of 91.76% and 93.79%, respectively. At a pH of 7.0, 25°C, an initial Sb (III) concentration of 100 mg/L, and an adsorbent dosage of 0.04 g/L, the maximum Sb (III) adsorption capacities of UiO-66-NH 2 and GO@UiO-66-NH 2 reached 39.23 mg/g and 61.07 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption process was accurately described by the Langmuir model, meaning that the Sb (III) was adsorbed through single-layer uniform adsorption. Moreover, the adsorption process was highly consistent with the pseudo-second-order model, which was indicative of spontaneous and endothermic chemical adsorption. Additionally, the Sb (III) removal efficiency could be maintained approximately 70% after sorption-desorption recycling four times. Therefore, our study provides an economical and effective method for the removal of Sb (III) in wastewater treatment.",

Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, no results were reported on this subject. The ND was characterized by FTIR, XRD, and SEM/EDX analyses. The experimental study of adsorption was carried out in batch mode. Results showed that ND adsorbent is mainly composed of silica. A fraction of calcite and ankerite was also identified. It is a porous material with a specific surface of about 41 m2.g-1 and with a hydroxyl surface functional group -OH. Adsorption results showed that adsorption process on ND is found to be effective in removing the carmoisine colorant. The adsorption capacity is strongly affected by the adsorbent and adsorbate contents, the solution pH, the work temperature, and the water hardness and mineralization. At room temperature, optimal experimental conditions for the highest adsorption capacity (12 mg.g-1) were colorant concentration 50mg.L-1, pH 2, contact time 30min, and ND content 1 g.L-1. Modeling study has showed that experimental results are well modeled by the Freundlich isotherm in multilayer adsorption. The reaction kinetics are pseudo-second order, and the thermodynamic parameters indicated that the nature of the adsorption process is endothermic and spontaneous.",

    "abstract": "Neolamarckia cadamba leaves were used as an adsorbent for methylene blue removal as well as for the reduction in the water quality parameters of the sewage belts of Yamuna River in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. A variety of water quality parameters were assessed, including chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, conductivity, hardness, pH, and temperature. A great deal of degradation in the water quality parameters collected from three locations within the Yamuna River in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India, has been observed by treating with Neolamarckia cadamba leaves. The adsorption studies were carried out by the batch method, and the effect of various parameters such as contact time, pH, initial concentration, and temperature was assessed. The maximum removal of methylene blue was obtained at pH 5 after 120 minutes of equilibrium time. In addition to fitting the Langmuir isotherm most accurately, the adsorbent also followed pseudokinetics of the second order. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of used biomass was 101 mg/g using 50 mg/L methylene blue solution. It is evident from the thermodynamic data that the adsorption is exothermic. Also, the spontaneity of the interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate decreases with temperature. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques were used to characterize the adsorbent. SEM images revealed that the biomass consisted of irregular spherical lumps with a porous structure, which provided effective adsorption sites. A chemical composition analysis of the biomass by EDAX shows that the chemical composition of oxygen and carbon decreases, whereas nitrogen’s chemical composition increases.",

Developed spheres were technically analysed for their chemical science, structural morphology, texture, porosity with respect to size distribution, and thermal degradation. Spheres are functionally enriched with oxygenated groups showing amorphous nature portraying as a smooth surface. After activation, intensity of functional groups is reduced due to reduction reaction by KOH thereby yielding highly rich porous carbon. The active surface area developed on spheres is 111 m 2 g -1 holding pores that are mesoporous in nature. Resistance to thermal exposure using TGA showed that decomposition of hemicelluloses followed by cellulose yielded aromatized carbon-rich skeleton through thermal degradation of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. Developed carbon was found to be effective in removing Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride from water with maximum adsorption capacity of 110.008 mg g -1 . Mechanistic removal followed pseudo-second-order kinetics along with Freundlich mode of adsorption. The presence of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups in porous carbon favoured elimination of CPF from water. The development of HTC-derived carbon helped conserving the energy thereby reducing the cost requirement.",

    "abstract": "Some environmental problems caused by the intrusion of active drug ingredients, especially antibiotics, into water resources pose a serious threat. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is an antibiotic from the group of fluoroquinolones that is used extensively in the treatment of bacterial infections. The presence of drug residues in the environment, especially in water resources, is an essential issue due to their stability and nondegradability. This study is aimed at investigating the efficiency of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) nanoparticles and the effect of independent variables, including initial concentrations of CIP (35-80 mg/L), adsorbent doses (20–60 mg), and pH values (4–10) at reaction time (80 min) for the removal efficiency of CIP antibiotics based on the Box-Behnken design (BBD) method. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated that a quadratic model was convenient for modeling CIP removal. The first step, the coprecipitation method, was appropriate for the preparation of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and developed as highly efficient adsorbents. Synthesized nanoparticles were later characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR). The results of XRD have shown that angles for the peaks at [Formula: see text], which corresponded to the crystal planes 220, 311, 400, 422, 511, 440, and 535, respectively, were consistent with standard peaks of magnetite and a cubic face structure. The obtained results indicated that the CIP removal efficiency was 74.44% under optimum operation parameters: initial concentration of CIP 44.15 (mg/L), adsorbent dosage of 59.6 (mg), [Formula: see text], and contact time of 80 min. In fact, a cooperative agreement between model prediction and experimental data using BBD with significant [Formula: see text] values of 0.95 was observed. Based on the results, magnetite nanoparticles have an excellent ability to remove antibiotics from an aqueous phase.",

    "abstract": "Groundwater seems to be the most significant natural source of potable water for millions of individuals. Fluoride pollution in groundwater is a big problem in Tamil Nadu’s Dharmapuri area. According to a survey done in a school in the Dharmapuri area, dental and skeletal fluoroses afflict almost 75% of school kids. There is no proven or recommended cost-effective strategy for lowering fluoride levels in the home. This study proposes cost-effective and efficient natural treatment approaches for lowering fluoride levels. In this experiment, fluorides in groundwater are eliminated to a suitable extent utilizing natural adsorbents. Neem stem charcoal (activated carbon), neem leaves powder, dry coconut husk, coconut shell charcoal (activated carbon), and rice husk powder are natural adsorbents. The adsorbents were utilized at different concentrations until the best concentration was found. The ideal concentration removes the bulk of fluoride from groundwater and delivers adequate treatment. People could adopt this cost-effective procedure because just a few components are enough. As per the Bureau of Indian Standards, the concentration should not exceed 1.5 ppm, and it should not be lesser than 1 ppm; keeping this in mind, the neem stem charcoal which has higher efficiency in removing fluoride can be used in extensive environments, but in this selected place, it reduces the concentration even below 1 ppm, which relays below the standard level. As a result, adopting these procedures helps prevent dental and skeletal fluoroses, which is common among young people.",

In contrast, biocomposites have poor mechanical and interface properties. This research is aimed at determining the interlaminar shear strength of composite materials reinforced with Dharbai fibre and nanosilicon powder. The composites were made using a hand lay-up method with the following conditions: (i) weight % of nanosilica filler, (ii) thickness of fibre mat, and (iii) cryogenic treatment period, each at three different levels, to meet the goals mentioned above. The composites were laminated using a traditional hand lay-up method, and their interlaminar shear strength was determined using the ASTM standard. According to a recent study, nanocomposites containing 4% nanoscale silicon and 300 grammes per square metre of woven Dharbai fibre showed the highest interlaminar shear strength after 15 minutes of cryogenic treatment. Fibre content increased the mechanical properties of pure epoxy in general. As the fibre and filler concentrations grew, more energy was required to break the fibre bundles between the matrix and its resin. According to the ANOVA, the cryogenic treatment was the most significant factor, contributing up to 59.58%, followed by woven Dharbai mate, contributing 22.11%, and nanosilicon at 18.30%.

The high maximum adsorption capacities (mmol g -1 ) in single/trinary mixture were found as 0.452/0.340 for MB; 0.329/0.321 for MO; and 0.806/2.04 for MR. Moreover, the recyclability experiments showed that the adsorbent could be reused through photocatalytic self-cleaning for at least three cycles with stable capacity. Thus, the TiO 2 /AC can be effectively employed for the removal of dyes from industrial textile wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Methylene blue dye (MB dye) is a harmful contaminant for wastewater streams of industries and is harmful to human and aquatic life. An ecofriendly sugar templating process was used to generate porous bentonite/polydimethylsiloxane (PB) and porous magnetite nanoparticles/bentonite/polydimethylsiloxane (PBNP) composite absorbents to remove MB dye in this study. During the infiltration of PDMS solution into the sugar template in the vacuum chamber, bentonite and magnetite particles were integrated on the surface of the PDMS, and the porous structure was generated during the leaching out of sugar particles in water. The absorbents were characterized using Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The absence of the methyl bond at 2924 cm -1 and phenol bond at 3325 cm -1 in the FTIR spectra of the formed membrane proves that the food grade sugar was completely removed. The SEM images confirm that porosity was achieved as well as uniform mixing of the in the formation of composite. MB dye was effectively removed from wastewater using the as-prepared composite as absorbent. The removal efficiencies of the composite PBNP and PB were ~91% and ~85%, respectively. The experimental data was applied to pseudo-first-order (PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic models as well as the Dubinin-Radushkevich, Harkins-Jura, and Elovich models for the adsorption isotherm. The data was found to fit the pseudo-second-order and Elovich models, respectively. The results show that the presence of magnetite nanoparticles improved MB dye removal significantly.",

The surface and morphology of modified biomass was characterized by the point of zero-charge (pH PZC ), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area ( S BET ), scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The equilibrium data were best described by the Langmuir and Freudnlich isotherm model for MB and BCB, respectively. Kinetics modeling shows that the adsorption of both dyes onto FV-FORMALD was well described by pseudo-second order. The thermodynamics parameters validated the exothermic nature and the spontaneously of the adsorption of both dyes. The optimum conditions for the adsorption of MB and BCB were at pH = 8 and 4, adsorbent concentration = 2 and 1 g L −1 , and T = 313.15 and 300.15 K, respectively. The FV-FORMALD had reuse potential for at least three cycles with high adsorption capacities of MB and BCB dyes. A colored real wastewater was successfully treated using FV-FORMALD. According to the results, the brown algae FV-FORMALD could be considered appropriate for removing cationic dyes due to its high efficiency and an environmentally friendly, sustainable, and low-cost approach.",

Washing with water or pretreatment with formaldehyde was performed on the bark powder. The adsorption capacity of this material towards Cu II , Cr III , Cd II and Ni II was evaluated in a batch process for various parameters. The results obtained showed that the retention capacity increased with contact time, pH and initial metal ion concentration but decreased with temperature. The adsorption capacities were 2.61, 0.71, 2.24 and 0.75 mmol/g adsorbent for Cu II , Cr III , Cd II and Ni II , respectively. Eucalyptus barks are also very efficient for the adsorption of dyes (Acid Blue 25, Erichrome Blue Black B and Calmagite) because of interaction between the hydroxy and amino groups of the dyes and the phenolic moities of bark. This adsorption was modified when metal ions had already been adsorbed on to the barks as a result of the formation of a 1:1 complex between the dye and the metal ion. Desorption was achieved by treating with the sodium salt of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) for metal ions and by heating at 75°C in aqueous medium for dyes. After desorption, the recycling of the support was tested for potential use as a means of concentrating pollutants.",

The Canonical Ensemble was a collection of cubic simulation boxes in which a finite pore resides, while the Gibbs Ensemble was that of the pore space of the finite pore. Argon was used as a model for Lennard-Jones fluids, while the adsorbent was modelled as a finite carbon slit pore whose two walls were composed of three graphene layers with carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The Lennard-Jones (LJ) 12–6 potential model was used to compute the interaction energy between two fluid particles, and also between a fluid particle and a carbon atom. Argon adsorption isotherms were obtained at 87.3 K for pore widths of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 nm using both Canonical and Gibbs Ensembles. These results were compared with isotherms obtained with corresponding infinite pores using Grand Canonical Ensembles. The effects of the number of cycles necessary to reach equilibrium, the initial allocation of particles, the displacement step and the simulation box size were particularly investigated in the Monte Carlo simulation with Canonical Ensembles. Of these parameters, the displacement step had the most significant effect on the performance of the Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation box size was also important, especially at low pressures at which the size must be sufficiently large to have a statistically acceptable number of particles in the bulk phase. Finally, it was found that the Canonical Ensemble and the Gibbs Ensemble both yielded the same isotherm (within statistical error); however, the computation time for GEMC was shorter than that for canonical ensemble simulation. However, the latter method described the proper interface between the reservoir and the adsorbed phase (and hence the meniscus).",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of agricultural by-products as a means of removing pollutants from contaminated wastewater is attracting increasing interest for sustainable development applications. The present work deals with the removal of phenol and 4-chlorophenol from aqueous solutions by chemically activated olive stones. The olive stones were soaked in 50% phosphoric acid for 3 h at 443 K. After washing, the product was activated in an inert atmosphere for 2 h or 3 h at temperatures within the range 873–1023 K. The carbons thus prepared were characterized by Methylene Blue and iodine adsorption, N 2 adsorption at 77 K in conjunction with the BET equation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Boehm titrations. The sorption capacity towards both pollutants was determined by fitting the Langmuir model to the adsorption isotherms. The optimum activation temperature and time were 1023 K and 3 h, respectively. A maximum adsorption capacity of 189 mg/g was obtained for phenol and 436 mg/g for 4-chlorophenol. In comparison, the Merck and Aldrich commercial-grade powdered activated carbons ranked lower with adsorption capacities of 145 mg/g and 179 mg/g for phenol and 244 mg/g and 316 mg/g for 4-chorophenol, respectively.",

The effects of relevant parameters, i.e. pH, adsorbent concentration, ionic strength and solution temperature, on the adsorption capacity were examined. The adsorption data followed the Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherms. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 16.79 mg/g at a pH value of 6.0, an initial Cu(II) ion concentration of 40 mg/dm3 and a temperature of 313 K. Various thermodynamic parameters, viz. the standard free energy change (ΔG0), the enthalpy (ΔH0) and the entropy (ΔS0), were evaluated for the process with the results indicating that it was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The dynamics of the adsorption process were also studied and values of the adsorption rate constant and the rate constant for intraparticle diffusion calculated. The activation energy (ΔEa) was found to be 19.84 kJ/mol in the present study, indicating a chemical adsorption process involving weak interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. The interaction between Cu(II) ions and kaolinite is mainly attributable to ion exchange. The adsorption capacity increased with increasing solution pH, decreasing ionic strength and decreasing adsorbent concentration. Kaolinite can be used to separate Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions.",

This time-dependent rearrangement of the adsorbed PVP molecules caused the formation of a denser polymer layer at the silica surface. The aggregate size of the primary silica particles with adsorbed PVP molecules decreased after treatment. The volume of macropores with a pore radius R p &gt; 25 nm increased due to the decrease in the distances between aggregates in agglomerates because of the adhesive effect of the PVP molecules. However, the volume of micropores at R p &lt; 1 nm decreased because of the penetration of the PVP molecules into the primary silica particle aggregates and the filling of gaps between adjacent particles. A decrease occurred in the amount of adsorbed water in the PVP layer exhibiting a maximum density.",

The adsorption capacity towards Pb(II) ion removal also increased with increasing contact time and adsorbent dosage. Compared to adsorbents derived from various other materials, the pyrolusite-modified adsorbent had a relatively high Pb(II) ion adsorption capacity.

    "abstract": "This paper covers the optimization of methane volumetric storage capacity by controlling the sub-nanometre (<1 nm) and supra-nanometre (1–5 nm) pore volumes. Nanospace engineering of KOH activated carbon generates an ideal structure for methane storage in which gas molecules are adsorbed as a high-density fluid by strong van der Waals forces into pores that are a few molecules in diameter. High specific surface areas, porosities, sub-nanometre (<1 nm) and supra-nanometre (1–5 nm) pore volumes are quantitatively selected by controlling the degree of carbon consumption and metallic potassium intercalation into the carbon lattice during the activation process. The formation of tuneable sub-nanometre and supra-nanometre pores is validated by sub-critical nitrogen adsorption. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy data show the atomic structure of high-surface-area activated carbon (2600 m2/g). While high surface area and high porosity are optimal for gravimetric methane storage, the results indicate that an exclusive sub-nanometre region, a low porosity and an acceptable surface area (approximately 2000 m2/g) are ideal for methane volumetric storage, storing 120 g CH4/l (184 vol/vol) at 35 bar and room temperature (22 °C). High-pressure methane isotherms up to 150 bar at 30, −25 and −50 °C on optimal activated carbons are presented. Methane volumetric storage capacity at 35 bar reaches 176 g/l (269 vol/vol) and 202 g/l (309 vol/vol) at −25 and −50 °C, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Nanocrystalline vanadium nitride (VN) materials are synthesized by two different routes, namely, the urea route and the ammonia route, using various V 2 O 5 precursors obtained by citric acid–based sol–gel method. The VN nanomaterials obtained are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and BET method. The XRD patterns show the presence of pure cubic phase with line broadening. The lattice parameters were found to be 4.1266 and 4.1136 Å for the urea route and 4.1125 and 4.1120 Å for the ammonia route using V 2 O 5 precursors heat treated at 350 and 550 °C, respectively. The estimated crystallite sizes are found to be 9 and 7 nm for the urea route and 22 and 28 nm for the ammonia route using V 2 O 5 precursors synthesized at 350 and 550 °C, respectively. The SEM images show the presence of agglomerates having particle dimensions of 115 and (300 × 15) nm for the urea route and 111 and 68 nm for the ammonia route using V 2 O 5 precursors heat treated at 350 and 550 °C, respectively. The maximum BET surface area of 57 m 2 /g was obtained for VN sample synthesized by the urea route using V 2 O 5 precursors synthesized at 350 °C. The isotherms show typical Type IV with H2 hysteresis, which is characteristic of the mesoporous particles. The production of high-surface-area nitride materials has been correlated to synthetic procedure, precursor used and formation of mesopores in the material.",

Ion exchange treatments were performed using Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba. As a result, Li- and Na-type montmorillonite showed larger interlayer distance (1.31–1.53 nm), than K, Rb, and Cs-type montmorillonite (1.23–1.26 nm). In the measurement of hydrophilicity using a pulse NMR-based particle interface analyzer, Li- and Na-type montmorillonite showed higher hydrophilicity. In addition, K Lang , which indicates the interaction with caffeine, was 0.25–0.32 l/mmol, which is lower than K-, Rb-, and Cs-type montmorillonite (1.14–1.60 l/mmol). It is possible that adsorption of water molecules inhibits caffeine from adsorbing. Because of the difficulty of exchange between caffeine and water molecules in interlayer of the Li- and Na-type montmorillonite, the interaction with caffeine decreased. Alternatively, another possibility is that when highly hydrophilic montmorillonite retains many water molecules, the caffeine adsorption sites are blocked by water molecules. In either case, hydrophilicity has a large influence on the adsorption of caffeine onto montmorillonite.",

The aim of this work was to enhance the ability of chitosan for selective and effective removal of aromatic amines from natural waters. The chitosan was modified with the inclusion of nano-Al 2 O 3 and then the impregnation with Cu 2+ solution. The study on the chemical structure of the modified adsorbent by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the formation of a complex between amine groups of the chitosan and Cu(II) on the adsorbent surface. It was found that the modified adsorbent, Cu–chitosan/nano-Al 2 O 3 , has more porous surface morphology and so more specific surface area available for adsorption. The adsorption properties of the modified adsorbent toward aniline and dimethyl aniline as typical aromatic amines were investigated using kinetics and isotherm studies at room temperature. The adsorption equilibrium data were fitted well by the Freundlich isotherm model. The kinetic data exhibited a non-linear fit to pseudo-second-order model for both aniline and dimethyl aniline. The adsorption capacity of Cu–chitosan/nano-Al 2 O 3 was much higher than that of neat chitosan and chitosan/nano-Al 2 O 3 . The adsorbent had high selectivity for adsorption of aniline and dimethyl aniline in the presence of chloride, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, and carbonate as natural waters common anions. The modified adsorbent exhibited good regeneration ability. The results showed that the introduced adsorbent can be employed as an effective chitosan-based adsorbent for selective removal of aromatic amines from natural waters.",

    "abstract": "This investigation suggests the implementation of ZSM-5 activated carbon composite as a prolific adsorbent for the continuous elimination of Pb 2+ ions from water. Continuous adsorption experiments were performed by varying three parameters such as process flow rate (2-6 mL min -1 ), bed height (2-6 cm), and initial concentration (250–750 mg L -1 ). The highest loading capacity of the fixed-bed 213.3 mg L -1 was achieved with optimal values of 2 mL min -1 of flow rate, bed height of 6 cm, and initial concentration of 750 mg L -1 , respectively. The breakthrough curves and saturation points were found to appear quickly for increasing flow rates and initial concentration and vice versa for bed depth. The lower flow rates with higher bed depths have exhibited optimal performances of the fixed-bed column. The mechanism of adsorption of Pb 2+ ions was found to be ion exchange with Na + ions from ZMS-5 and pore adsorption onto activated carbon. The breakthrough curves were verified with three well-known mathematical models such as the Adams-Bohart, Thomas, and Yoon-Nelson models. The later models showed the best fit to the column data over the Adams-Bohart model that can be utilized to understand the binding of Pb 2+ ions onto the composite. Regeneration of ZSM-5/activated carbon was achieved successfully with 0.1 M HCl within 60 min of contact time. The outcomes conclude that ZSM-5 activated carbon composite is a prolific material for the continuous removal of water loaded with Pb 2+ ions.",

    "abstract": "The presence of fluoride ions in water poses a significant danger to human health. In Tanzania, where the Rift Valley passes, some people are impaired due to elevated levels of fluoride in water. The purpose of this study was to prepare thermally activated Adansonia digitata fruit pericarp biosorbents at 450, 500, 550, and 600°C for defluoridation. Using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyzer, the surface area and pore diameter were measured. The scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry were used to determine morphological features and functional groups of biosorbents. To analyze the effect of pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, and initial concentration, the response surface methodology was applied. Adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and regeneration studies were also conducted. There were considerably wide surface areas of 385.44, 399.27, 445.71, and 447.70 m 2 /g and pore diameters of 0.3055, 3.0341, 3.0375, and 3.0471 nm for biosorbents activated at 450, 500, 550, and 600°C, respectively. FT-IR spectra indicated the oxidation of alcoholic –OH to carboxylic –OH during the activation process, which is proved by the shifting of the peak at 3500-3000 cm -1 from raw biosorbent to a very broad and strong band at 3500-2000 cm -1 from the activated biosorbent. The maximum removal efficiencies of biosorbents activated at 450, 500, 550, and 600°C were 95.55, 96.50, 97.65, and 98.36%, respectively, for all biosorbents at a pH of 2, an initial concentration of 27.50 ppm, a contact period of 75.00 minutes, and an adsorbent dose of 5.50 g, which indicates that the adsorbents were successful for fluoride removal. The isotherms and kinetics indicated that the adsorption fitted well with Freundlich ([Formula: see text]) and pseudo-second-order ([Formula: see text]) kinetic adsorption models, respectively. The results showed that the removal of fluoride by biosorbents prepared is effective and could be used for defluoridation of drinking water.",

    "abstract": "Coal dust is a significant concern to the safety of coal mine operations. The wettability of coal can be effectively altered by adding surfactants to water. The development of high-efficiency dust suppressants is hampered by a lack of understanding of the microscopic interaction process between coal dust and surfactants. In this investigation, the influence of the branched structure of the polyoxyethylene unit in nonionic surfactants on the wettability of anthracite surfaces was evaluated by combining the modeling study and experimental research. The macromolecular model of Jincheng anthracite with 55 different components (C 7730 H 3916 O 133 N 123 S 25 ) was constructed. Lauryl polyoxyethylene ether C 12 (EO) 20 and Tween 20 were selected. The simulation results showed that due to the branched structure of polyoxyethylene, the surface of anthracite after adsorption by Tween 20 is more hydrophilic. Further analysis found that the adsorption configuration of Tween 20 is that the hydrophilic head group covers the hydrophobic tail chain, while the adsorption configuration of C 12 (EO) 20 is that the hydrophobic tail chain covers the hydrophilic head group. The network structure formed by Tween 20 is relatively loose, and the surface is rougher. The network structure formed by C 12 (EO) 20 is denser. Water molecules have a higher aggregation degree near Tween 20 and stronger permeability, and more hydrogen bonds are formed. The existence state of carbon and oxygen elements on the surface of modified coal was analyzed by XPS experiment, which confirmed the adsorption structure obtained by molecular simulation.",

    "abstract": "SiO 2 was prepared from rice husk (RH) with the assistance of cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), and the CuO•Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 composite was prepared by a simple coprecipitation method to enhance the Fenton-like degradation of dyes in a wide pH range. SiO 2 was a mesoporous material with a relatively large surface area of 496.4 m 2 /g and a highly relative pore volume of 1.154 cm 3 /g. The Fe 3 O 4 and CuO particles with the size of 20–50 nm were well dispersed in the composite, making the composite tighter and causing the disappearance of large pores in the range of 20–55 nm. The surface area and pore volume of the composite were reduced to 248.6 m 2 /g and 0.420 cm 3 /g, respectively. Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 and Fe 3 O 4 samples only exhibited high catalytic activity in an acidic medium, while the CuO•Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 composite could effectively work in a wide pH range of 3–7. Besides, the effects of reaction conditions such as catalyst dosage, H 2 O 2 concentration, and initial dye concentration on the catalytic performance of the composite were studied. The optimal conditions for the degradation of dye were tartrazine (TA) concentration of 50 mg/L, dosage catalyst of 0.5 g/L, H 2 O 2 concentration of 120 mM, and pH 5. The CuO•Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 composite reached the highest activity at pH 5, showing a degradation efficiency (DE) of 93.3% and a reaction rate of 0.061 min −1 . The reusability of the catalyst was investigated by cyclic experiments. The DE of the 3 rd reuse remained at 55.1%, equivalent to 93.5% of the first use. The catalytic mechanism for the Fenton system has also been proposed.",

In this study, we synthesized WO 3 as a catalyst for the degradation of methylene blue, a thiazine dye, which was used in the previous work. The hydrothermal process is used to create WO 3 nanoparticles, which are made from sodium tungstate. When it comes to confirming the nanoparticles, many characterization techniques are employed, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field emission–scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The existence of monoclinic crystalline structure is shown by XRD, with the average crystalline size being around 34 nm. FTIR confirms the presence of metal oxides. The pellucid absorption extremity in the UV-Vis region corresponds to the rudimentary absorption of the WO 3 semiconductor. FE-SEM confirms square-shaped nanoplates with EDX address the occurrence of elemental tungsten. The photocatalytic activity of WO 3 nanoparticles against methylene blue is taken for at different intervals of time that confirms MB’s degradation.

    "abstract": "This study describes the preparation and characterization of glass/poly-3-methyl aniline (P3MA)/PbS quantum dot (QD) optoelectronic photodetector to detect and sense the light in broad spectral regions of UV, Vis, and NIR. This work is carried out to solve the drawbacks of other studs that prepare detectors in just one or two optical regions. Previous studies have used high-priced techniques. The deposition of P3MA on the glass surface was carried out by in situ oxidation process. Then, this polymer film was used to assist the deposition of PbS-QD particles through the ionic adsorption deposition method. The latter was performed using four different concentrations of Pb(NO 3 ) 2 solution (0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07 M) to form four P3MA/PbS composites: I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The chemical structure, morphologies, and electrical and optical properties of these composites were determined using different analytical tools. The SEM confirmed the formation of spherical QD particles of PbS on the P3MA surface. The TEM analysis showed that the composite has an average size of 5 nm, with the interatomic distances of 0.4 nm. Furthermore, the optical band gap values were 1.53, 1.52, 1.50, and 1.51 eV, respectively. The optoelectronic device could detect and sense light from 390 to 636 nm under various optical wavelengths. The produced current density ([Formula: see text]) values decreased from 0.029 mA.cm -2 at 390 nm to 0.022 mA.cm -2 at 500 nm and then increased until 0.024 mA.cm -2 at 636 nm. The light sensing was determined through the photoresponsivity ([Formula: see text]) and detectivity ([Formula: see text]) parameters, in which the photodetector has [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] values of 0.29 mA.cm -2 and [Formula: see text] Jones, respectively. Finally, a simple mechanism was proposed to explain the light sensing through the prepared optoelectronic device. Soon, our team works on the industrial applications of this optoelectronic device in the industry field related to the great optoelectronic device technical properties and its low cost and easy preparation.",

    "abstract": "The utilization of natural fibre-based biodegradable polymers has expanded in the present circumstances since natural fibres are relatively inexpensive, recyclable, lighter, nonflammable, and harmless. However, hydrophilic nature is the most serious issue. To address this issue, the current study was applied to enhance the material characteristics of hybrid composites strengthened by CGF and nanosilica powder. To accomplish the mentioned goal, RSM calculated and optimized the following processing parameters using the BBD arrangement at various CGF fibre thickness (gsm), weight percent of nanosilica powder (wt. percent), and cryogenic treatment period (min). To prevent hydrophilic nature, the fibres were pretreated for four hours with a 5% alkaline solution. Deterioration models were created to analyze the material characteristics, and the optimal progression variables were determined. Based on the multiresponse surface methodology, the governable process variables for nano-silica- and CGF-based hybrid nanocomposites should be set at 3% silica, 300 gsm of CGF, and 30 minutes of cryogenic treatment. The tension, bending, and impact property correlation coefficient values ([Formula: see text]) are 0.95, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The above-mentioned combinations provide better water absorption and mechanical strength.",

The chief intention of the current study is to determine the mechanical and water retention features of composite materials under ambient conditions. Coir and pineapple leaf fibre were used as a reinforcement, aluminium oxide as additives, and polyester as a matrix. The hybrid resources were laminated by the manual hand lay-up method. The mechanical characteristics like tensile, flexural, and fracture toughness properties were tested as per the ASTM standard. Nanoparticle weight ratio and its size variation significantly impact mechanical qualities. The hybrid composite’s water retention behaviour was tested for two types of water levels: ordinary tab water and nanofluid. The moisture uptake of the composites rose as the fibre volume increased, and after 640 hours, all of the composites had reached equilibrium. According to the results, the following combinations have the maximum mechanical strength: 15% wt.% coir, 15% wt.% pineapple, 10% wt.% nanofiller, and 60% wt.% polyester resin. The combinations mentioned above withstand the most load during the tests. Compared to 20% filler, 10% Al 2 O 3 filler produces good interfacial adhesion in the current study.

    "abstract": "Chromium (Cr) is a heavy metal that has a serious environmental pollution problem. Electroplating wastewater contains high level of Cr that surpassed the acceptable environmental discharge standard limit in surface water bodies and causes aquatic ecosystem risks. Various studies have been conducted in Ethiopia on the removal of Cr from various types of wastewater; however, factual studies on the adaptability of cost-effective activated coffee husk carbon for the removal of Cr from electroplating wastewater are lacking. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the Cr adsorption efficiency of activated coffee husk carbon from electroplating wastewater at laboratory scale. The activated coffee husk carbon’s pH, electrical conductivity (EC), ash content, moisture content, bulk density, particle size, pore volume, porosity, volatile organic matter, carbon yield, and carbon:nitrogen ratio were determined following standard methods. In the adsorption experiment, adsorbent dosage, agitation speed, contact time, pH, and initial concentration were optimized. Models were used to examine the adsorption isotherms and kinetics. The ability of activated coffee husk carbon to desorb Cr was investigated. The adsorbent functional groups and surface morphology were examined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. Analysis of the physicochemical characteristics of the adsorbent showed that the activated coffee husk carbon has good quality, and thus, playing an important role in metal adsorption. Furthermore, FTIR analysis also confirmed the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and other important functional groups, which promote heavy metal adsorption. The adsorption process optimization revealed 99.65% maximum Cr adsorption efficiency at 120 min contact time, 40 mgL -1 initial concentration, 150 rpm agitation speed, pH 7.0, and 20 gL -1 adsorbent dosages. From the adsorption model studies, Freundlich sorption isotherm and pseudosecond-order models were well fitted with respective [Formula: see text] values of 0.987 and 0.999. A 60% Cr was removed according to desorption studies. In general, due to the ease with which coffee husk can be obtained from coffee processing facilities, its use as an absorbent will be cost-effective and considered as an alternative option in removing Cr metal from wastewaters.",

    "abstract": "Due to the widespread production of maize, the waste created by this crop has become a serious concern. This study applied the concept of waste circulation to the production of magnetic biochar from corn husk waste to remediate paraquat-contaminated water. Magnetic biochar (MB) was produced by impregnating maize husks with iron and carbonizing the residue in a nitrogen environment. Carbonized MB at the temperature of 850°C (MB-01-850) exhibited a combination of microporous and mesoporous structures ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), while biochar created only a microporous structure ([Formula: see text]). According to the findings, Fe(NO 3 ) 3 significantly affected the increase in mesopore formation after carbonization. In addition, biochar exhibits excellent magnetic responsiveness. MB-01-850 reached equilibrium within approximately 20 min in synthetic water. Batch adsorption studies showed that MB-01-850 had maximum adsorption capacities ([Formula: see text]) of 34.97 mg/g and 31.63 mg/g for synthetic and natural water, respectively. The unmodified biochar (without mesopores) had a [Formula: see text] of 4.08 mg/g. This indicates that the presence of mesopores improves the effectiveness of paraquat adsorption. Additionally, the adsorption performance of magnetic biochar exhibited no statistically significant variance when tested under natural water conditions. Furthermore, magnetic biochar demonstrates impressive regeneration capacity, allowing it to be regenerated almost entirely for a minimum of four cycles using a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution with a concentration equal to or greater than 0.5 M.",

The effect of pH on the removal of the said dye has been explained in terms of surface hydroxylation and complexation. Various empirical models have been developed in an attempt to correlate the percentage uptake of dye with the parameters investigated. Dynamic modelling of the dye uptake has been undertaken and found to follow first-order kinetics. The rate constants were determined during the adsorption of the dye under the optimum conditions. Coefficients for mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion were also evaluated in order to explain the mechanism. Langmuir's isotherm was found to be valid. Significant desorption of the dye from the surface of the adsorbents was noted at pH 12.0.",

Optimum conditions for maximum adsorption in terms of shaking time, lead ion concentration, temperature and concentration of different acids were established. The results obtained reveal that the adsorption of lead ions on active carbon is athermic (ΔH = 0) in nature and follows first-order kinetics. The first-order rate constant was evaluated as 0.049 min −1 and the intraparticle diffusion rate as 3.07 × 10 −4 (g/g min 1/2 ). The data also obey the Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm equations over the concentration range studied. The magnitude of the adsorption energy, 7.61 kJ/mol, calculated from the β-constant of the D-R equation lies in the energy range for physical adsorption which is attributed to weak bonding between the lead ions and the active carbon.",

All measurements were carried out over the temperature range 15—40°C. The occurrence of a minimum in the adsorption of PAA between 25–30°C was caused by conformational changes of the polymer macromolecules. For non-filtered PAA, a decrease in polymer adsorption and an increase in the thickness of the adsorbed polymer layers were observed. These result from changes in the polydispersity index of filtered PAA and the blocking of some active sites on the oxide surface by inorganic contamination present in the non-filtered PAA samples.

Chars were formed at high heating rates in a flat-frame burner (maximum temperature of 1473 K), a process representative of char formation in pulverized coal combustion. Most of the surface area of the coals was found in micropores with radii less than 1.5 nm, while 95% or more of the pore volume in the coals (85% of that in chars) was contained in mesopores less than 20 nm). During the high-temperature formation of char in a flame: (I) CO 2 surface areas (involving mainly micropores, r pore &lt; 1.5 nm) increase two- to three-fold, while N 2 surface areas (involving mesopores. 1.5 nm &lt; r pore &lt; 20 nm) increase 20–200-fold; (2) solid densities increase about 25% due to graphitization, while particle densities decrease by about a factor of two due to large increases in particle porosity; (3) pore volumes increase 5–10-fold; and (4) total porosities increase three- to four-fold, most of this increase occurring in the macropore range. The larger surface areas and porosities of chars relative to coals may be explained by (i) the removal by pyrolysis of strongly adsorbed molecules or volatile hydrocarbons from micropores and small mesopores that would otherwise hinder access of CO 2 and N 2 molecules; (ii) the creation of new pores during the restructuring process involved in charification; and (iii) opening up by gasification with oxygen of new pores previously blocked to gas adsorption. The preparation conditions (e.g. atmosphere, heating rate and temperature) greatly affect the physical properties including the surface area, porosity and density of the resulting chars. The degree of carbon burnout is an important correlating factor affecting these properties.",

These were phenol (P), p-nitrophenol (PNP), p-nitroaniline (PNA), Methylene Blue (MB) and Congo Red (CR). The adsorption of the two dyes (MB and CR) was a function of the pore dimensions, whereas phenol uptake was greatly reduced because of the acidic oxygen functional groups on the carbon surface. The amount of PNP taken up corresponded exactly with the specific surface area as estimated from nitrogen isotherm measurements. The surface abundances (as μmol/m 2 ) of PNP, P and PNA were found to be independent of the porosity characteristics of the active carbon and followed the general sequence PNP &gt; P &gt; PNA &gt; MB &gt; CR.

The initial part of this plot is convex and can be fitted by a power equation (i.e. with the amount adsorbed being proportional to a fractional power of the time), the final part is concave and can be fitted by a Langmuir-type equation (i.e. with the rate decreasing linearly with the amount adsorbed) and the intermediate region around the inflection point can be fitted by the Elovich equation (i.e. with the amount adsorbed increasing logarithmically with the time). In many cases the above regions are preceded by a region at which the rate is constant. The equation dθ/dt = A(1 – θ)/θ where θ is the fractional coverage, t is the time and a is a constant, is consistent with these kinetics. It corresponds to kinetics in which the activation energy increases logarithmically with the coverage. It can be derived on the basis of a statistical-rate theory or on the basis of a precursor-state theory. The diffusion equation [Formula: see text] where q and q x are the quantities adsorbed at time t and t = ∞, a n and b n are parameters determined by the integers n, D is the diffusion coefficient and r the length path, is also consistent with the above kinetics. Both equations have also been extended to heterogenous surfaces. Isotherms with constant initial rate are associated with non-activated adsorption and measurements at low pressures. The constant initial rate corresponds to a state at which the kinetics are determined by the rate of arrival of the gas molecules to the surface.",

    "abstract": "Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) pastes with added superplasticizer were made using water/cement weight ratios of standard consistency. Three types of superplasticizer based on acrylate—poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers were used. The pastes were hydrated for various time lengths and the mechanical characteristics of the hardened cement pastes were studied and related to their pore structures. It was found that the addition of the superplasticizers to OPC improved the mechanical properties of the hardened pastes for all hydration lengths. The addition of such superplasticizers to OPC resulted in a decrease in the specific surface areas and total pore volumes of the hardened superplasticized cement pastes relative to the corresponding hardened neat cement pastes.",

Of the tested polymers, the aminated hypercrosslinked resins had the highest adsorption capacities. The empirical Freundlich equation was successfully employed to describe the adsorption process. The specific surface area and the micropore structure of the adsorbent together with the tertiary amino group on the matrix affected the adsorption performance towards phenol. Furthermore, these factors also influenced the thermodynamic properties. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the presence of the tertiary amino group on the polymer matrix decreased the adsorption rate and increased the apparent activation energy of the adsorption process.",

    "abstract": "For ecological reasons, there is an increasing demand for recycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes in developed countries. Although one potential application might be its utilisation for the production of activated carbons, the behaviour of these wastes when subjected to different heat treatments and activation processes is still not very well known. In the present work, samples with different degrees of burn-off were prepared by pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere and subsequent CO 2 activation at high temperatures. The derived changes in the textural and structural properties of the residual solids were studied by helium picnometry, N 2 and CO 2 adsorption isotherms, powder XRD, Raman spectroscopy and XPS. The study reveals that CO 2 activation of PET wastes develops a carbonaceous matrix with micropores. Helium measurements showed that the mass density of the activated samples increased as the degree of burn-off increased. Characterisation studies revealed that the structural changes derived from pyrolysis and further CO 2 activation mostly involved a progressive decrease in the number of structural units.",

The four adsorbents were characterized by various techniques (e.g. BET specific surface area measurements, FT-IR spectroscopy and measurements of the total pore volume, density, pH and moisture content). Preliminary investigations showed that the highest uptake was exhibited by K-APC. Factors affecting the removal of Indigo Carmine (IC) dye using K-APC were investigated. The amounts of co-existing ions as well as those removed during the desorption process were determined quantitatively. The results obtained were examined using two-parameter equilibrium models (Langmuir and Freundlich equations). Studies of the process at 30, 50 and 70°C demonstrated that adsorption was endothermic. The effects of cations, e.g. K + , Na + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ and Al 3+ , on dye removal were investigated. The monolayer capacity of K-APC was 552.5 mg/g. The proposed mechanism suggests that surface chemistry rather than the surface texture of the activated carbon plays a significant role in the process. Thus, K-APC can be considered as a novel adsorbent for the removal of IC dye from waste effluents.",

    "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of different factors on the adsorption of Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ions from aqueous solution onto vermiculite. The ratio of the initial concentration of ions, C 0 , to the adsorbent concentration, W 0 , was shown to be the key factor determining the equilibrium ion adsorption density, q e . Subject to the magnitude of C 0 /W 0 , the value of q e could either attain its maximum level, q m (the maximum adsorption density), when the solid surface was fully saturated, or approach its critical limit, q c (the C 0 /W 0 ratio), when the ions in the bulk solution had been completely removed. The main mechanism for adsorption in the systems studied was ion-exchange. An increase in Zn 2+ or Cd 2+ ion adsorption from the single metal ion solution resulted in an increase in the concentrations of unadsorbed K + , Na + , Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ions remaining in the bulk solution. Competition between adsorbing ions was observed in the mixed K + –Zn 2+ –Cd 2+ ion system. Although temperature had a positive effect upon the adsorption of Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ions, its effect was statistically negligible over the range 15–45°C. The negative effect of decreasing pH values on the adsorption process was only significant below a pH value of 4.0, indicating that the adsorption of Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ions would be significantly depressed when high amounts of H + ions are present in the system.",

The effects of various parameters such as the impregnation ratio, activation temperature and time on the nitrogen adsorption isotherms, specific surface areas and pore volumes of the activated carbons were measured and analyzed in order to optimize the operational conditions. The nitrogen adsorption capacity of the activated carbons was significantly affected by the impregnation ratio and the activation temperature.

    "abstract": "Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the adsorption and movement of carbofuran on four divergent textured Indian soils at a fixed volume fraction (f s = 0.1) of methanol/water mixtures using batch equilibrium and soil thin layer chromatography (soil TLC) techniques. The measured equilibrium adsorption isotherms for silt loam (FSL and ASL) and loam (KL) soils were L-shaped and for sandy loam (BSL) soil S-shaped, all being well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm. A higher adsorption of carbofuran was observed on FSL followed by ASL, KL and BSL soils as anticipated by the values obtained for the Freundlich constant, K F and partition coefficient, K D . The Frontal Retardation factor (FR f ) values obtained from soil TLC studies were inversely proportional to the K F and K D values. The affinity of carbofuran towards organic carbon, organic matter and clay content of the soils was evaluated by calculating the K OC , K OM and K C values. The negative magnitude of the Gibbs'free energy (ΔG 0 ) indicated the spontaneity of the adsorption of carbofuran onto the soils studied. The leaching index (LI) of carbofuran calculated for the soils studied indicated its high potential to leach into shallow aquifers and ground water. Pearson's correlations calculated for K F and K D against the soil properties showed a highly significant correlation with the clay + silt content of the soils. Multiple regression of K F and K D against the soil properties indicated that the mineral content of the soils (clay and clay + silt) is the best predictor of carbofuran adsorption, followed by soil pH. Predicted log K OM values were also evaluated by using the aqueous solubility, the 1-octanol/ water partition coefficient (K OW ), the adsorbability index (AI) and the first-order molecular connectivity index ( 1 χ) of carbofuran. Use of the aqueous solubility, and the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (K OW ) to predict the extent of adsorption gave values which displayed a considerable error in comparison to those measured experimentally, whereas the use of the adsorbability index (AI) and the first-order molecular connectivity index ( 1 χ) of carbofuran improved the predictions considerably.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the sorptive removal of As 3+ with promising sorption efficiency up to a very low concentration has been investigated using chitosan–montmorillonite (MMT) composites (in the form of powder and beads). In addition, the recovery of the composite from the sorbent is proposed as well. The sorbent has been observed to show a sorption efficiency of 42.0% from 0.006 μg ml −1 of metal ion. The batch adsorption model was developed to predict the equilibrium adsorption capacity with respect to the pH of As 3+ solution, contact time and initial concentration of metal ion. The maximum As 3+ sorption capacity of 48.7 mg g −1 (achieved within 10 minutes of contact time) was obtained using chitosan–MMT beads at the pH of drinking water (8.0) at 298 K. The equilibrium sorption data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models and the model parameters were evaluated, wherein the Freundlich model shows the most favourable representation of As 3+ adsorption behaviour. The biocomposites show comparable high sorption capacity with detection and estimation of As 3+ from 0.004 (4.0 ppb) to 100.00 μg ml −1 (100.0 ppm) of aqueous solution. The adsorption kinetics demonstrated intra-particle diffusion as the rate-determining step during the initial phase of adsorption (up to 10 minutes of contact time), which were supported by X-ray diffraction studies; by contrast, chemisorption was found to be the rate-determining step during the later part of adsorption (after 10 minutes of contact time), which were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance studies. Desorption of As 3+ from the sorbents was optimized using potassium dihydrogen phosphate, wherein 0.1 M of the desorbate was found to be an appreciable regenerating agent supporting the reusability of the sorbent up to three cycles, retaining 4402 μg g −1 of the metal ion.",

Our results raise doubts that phenol is primarily adsorbed in flat position on the graphene layers, and consequently whether the adsorption forces are controlled by π–π dispersion interactions between the aromatic ring of phenol and the graphene layer structure. Based on the results of quantum mechanical calculations (carried out through various approaches), we conclude that neither surface oxidation nor the presence of a polarizable solvent is consistent with the claim that π–π interactions are dominant in the adsorption of phenolic compounds on graphite.",

The removal was greatest at medium acidity, which was equivalent to pH 2.0, and it was governed by two different processes, i.e. attachment onto un-ionized –COOH groups through hydrogen bonding and reduction to Au metal by the action of the –OH group. Purification of humin through repeated immersion and shaking in a mixed solution consisting of 0.1 M HCl and 0.05 M HF led to the abrupt increase in the –COOH contents from 386 mmol/kg to 2510 mmol/kg, while the content of total –OH functional groups remained relatively constant at values slightly higher than 3000 mmol/kg. The increase in –COOH content improved the removal of AuCl − 4 ions from 23 mg/g to 27 mg/g, but it was unfortunately accompanied by a diminished reduction ability to Au metal. Hence, the role of the –COOH functional group in removing AuCl − 4 ions through hydrogen bonding was more significant for the purified humin, while that of the –OH group in removing AuCl − 4 ions through reduction to Au metal was better for the crude (unpurified) humin.",

Dextrans are readily separated by solvent precipitation; however, continuous chromatographic separation (simulated moving bed or SMB) should be an interesting option for the enrichment and purification of IMOs from mono- and disaccharides. The objective of the present work was to measure fundamental adsorption data of IMOs, mono- and disaccharides in preparative columns packed with ion-exchange resin of different cationic forms (K + , Ca + , H + and Na + ), so as to verify the influence of the cation on the selectivity and capacity. Ion exchange in H + form showed the best performance in terms of selectivity between maltose and maltotriose, but the resin in the K + form had superior adsorption capacities. Additionally, on the basis of equilibrium theory, optimal SMB operating conditions for resin H + will yield the highest productivity as compared with the other cationic forms.",

Characterization of the metal ion–biomass interactions responsible for biosorption was studied employing zeta potential measurements, BET, FT-IR and EDX techniques; these indicated that the uptake of metal ions by non-living yeast was a surface adsorption phenomenon.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to quantify the loading, thermal stability and CO 2 capture capacity of the materials. Our results show that the amount of amine deposited did not depend on the solvent used, but was generally greater from more concentrated solutions, and increased with increasing molar mass. Deposition of amines was principally achieved by adsorption onto the mesopore walls, but without complete pore filling, and also, in some cases, by adsorption in the aerogel micropores. It was also concluded that the thermal stability of the amines deposited on the walls of the mesopores was independent of the solvent used, concentration or aerogel type. Preliminary studies of CO 2 adsorption–desorption were carried out and a good correlation between ln(C n ) and 1/T, where C n is the capacity at temperature T, was found. This enabled direct comparison to be made with published results obtained at different temperatures, and it was found that those obtained in this work were highly comparable with others found for amine-impregnated porous materials with similar amine loadings.",

Batch equilibrium assays showed that the tested adsorbents had good adsorption capacities, better than the ones reported previously for similar materials.

    "abstract": "Four activated carbons (ACs) activated by different activation methods from different precursors were heat-treated at 600℃ to decrease surface oxygen functional groups and to separate the effect of pore texture from surface chemistry on their sulfur adsorption performance. The ACs and the heat-treated ones were used as adsorbents for thiophene (T), dibenzothiophene (DBT), and 4,6-dimethyl dibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) for model fuels with or without a competing benzene. The correlations of surface functional groups and pore textures to their adsorption capacities for T, DBT and 4,6-DMDBT were investigated. Results indicated that the heat treatment not only decreased surface oxygen content, but also caused a pore texture modification. The adsorption isotherms can be well fitted by the Langmuir–Freundlich single solute isotherm. The sulfur adsorption capacity of ACs after the treatment for T, DBT, and 4,6-DMDBT has a good linear relationship with the pore volume of pores within 0.536–1.090, 0.536–1.179, and 0.679–1.268 nm, respectively. The decreased percentage of surface oxygen of ACs by the heat treatment is correlated linearly with the decreased percentage of the sulfur adsorption capacity for all the thiophenic compounds. Micropore filling via the π–π interaction is the dominant adsorption mechanism of thiophenic compounds for both the untreated and heat-treated ACs. Surface oxides contribute to the thiophenic adsorption by a cooperative interaction of the π–π interaction and the acid–base interaction between the basic sulfur atom and the acidic carbon atoms linked with oxygen in graphene edges. A flat adsorption is the most possible geometry in the adsorption of thiophenic compounds.",

    "abstract": "To understand methane adsorption characteristics on shale at high pressures, we conducted experiments of methane adsorption on dry shale up to 50 MPa and at 95.6 ℃, 75.6 ℃, and 40.6 ℃. Results show that the amount of excess adsorption on shale at high pressures is not the same as that at low pressures. The amount of adsorption increases with pressure until a peak value is reached and then declines with further pressure increases. Isosteric heat of adsorption is studied to explain the excess adsorption behavior. In addition, a new supercritical adsorption model was developed based on supercritical adsorption. This new model and Langmuir model were both used to fit the adsorption isotherms data. Langmuir model matched well with experiment data only at low pressures but failed at high pressures. The new model can fit the adsorption isotherms well, indicating that it reflects the characteristics of supercritical methane adsorption on shale at high pressure and temperature.",

    "abstract": "Adsorption and diffusion of lithium-ion on and between graphene layers are investigated by an analytical model, employing a pairwise potential, which can be approximated by the Lennard–Jones potential to express the interaction between lithium-ion and each carbon atom of graphene. The equilibrium position and binding energy of lithium-ion at three particular adsorption sites (hollow, bridge, and top) are calculated, and the adsorption stability is discussed. The results show that hollow site is the most stable adsorption site, and top site is the most unstable. The adsorption and diffusion of lithium-ion on different sizes of monolayer graphene are investigated and proved to be size and edge dependent. Moreover, lithium-ion would rather diffuse on the surface of graphene than through a hexagonal carbon ring to the other side no matter what the graphene sheet size is. In addition, two kinds of vacancy defects in graphene are considered to study the diffusion of lithium-ion. The vacancy defect can improve energy barrier, and if a vacancy defect is big enough, lithium-ion migrating through the vacancy area from one layer to another is feasible. The possible applications of present study include rechargeable lithium-ion graphene battery and Li storage in carbon material.",

The Langmuir isotherm model well expressed fluoride biosorption onto zirconium-doped N. oculata and the Freundlich isotherm model fitted well the data of zirconium-doped C. protothecoides. The correlation coefficients indicate that the fluoride biosorption onto zirconium-doped N. oculata, and C. protothecoides biosorbents correlated well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.

To reach that goal, studies have been conducted in batch and in continuous fixed bed column. Kinetic models of pseudo-first order and -second order and equilibrium isotherms of Langmuir and Freundlich were used to predict the metal accumulation behavior by free and immobilized biomass in a batch system. The data were best fit to kinetic model of second order, with coefficients of determination (R 2 ) greater than 0.98. Free cells were more efficient in the process than alginate pellets and it was not possible to model the results due to the very fast uptake. Equilibrium modelling indicated that both free and immobilized cells, as well as alginate pellets results were best fit to Langmuir equation due to the high R 2 value and similarity with experimental results. Dynamic column tests conducted with Ankistrodesmus sp. and Golenkinia sp. immobilized cells during 8 hours presented 80% efficiency in the removal of the metal, without reaching saturation. The high and fast ability of the microalgae to adsorb lanthanum corroborates their potential large-scale application.",

Concurrently, the occurring of phenolic compounds in aquatic ambit creates potential human health and environmental problems. There are a lot of technologies available for the treatment of organic pollutants. To remove phenol and chlorophenols, adsorption is a wastewater purification method. In this study, natural and activated clinoptilolite were carried out for the removal of phenol, ortho-chlorophenol, para-chlorophenol, and meta-chlorophenol. Activated clinoptilolite was prepared via acid activation and evaluated by means of Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis. Phenol and chlorophenols have high adsorption rate, and equilibrium was reached in approximately 30 min. The maximum adsorptions of phenol, ortho-chlorophenol, meta-chlorophenol, and para-chlorophenols on the activated clinoptilolite were 6.7386, 8.6300, 9.5787, and 7.3758 mg g −1 , respectively. The affinity order was in the following order: m-CP &gt; o-CP &gt; p-CP &gt; Ph. The adsorption of phenol and chlorophenols decreased after pH = 6.25. Using the thermodynamic data, Gibbs free energy of the activated clinoptilolite was evaluated. The effects of different conditions such as pH, adsorption time, and initial concentration were analyzed. The adsorption rates of phenol and chlorophenols were constituted to be the maximum at approximately pH 6.5. Desorption of phenol and chlorophenols was carried out using ethyl alcohol solution (30%, v/v). The adsorption isotherms of phenol and chlorophenols on activated clinoptilolite were evaluated. The equilibrium adsorption data were the best suited to Freundlich adsorption isotherm pattern.",

First order, pseudo-second order and Elovich adsorption kinetic models were applied for the kinetic studies. The experimental equilibrium data were analysed using the isotherms of Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin. Batch adsorption studies were performed for the removal of tartrazine azoic dye from aqueous solutions by two materials obtained at 600 °C (NAC-600) and 857 °C (NAC-857) and another two materials prepared at the same temperatures but simultaneously activated with steam (NAC-600-H 2 O and NAC-857-H 2 O). The zero point charge was between pH values of 9 to 11 and the maximum adsorption occurred when activated carbons were steam activated and were 4.47 and 13.66 mg g −1 for NAC-600-H 2 O and NAC-857-H 2 O respectively. The results clearly showed that the adsorption of A5 onto carbonaceous materials from nut shells (NAC) best fit to the pseudo second- order model, and the rate constants were in the range from 489.3 to 509.4 g mg −1 h −1 . Maximum uptake capacity of tartrazine was comparable to values encountered in the literature for other carbonaceous materials. The results show that under specific activation conditions, Mexican pecan nut shells, as agricultural residues, present high potential as a raw material to produce alternative adsorbent materials for dyes removal from aqueous solutions.",

    "abstract": "The discharges enriched with heavy metals, particularly Cr(VI), are a serious environmental problem. In this work, it is presented the use of biosorbents from eggshells membranes of ostrich, quail, duck and chicken; the membranes were easily prepared and studied for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions. Maximum uptake of 1.41 mmol g −1 membrane permitted the identification of ostrich membrane as the material with the highest Cr(VI) uptake. N 2 adsorption experiments permitted to classify ostrich membranes as mesoporous materials, since they had pore size of 14.8 nm. This represented an advantage on the nature of these membranes to be used as biosorbents with respect to other membranes. The adsorption isotherm models such as Langmuir and Freundlich were verified using experimental data. Langmuir model described the adsorption process satisfactorily at pH 1 and 2 whereas Freundlich model fitted data better at pH 3 and 5. The adsorption kinetic data were adjusted to a pseudo-second order kinetic model. TGA results permitted demonstrating a low thermal stability of ostrich membrane, since it starts decomposing at around 50°C due to the fact that membranes have about 60% protein. Through SEM microscopy was possible to observe the morphology of the membrane surfaces before and after Cr(VI) uptake which reflects the textural characteristics of the biosorbent. FTIR and XPS analyses suggested that Cr was adsorbed on ostrich membranes through the amine groups of proteins conforming the fibers of membranes. Despite the oxygen shows higher electronegativity than N, Cr shows more preference toward N due to fact that pH conditions favor the positive charges on the surface of the membrane. Our results make evident that this waste material is a novel and efficient option for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions.",

Results showed that silicon fertilizer and biochar addition significantly changed soil properties, including pH, total organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate.

Principal component analysis shows that the difference in soil microbial community structure is the most obvious under the combined addition of biochar, silicon fertilizer and biochar.

Four different types of carbon dots are present, according to the way of manufacturing and application the type is chosen. The water-soluble characteristics of carbon dots help them be involved in biomedicine applications. The optical properties of the carbon dots find applications as drug delivery, biosensors, LED, etc. The properties like fluorescence, photoluminescence, and phosphorescence are found in the carbon dots. The carbon dots occupy the tiny spot that exhibits different optical properties on excitation. The carbon dots excitation is mainly due to surface states. The characterization of surface states is very complex. The surface states contain the core structure of carbon and oxygen functional groups on the surfaces. The anions and cations formed from functional groups on excitation will recombine themselves. The functional groups are usually carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The Π-collaborative network of the electronic structure contains many quantization levels which help the carbon dots to produce different wavelengths adapting to different applications. Due to the interference of the structure of the carbon dots, the entire property will vary. Doping of heteroatom methods is employed to enhance the fluorescence, and photoluminescence property carried out. They used N, S, P, and B heteroatoms singly and in combination to doping carbon dots. Here, the paper proposes the sulphur dioxide adsorption technique to enhance the optical properties of the carbon dots.

    "abstract": "Nanofluids made of TiO 2 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes are the focus of our study. Using TiO 2 and water as the basic fluids, nanofluids were created in 100 : 0, 75 : 25, and 50 : 50 proportions. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were disseminated into these base fluids of three types at 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 percentages. Over the course of two months, the change of zeta potential is monitored to assess the stability of the dispersion. XRD analysis and SEM and TEM analysis are carried out for TiO 2 nanofluids. Nanoparticles were analyzed using EDAX analysis to identify their composition. SEM examination was used to investigate the morphology for TiO 2 nanoparticles. Particles of TiO 2 produced in this manner seemed to have an average diameter of 27 nm. Nanofluids have a poor stability, which is the most important aspect of employing them, although most studies did not focus on this. When it comes to nanofluids, this study is unique in that it provides an in-depth look of surface modification approaches that have been employed by researchers to address these issues, as well as an evaluation of their stability over two months. Solubility is improved by acid treatment of CNTs, which results in functional groups on the surface of CNTs.",

    "abstract": "Organic filament-based lightweight materials are increasingly being used because of their high strength-to-weight ratio, recyclability, and low cost. The application of nanofillers in addition to natural fibres is a fascinating one. The main purpose of the current experimental investigation is to manufacture and estimate the mechanical material of nanocomposites. Natural fibres like flax and sisal are used as reinforcement; nanosilica particles act as fillers, and epoxy resin as a matrix. The composites were created using the Taguchi L 9 orthogonal array and a hand lay-up technique. The mechanical and water retention behaviour of the hybrid composites is based on the following three parameters, each with three different levels: (i) adding different weight ratios of nanofiller (1.5, 3, and 4.5 wt%), (ii) weight ratio of reinforcements (20, 30, and 40 wt%), and (iii) duration of NaOCl conditions (2, 4, and 6 hours). Mechanical possessions like tension, bending, and impact were tested as per the ASTM standard. The tested composites show that 30 wt% reinforcement, 3 wt% nanosilica, and 4 hours of alkaline processing provide the best materials and aquatic preoccupation belongings. When compared to nanofiller composites, nanoparticle-filled composites have 17% evolution in tension, 22% upsurge in flexural strength, 13% in impact strength, and 36% increase in impact strength hygroscopic behaviour. Scanning electron microscopes were used to analyze the fractured structure of hybrid composites. Compared to 1.5 and 4.5 wt% of nanofiller, the 3 wt% of filler provides high interfacial adhesion to the hybrid composites. It helps the reinforcement and matrix to contact each other.",

    "abstract": "The development of advanced materials for the removal of heavy metal ions is a never-ending quest of environmental remediation. In this study, a facile and cost-effective approach was employed to synthesize copper ferrite (CF) and copper ferrite/reduced graphene oxide (CG) by microwave assisted combustion method for potential removal of barium ions from aqueous medium. The physiochemical characterizations indicated the formation of magnetic nanocomposite with an average crystallite size of CF and CG is 32.4 and 30.3 nm and with specific surface area of 0.66 and 5.74 m 2 /g. The magnetic results possess multidomain microstructures with saturation magnetization of 37.11 and 33.84 emu/g for CF and CG. The adsorption studies prove that upon addition of rGO on the spherical spinel ferrite, the adsorption performance was greatly improved for CG nanocomposite when compared with the bare CF nanoparticles. The proposed magnetic adsorbent demonstrated a relatively high Ba 2+ adsorption capacity of 161.6 mg·g -1 for CG nanocomposite when compared to 86.6 mg·g -1 for CF nanoparticles under optimum conditions ([Formula: see text]). The pseudo-first-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO), and Elovich models were fitted to the kinetic data, the yielded [Formula: see text] value of 0.9993 (PSO) for CF and 0.9994 (PSO) for CG which is greater than the other two models, which signify that the adsorption process is chemisorption. Thermodynamic studies show that barium adsorption using CF and CG adsorbents is endothermic. The as-fabricated CuFe 2 O 4 /rGO nanocomposite represents a propitious candidate for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions.",

Magnetic mesoporous carbon was achieved by chemical activation of macadamia nutshell with Fe(NO 3 ) 3 under nitrogen atmosphere at 850°C (MMC-850). Porosity of MMC-850 included S BET 317 m 2 /g with V micro 0.0796 cm 3 /g and considerably high V meso 0.4318 cm 3 /g. Not only did MMC-850 possesses good magnetic properties with saturation magnetization and coercive force of 31.48 emu/g and 506.6 O e , respectively, but MMC-850 also showed high-removal efficiency of reactive black dye (RB5) with maximum adsorption capacity at 123.51 mg/g. The experimental data fit the Langmuir isotherm and Elovich model. Thermal regeneration was effective in degrading RB5 and removal ability was above 90% after two regeneration cycles. RB5 removal from water by MMC-850 as an adsorbent is considered a facile and inexpensive method since macadamia nutshell is a food by-product which is a green and renewable carbon precursor. MMC-850 is a potential adsorbent because it can be separated from wastewater treatment system using magnetic force. Besides, MMC-850 particle is not brittle compared to other porous biochar/activated carbon with similar size; therefore, it is an excellent candidate for column packing or scaling up for wastewater treatment facilities in the future.",

    "abstract": "This study is aimed at extending the soybean hulls’ lifetime by their utilization as an adsorbent for metal ions (Cd 2+ and Cu 2+ ) and dyes (Reactive Yellow 39 (RY 39) and Acid Blue 225 (AB 225)). ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, FE-SEM microscopy, and zeta potential measurements were used for adsorbent characterization. The effect of the solution’s pH, peroxidase extraction, adsorbent particle size, contact time, the pollutant’s initial concentration, and temperature on the soybean hulls’ adsorption potential was studied. Before peroxidase extraction, soybean hulls were capable of removing 72% Cd 2+ , 71% Cu 2+ (at a pH of 5.00) or 81% RY 39, and 73% AB 225 (at a pH of 3.00). For further experiments, soybean hulls without peroxidase were used for several reasons: (1) due to their observed higher metal ion removal, (2) in order to reduce the waste disposal cost after the peroxidase (usually used for wastewater decolorization) extraction, and (3) since the soybean hulls without peroxidase possessed significantly lower secondary pollution than those with peroxidase. Cd 2+ and Cu 2+ removal was slightly increased when the smaller adsorbent fraction (710-1000 μm) was used, while the adsorbent particle size did not have an impact on dye removal. After 30 min of contact time, 92% and 88% of RY 39 and AB 225 were removed, respectively, while after the same contact time, 80% and 69% of Cd 2+ and Cu 2+ were removed, respectively. Adsorption of all tested pollutants follows a pseudo-second-order reaction through the fast adsorption, intraparticle diffusion, and final equilibrium stage. The maximal adsorption capacities determined by the Langmuir model were 21.10, 20.54, 16.54, and 17.23 mg/g for Cd 2+ , Cu 2+ , RY 39, and AB 225, respectively. Calculated thermodynamic parameters suggested that the adsorption of all pollutants is spontaneous and of endothermic character. Moreover, different binary mixtures were prepared, and the competitive adsorptions revealed that the soybean hulls are the most efficient adsorbent for the mixture of AB 225 and Cu 2+ . The findings of this study contribute to the soybean hulls’ recovery after the peroxidase extraction and bring them into the circular economy concept.",

As a factor of adsorbent particle size, adsorbent dosage, training time, and starting concentrations, the adsorption capacity for each medicinal ingredient was examined. SEM was used to analyze a nanomaterial that had been chemically altered with orthophosphoric acid (FTIR). To determine the residual proportion of PCM in solvent, batch adsorption of PCM was then carried out at various operation conditions, including contact time, temperatures, and initial dosage. The adsorption effectiveness of paracetamol on carbon-activated nanoparticle was calculated using experimental results.

This solid waste material is chosen as an adsorbent for the current study since it is available abundantly in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, and has not been used for any other applications. The current study was conducted to get rid of the element chromium (VI) from wastewater by using the adsorption process. The aged refuse was analytically tested through various processes such as BET, TGA, XRD, SEM, and FTIR to determine the surface morphology, functional groups, thermal stability, nature of the crystalline, and surface area. The researchers conducted the batch adsorption study to validate the influence exerted by different sorts of adsorption parameters like contact time (10-100 min), initial concentration of the pollutant (50 mg·L -1 to 250 mg·L -1 ), pH (1-7), and the dosage of the adsorbent (0.5 g·L -1 -3.0 g·L -1 ). In the current study, the researchers achieved the maximum adsorption capacity of 195.54 mg·g -1 . From the kinetic results, it can be understood that the pseudo-first-order model was the most suitable kinetic model. Further, the study outcomes confirm that the Langmuir isotherm model is the best fit by isotherm studies which indicate the monolayer adsorption process.

    "abstract": "The mining and electroplating industries have resulted in the contamination of the environment with heavy metal. This has resulted in a serious threat to the ecological environment and human health due to the presence of copper pollution. To address this issue, extensive efforts have been made to develop effective methods for removing contaminants, particularly heavy metal, and Samanea saman (SS) was selected as precursor production of activated carbon. Therefore, this study is aimed at investigating Samanea saman-activated carbon (SSAC) to remove copper from an aqueous solution. SS was chemically activated by potassium carbonate and carbonized at 600°C for 5 hours, while SSAC was characterized by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and proximate tests. Copper adsorption on SSAC was evaluated by the Langmuir, Freundlich, Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, Harkin-Jura, and Jovanovic models. Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models were used to identify adsorption process mechanism. SEM-EDS results presented that the pore of SSAC was heterogeneous, irregular in shape, and mesopore. In addition, FTIR analysis identified the main functional groups present in SSAC as C-H, C-O-C, and C-O. The proximate test conducted on SSAC determined the water content, volatile matter, ash content, and fixed carbon to be 0.61%, 22.26%, 9.77%, and 67.97%, respectively. The results showed that SSAC exhibited exceptional performance with copper removal efficiency of 99.49% under an adsorbent mass of 0.25 g, a reaction time of 30 minutes, and a concentration of 10 mg/L. Isotherm adsorption of SSAC followed the Redlich-Peterson model with an adsorption capacity (Qm) of 0.663 mg/g, correlation value ([Formula: see text]) of 0.9992, and pseudo-second-order pattern [Formula: see text]. Therefore, SSAC can be proposed as a potential and economical biomaterial to treat heavy metal in wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Activated carbon was prepared from almond husks by activation at different temperatures in the absence (MAC-I) and presence (MAC-II) of H 2 SO 4 . The ability of the activated carbon to remove zinc(II) ions by adsorption from aqueous solutions was investigated, varying several conditions such as pH, the carbonisation temperature of the husk, the initial concentration of metal ions, the contact time and the adsorbent concentration. The optimum conditions were found to be a pH value of 5.5, a carbonisation temperature of 700°C, a contact time of 60 min and an adsorbent concentration of 4 g/l. The results obtained indicated that effective uptake of Zn(II) ions was achieved when the carbon prepared by heating almond husks at 700°C was activated by the addition of H 2 SO 4 . A 92% removal of Zn(II) ions was achieved at an initial concentration of 20 mg/l and an adsorbent concentration of 4 g/l. When the adsorbent concentration was increased to 40 g/l, the adsorption density decreased from 4.5 mg/g to 0.47 mg/g for MAC-II. The Langmuir and Freundlich constants were both calculated, and the data found to be fitted reasonably well by the Langmuir isotherm. The adsorption capacities for MAC-I and MAC-II as calculated from the Langmuir isotherm were 30.864 mg/g and 35.336 mg/g, respectively.",

An inversion of the adsorption capacity of phenol with temperature has been observed, probably as a consequence of the high microporosity of the carbon and the restricted accessibility of phenol to the smaller pores. Adsorption at 40°C is also accompanied by the degradation of phenol by aerobic micro-organisms (ficomicetus-type fungi). Approximate values of the isosteric heats of adsorption of p-nitrophenol have been calculated, being in the range 5.8–6.5 kcal/mol.

First, the textural properties and the surface oxygen content as well as the surface acidities of the activated carbons studied were determined by nitrogen adsorption, XPS and Boehm titration methods. The water vapour isotherms of the samples were then measured and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were conducted to estimate the desorption activation energy, E d , of water on the activated carbons. The effects of pore structure and surface oxygen content of the activated carbons on the magnitude of E d are discussed. The results obtained show that the surface acidities of the activated carbons were in direct proportion to their surface oxygen contents, with the value of E d for water on the activated carbons increasing with increasing surface oxygen content and decreasing pore size of the activated carbons. When the magnitude of the surface acidity was 0.578, 0.436 and 0.338 mmol/g, respectively, the E d for water had corresponding values of 48.61, 41.67 and 37.22 kJ/mol, respectively. The amount of water vapour adsorbed at lower relative humidity increased with increasing surface acidity, whilst it was dependent on the pore volume at higher relative humidity due to pore filling, i.e. the larger the total pore volume of the activated carbons, the larger their adsorption capacities towards for water vapour.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we explain the removal of harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by adsorbing them on activated carbon fibres (ACFs). For this purpose, we prepared a significant number of ACFs with different surface chemistries and porosity developments, and analyzed the effect of these two variables on VOC adsorption. Our results showed that at low concentrations (around 1000 ppmv), pore size distribution (PSD) is the main parameter that controls the removal of VOC. Therefore, a narrow PSD with a mean pore size between 0.8 and 1.0 nm is most appropriate to achieve high VOC adsorption capacities at these concentrations. However, at lower concentrations (P/P 0 &lt; 10 −2 ), VOC adsorption capacity depends on different adsorbent properties (not only on the PSD but also on the surface chemistry) and on the polarity of the VOC. For this reason, the selection of the activating agent (CO 2 or H 2 O) has an important influence on the adsorption process depending on the polarity of the organic compound to be adsorbed. Thus, for example, steam activation would be better for the adsorption of polar compounds because of the higher amount of surface oxygenated groups developed from the steam activation.",

    "abstract": "A high surface area activated carbon was synthesized by potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation of Finger Citron residue. The pore structure of the as-synthesized activated carbon was characterized by nitrogen adsorption and its carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sorption capacities at different conditions were measured under high pressure. The BET surface area and total pore volume of the as-synthesized sample were 2887 m 2 /g and 1.23 cm 3 /g, respectively. The dry sample exhibited a CO 2 adsorption capacity of 19.21 mmol/g at 276 K and 3.57 MPa. The CO 2 adsorption uptake increased considerably when an amount of water was pre-adsorbed onto the sample, possibly as a result of the formation of CO 2 hydrate in the pore spaces of the activated carbon. The maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity of the wet sample was found to be 29.02 mmol/g at 273 K and 3.57 MPa. Overall, the results reported confirm that Finger Citron residue could prove a promising precursor for high surface area activated carbon and point to the potential application of activated carbon made from Finger Citron residue in carbon capture and storage.",

To quantify the extent of the surface hydrophilicity, which is due to the effect of nitrogen doping, we carried out water adsorption at 298 K, and found that the adsorbed amount of water is proportional to the nitrogen content over the low-pressure region (P/P0 &lt; 0.3).

Impregnation in 20% phosphoric acid for 2 h at 170 °C and subsequent air activation at 600 °C for 3 h significantly enhanced the adsorption capacities of both algae relative to their inactivated states. Parameters influencing the adsorption capacity such as contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH and temperature were studied. Similar experiments were carried out with commercially available Merck activated carbon (MAC) for comparative purposes. Adsorption efficiencies were measured at a pH 2 and dosages of 8 g/ℓ and 12 g/ℓ for PGA and PBA, respectively. Batch adsorption experiments resulted in maximum adsorption capacities determined from Langmuir models of up to 263, 93 and 84 mg/g for PGA, PBA and MAC, respectively. BET, FT-IR analyses, iodine number and Methylene Blue index determination were also performed to characterize the prepared adsorbents. The adsorption kinetics were found to comply with the pseudo-second-order model with intra-particle diffusion being the rate-determining step. Thermodynamic analysis confirmed that the adsorption reaction was spontaneous and endothermic.

In fact, complete Hg(II) removal is only obtained with the sulphur-containing activated carbons.",

This study investigated the adsorption performance of Hg(II) ions by PP-PAM and the effect of various influencing factors on Hg(II) ion adsorption. The experiment indicated that the Hg(II) adsorption capacity of the PP-PAM increased with the increase of the pH, and the Hg(II) adsorption kinetics was consistent with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption isotherm followed the Langmuir model, with the maximum adsorption capacity calculated to be 0.854 mmol/g for Hg(II) ions.

Experimental results showed that the surface areas of modified polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber increased by 58.54% and pore width increased by 40.19% compared with unmodified polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber. Boehm’s titration results show the surface acid sites of composite material were increased by 712% compared with unmodified polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber.

Furthermore, the results showed the whole sorption process was a good fit to Lagergren pseudo-second-order model and Freundlich isotherms model. Therefore, the results infer that there was a heterogeneous distribution of active sites, and then the sorption process was chemical adsorption and multilayer adsorption.

    "abstract": "The adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 on carbon molecular sieves was studied based on the adsorption potential theory, which is widely used in gas adsorption on microporous adsorbents. The methods to obtain the adsorption density in the adsorbed phase, including Ozawa’s method and the empirical method, and the methods to calculate the virtual saturation vapor pressure, including Dubinin’s method and Amankwah’s method, were discussed. A functional exponential form proposed in this study could describe the adsorption characteristic curve better than the cubic polynomial and logarithmic function used in the previous literature. A new model, which expresses the correlation of adsorbed amount, temperature, and pressure, was proposed and verified experimentally. The model provides a reliable way to predict the adsorption isotherms of CO 2 and CH 4 on carbon molecular sieves at different temperatures according to the data measured at a certain temperature and to select a proper kind of carbon molecular sieve in CO 2 /CH 4 separation.",

    "abstract": "This work is framed within the Eighth Industrial Fluid Properties Simulation Challenge, with the aim of assessing the capability of molecular simulation methods and force fields to accurately predict adsorption in porous media for systems of relevant practical interest. The current challenge focuses on predicting adsorption isotherms of n-perfluorohexane in the certified reference material BAM-P109 standard activated carbon. A temperature of T=273 K and pressures of p/p0=0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 relative to the bulk saturation pressure p0 (as predicted by the model) are the conditions selected in this challenge. In our methodology we use coarse-grained intermolecular models and a top-down technique where an accurate equation of state is used to link the experimental macroscopic properties of a fluid to the force-field parameters. The state-of-the-art version of the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) for potentials of variable range as reformulated in the Mie group contribution incarnation (SAFT-γ Mie) is employed here. The parameters of the SAFT-γ Mie force field are estimated directly from the vapour pressure and saturated liquid density data of the pure fluids using the equation of state, and further validated by molecular dynamic simulations. The coarse-grained intermolecular potential models are then used to obtain the adsorption isotherm kernels for argon, carbon dioxide, and n-perfluorohexane in graphite slit pores of various widths using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. A unique and fluid-independent pore size distribution curve with total micropore volume of 0.5802 cm3/g is proposed for the BAM-P109. The pore size distribution is obtained by applying a non-linear regression procedure over the adsorption integral equation to minimise the quadratic error between the available experimental adsorption isotherms for argon and carbon dioxide and purpose-built Grand Canonical Monte Carlo kernels. The predicted adsorption levels of n-perfluorohexane at 273 K in BAM-P109 are 72.75 ± 0.01, 73.82 ± 0.01, and 75.44 ± 0.05 cm3/g at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) conditions for p/p0=0.1, 0.3, and 0.6, respectively.",

The challenge focused on the adsorption of perfluorohexane in the activated carbon standard BAM-P109. Entrants were challenged to predict the adsorption of perfluorohexane in the activated carbon at a temperature of 273 K and at relative pressures of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6. The relative pressure (P/P o ) is defined as that relative to the bulk saturation pressure predicted by the fluid model at a given temperature (273 K in this case). The predictions were judged by comparison to a set of experimentally determined values, which are published here for the first time and were not disclosed to the entrants prior to the challenge. Benchmark experimental studies, described herein, were also carried out and provided to entrants in order to aid in the development of new force fields and simulation methods to be employed in the challenge. These studies included argon, carbon dioxide, and water adsorption in the BAM-P109 activated carbon as well as X-ray diffraction, X-ray microtomography, photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic emission spectroscopy studies of BAM-P109. Several concurrent studies were carried out for the BAM-P108 activated carbon. These are included in the current manuscript for comparison.",

The cost of functionalization also hinders the use of hydrophobic materials as sorbents. Novel hydrophilic silicas, prepared at low temperature and ambient pressure, were characterised by SEM, FTIR and BET analysis, and studied for the adsorption of aqueous phase organic compounds at concentrations below their solubility limits. Adsorption capacities were found to be up to 264 mg/g for benzene and 78.8 mg/g for toluene. Direct comparison is made with the analogous hydrophobic version of one of the silica materials, demonstrating comparable uptakes for benzene concentrations lower than 50 mg/L. This finding supports the hypothesis that, at very low aqueous phase organic concentrations, hydrophobicization has no discernible effect on access of the pollutants to the internal porosity of the material.",

The knowledge about surface free energy is very helpful for understanding the processes taking place on the surface. However, experimental determination of solid surface free energy is still not a fully solved problem. In this paper, some problems dealing with calculation of solid surface free energy from contact angle are discussed based on literature values of advancing and receding contact angles measured on four different fluoropolymers surface. The four approaches most often used for the calculation are described and especial focus on the approach in which both the advancing and receding contact angles is paid. It is concluded that using probing liquids the absolute value of solid surface free energy cannot be determined. However, the determined apparent values of the energy are very helpful to understand the conditions necessary for a given process to occur.",

In this paper, the cylindrical bituminous coal cores of Xutuan coal mine in Huaibei coal mine group were studied as experimental objects, using the laboratory self-designed experimental device Gas Adsorption and Strain Testing Apparatus system. The influence of the bituminous coal moisture content on gas adsorption characteristics was studied. Drying experiments of coal samples showed that they lose the original moisture content following the exponential decay function of time. At wetting, the saturated moisture content in coal samples increased following the Exponential Association function of time. The experimental results show that the average original moisture content and average saturated moisture content of raw coal samples are 1.3 and 2.4%, respectively. On this basis, the gas adsorption experiments on samples with different moisture contents under different gas pressures were carried out. With the moisture content increase, the gas adsorption capacity and saturation value decreased and the decrease rate gradually reduced. The single exponential decay function describes the gas adsorption capacity dependence on moisture content. Moisture content also affects the adsorption deformation of bituminous coal. At high moisture content, the adsorption deformation of bituminous coal is less.",

The results revealed that the production of MBFA9 could be increased significantly by adding a small amount of carbon and nitrogen to food wastewater. Under the best experimental conditions (pH 8.5, culture temperature 30°C, 150 r/min), adding 1% (m/v) carbon and 0.1% (m/v) nitrogen to 1% (v/v) wastewater resulted in a yield of MBFA9 of 6.29 g/l.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that bacterial cells, metabolite small molecule acids, and MBFA9 in FBA9 all contributed to the removal of Pb(II). Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry analysis indicated that functional groups such as –OH, –COOH, –CO, and –NH 2 existed in MBFA9 and on the cell surface.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel polymerized fiber doped with metal–organic frameworks (UIO-66(Zr)-NH2) was developed in a capillary by microwave irradiation. The fiber was successfully prepared using 4-vinyl pyridine as the monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the cross-linker to reinforce its durability. The resultant fiber was applied to extract sulfonylurea herbicides from environmental soil and water samples before analysis with high-performance liquid chromatography. The optimization of different parameters affecting solid-phase microextraction procedure was carried out. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the extraction capability of the hybrid fiber was two times greater than that of the polymer fiber without UIO-66(Zr)-NH2.The proposed hybrid fiber extraction method exhibited low detection limits (0.19–1.79 µg/l), good precision (<12.0%), and wide linear range (10–700 µg/l). Satisfactory recoveries of sulfonylurea herbicides were obtained with spiked soil and water samples in the range of 75.7–94.2 and 82.2–95.3%, respectively.",

The sorption performance of SE-1 for selective removal of nitrate in aqueous solution was compared to a commercially available nitrate specialty resin, namely Purolite A 520E (A 520E). It was found that the kinetic data could be described better by the pseudo-second-order model, and SE-1 indicated a faster sorption kinetics than A 520E resin. The Langmiur model was more appropriate for explicating the sorption isotherm. Importantly, SE-1 exhibited a greater sorption capacity for nitrate regardless of the absence or presence of competing anions in solutions. The result of column tests reinforced the feasibility of SE-1 for practical application in groundwater treatment.",

Within this paper, the carbon/MIL-53(Fe) composite was fabricated via an in situ synthesis, in which N-containing carbon dots (NCDs) were mixed with MOF precursors’ solutions under various ratios before going through the solvothermal stage. It was showed that the introduction of a certain amount of NCDs would affect characteristic features and improve the photocatalytic performance of final products. The optimal doping content of NCDs in NCD/MIL-53(Fe) composite was determined. SEM images showed that the M-140 appeared as hexagonal bipyramid-shaped crystals with an average size of 700 nm. Compared with pristine MIL-53(Fe), the M-140 was more visibly light-responsive, and its calculated band gap energy was approximately 2.3 eV. In addition, M-140 catalyst also displayed more excellent photocatalytic activity for Methylene Blue degradation in a pH range from 5 to 7. Under optimal conditions, MB was achieved within 60 minutes and the removal rate was nearly 100% after 5 cycles. The photocatalytic mechanism of the obtained NCD/MIL-53(Fe) composite was discussed.",

    "abstract": "In this study, nano zero-valent iron-reduced graphene oxide (NZVI-rGO) composites were synthesized to remove 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) as an efficient adsorbent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that NZVI particles were successfully loaded and dispersed uniformly on rGO nanosheets. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that the interaction between NZVI-rGO and 2,4-DCP promoted the adsorption process. A three-level, four-factor Box-Behnken design (BBD) of the response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the influencing factors including NZVI-rGO dosage, 2,4-DCP initial concentration, reaction time and initial pH. A statistically significant, well-fitting quadratic regression model was successfully constructed to predict 2,4-DCP removal rate. The high [Formula: see text] value (15.95), very low [Formula: see text] value (&lt;0.0001), nonsignificant lack of fit, and appropriate coefficient of determination ([Formula: see text]) demonstrate a good correlation between the experimental and predicted values of the proposed model. The analyses of variance reveal that NZVI-rGO dosage and reaction time have a positive effect on 2,4-DCP removal, whereas the increase of contaminant concentration and initial pH inhibit the removal, whereas the effect of contaminant concentration and initial pH is in reverse, where the change of NZVI-rGO dosage has the greatest effect. The optimum condition is1.215 g/L of NZVI-rGO dosage, 20.856 mg/L of 2,4-DCP concentration, 4.115 of pH, and 8.157 min of reaction time.

Adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of this separation method were studied at different conditions of pH and temperature. Results showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of these bioalcohols were obtained at pH 6 and 20°C. An exothermic separation was identified, which can be mainly associated to hydrophobic interactions between bone char surface and bioalcohols. Binary adsorption studies were also performed using mixtures of these bioalcohols. An antagonistic adsorption was observed for all bioalcohols where the ethanol and propanol separation was significantly affected by butanol. A model based on an artificial neural network was proposed to correlate both single and binary adsorption isotherms of these bioalcohols with bone char. It was concluded that the bone char could be an interesting adsorbent for the sustainable separation and recovery of bioalcohols from fermentation broths, which are actually considered emerging liquid biofuels and relevant industrial chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Due to the complexity of the internal structure of natural coal and its characteristic of multicomponent, the depth of its methane adsorption potential well is nonuniform, which makes it difficult to accurately evaluate the adsorption capacity of coal. Besides, in order to find out the factors affecting the depth distribution of potential wells in natural coal, this paper calculated the depth and number of potential wells during methane adsorption in coal according to the Langmuir adsorption kinetics process. Coal samples with different metamorphic degrees were tested and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy diffraction technology. The relationship between the structural parameters of functional groups in coal samples with different metamorphic degrees and the distribution of different depths of adsorption potential wells in coal samples was studied. Some main conclusions are as follows: The number of adsorption potential wells at different depths in natural coal with different metamorphic degrees has multipeak distribution characteristics. With the increase of the metamorphic degree of coal sample, the structures such as aliphatic branched chain structure and oxygen-containing functional groups in coal structure break, fall off, and deoxygenate. The relative content of aliphatic hydrocarbons is significantly reduced and condensed into aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic ring structures. The different types and quantities of functional groups on the surface of coal samples lead to different forces between coal molecules and methane gas molecules, thus affecting the distribution of different depths of adsorption potential wells in coal samples.",

However, the rapid aggregation of nZVIs significantly affects their mobility and reactivity, which considerably limits the practical applications. Montmorillonite- (Mt-) supported nZVI (Mt-nZVI) has received increasing attention for the past decade because it can prevent the aggregation of nZVI and incorporate the advantages of both nZVI and Mt in soil and water treatment. This work thus had a comprehensive review on the use of Mt-nZVI for soil and water treatment. We first summarized existing methods used to prepare Mt-nZVI, indicating the advantages of using Mt to support nZVI (e.g., increase of the dispersion and mobility of nZVI, reduction of the size and oxidation tendency of nZVI). We then presented the reaction mechanisms of Mt-nZVI for contaminant removal and evaluated the critical factors that influence the removal (e.g., pH, temperature, and dosage of the adsorbent). We further presented examples of applications of Mt-nZVI for the removal of typical contaminants such as heavy metals and organic compounds in soil and water. We finally discussed the limitations of the use of Mt-nZVI for water treatment and soil remediation and presented future directions for the application of nZVI technology for soil and water treatment.",

    "abstract": "Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) is one of the contaminants present in the environment. They are the by-product of combustion, industrial pollution, generation of electricity, etc. After some reactions in the atmosphere, SO 2 changes its form and produces acid rain. The presence of SO 2 needs to be detected to combat its effect. Many nanosensors are designed to detect the presence of SO 2 in the environment. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire sensor is one of those sensors used for SO 2 detection. The size, structure, cost-effectiveness, and unique properties made it a choice for sensing purposes. Activated carbon is another compound that has porous substances that helps the adsorbate to settle down on the large surface area of its adsorbent surfaces. Combining the nature of ZnO nanowire and activated carbon, the adsorption of SO 2 can be increased. This paper proposes a novel technique involving the activated carbon in the ZnO nanowire sensor to increase its SO 2 adsorption capacity and rate. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm is used to find the adsorption efficiency between the solid adsorbent and gaseous adsorbate. MATLAB simulation was carried out for the proposed work in which it is seen that the novel method shows 33.34% efficiency in terms of SO 2 adsorption capacity. The response of the proposed sensor shows 23% efficiency over time. The analysis shows that the usage of the activated carbon increases the adsorbent site for SO 2 adsorbate to adsorb on the surfaces. According to the adsorption quantity, SO 2 level has been obtained in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Dye pollution is a serious threat to aquatic environment and human health. Although activated carbon is an efficient adsorbent for dye reclamation from effluents, its expressive nature renders its use on large commercial scales. On the other hand, waste biomasses are not effectively used for any beneficial purposes. Sawdust is a waste biomass of wood mills, and due to its small particle sizes, it has the potential to be used as adsorbent. In spite of its uses for cooking purposes, it is sometimes used as adsorbent as such or converted into activated carbon. In raw form, it is not a good adsorbent; however, its adsorption capacity can be increased by applying chemical modifications. In the present study, sawdust of paper mulberry ( Broussonetia papyrifera) was used as adsorbent for the removal of basic blue 3 and methylene green from water after chemical modification with NaOH and HCl in 1 : 1. The prepared adsorbent was characterized by SEM and FTIR, whereas the surface area was estimated through an already reported method in literature. Batch experiments were performed to determine the isothermal and kinetic parameters of the selected dyes adsorption on activated sawdust. The effect of adsorbent dosage and temperature on adsorption were also evaluated. The best fit of the kinetic data was achieved with pseudosecond-order model for which [Formula: see text] values were approximately equal to 1 whereas Langmuir model was most suitable model to explain the isothermal data. The optimum adsorbent dosage was 0.05 g for both of the selected dyes. Different thermodynamic parameters, such as enthalpy ([Formula: see text] and 8.334 kJ/mol respectively for basic blue 3 and methylene green), entropy ([Formula: see text] and 29.22 kJ/molK respectively for basic blue 3 and methylene green), and Gibbs free energy ([Formula: see text], -410, and -1658 kJ/mol (basic blue)/-65, -519, and -1139 kJ/mol (methylene green), were estimated, and the process was found to be endothermic, spontaneous, and feasible. The increase in [Formula: see text] with increase in temperature indicates that the adsorption process is favorable at high temperature. The prepared adsorbent could be effectively used in the reclamation of water loaded with other contaminants; however, further experiments are needed to increase the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent.",

From the kinetic study, the rate of the reaction follows the pseudosecond-order kinetics with [Formula: see text]. From the study, it was inferred the nanoparticles synthesized can act as a good adsorbent and can be used to purify the wastewater contaminated with methylene blue.",

The functionalization of chabazite was performed via a protonation and calcination with the aim of generating Lewis acid sites to improve its anion exchange properties. The surface and physicochemical properties of both adsorbents were studied and compared. The adsorption isotherms of tested heavy metal ions were quantified and modeled to identify the best isotherm equation. Steric parameters for the adsorption of these ions were also calculated with a monolayer statistical physics model. Natural chabazite showed the maximum adsorption capacity for Pb(II), while the modified zeolite improved its As(V) properties in 79%. These results showed that the modified zeolite was able to remove both cations and anions from aqueous solution. The application of this functionalized chabazite can be extended for the removal of other anionic pollutants from water, thus opening the possibility of preparing new adsorbents with tailored properties for water treatment.",

Selective adsorption represents a highly potential process for this purpose. In this publication, a silica adsorbent functionalized with an amino-polycarboxylate derivate (HSU331) was investigated regarding the selective adsorption of Ni(II) in the presence of Co(II) in acidic solution (pH range at equilibrium 1.8–2.3) at elevated temperature. Comparable maximum equilibrium loadings ([Formula: see text]) for Ni(II) and Co(II) of 0.59 μmol(Ni(II)) · μmol(Ligand) -1 (18.3 mg(Ni(II)) · g(Adsorbent) -1 ), and 0.52 μmol(Co(II)) · μmol(Ligand) -1 (16.0 mg(Co(II)) · g(Adsorbent) -1 ), respectively, were achieved at T = 50°C in single-component experiments. Under competitive conditions, the Ni(II) loading remained constant at 0.60 μmol(Ni(II)) · μmol(Ligand) -1 (18.4 mg(Ni(II)) · g(Adsorbent) -1 ), while the Co(II) loading drastically decreased to 0.09 μmol(Co(II)) · μmol(Ligand) -1 (2.7 mg(Co(II)) · g(Adsorbent) -1 ) in an equimolar dual-component system. Calculated stability constants of 3 · 10 3 and 0.7 · 10 3 L · mol -1 , respectively, for the formed metal ion complexes of Ni(II) and Co(II) onto the adsorbent HSU331, clarify the clear selectivity of the adsorbent towards Ni(II) in the presence of Co(II) even at elevated temperature ( T = 50°C).",

    "abstract": "Potassium carbonate was tested as novel information for producing carbonaceous materials from jute cores. Two quadratic models have been developed for both answers to link the preparatory parameters: activating temperatures, molar ratio, and incubation time. The RSM and ANN models were used to improve the processing conditions to maximise the quantities of iodine and methylene blue penetration. The best charcoal was obtained using 900°C activating temperatures, a 1.5 molar ratio, and a 4-hour activating time. This resulted in iodine and methylene blue absorption of 1260.07 mg/g and 369.21 mg/g, respectively. It was discovered that the K 2 CO 3 -based pyrolysis process might be anticipated to become a safe yet incredibly efficient process of making activated carbons with a very well-defined and monocultural porous structure. Even though the precise emphasis given to K 2 CO 3 is unknown at the moment, given the creation of K 2 C 3 O 4 just after evolvement with one additional molarity of CO at approximately 870°C, these same porous and papule responses begun by K 2 CO 3 stimulation might be temporarily posited to be quite comparable to an initiation action needed to make progress by K 2 C 3 O 4. The influence of control parameters was examined in this study using variance analysis like the ANOVA test. Furthermore, the response surface (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed to improve the output results while optimising the methylene blue and iodine qualities. Consequently, the experimental findings correlate well with the statistics.",

The biosorption parameters that were adjusted were the initial pH (2.0–10.0), temperature (30°C, 40°C, and 50°C), biosorbent dose (0.01–0.03 g/50 mL), initial Cr(VI) concentration (10–100 mg/L), and contact period (0–360 min). The interaction between the surface functional groups on the CBM and CBC and the Cr(VI) ions was found to be the primary mechanism for Cr(VI) sorption via surface complexation and electrostatic interactions, according to the investigation of the pH influence. The Langmuir isotherm was shown to be more well-fitting than the Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms for the concentration range of 10 to 100 mg/L. The testing results indicated a sorption capacity of 90.909 mg/g of CBM and 131.579 mg/g of CBC. According to kinetic investigations, the absorption of Cr(VI) ions onto CBM and CBC was defined in pseudo-second order. The findings of thermodynamic investigations showed that the biosorption of Cr(VI) ions onto CBM and CBC was an exothermic, spontaneous process. These findings demonstrated that, even for high concentrations of Cr(VI) in industrial wastewater, CBM and CBC could be viable, affordable alternatives as adsorbents.",

    "abstract": "This research investigates the simultaneous removal of lead ion-Pb(II), cadmium ion-Cd(II), and cobalt ion-Co(II) from aqueous solution and real samples using activated carbon (AC-C) synthesized from cypress fruit. The investigation meticulously examines the prompt of several adsorption parameters (pH, adsorbent dosage, temperature, initial concentration, and agitation time) on the effectiveness of heavy metal removal by AC-C. FTIR, SEM, and EDS analyses provide convincing evidence for the effective adsorption of metal ions onto the AC-C surface. Pb(II) performed best at a concentration of 40 mg.L −1 in an acidic solution (pH 5) with 70 mg of adsorbent and 100 min of agitation time. Co(II) and Cd(II) achieved their highest removal rates at a concentration of 90 mg.L −1 in basic solutions (pH 10) with 70 mg of adsorbent and 90 min of agitation time. Under these optimal conditions, AC-C demonstrates remarkable removal efficiencies of 98.68% for Pb(II), 95.60% for Co(II), and 76.45% for Cd(II). Kinetic studies reveal that the adsorption process fits a second-order model for the simultaneous removal of the three metal ions. Additionally, equilibrium data are best characterized by the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating monolayer adsorption of the heavy metal ions mixture. Thermodynamic analysis provides further insights into the adsorption process. The positive enthalpy (ΔH°) confirms the endothermic adsorption of the three ions, and the positive entropy (ΔS°) predicts an unpredictable nature at the solid-solution interface. This study establishes AC-C derived from cypress fruit as a highly effective and promising candidate for the simultaneous removal of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Co(II) from aqueous environments. Its remarkable performance, coupled with the readily available natural resource, paves the way for wider application of AC-C in environmental remediation strategies.",

The effects of pH, contact-time and initial dye concentration on the adsorption performance were evaluated. The adsorption kinetics were fitted with pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion models, while the adsorption isotherms were modelled using Langmuir, Freundlich and Sips equations. The results showed that the adsorption of both dyes followed the PSO kinetic model, and the Freundlich and Sips isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacities of the carbon material for MO and MB, according to the Sips model, were 4584 and 1769 mg/g, respectively. The pH range of 3–11 had negligible influence on the adsorption capacities of both dyes. The adsorption mechanism was mainly attributed to π–π interactions, n–π electron donor–acceptor (EDA) interactions and pore filling. The activated carbon material exhibited good reusability and stability, achieving over 90% dye removal, after five cycles of adsorption–desorption using hot (90 ± 2 °C) deionised water as the eluent, indicating that the carbon material synthesised from peanut shells is a promising adsorbent for the removal of ionic dyes from wastewater.",

Chemical activation by impregnation with H 3 PO 4 was employed using acid solutions of varying concentration in the range 30–70% followed by thermal treatment at 500–700°C. The development of porosity was followed from an analysis of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms obtained at 77 K by applying standard BET and t-plot methods. Carbons with low to moderate surface areas (273–827 m 2 /g) and total pore volumes (0.27–0.69 ml/g), containing essentially micropores with diameters of 8.2 Å up to 12.4 Å were obtained. Increasing the concentration of impregnant led to the development of porosity with the optimum being attained at 60% H 3 PO 4 . Phosphoric acid is visualized as acting both as an acid catalyst promoting bond-cleavage reactions and the formation of new crosslinks and also as a reactant which combines with organic species to form phosphate and polyphosphate bridges which connect and crosslink biopolymer fragments.

The amounts of dopant added were varied in the range 0.75–6 mol% Li 2 O. The effects of this treatment on the surface and catalytic properties of cobaltic oxide solid were investigated using nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and studies of the decomposition of H 2 O 2 at 30–50°C. The results obtained revealed that Li 2 O doping of Co 3 O 4 followed by heat treatment at 500°C and 600°C resulted in a progressive increase in the value of the specific surface area, S BET , to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant present. However, the increase was more pronounced in the case of solid samples calcined at 500°C. This increase in the specific surface areas has been attributed to the fixation of a portion of the dopant ions on the uppermost surface layers of the solid leading to outward growth of the surface lattice. The observed increase in S BET due to Li 2 O doping at 500°C might also result from a narrowing of the pores in the treated solid as a result of the doping process. Lithium oxide doping of cobaltic oxide followed by heat treatment at 700–900°C resulted in a significant decrease in the S BET , V p and r̄ values. Pure and doped solids precalcined at 500°C and 600°C exhibited extremely high catalytic activities which were not much affected by doping with Li 2 O. On the other hand, doping followed by calcination at 700–900°C brought about a considerable and progressive increase in the catalytic activity of the treated solids. This treatment did not modify the activation energy of the catalysed reaction, i.e. doping of Co 3 O 4 solid followed by heating at 700°C and 900°C did not alter the mechanism of the catalytic reaction but increased the concentration of catalytically active constituents taking part in the catalytic process without altering their energetic nature.",

    "abstract": "The influence of the molecular weight of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyacrylamide (PAM) as well as of inorganic contaminants on the ZrO 2 surface on the adsorption and electrokinetic properties of the metal oxide/polyelectrolyte solution interface were studied for ZrO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 solid particles. The calculated concentrations of the various surface groups on ZrO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 enabled an investigation of the possible mechanism for the bonding of the studied polyelectrolytes with the surfaces of both oxides. PAA and PAM macromolecules bond with the solid surface mainly via the –OH groups of the oxides, which may interact with the carboxy groups of polyelectrolytes through hydrogen bridging. A comparison of the change in values of the diffuse layer charge with the surface charge enabled the principal factors responsible for the changes in the zeta potential of the oxides, e.g. pH, polymer molecular weight and concentration of the polymer solutions, to be evaluated. From such zeta potential values, it was possible to determine the free energies of adsorption of PAA and PAM on the surfaces of both oxides. The thicknesses of adsorbed polymer layers on Fe 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 were calculated on the basis of measurements of their suspension viscosities in the absence and presence of adsorbed polymer. It was shown that the thickness of the adsorption layer increased with increasing polymer molecular weight, pH and concentration of the polymer solution. Because the experimental determination of the number and the length of trains, loops and tails in such polyelectrolytes was not possible, the participation of such segments of polymer structure at the interface was computed using the Scheutjens–Fleer model of polymer adsorption. The polymer adsorption expressed as the number of equivalent monolayers was calculated and compared with the experimental data.",

It was found that the flow rate and the column specification had a distinct influence on the adsorption of U(VI) ions onto FPAO. When the flow rate was varied from 0.95 ml/min to 3.75 ml/min, the amount of U(VI) ions adsorbed decreased from 379.3 mg/g to 340.6 mg/g while the corresponding equilibrium time diminished from 41.2 h to 10 h.

The closed- and open-shell systems were taken into account. The well-known theoretical reactivity indices (ionization potential, electron affinity and global softness) were calculated for the adsorbents analyzed. We have shown that the values of these parameters are independent of the size of the carbon models. To test the reactivity of adsorption sites as probe molecules, we have used the chloride anion (Cl − ), cation (Cl + ) and radical (Cl 0 ), respectively. Respective correlations between the enthalpy of reaction, the ionization and/or electronic chemical potential of the carbon structures were found. The results obtained confirm the original HSAB concept of Pearson which has been improved recently by Nalewajski. A similar relationship was observed for the adsorbent charge-transfer term, i.e. the change in the electron densities of the analyzed graphene sheets before and after the adsorption process. From an analysis of the results presented, it has been deduced that a charge-transfer mechanism is probable for chloride ion/adsorbent complexes. Moreover, the acid–base duality of carbon models during the adsorption process was shown and confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Natural clays and materials such as bentonite, zeolite and sepiolite have been widely used for environmental and agricultural purposes because of their easy application and relative low cost. The aim of the present study was to investigate the sorption capacity of the natural Turkish (Reşadiye) bentonite (NTB) for the removal of ammonium (NH + 4 ) ions from aqueous solution from the viewpoint of both the sorption isotherms and the associated thermodynamics. The influence of pH, adsorbent dosage and temperature on the sorption of NH + 4 ions onto NTB was also studied. It was found that the non-linear Langmuir model was more suitable for describing the sorption of NH + 4 ions onto NTB since the application of this model exhibited a higher coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0.99) than that for the non-linear Freundlich model (R 2 = 0.98). The Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) model was also applied to the equilibrium data (R 2 = 0.99). The maximum sorption capacity towards NH + 4 ions was determined via the Langmiur equation and found to be 30.12 mg/g. A comparison of the sorption capacity of NTB with those for various adsorbents revealed that this adsorbent had a high sorption capacity for the removal of NH + 4 ions. The results obtained from an application of the D-R isotherm showed that the sorption of NH + 4 ions onto NTB was a physical process. Thermodynamic parameters such as the free energy change (ΔG 0 ), enthalpy change (ΔH 0 ) and entropy change (AS 0 ) were also calculated to establish the thermodynamic adsorption behaviour of NH + 4 ions onto NTB. These parameters indicated that the sorption of NH + 4 ions by NTB was spontaneous, exothermic in nature and involved weak interactions between the NH + 4 ions and negative charges on the NTB surface. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that NTB has a significant potential for reducing the concentration of NH + 4 ions in wastewater and agricultural residues by sorption without destroying the physical and ecological properties of the environment.",

The Central Research Institute of the Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) has developed a method for the extraction of this water through the use of dimethyl ether (DME), which liquefies at ordinary temperatures under the influence of a slight pressure. In this method, the water content in the fuel is extracted into the liquefied DME for separation from the fuel. After dewatering, the DME is depressurised, and subsequently vaporised, thereby leaving the separated water. Dewatering with an input energy of only 1109 kJ/kg water under ordinary conditions has been demonstrated theoretically.",

The adsorption behaviour of the dibenzothiophene-imprinted material (D-MIP/TiO2) was evaluated using batch adsorption experiments to determine the kinetic, isotherm and thermodynamic parameters. The experimental results showed that the adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and that the experimental data were well fitted by the Freundlich adsorption equation. This indicated that adsorption involved a multilayer process. Values of the Gibbs' free energy (ΔG0) ranged from −7.11 kJ/mol to −9.36 kJ/mol over the temperature interval 298–318 K, indicating that the adsorption was endothermic in nature. In addition, D-MIP exhibited selective recognition of DBT relative to other similar compounds such as benzothiophene (BT), 4-methyldibenzothiphene (4-MDBT) and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT). In the corresponding selectivity test, D-MIP/TiO2 showed a greater adsorption capacity towards DBT than BT, 4-MDBT and 4,6-DMDBT.

The kenaf core fibres were milled into different sizes and treated with NaOH before being used to investigate their efficiency in removing Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions. Sorption studies were performed at a pH value of 5. Sorption of the Cu(II) ions increased and the sorption yield decreased with increasing initial Cu(II) ion concentration. The sorption data were correlated with the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherms. The values of the correlation coefficients obtained indicated that the Langmuir isotherm fitted the experimental data better than the Freundlich and D–R isotherms. Kenaf core fibres with fibre sizes in the range 150–300 μm possessed the highest sorption capacity. The calculated parameters of the isotherms suggest that the uptake of Cu(II) ions occurred at the homogeneous active sites on the surfaces of the kenaf core fibres.",

In the present study, the biosorption of copper(II) ions was investigated using non-living Sphingomonas paucimobilis biomass isolated from activated sludge, as obtained from the Lianyungang Dapu sewage treatment plant in China. The effects of several parameters including solution pH, contact time and ionic strength on the Cu(II) ion uptake were studied. The biomass was characterized by scanning electron microscopy/X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). The applicability of the Langmuir and Freundlich models was tested. The correlation coefficients (R 2 ) of both models were greater than 0.9. The maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 50.1 mg/g for Cu(II) ions at 20 °C. The adsorption process was rapid and followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Optimum adsorption was achieved at pH 5. The adsorption was also found to be dependent on the NaCl concentration employed. The Sphingomonas paucimobilis biomass could serve as an adsorbent for the removal of Cu(II) ions from industrial effluents.",

Batch and column experiments were performed to determine the maximum adsorption capacity of the selected adsorbents. Algae were immobilised by employing pumice or silica gel as alternative substances for polymer matrices. The effects of pH, contact time, initial Cr(VI) ion concentration and adsorbent concentration were tested. Results are presented showing that the maximum adsorption capacity occurred at pH 2 when Scenedesmus obliquus and Arthospira maxima were employed as adsorbents. A biphasic Cr(VI) ion removal pattern was observed in all experiments. The effects of Cr(VI) ion loading on both the free and immobilised biomass were tested to allow the applications to be compared. The maximum removal extent of Cr(VI) ions from the aqueous phase was 18.98 ± 0.32 mg/mg free S. obliquus and 18.37 ± 0.28 mg/mg immobilised S. obliquus. The results show that immobilisation of the biomaterial made only a small difference to the extent of Cr(VI) ion removal. However, it is a much more suitable process for industrial applications since it can be continuously applied. The recovery of loaded metal ions was studied when it was found that HCl was very effective for desorbing Cr(VI) ions adsorbed onto the biomass.

An ion-selective electrode technique was used for fluoride ion analysis in the adsorption experiments and electrokinetic measurements were utilized to delineate specific adsorption effects. The results suggest that, at low fluoride ion concentrations, a fluoroapatite-type compound may form on the apatite surface via the chemisorption of fluoride ions at calcium sites; at high fluoride ion concentrations, calcium fluoride appears to form at the apatite surface via a surface-precipitation phenomenon. The formation of CaF 2 on the surface of fluoride ion-treated apatite was further substantiated by FT-IR spectroscopic measurements, which clearly demonstrated a metathetic exchange with phosphate from the apatite lattice during the surface precipitation process.",

After a brief review regarding Cr(VI) ion contamination and treatment, the preparation of a novel biosorbent from pyrolyzed wood char for Cr(VI) ion adsorption is described. Pyrolysis was conducted at temperatures within the range 200–350 °C, thereby helping to protect beneficial functional groups, saving energy and hence reducing costs. The influence of pH, concentration, adsorbent dosage, ionic strength and equilibration time on Cr(VI) ion adsorption by this biosorbent was investigated. It was shown that the char obtained at 200 °C possessed the highest Cr(VI) ion retention capacity (31.96 mg/g) but required the longest equilibration time (&gt; 47 d). Coating the char with nano-scale iron oxide greatly improved its adsorption affinity towards Cr(VI) ions, with a higher adsorption affinity (Henry's law K d = 2.988 ℓ/mg) and an enhanced Cr(VI) ion adsorption capacity (53.45 mg/g) being accomplished within a much shorter equilibration time (24 h). Spectroscopic studies confirmed that complexation of Cr(VI) ions occurred via surface hydroxy groups. The methods proposed for preparing and modifying wood char are likely to be applicable in industrial wastewater treatment.",

The calculation assumes that the gas undergoes temperature-driven isobaric condensation, pressure-driven isothermal expansion and temperature-driven isobaric evaporation. The gas is in a disordered and chaotic state in all the three processes as a result of the kinetic energy by the driving forces. A zero entropy value is achievable at a remote distance from the membrane after desorption takes place. The deviation of the entropy from zero for isobaric evaporation is indicative of the irreversibility of the process. In contrast, the convergence of the entropy towards zero for the other two systems is indicative of the near-reversibility of the process.",

The adsorption performance of these compounds (both kinetic and equilibrium) has been discussed in terms of their chemical and physical properties. The results showed that the rate of adsorption was strongly dependent on the molecular size of the hydrocarbons. Thus, for example, steric hindrances associated with acenaphthene inhibited the accessibility of this compound to the high-energy sites. Under equilibrium conditions, the uptake seemed to be governed by the carbon–PAH affinity, as the lowest uptake was obtained for naphthalene which displayed the fastest adsorption rate. The interactions between the studied pollutants and the activated carbon seemed to be controlled by two factors, viz. aromaticity and water solubility. As a general rule, the higher the number of aromatic rings in the polycyclic hydrocarbon, the more favoured the adsorbate–carbon interactions. Analysis of the carbon after adsorption of the studied hydrocarbons indicated that the accessibility restrictions to the porosity of the carbon can also lead to weaker interactions with the activated carbon.",

Severe aggregation of the silica nanoparticles was largely minimized after surface modification. The carbon dioxide adsorption capacity of the dendrimer-modified silica nanoparticles was significantly enhanced in comparison with the unmodified and aminosilane-modified silica nanoparticles because of the large surface area and presence of functional groups exhibiting CO 2 affinity in the former.",

    "abstract": "Coal and gas outburst is a dynamic phenomenon with violent eruptions of coal and gas from the working coal seam. It has been proved that the rapid desorption within a short period is necessary for the occurrence of an outburst. Due to limitation of the present test condition, gas desorption characterization for the first 60 s has not been researched sufficiently. In the present study, an experimental apparatus with the ability of high-frequency data collection was developed. Initial desorption characterization of methane and carbon dioxide in coal was experimentally studied. Both the initial desorption characterization of methane and carbon dioxide were experimentally studied with different equilibrium pressures. The desorbed gas pressure was measured at desorption time phase of 0–10 and 45–60 s, besides the initial amount of desorbed gas and initial diffusion velocity of coal gas were calculated to assess their risk of outburst. The results show that the gas pressure for both methane and carbon dioxide increases sharply in the initial time and then levels off, and the total amount of desorbed gas increases with the increasing desorption time. Although the amount of desorption methane is slightly larger than that of carbon dioxide at the beginning, the total amount of desorbed carbon dioxide is significantly larger than that of methane at the desorption process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the coal and carbon dioxide outburst is more dangerous than the coal and methane outburst based on the obtained experimental results.",

Kinetics of AgNPs adsorption onto glass beads followed a pseudo-second-order model. The interaction between glass microspheres surface and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated AgNPs is due to hydrogen bonding with oxygen of carbonyl groups of PVP and silanol groups on the glass surface.",

Considering percentage removal of total metal ions (contaminants) as the treatment response, the effects of three variables, namely, wt% AAM, wt% cross-linker and temperature of polymerization were investigated. The polyacrylamide (PAAM) hydrogel was obtained as small beads and optimized using RSM. The hydrogel was used for the removal of total metal ions and total organic acid anions (known as heat-stable salts, HSSs) from industrial lean methyl diethanolamine solvents (MDEA, 50 wt% used by Gasco, Habshan, Abu Dhabi for natural gas sweetening). The presence of heavy-metal ions and HSS is responsible for many problems such as corrosion, foaming and fouling of the equipment. The PAAM hydrogel was characterized by determining its cross-link density and diffusivity. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of the polymeric hydrogel explained the adsorption process. using the best-prepared hydrogel, the percentage removal of total metal ions and total organic acid anions was 74% and 24.26%, respectively. According to the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption capacity of the hydrogel for total metal ions was 1.876 µ equivalence/g and 7.686 mg/g for organic acid anions. The adsorption kinetics obeyed pseudo-first-order model for metal-ions removal and the highest rate of chromium ion adsorption was observed at pH 10.33. The desorption studies showed that the percentage removal was consistent across five cycles of adsorption and desorption.",

Three activation temperatures (670, 730 and 790 °C), three chemical-to-coal ratios (2, 2.5 and 3) and two pyrolysis times (1 and 2 hours) were studied in each carbon series (NaOH and KOH). Accordingly, the pore structures of Activated carbon (ACs) were investigated accurately based on adsorption isotherms of nitrogen as well as density functional theory. In addition, their methane storage capacities were also measured and discussed. Specific volumes (microporosity and mesoporosity) of products were also calculated. The KOH ACs had higher micropore volumes, whereas NaOH ACs had relatively higher densities. The highest methane storage was obtained by a KOH AC sample with 3:1 chemical-to-coal ratio (R), activated at 730 °C for 1 hour (AK37301).

The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of CO 2 were studied at 288, 298 and 308 K within a pressure range of 0–5 MPa by a volumetric method. The adsorption heat, mass-transfer constant, diffusion coefficient and diffusion activation energy were also investigated in this work. The results showed that the chromium-based MIL-101 adsorbent exhibited an impressive selectivity for CO 2 over N 2 and had an adsorption capacity of 20 mmol/g of CO 2 at 298 K and 5.0 MPa, which was much better than that of other conventional adsorbents (e.g. SBA-15, MCM-41, SG-A). The adsorption heat of CO 2 on MIL-101 was in the range of 21–45 kJ/mol, which decreased with the loading of CO 2 . The mass-transfer constants and diffusion coefficients increased with the temperature and decreased with the pressure, whereas the diffusion activation energy decreased with the increased pressure, indicating that adsorption of CO 2 at high pressures was easier. In addition, a linear correlation was found between CO 2 uptake and surface areas at low pressure, which showed that the adsorption capacity of CO 2 could be controlled by adjusting the surface area of the prepared adsorbents in this condition.",

Using a mixture of activated carbon (AC) and carbon molecular sieve (CMS) as the adsorbent, this method ensures that the gaseous mixture adsorbed does not reach the explosive limits by adsorbing methane and part of the oxygen simultaneously. Using a two-bed vacuum PSA experimental apparatus, the low-concentration CMM was safely enriched from 20% to more than 30%, with CMS and AC mass ratio of 3.4. The results of experimental studies indicate that the mixture adsorbent (AC and CMS) has explosion-suppression and flameproof characteristics.

It can be used to modify adsorbent materials, greatly improving their chemical properties. This article studies the effect of compound modification of activated carbons in a high-gravity environment on their toluene adsorption. The compound modification includes physical (N 2 ) and chemical modification (HNO 3 ), and the effect of modification is compared between traditional fixed-bed and rotating packed bed modification. The physical characteristics of the activated carbons, including pore size, specific surface area, and morphology are tested by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and scanning electron microscopy, and the surface functional groups of the activated carbons are determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Boehm titration. The results indicate that the activated carbons modified by rotating packed bed have a larger specific surface area (871.5 m 2 /g) and smaller pore size (0.524 nm), and the content of acidic oxygen-containing groups is 1.5 times that of unmodified activated carbons. The adsorption capacity of the activated carbons compound-modified by rotating packed bed increases by 69% compared with the unmodified activated carbons. The adsorption by the rotating packed bed-compound-modified activated carbons obeys the Freundlich model. The modification of activated carbons by rotating packed bed greatly enhances their specific surface area, pore size, and surface content of oxygen-containing functional groups, markedly improving the adsorption performance and increasing the utilization rate.",

    "abstract": "Tectonic deformation can cause significant changes in the physical and chemical structures of coal by damaging the macrostructure and macromolecular composition. For thorough research on the coal tectonic deformation impacts on gas adsorption capacity, this paper collected and summarized the parameters of experimental adsorption isotherms and coal macerals, conducted proximate and ultimate analyses, and systematically discussed the adsorption properties of different structures of coals and the influence of temperature and pressure on coal adsorption. Furthermore, the semi-quantitative relationships between the structural parameters of coal and its methane adsorption capacity are explored. The results show that (1) due to different tectonic stresses, the molecular and porous structures of different types of tectonic coal exhibit significant differences (e.g. sample N25, which is in a fault zone, has the highest methane adsorption capacity), and (2) coal methane adsorption capacity decreases along with increasing temperature. At a pressure of 12 MPa, primary coal (N32) showed Langmuir volume (V L ) values of 15.38, 9.58, and 7.86 cm 3 /g and Langmuir pressure (P L ) values of 3.82, 2.07, and 1.81 MPa at temperatures of 30°C, 50°C, and 70°C, respectively. (3) The Langmuir volume appears to have a linear relationship with parameters I D1 /I G , Al/OX, and A-factor, as well as a parabolic curve relationship with f a , thereby illustrating that increases of apparent aromaticity can raise CH 4 adsorption on coal.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the effects of temperature, pH, and biochar under cadmium stress on the adsorption characteristics of atrazine in soils in northeast China were studied by batch adsorption method. In the atrazine–Cd(II) coexistence system, the adsorption of atrazine by the soils reached equilibrium within 24 h, but there were some differences in sorption capacities of the three types of soil and the order of adsorption is albic soil &gt; black soil &gt; saline-alkaline soil. With the concentration of atrazine increased, the adsorption capacity of atrazine in the three types of soil gradually increased, the upward trend became more obvious with the ambient temperature of the solution decreased. The adsorption kinetics curves of atrazine in the three types of soil conform to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the adsorption isotherm follows the Langmuir model. When atrazine and Cd(II) coexist in soils, the decrease in atrazine adsorption in the soil may be due to the competitive interaction between the two chemicals. Cd(II) occupies part of the adsorption site of atrazine, thus saturating the active site in soils. Since atrazine is a weakly alkaline pesticide, the lower the pH of the soil, the higher the affinity of atrazine for the soil. After adding biochar to the soil, the functional groups in biochar can form π bond with atrazine, which promotes the fixation of atrazine in the soil. The results show that the prevention of atrazine and cadmium leaching can be achieved by appropriately adjusting the pH, temperature, clay content, and organic matter of the soils.",

After introducing 15 mg of CNTM into cigarette filter, some of the most important harmful compounds including tar, nicotine, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and phenolic compounds were more efficiently adsorbed in comparison with using commercial activated carbon, which can be related to the relatively bigger pore volume and a geometric confinement of CNT in CNTM for some toxic compounds in cigarette smoke.

    "abstract": "Face coverings such as a face mask are one of the important preventive measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, by limiting exhaled particles and reducing expiratory droplet spread. Adding a filter to face masks may offer extra protection against the virus. Nevertheless, there remains a significant concern where thicker, tightly woven materials of masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably, due to inadequate moisture management properties of woven fabric in existing disposable surgical face masks. Therefore, the study on the properties of air permeability, water vapor permeability, and flexural rigidity of a face mask fabric is highly essential. This study is aimed at analyzing the potential application of electrospun nanofibers fabricated from electrospinning technique, as filter inserts in commercial surgical face masks. The function of electrospun nanofiber filter (NF) inserted in commercial surgical face masks was introduced in the study. The results indicated the significant reduction in air permeability and water vapor permeability along with the additional usage of electrospun NF within the surgical face masks, due to the smaller fiber size and interspaces in the filter layer as analyzed from FESEM analysis. The percentage of air permeability value was slightly decreased by 15.9%, from 339.5 to 285.5 mm/s, whereas the value of flexural rigidity of surgical face masks with and without electrospun NF insert is 0.1358 and 0.1207 mg/cm, respectively. Hence, the NF inserts are recommended as the potential core component in a face mask.",

The factors affecting the performance of the ANG system with a zirconium-based MOF with benzene dicarboxylic acid as a linker (ZrBDC) as an adsorbent were considered: textural properties of the adsorbent and thermal effect arising upon adsorption. The high-density ZrBDC-based pellets were prepared by mechanical compaction of the as-synthesized MOF powder at different pressures from 30 to 240 MPa at 298 K without a binder and mixed with polymer binders: polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and carboxyl methylcellulose (CMC). The structural investigations revealed that the compaction of ZrBDC with PVA under 30 MPa was optimal to produce the ZrBDC-PVA adsorbent with more than a twofold increase in the packing density and the lowest degradation of the porous structure. The specific total and deliverable volumetric methane storage capacities of the ZrBDC-based adsorbents were evaluated from the experimental data on methane adsorption measured up to 10 MPa and within a temperature range from 253 to 333 K. It was measured experimentally that at 253 K, an 100 mL adsorption tank loaded with the ZrBDC-PVA pellets exhibited the deliverable methane storage capacity of 172 m 3 (NTP)/m 3 when the pressure dropped from 10 to 0.1 MPa. The methane adsorption data for the ZrBDC powder and ZrBDC-PVA pellets were used to calculate the important thermodynamic characteristic of the ZrBDC/CH 4 adsorption system—the differential molar isosteric heat of adsorption, which was used to evaluate the state thermodynamic functions: entropy, enthalpy, and heat capacity. The initial heats of methane adsorption in powdered ZrBDC evaluated from the experimental adsorption isosteres were found to be ~19.3 kJ/mol, and then these values in the ZrBDC/CH 4 system decreased at different rates during adsorption. In contrast, the heat of methane adsorption onto the ZrBDC-PVA pellets increased from 19.4 kJ/mol to a maximum with a magnitude, width, and position depended on temperature, and then it fell. The behaviors of the thermodynamic state functions of the ZrBDC/CH 4 adsorption system were interpreted as a variation in the state of adsorbed molecules determined by a ratio of CH 4 -CH 4 and CH 4 -ZrBDC interactions. The heat of adsorption was used to calculate the temperature changes of the ANG systems loaded with ZrBDC powder and ZrBDC pellets during methane adsorption under adiabatic conditions; the maximum integrated heat of adsorption was found at 273 K. The maximum temperature changes of the ANG system with the ZrBDC materials during the adsorption (charging) process did not exceed 14 K that are much lower than those reported for the systems loaded with activated carbons. The results obtained are of direct relevance for designing the adsorption-based methane storage systems for the automotive industry, developing new gas-power robotics systems and uncrewed aerial vehicles.",

The microscopic techniques revealed the micron-sized flower-like structure, while the XRD showed peaks at 30–33° which indicates the transformation of the calcite and silicate phases into new-phase mineral. FTIR also revealed bands in regions of 500–1200 cm −1 and new bands near 450 cm −1 . EDS confirmed the presence of Na in the sintered product and the transformation of the ISA. Finally, the sintered product potential was assayed for the removal of methylene blue dye from wastewater using an adsorption mechanism. The removal efficiency of dye reached up to 70% within one hour only. It was found that the ISA sintered product has the potential to remove MB dye efficiently from wastewater and also reduce solid waste pollution. Microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the sintered incense stick ash product on RTG-2 cells. The sintered incense stick ash product induced cytotoxicity on RTG-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Sintered ISA products have the potential to remove methylene blue dye efficiently from wastewater and reduce solid waste pollution.",

The prepared adsorbents were characterized by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, and point of zero charge (pHpzc). The effects of adsorbent dosage, initial concentration, and contact time were considered. Equilibrium data was tested using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Frenkel–Halsey–Hill models. The degree of adsorption of acetic acid increased for both adsorbents as contact time, and adsorbent dosage and initial concentration were increased. The adsorption data were described well by the (Freundlich=Frenkel–Halsey–Hill) models with the highest regression coefficient of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for Rice Husk Activated Carbon (RH-AC) and Potato Peels Activated Carbon (PP-AC), respectively. This suggests a multilayer through the existence of a heterogeneous pore distribution in the adsorbent surface. Kinetic data agreed well with pseudosecond-order ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) RH-AC and PP-AC, correspondingly. This indicates that the adsorption process was chemisorption in nature. The regeneration studies showed that the adsorbents prepared could be renewed and reused before losing their adsorbing affinity for acetic acid.",

In optimal experimental conditions, the maximum adsorption efficiency was 92.65%. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used allowing the identification of the main functional groups and morphology of rice husk and treated rice husk, and the results showed an improvement of adsorption characteristics after rice husk treatment with NaOH.

For this purpose, tuffite was used in its natural and modified form with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Batch adsorption experiment was performed. The effects of contact time (0–90 min), adsorbent dosage (1–10 g/L), initial concentration (10–200 mg/L), and pH (2–12) on the removal of Pb (II) were investigated. The isotherm data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models. Kinetic models such as pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion models were used. In order to optimize the adsorption system and investigate the kinetic behaviour of adsorption, nonlinear isotherm and kinetic models were used as well as linearized models. Error analyses were made in order to express the obtained results more accurately. pH 5 was the optimum value for adsorption. According to nonlinear isotherm model calculations, Bayburt stone (BS) and its modified form (MBS) had [Formula: see text] values of 335 and 584 mg/g, respectively. The Freundlich model, with its high correlation coefficients of about 1.00, was found to be more suitable for the adsorption of Pb (II) to MBS. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model with mean [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] values of 0.997 and 0.0116 1/min, respectively, was found to be more appropriate. According to the regeneration studies, the maximum desorption efficiency was 97.8%. The thermodynamic equilibrium coefficients obtained at different temperatures and [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] values were observed as -21.4, 46.4, and 163 kJ/mol, respectively.

    "abstract": "The use of renewable energy is crucial to the global growth of sustainability. Milk business amongst many other food industry divisions requires a significant amount of energy, making the meal processing business one of the most energy-intensive industries. As of right now, more than 30 percent of the dairy produced in India is processed. In distant parts of India, milk spoiling is more common due to the delay among milking and storing; as a result, facilities for quick pasteurization and storage are needed. Heated is necessary for pasteurization. Since for a long time, the Indian milk industry has relied on nonrenewable energy sources, that are not only becoming much more costly but are also to blame for significant environmental issues including greenhouse gases and health issues. Consequently, scientific communities, environmental and social organizations, and the governments have all pushed the use of green energy. Solar energy has been shown to be the most viable among various sustainable and renewable energies given the geographical position of India. Solar energy can be used to pasteurize milk because of the energy intensity and range of temperature requirements. Adsorbent refrigerator is recommended here since it is powered by waste/solar heat and can store (200 liters of milk) at low temperatures until it is distributed after the pasteurization process (easily available from farm waste). The solar collector of evacuated tube is used for minimizing heat loss and pasteurizing milk. The outcome demonstrates that milk can be simply pasteurized at 73°C for 25minutes at a flow rate of 5 liter per minutes. A solar energy adsorbent refrigeration system has been constructed and described for keeping 200 liters of milk at 10-15°C for 9–11 hours. Investigation findings indicate that the specific cooling power of the system is sufficient to store 200 liters of milk at 5.8 kW/kg and 5.5 kW/kg for 500 liter per hours hot water supplied at 92°C, 32°C condenser temperatures, and 5°C evaporator temperatures. The heat loss of evacuated tube collector is compared to solar concentrator. The study results provide evacuated tube collector is better for pasteurizing milk since to its highly efficient, longevity, and compactness.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and the continual rise in cooling demand means more efficient and environmentally friendly refrigeration technologies are required more than ever. One attractive route to reducing future demand is to improve adsorption refrigeration technologies based on natural refrigerants such as ammonia. The choice of ammonia adsorbent plays an important role in achieving improved refrigeration efficiency and suitable operating conditions. This paper reports a detailed study on the role of pore size on thermal efficiency, desorption temperature and cooling capacity of ammonia–carbon adsorption refrigeration systems. Systematic Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to study ammonia adsorption in carbon slit-pores with pores sizes ranging from 0.5 nm to 3.0 nm. Simulations were carried out at temperatures between 0°C and 50°C and pressures up to 15.0 bar. It is found that nanoporous carbon with very small pore sizes is not a good adsorbent for thermally efficient adsorption refrigeration systems. However, carbon mesopores can provide higher refrigeration capacities and coefficients of performance together with lower desorption temperatures, thus offering the possibility of relying on low-grade thermal waste heat to drive the refrigeration process.",

However, the decrease in adsorption amount of gas fat coal and long flame coal is lower than that of anthracite, indicating that the effect of adding water on CH 4 adsorption is most significant in high metamorphic coal, while the effect on medium and low metamorphic coal is relatively small. The average adsorption heat of CH 4 molecules in anthracite is 1.66 times of that of gas fat coal and 2.40 times of that of long flame coal, and the higher the added moisture content, the lower the adsorption heat of CH 4 , the more significant the inhibitory effect of added moisture on CH 4 adsorption by coal.",

Adsorption experiments, designed using the Taguchi method (L25, four factors, five levels), identified contact time as the most influential factor for Pb 2+ removal. The maximum Pb 2+ adsorption capacity of HNO 3 -activated bentonite was 1.3 times higher than raw bentonite (61.77 mg/g vs 48.22 mg/g).

Modified KP exhibited higher adsorption capacity (5.71 mmol g –1 ) than original KP (lower than 0.5 mmol g –1 ) or other natural adsorbents. Modification improved the adsorption capacity of KP.

    "abstract": "The increasing CO 2 emission leads to significant ecological changes, and the control of CO 2 emissions has been a major concern worldwide. Solid adsorbents are a highly promising carbon capture technology; the regeneration energy, visually representing the operating cost, is a key parameter to judge the merit of different solid adsorbents. In this paper, a uniform energy consumption calculation method was proposed to compare the characteristics of CO 2 adsorbents in temperature swing adsorption process. The results showed that, for chemisorbents with strong interactions with CO 2 (e.g. alkali and alkaline earth metal-based adsorbents), due to the high adsorption heat and the high regeneration temperature required, their energy consumption in CO 2 capturing was quite high. It could be even higher than that of 30% monoethanolamine solution. Adsorption heat plays an important role in the cyclic regeneration of adsorbents; a very low adsorption heat (&lt;25 kJ/mol) will make it difficult to form the difference in adsorption capacities between low and high temperatures. Among all the adsorbents, metal–organic frameworks, zeolites, and amine-functionalized adsorbents perform best, all of which possess moderate adsorption heats and large adsorption capacities at relatively low regeneration temperature.",

The adsorption isotherms all fitted a simple Langmuir adsorption equation quite well. The amount of metal ion adsorbed increased with pH for lead and copper ion. However, for both thallium and chromium, a significant drop in adsorption between pH 3 and 4 was observed, associated with the dominant presence of lower-charged hydroxy species at higher pH values. At pH 4, adsorption was in the order Pb II &gt; Cu II &gt; TI I &gt;&gt; Cr III , whereas at pH ≤ 2 the order was Bi III ≤ Pb II &gt; Tl I &gt; Cr III &gt; Cu II . In the low pH range, which is largely free of hydrolysis species, the adsorption of the isoelectronic bismuth, lead and thallium series appears to be dominated by charge, and charge appears a dominant factor with the transition metal pair also. The adsorption of lead (at pH 4 and 5) and bismuth (at pH 1.5) to samples of EMD subjected to prolonged heat treatment at 110, 400 and 650°C were also examined. Samples dried at 110°C mainly lost only surface water, and showed adsorption characteristics similar to untreated samples. Samples heated at 400°C lost all their combined water but still showed significant adsorption, whereas samples heated at 600°C were converted to Mn 2 O 3 , and showed very small though measurable metal ion adsorption.",

Five adsorbates, i.e. methane, methanol, ethanol, carbon dichloride and carbon tetrachloride were adsorbed at three temperatures (308, 328 and 348 K) on two polymeric microporous carbons. Adsorption isotherms, as well as differential heats of adsorption, were measured using adsorption calorimetry. From the experimental results, the entropy as well as the average heat capacity of the adsorbed molecules were calculated. The data obtained lead to the mechanism of adsorption in carbon micropores as well as to the influence of the oxidation of the carbon surface on this mechanism. By comparing the isosteric and differential heats of adsorption, it is shown that the isosteric enthalpy cannot be applied for a correct description of the adsorption energetics. Finally, some empirical relationships describing low-coverage adsorption are proposed and discussed.",

The precursors which were treated in this manner were fruit stones and nut shells (peach, apricot and olive stones; date pits, almond, hazel nut and pistacio shells), fibrous materials (sugar cane bagasse, date palm branches and leaves, cotton stalks and wood meal), corn cobs, rice husks, alkali-washed rice hulls and barbecue charcoal. Low adsorption of nitrogen was observed at 77 K with low values being estimated for the corresponding BET surface areas and total pore volumes. The surface areas as determined from CO 2 adsorption at 303 K were relatively higher and various micropore parameters were calculated from the Dubinin–Radushkevich equation. Iodine was adsorbed from aqueous solution in amounts higher than the apparent surface areas and Methylene Blue was also taken up in a similar fashion. Such behaviour was attributed to the surface chemical natures of the chars which contribute to the higher uptake from aqueous solution. Generally, microporous products exhibiting a predominant ultramicroporosity were obtained under pyrolysis conditions.",

A new washing bioremedy based on surfactant products synthesized microbially from the bacterial strain Pseudomonas sp. PS-17 has been obtained. It contains an unique biocomplex of a glycolipid biosurfactant and an alginate biopolymer and possesses a high surface and emulsifying activity. The washing and antisorptional capacity of this bioremedy has been tested on objects of various natures, viz. bird feathers, animal skins and furs.

Titration with the weakest basic probe (aniline) rather than 2-phenylethylamine generally led to a lower amount of acidic sites. The amount of acidic sites determined at the surface was greatly affected by the solvent. With silica–zirconia, a higher amount of acidic sites was established by titration in apolar rather than polar solvents. The results have been compared with those obtained by conventional methods, i.e. ion exchange employing salts and, for silica–zirconia, Hammett titrations. The quite satisfactory results obtained are of some importance in establishing valuable relationships between catalyst acidity and catalytic activity in various solvents.",

This is overcome by the stronger van der Waals interaction of ethane at high loadings, explaining recent literature data. Both experimental data and single-component Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were fitted well with the Unilan model and mixture isotherms were satisfactorily predicted by the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory when compared with binary simulation results. Both binary GCMC simulations and Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory predictions yielded separation factors of ca. 2 and a difference in isosteric heat of 3 kJ/mol.

The effects of concentration (10–1500 mg/l), solution pH (1–10) and temperature (25°C, 35°C and 45°C) were studied. The mercury(II) adsorption isotherms followed the Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacities of 361.0, 142.2 and 300.3 mg/g for HgCl 2 , [HgCl 4 ] 2– and Hg 2+ , respectively. Fibre K proved to have the highest adsorption capacity towards HgCl 2 but the best results for the adsorption of [HgCl 4 ] 2– and Hg 2+ were obtained with the fibre K AC . The performance of fibre K BAS was always worse than those of the other two fibres tested. The negative values obtained for ΔH 0 and ΔG 0 indicate that the adsorption was an exothermic and spontaneous process and also demonstrated that the adsorption of Hg(II) is a feasible process.",

Some of the results have been compared with those obtained on a commercial synthetic zeolite 4A (CECA). The adsorption rates of the various gases were measured automatically via a custom acquisition data card capable of registering pressure and time data simultaneously. All the samples showed a decreasing adsorption affinity in the order CO 2 &gt; C 2 H 4 &gt; C 2 H 6 . A very slow adsorption process and a large proportion of irreversible adsorption were observed for both hydrocarbons onto Cp at 20 °C. The irreversible adsorption of C 2 H 4 decreased with increasing temperature, with a small irreversible adsorption being detected at 240 °C. Both Cp at 240 °C and Cp–Na at 0 °C could be promising adsorbents for the separation of C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 mixtures, while Cp–H may be recommended for the separation at 20 °C at times less than 100 s. The high adsorption selectivity toward CO 2 of Cp and Cp–Na at all the experimental temperatures studied enables these samples to be recommenced for the purification of C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 6 contaminated with CO 2 .",

For asymmetric capacitors where the ratio of the BET surface area, S BET , of the negative carbon electrode to that of the positive carbon electrode was less than 1.7, the capacitance of the electric double layer was strongly governed by the negative carbon electrode. Their rate performance, as evaluated from the ratio of the capacitance at 200 mA to that at 20 mA, C 200 /C 20 , was determined by the mesoporous surface area of the negative carbon electrode.

    "abstract": "The determination of Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) from inverse gas chromatographic (IGC) data for a group of nano-materials and modified nano-materials is presented and discussed. The solubility parameter concept is applied in many industries to explain the different properties of the various components in a formulation. Knowledge of the solubility parameter data for different components is important for predicting the magnitude of the interaction between the formulation components and the future stability of the product. Solubility parameter data are also useful in the description and interpretation of different phenomena occurring between materials such as their miscibility, compatibility or adsorption. The inverse gas chromatography method is widely used for the characterization of polymers and polymer blends, surfactants, biopolymers, solid food and petroleum pitches. The method involves placing the investigated material (stationary phase) in a column and then characterizing it using volatile probes with known properties (test solutes) which are carried by a mobile phase. The solubility parameter called the Hildebrand solubility parameter or the Hildebrand parameter is only applied for regular solutions. The so-called Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) is an extension of the Hildebrand solubility parameter to polar and hydrogen-bonding systems. Hansen assumed that the cohesive energy can be considered as the sum of the contributions from dispersive (E d ), polar (E p ) and hydrogen-bonding (E h ) interactions: –E coh = –E d – E p – E h ; and that the total solubility parameter (δ T ) may be expressed as δ T 2 = δ d 2 + δ p 2 + δ 2 h , where δ p , δ p and δ h denote the dispersive, polar and hydrogen-bonding contribution, respectively. The estimation of HSP from IGC data for a group of nano-materials and modified nano-materials is presented and discussed here.",

Molar ratios of 3.2:1, 1.1:1 and 0.4:1 for the two functions –SH and –NH 2 were employed. Xerogels which contain only one of the two functions were also synthesized for comparative purposes. It was shown that the use of stannic compounds as catalysts for xerogels with 3-mercaptopropyl groups resulted in a product which possessed a non-porous structure, while the use of fluoride ions allowed the synthesis of a sample with a porous structure (S sp = 216 m 2 /g, V s = 0.152 cm 3 /g, d = 3.5 nm). Xerogels with a bifunctional surface layer possess a bimodal structure. Infrared, Raman and multinuclear solid-state NMR ( 1 H, 13 C, 29 Si) spectroscopy data showed: (i) the absence of deprotonation for the 3-mercaptopropyl groups in the bifunctional surface layer of the xerogels; and (ii) that 3-aminopropyl groups form hydrogen bonds in these surface layers. The type of hydrogen bond formed depends on the ratio of the amount of water to the amount of 3-aminopropyl groups in the surface layer. When this ratio is about 1:1, the amino group forms a hydrogen bond with the silanol group associated with the water molecule. Re-organization of the surface layer is observed when the amount of water decreases, the amino groups forming hydrogen bonds between themselves. Hence, the system of hydrogen bonds in the surface layer of such xerogels depends primarily on the drying regime employed for the samples.",

Scanning electron micrographs of the powder as-prepared showed that PGL possessed an irregular texture consisting of globular and elongated grains. The porosity of the structure was also noted. After adsorption of Cd(II) ions, ca. 30% of the powdered grains on the resulting surface showed a pixel concentration of Cd(II) ions, indicating the adsorption of Cd(II) ions by selective grains. The FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared powder and the Cd(II) ion-loaded powder were similar but the absorption bands were shifted by 5–35 cm −1 after the adsorption process. The experimental parameters chosen for adsorption studies included time, pH, particle size, temperature, adsorbate, biosorbent, anions and Pb(II) ion concentrations. The kinetic data followed linear and non-linear pseudo-second-order kinetics. The adsorption of Cd(II) ions increased from zero to 60.39% as the pH of the aqueous solution was increased from 2 to 3.5, with a further increase in pH to 5.5 resulting in a marginal increase in the extent of adsorption to 63.7%. The isothermal data were well fitted by the Freundlich adsorption model. On the basis of the Langmuir isotherm model, the maximum loading capacity was calculated as 31.15 mg/g. The presence of chloride or sulphate anions had an adverse effect on the Cd(II) ion uptake by PGL. Lead(II) ions were adsorbed preferentially from binary Cd(II)/Pb(II) ion solutions, thereby decreasing the Cd(II) ion uptake. The thermodynamic parameters for the process were also estimated.",

For this purpose, hydrotalcites of different compositions (containing 30, 63 and 70% MgO in their compositions) were tested, with and without pre-treatment (uncalcined and calcined). A model was obtained to predict the degradation constant. This model may be useful in predicting the extent of clavulanic acid hydrolysis in the adsorption process. Adsorption studies were performed in stirred batch glass reactors. Assays were performed using solutions under different conditions, as well as variable solid/liquid ratios. It was shown that distilled water and a solid/liquid ratio of 15.0 mg/ℓ generated the most favourable conditions for adsorption. A calcined hydrotalcite containing 70% MgO was selected for further study since it presented the best adsorption performance. The adsorbents were characterized by X-ray diffraction methods, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Adsorption equilibrium was evaluated from adsorption isotherms determined at different temperatures. The experimental isotherm data were well fitted by a linear equilibrium model with the corresponding adsorption constants being K = 0.404, 0.602, 0.849 and 1.083 ℓ/g at 16.5, 19.0, 21.5 and 24.0 °C, respectively, showing an increased adsorption capacity at higher temperatures. Thermodynamic evaluation of the process allowed the Gibbs' free energy (ΔG 0 ), the standard enthalpy change (ΔH 0 ) and the standard entropy change (ΔS 0 ) to be estimated as follows: ΔG 0 = 2.100, 1.301, 0.503 and −0.295 kJ/mol at 16.5, 19.0, 21.5 and 24.0 °C, respectively; ΔH 0 = 94.602 kJ/mol; and ΔS 0 = 0.319 kJ/(mol K), respectively.

Structural analysis of the product obtained after Cr(VI) ion sorption onto Zn–Al–CO 3 showed that the carbonate anion was not replaced in the interlayer and that the Cr(VI) ion was adsorbed within cavities formed by three adjacent metal hydroxide octahedra situated at the edge of the brucite-like layer.",

The results showed that the water absorption rate increased significantly (from 327% to 651%) and the weight loss rate decreased (from 19.0% to 4.1%) with the increase of glutaraldehyde content. Overall, this in situ cross-linking electrospinning technique provides a method to cross-link pullulan during electrospinning. The cross-linked pullulan nanofibers could be employed as promising materials for a variety of potential applications in adsorption and separation fields.",

    "abstract": "In this study, activated nano-carbon xerogels were obtained by different activation schemes of a resorcinol–formaldehyde xerogel (RFX) with a resorcinol/catalyst (R/C) ratio of 50. For the precursor (RFX), activation was carried out under physical (steam) and chemical (H 3 PO 4 , KOH or NaOH) treatment in a one-stage process. Carbon xerogels were derived by simple pyrolysis at 500 °C or 700 °C for comparative purposes. The samples were characterized by different techniques including CHO elemental analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption studies at 77 K, with the data obtained in the latter case being analyzed using the BET equation and the α S -method, as well as the fractal dimension approach. The porosities of the obtained carbons were considerably enhanced by chemical activation (mostly within the micropore range), while steam activation promoted the porosities to a lesser extent. Single-bottle removal of copper(II) ions was found to be appreciable in the case of the carbon xerogels (Q ads = 32–52 mg/g) and excellent with the activated carbon xerogels (Q ads = 76–198 mg/g). Application of the pseudo-second-order relationship gave the best fit to the kinetic uptake curves for selected samples. Activated carbon xerogels proved to be potential cation-exchange carbons whose performance appeared to be governed by the total surface area, slurry pH and the abundance of oxygen functional groups per unit surface area of the sorbent.",

Thus, ACFs in cloth (ACFC) and felt forms (ACFF) with three different surface areas were each analyzed for their pore volumes, pore sizes and pore-size distributions. The fibre morphology and organization was visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The microporosity of the ACF materials based on nitrogen isotherms, the percentage of micropores by area and volume, the average pore size and the pore-size distribution were also determined. An increase in the surface areas of the ACFC types led to an increase in the total pore volume, micropore volume, micropore area and pore width, but led to a decrease in the percentage of micropores by area and volume. The nitrogen isotherms demonstrated that the surface area dictated the amount of adsorption onto the ACF regardless of the form of the latter. The difference in the volume of smaller micropores between the ACFC and ACFF types may be attributed to the difference in the adsorbent density and the accessibility of the fibre surface to the activating gas during the activation process. An understanding of the pore structure of ACFs by form and surface area is crucial in determining the appropriate specific applications of such adsorbents.",

The three widely used models of Dubinin–Stoeckli, Stoeckli and Horvath–Kawazoe were applied for characterizing these porous solids. Although the results showed some differences amongst these models arising from the fundamental assumptions on which they are based, in general they were comparable. Thus, at the same chemical ratio, samples activated by ZnCl 2 showed more adsorption capacity than those from KOH. Moreover, the pore volumes increased as the impregnation ratio in each series increased. In addition, with increasing impregnation ratio (up to 100%) in the ZnCl 2 series, the micropores were widened and a further increase in ZnCl 2 content caused the micropores to change to mesopores. In the KOH series, increasing KOH created more micropores in the carbon structure over the whole range of chemical/nutshell ratio studied.",

The kinetic results showed that the protoxin and toxin could be adsorbed by sepiolite rapidly, and the equilibrium was reached within 1 h. The adsorption isotherms of both proteins followed Langmuir equation (R 2 &gt;0.98) and the curves belonged to L type. The adsorption capacity, adsorption rate and the insecticidal activity of toxin were higher than those of protoxin. The results of ultraviolet irradiation showed that sepiolite could protect the toxin from ultraviolet irradiation damage, but it accelerated the damage of protoxin. Therefore, the toxin is suitable for preparing long-term formulations of B. thuringiensis using the carrier of sepiolite. The results of Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy indicated that toxin did not influence the structure of sepiolite and the adsorption of toxin only on the surface of sepiolite.

The characteristics of the coal adsorbing flue gas were studied with the atmospheric volumetric method. The factors affecting the seal of CO 2 were analyzed and the effect of power plant flue gas on fire prevention in the goaf was investigated at normal temperature and pressure. It can be inferred from the experiment that N 2 , SO 2 , and H 2 O can also reduce CO 2 adsorption capacity. The increase or decrease in pH can increase the adsorption capacity of CO 2 , which is apparently larger when the pH is decreasing than when the pH is increasing. The O 2 adsorption capacity can evidently be reduced when the power plant flue gas is injected into the goaf. The activation energy of coal burned in air is greater than that of coal burned in flue gas, indicating that the use of power plant flue gas, with N 2 and CO 2 as the main components, to replace the traditional inert gas can not only save N 2 generation cost, but also reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, while the power plant flue gas can be adsorbed by coal.",

The effects of shaking speed, resin dosage, and pH on adsorption were investigated by static experiments. The external mass transfer rate remains substantially unchanged when the shaking speed exceeds 160 r min −1 . The optimal pH range is 5–8, and an increase of resin dosage can directly improve the percentage of removal of Rhodamine B. The equilibrium isotherm data of Rhodamine B on CT269DR resin fit the Langmuir adsorption isotherm well. The thermodynamics parameters, Δ H = 69.93 kJ mol −1 , Δ S = 326.73 J mol −1 K −1 , and Δ G &lt; 0, demonstrate that the adsorption of Rhodamine B onto CT269DR resin is spontaneous and endothermic. The pseudo first-order kinetic model can be successfully used to represent the adsorption process and the activation energy is 25.7 kJ mol −1 . The dynamic experiments show that the breakthrough point is advanced when the flow rate increases and the bed adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature. Furthermore, the desorption using the solution of 2% NaOH is suitable for desorption and reusing process, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis reveals that used resin has good wear resistance and chemical stability. The results confirm that CT269DR resin can be employed as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of Rhodamine B from wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Although graphite is not effective as an adsorbent in water treatment, it provides a homogenous, non-porous, carbonaceous structure that is ideal for studying fundamental adsorption mechanisms. High-purity graphite powder (C content 99.5%) was oxidized in an ozone stream, producing a near-surface oxygen content of 5.9 at.%, and was used together with the virgin material to establish adsorption isotherms for organic compounds in aqueous solutions. We examined how the aromaticity and substituents of the adsorptives affect adsorption on the model-activated carbon surface. For both virgin and oxidized graphite, the adsorption capacity for the aromatic compounds decreased in the order 1-naphthol &gt; 2-methoxynaphthalene &gt; naphthalene &gt; anisole &gt; phenol, with significant differences in the adsorption capacities of the two graphite species observed only for anisole, naphthalene, and 1-naphthol. The Freundlich constants (K F ) for the five compounds on virgin graphite were 23.9, 10.3, 5.5, 1.4, and 0.8 (nmol mg −1 )/(µmol L −1 ) n , respectively. Naphthalene and 1-naphthol were slightly more adsorbed on the virgin material, whereas oxidized graphite had marginally better adsorption properties for anisole. The results underline the importance of dispersive and π– π interactions in the adsorption of organic compounds on carbonaceous adsorbents; a second aromatic ring in 1-naphthol and 2-methoxynaphthalene greatly increased the adsorption capacity for these compounds compared with their one-ring counterparts phenol and anisole. Differences were also observed in the adsorption of compounds containing hydroxyl or methoxy substituents, which have electron-donating properties (a resonance effect) but different electron-withdrawal characteristics (caused by induction). Two amino acids occurring as zwitterions, l-tryptophan and l-tyrosine, were also tested as adsorptives. l-Tryptophan, which has a larger aromatic system, achieved higher loading on graphite, suggesting an adsorption mechanism primarily governed by dispersive and π– π interactions for these two ionic compounds as well.",

A pseudo triaxle experimental system, which is opposite to the name of true triaxial system, for the water-displacing-methane effect was created. First, cylindrical coal samples in a methane adsorption equilibrium state, spontaneously desorbed. And then water was injected into the coal samples. The following was shown: (1) The displacement methane volume gradually rises with an increase of injected water, while the displacement methane rate tends to rise at first before declining later. Simultaneously, the water-displacing-methane process is characterised by a time effect. The methane displacement lags behind water injection. (2) Competitive adsorption and displacement desorption between the water and methane will promote adsorption methane into free methane, while the pore pressure increase caused by water injection will turn free methane into adsorption methane. The net free methane of the combination action provides a methane source for the water-displacing-methane effect. (3) A pore pressure gradient, which provides a power source for the water-displacing-methane effect, is formed and reduces gradually at the front of the water seepage along the seepage direction. The increase in water pressure can rapidly improve the pore pressure gradient and boost the displacement methane volume as well as improve displacement methane efficiency. (4) A starting porosity pressure gradient and limit pore pressure exist in the process of water-displacing-methane. When the pore pressure gradient is less than the starting pore pressure gradient, there is free methane in the coal rock, but it cannot be displaced. When the pore pressure is between the starting pore pressure and the limit pore pressure, the free methane can be displaced. When the pore pressure is greater than the limit pore pressure, the methane is almost completely adsorption methane, and water cannot be used to displace the free methane.",

Our experiments showed that talc had an AT adsorption capacity of 11 mmol/kg. In addition, adsorption of AT on talc was instantaneous, which suggests that the adsorption sites were located on the external surfaces or edges. Factors such as solution pH, ionic strength and temperature all had minimal influence on AT adsorption, although the adsorption process was exothermic and the free energy of adsorption was negative, indicating weak physical adsorption.

Results of X-ray powder diffraction analysis showed that the formation of bicarbonate as a result of the K 2 CO 3 decomposition with CO 2 and H 2 O involved two reactions with K 4 H 2 (CO 3 ) 3 ·1.5H 2 O as an intermediate.

Because the equilibrium constant for the bicarbonate formation is smaller at higher temperatures, the reaction does not proceed as quickly or efficiently according to Le Châtelier's principle. Therefore, the CO 2 occlusion of K 2 CO 3 is suitable for the saturated occlusion amount at lower temperatures.",

Sorption properties of initial and modified sorbents are investigated. It is established that a-hydroxycarboxyl groups, which are present in all three kinds of sorbents, form colourless chelate complexes due to the replacement of their protons with an equivalent amount of metal ions. Because of the charge transfer during metal–ligand interactions, coloured chelate complexes are formed. In the aldehyde–bisulphite groups, two singly charged ions (Na + and H + ) are consequently replaced with two equivalents of metal ion resulting in the formation of colourless chelate complexes. Sorption isotherms of metal ions by the samples of native and modified cellulose are well described by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption values and Henry's constants are in good agreement with the quantity and nature of cellulose acidic groups.",

    "abstract": "Existing studies on the adsorption of alkaline earth metal ions have mainly focused on the adsorption of one alkaline earth metal ion. However, under natural conditions, alkaline earth metal ions usually co-exist. While separating them using an adsorbent, they compete with each other for adsorption onto the adsorbent. In this work, comparative and competitive adsorption of Mg, Ca and Sr ions onto four resins (D001, DJH003, LSC-100 and LSC-500) of sodium form were investigated in batch experiments at 25 °C. Our results showed that in all the experiments, the equilibrium point was attained in approximately 4 hours. In general, the pseudo-first-order model is more suitable to describe the adsorption kinetic data than the pseudo-second-order model. For both D001 and DJH003 resins, there are bigger differences in the adsorption amounts of Mg, Ca and Sr ions for the competitive adsorption than for the non-competitive adsorption. Under competitive adsorption conditions, the separation factor follows the order of β Sr/Mg &gt; β Ca/Mg , and the order of preference for adsorption is Sr 2+ &gt; Ca 2+ &gt; Mg 2+ . Therefore, it can be seen that there is a clear inhibitory effect for the adsorption of Mg ions owing to the competition of other ions. However, for both LSC-100 and LSC-500 resins, the competitive adsorption of Mg, Ca and Sr ions does not show obvious differences. The competitive adsorption results for all the resins were explained by considering hydration of the metal ions, electrostatic attractions and complexation between the metal ions and the resins. The results obtained would be helpful for understanding the competitive adsorption processes and the recovery or removal of one or more alkaline earth metal ions from aqueous solutions.",

In order to quantify their contribution to the total amount of adsorbed gas, we investigate the pore volume distribution on shale, coal, isolated kerogen, and clay samples using low pressure nitrogen and carbon dioxide adsorption method. And a series of methane adsorption isotherms on the samples was measured by a volumetric approach at 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C under pressures up to 10 MPa. Results indicate that a strong correlation exists between TOC and micropore volume of shale, but to verify the correlations between BET surface area and TOC, or micropore volume and Ro are still difficult. Certain isotherms on shales differ from Type I IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) isotherm. The unusual shape may be attributed to shale pore structure or composition. Finally, the modified D-A-Langmuir model including pore distribution parameters can provide a precise representation of the methane adsorption data on shales. The findings of this study are applicable to the accurate resource assessments and recovery technologies for shale-gas.",

    "abstract": "Activated carbon was prepared from the seeds of aguaje palm ( Mauritia flexuosa L.f.) by a chemical activation with phosphoric acid. This activated carbon was used for adsorbing metal ions: Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III). To understand the mechanism of adsorption of these heavy metals (Cr, Cd, and Pb), the activated carbon surface was oxidized with nitric acid (1 M) increasing the oxygenated surface groups showing an increasing in their adsorption capacities of these metals. The oxidized activated carbon slightly increased the maximum adsorption capacity to 5–7%. The order of adsorption for unoxidized and oxidized activated carbons was Pb&gt; Cd&gt; Cr. This experimental information was corroborated by molecular modeling program Hyperchem 8 based adsorption mainly on two factors: the electron density and orbitals—highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.Activated carbons were characterized by adsorption/desorption of N 2 , obtaining an increase of microporous surface area for oxidized activated carbon. An increase of surface acidity and a reduction of isoelectric points were observed in oxidized activated carbon. According to these results, the adsorption of metal ions is favored in contact with an oxidized activated carbon, which has more amount of phenolic and carboxylic functional groups. Similarly, decreasing the isoelectric point indicates that the surface has a higher negative charge. The surface information was corroborated by Hyperchem, which indicates that the surface of the oxidized activated carbon has a higher electron density, indicating a larger amount of electrons on its surface, which means the surface of oxidized activated carbon charges negatively and thereby attracts metal ions.",

    "abstract": "A novel stochastic model is proposed to characterize the adsorption kinetics of pollutants including dyes (direct red 80 and direct blue 1), fluoride ions, and cadmium ions removed by calcium pectinate (Pec-Ca), aluminum xanthanate (Xant-Al), and reed leaves, respectively. The model is based on a transformation over time following the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck stochastic process, which explicitly includes the uncertainty involved in the adsorption process. The model includes stochastic versions of the pseudo-first-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO), and pseudo-[Formula: see text]-order (PNO) models. It also allows the estimation of the adsorption parameters, including the maximum removal capacity ([Formula: see text]), the adsorption rate constant ([Formula: see text]), the reaction pseudoorder ([Formula: see text]), and the variability [Formula: see text]. The model fitted produced [Formula: see text] values similar to those of the nonstochastic versions of the PFO, PSO, and PNO models; however, the obtained values for each parameter indicate that the stochastic model better reproduces the experimental data. The [Formula: see text] values of the Pec-Ca-dye, Xant-Al-fluoride, and reed leaf-Cd +2 systems ranged from 2.0 to 9.7, 0.41 to 1.9, and 0.04 and 0.29 mg/g, respectively, whereas the values of [Formula: see text] ranged from 0.051 to 0.286, 0.743 to 75.73, and 0.756 to 8.861 (mg/g) 1- n /min, respectively. These results suggest a variability in the parameters [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] inherent to the natures of the adsorbate and adsorbent. The obtained [Formula: see text] values ranged from 1.13 to 2.02 for the Pec-Ca-dye system, 1.0–3.5 for the Xant-Al-fluoride system, and 1.8–3.8 for the reed leaf-Cd +2 system. These ranges indicate the flexibility of the stochastic model to obtain fractional [Formula: see text] values, resulting in high [Formula: see text] values. The variability in each system was evaluated based on [Formula: see text]. The developed model is the first to describe pollutant removal kinetics based on a stochastic differential equation.",

The current study is aimed at finding the interaction of HMs-resistance strains ( Bacillus cereus and Lysinibacillus macroides) with different concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg/L) of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and how they would cope with HM stress (Pb, Cd, Cr, and Cu). The growth rate and tolerance potential of bacteria were increased at lowered concentrations (5 and 10 mg/L) of ZnO NPs against HMs while it was unaffected at higher concentrations of ZnO NPs. These findings were confirmed by minimum inhibition zone and higher zinc solubilization at lower concentrations of ZnO NPs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that higher concentrations of ZnO NP increased HM accumulation in bacteria cells which had a significant impact on bacterial morphology and caused pores in bacterial membrane while in the case of lower concentrations, the cell remained unaffected. These results were further supported by the less production of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) contents at lower concentrations of ZnO NPs against heavy metal stress. This study suggested that synergistic treatment of Bacillus spp. with lower concentrations of ZnO NPs enhances the tolerance potential and significantly reduces the HM toxicity.",

The adsorption progress of MO and CR on PRM was found to be spontaneous and endothermic. The column studies demonstrated that, under dynamic flow, the PRM can efficiently remove MO and CR from aqueous solution, with adsorption capacities of 31.08 and 55.04 mg/g, respectively. In the toxicity test, the phytotoxicity of the column effluents (after dye removal) was significantly lowered compared to the initial dye influents.

    "abstract": "The continuous degradation of surface water quality by dye materials is of concern globally. Agricultural waste Litchi chinensis (LC) peel in its raw (RL) and modified (CL) forms was used as potential sorbents for sequestration of Congo red (CR) dye from an aqueous solution. The sorbents were characterized before and after sorption with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Determination of the point of zero charge (PZC) suggested CR dye sorption from an aqueous solution would be best in acidic pH. Batch experimental drivers such as the effects of time, dosage, initial concentration, pH, and temperature were optimized and used. Results from the study showed that modification with citric acid (CA) reduced the equilibration time from 90 to 15 min. Change in water chemistry did not significantly affect the removal efficiency of the sorbent but rather slightly improved it for both sorbent types. The smaller particle size of &lt;125 μm recorded higher removal efficiency than the larger one (&gt;125 μm). The effect of temperature affects the sorption differently. For the RL system, it decreases with an increase in the temperature, while for the CL system it increases with an increase in temperature. The Langmuir isotherm best described the equilibrium data obtained based on the linearized coefficients with maximum sorption capacities ([Formula: see text]) of 55.56 mg/g (RL) and 58.48 mg/g (CL). The pseudo-second-order model also best described the kinetic data. The thermodynamics study showed that the reaction is both feasible and spontaneous. Both sorbents recorded high removal efficiency for other dyes such as rhodamine B, methylene blue, methyl orange, malachite green, and erythrosin B. The five cycled regeneration/sorption experiments with 0.1 M NaOH as the desorbing agent showed that the regenerated sorbents efficiently removed CR dye from an aqueous solution close to their virgin samples for the first three cycles. This research, therefore, establishes LC peel as a potential eco-friendly, readily available, and effective sorbent for sequestration of hazardous dyes from wastewater.",

Not the effect of LMWOAs on inducing organic P (Po) released into soil solution through soil microorganisms at different temperatures was poorly understood, but the transform mechanism for P fraction was also not well explained. This study used three experiments to determine the release of P and the transformation mechanism of P fractions induced by oxalic acid, citric acid, and malic acid in acidic forest soils. The results showed that LMWOAs, as carbon sources for microorganisms, mobilize Po more effectively than glucose. Inorganic P and organic P were released by LMWOAs followed by [Formula: see text] if the substrates of P and LMWOAs were enough. There may be a critical threshold for the concentration of citric acid and oxalic acid between 10 mM and 25 mM to require for the solution of adsorbed and precipitated P, respectively. In all, LMWOAs increased the concentration of labile P by decreasing the concentration of stable P. The results indicated that LMWOAs can significantly promote P availability in acidic forests soils, and the effect of microorganisms on soil available P was more inclined to use LMWOAs than glucose.",

Utilization of biomass waste in the preparation of AC and BC has gained a lot of attention recently. This review outlines the techniques used for preparation, modification, characterization, and application of the above-mentioned materials in batch studies. The approaches towards understanding the adsorption mechanisms have also been discussed. It is observed that in the majority of the studies, high removal efficiencies were reported using biowaste adsorbents. Regarding the full potential of adsorption, varying values were obtained that are strongly influenced by the adsorbent preparation technique and adsorption method. In addition, most of the studies were concentrated on the kinetic, isotherm equilibrium, and thermodynamic aspects of adsorption, suggesting the dominant isotherm and kinetic models as Langmuir or Freundlich and pseudo-second-order models. Due to development in biosorbents, adsorption has been found to be increasingly economical. However, application of these adsorbents at commercial scale has not been adequately investigated and needs to be studied. Most of the studies have been conducted on synthetic solutions that do not completely represent the discharged effluents. This also needs attention in future studies.",

    "abstract": "This research is aimed at investigating the possible use of cassava agroindustry solid wastes in manufacturing adsorbents and their use in removing heavy metals Cd 2+ , Pb 2+ , and Cr total from water. Thus, a pilot study was conducted in two main steps: (1) obtaining and characterizing the adsorbents and (2) laboratory studies focused on the evaluation of critical physicochemical parameters on adsorption, such as pH of the solution containing heavy metals, the effect of adsorbent dose, besides kinetics and equilibrium adsorption and desorption studies. Three adsorbents were studied, cassava barks, bagasse, and their mixture. SEM, FTIR, pH PZC , acid digestion, and chemical composition analysis were employed for adsorbent characterization. The pH of the contaminated solution was evaluated within 4.0 to 7.0, while the adsorbent doses varied from 5.0 to 24.0 g L -1 . The adsorption kinetics was evaluated within 5 to 180 minutes and interpreted using pseudofirst- and second-order models. Finally, equilibrium and desorption studies were performed by evaluating adsorbent performance within 5 to 200 mg L -1 of heavy metals, using several nonlinear models for results interpretation. SEM analysis reveals a heterogeneous structure full of cavities. FTIR before and after adsorption reveals gaps related to missing functional groups, suggesting a significant role of alkenes, carboxylic acid, alcohol, anhydride, and ether. pH PZC is found at pH 6.02, 6.04, and 6.26 for adsorbents derived from barks, bagasse, and their mixture. In low concentrations of metals, the higher adsorption capacities were found at pH 7.0 (94.9%) using 16 g L -1 of adsorbent, with the most cost-benefit dose found using 8.0 g L -1 . The removal of metals reaches equilibrium within 5-10 minutes of contact time with pseudosecond-order best adjustments to the observed phenomena. The adsorption of metals by a cassava adsorbent is better adjusted to the Freundlich model, with significant and critical information provided by Sips, Redlich-Peterson, Temkin, Liu, and Khan models. Adsorption/desorption studies indicate that cassava adsorbent performs, on average, -10% of the adsorption of metals compared to activated carbon. Nevertheless, factors such as low cost and availability favor the use of such natural materials.",

A deep learning neural network (D-CNN) is proposed to predict the adsorption rate of [Formula: see text] on zeolites. The adsorbed amount will be classified and predicted by the D-CNN. Three tree machine learning models, namely, gradient decision model (GDM), scalable boosting tree model (SBT), and gradient variant decision tree model (GVD), were fused.

The important extracted features from the three employed model were fused and used as the fusion feature set in our proposed model: fusion matrix deep learning model (FMDL). A dataset of 1400 data items, on adsorbent type and various adsorption pressure, is used as inputs for the D-CNN model. Comparison of the proposed model is done against the three tree models, which utilizes a single training layer. The error measure of the D-CNN and the tree model architectures utilize the mean square error confirming the efficiency of 0.00003 for our model, 0.00062 for the SBT, 0.00091 for the GDM, and 0.00098 for the GVD, after 150 epochs.

The main objective of the present paper is to evaluate the use of Moringa oleifera (MO) as a natural coagulant in coagulation/flocculation (C/F) followed by the ultrafiltration (UF) of Final Effluent Treatment Plant wastewater treatment which can also be employed as an alternative to the present conventional methods of treatment. Process efficiency was evaluated in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), turbidity, total hardness, alkalinity, ammoniacal nitrogen, and zeta potential along with permeability and fouling behaviour of the membrane. A significant improvement in both the physical and chemical characteristics of the effluent quality is showing a clearer colour and a greater reduction in BOD (89.74%) and COD (63.80%) values, while pH was in the acceptable range for effluent disposal. The results indicate a lower membrane fouling rate (49%), an increase in permeate flow, and better quality of the permeate, proving that the C/F-UF treatment is an effective and efficient technique for wastewater treatment. Eventually, the treated wastewater obtained with this process generates better quality water and preserves the aquatic ecosystem.",

Several alternatives have been proposed to contribute in a cheaper and efficient way to treat these effluents. This study aimed to describe the results obtained in the removal of the concentrations of Cu(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) ions, present in an aqueous solution, by the use of a hybrid system combining the adsorption and electroflotation processes simultaneously. The adsorbent materials used were two Brazilian soil clays classified as sodium clay (SC) and ferric clay (FC). For the electroflotation process, aluminum, iron, and stainless-steel electrodes were used. The obtained data showed good efficiency in the removal of the four metallic ion concentrations. The best results presented a reduction in the concentration of Cu(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) ions of 50.11%, 36.71%, 21.59%, and 23.43%, respectively, when it was used the hybrid system formed by the ferrous clay as adsorbent and the aluminum electrode for the electroflotation process.",

However, these processes are challenging due to their similar physical properties, including molecule sizes and boiling points. Herein, we report an N-rich cage-based microporous metal-organic framework (MOF), [Cd 5 (Tz) 9 ](NO 3 ) (termed as Cd-TZ, TZ stands for tetrazole), and its highly efficient separation of C 2 H 2 /CO 2 and C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 . Single-component gas adsorption isotherms reveal that Cd-TZ exhibits high C 2 H 2 adsorption capacity (3.10 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar). The N-rich cages in Cd-TZ can trap C 2 H 2 with a higher isosteric heat of adsorption (40.8 kJ mol -1 ) than CO 2 and C 2 H 4 owing to the robust host-guest interactions between the noncoordinated N atoms and C 2 H 2 , which has been verified by molecular modeling studies. Cd-TZ shows a high IAST selectivity for C 2 H 2 /CO 2 (8.3) and C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 (13.3). The breakthrough simulations confirm the potential for separating C 2 H 2 /CO 2 and the purification of C 2 H 4 from C 2 H 2 .",

However, it is a great threat to public health and the adsorbent needs to be adopted for removing the radioactive iodine. The iodine adsorbent needs to have some advantages, such as simple preparation method, low cost, high absorption capacity, and recyclable utilization. In order to meet the above requirements, the etched material of institute Lavoisier 101 (MIL-101) was prepared to absorb the gaseous iodine. After the MIL-101 is etched, the iodine adsorption performance has been greatly improved. The iodine adsorption experiment of etched MIL-101 with different etching time (1 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 6 h) was completed, the results show that the optimal etching time is 4 hours and the capture capacity of the etched MIL-101 is 371 wt%, which is about 22% higher than that of original MIL-101. The experiment results of XRD, FT-IR, and XPS prove that the components and structure of etched MIL-101 are accordable with those of MIL-101. The surface roughness is introduced in this work. The pore roughness is also an important factor to the adsorption capacity, and the related research also supports this conclusion. Furthermore, after iodine is absorbed, etched MIL-101 can be treated by ethanol for iodine release, and the etched MIL-101 has satisfied recyclability within three cycles. Compared with MIL-101, etched MIL-101 not only had good reversible adsorption of iodine but also can adsorb low-concentration iodine. The etched MIL-101 has a broad application prospect in nuclear emergency response and radiation detection.",

In particular, we examined how MR adsorption of perchlorate interacts competitively with concomitant adsorption of agriculture-derived phosphate and nitrate contaminants. Equilibrium and pH experiments were first conducted in single-component systems, the results of which were best described by the Langmuir-Freundlich (L-F) isotherm. Subsequent analyses of competitive effects on adsorption showed that although MR had a higher adsorption capacity for perchlorate alone than for nitrate or phosphate alone, the addition of either phosphate or nitrate to a perchlorate solution had a diminishing effect on MR adsorption of perchlorate within a natural-water pH range, with phosphate having the stronger competitive effect. Perchlorate adsorption on MR varied inversely with competing ion concentrations, providing direct evidence of the perchlorate diminution effect being attributable to anion competition. Finally, we developed a multicomponent isotherm model that describes the binary adsorption of perchlorate in the presence of each of these competing anions. The results of this work provide perchlorate removal efficiency information that is directly applicable to the design of water treatment systems.",

The nanostructured adsorbents were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, elemental analysis, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption at 77 K, point of zero charge, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscopy. The descending adsorption values of nanostructured adsorbents: for diuron BT (99.35%) &gt; BIO (96.36%) &gt; AL (88.33%), hexazinone, BT (97.26%) &gt; AL (83.75%) &gt; BIO (14.22%), and sulfometuron-methyl, AL (95.73%) &gt; BT (90.96%) &gt; BIO (34.92%). The time required for the adsorption equilibrium was 1 hour, with greater adequacy to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms showed the best fit of herbicide adsorption on the microporous BT and BIO, respectively. In the AL, the diuron and hexazinone experimental data fitted more precisely to Temkin's model and sulfometuron-methyl to Freundlich's model. Nanostructured adsorbents have different capacities to adsorb diuron, hexazinone, and sulfometuron-methyl herbicides present in aqueous media, with BT being the material with the highest adsorption capacity for the remediation of the mixture containing the three herbicides.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated using walnut shells (WSs), a commonly found adsorbent, to remove tylosin, a common antibiotic, from wastewater. Characterization of the WS was carried out using Brunauer, Emmet, and Teller (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). To determine the adsorption conditions in the batch system, solution pH, adsorbent amount, and contact time factors were studied. In the continuous system, flow rate and adsorbent amount were investigated. In adsorption studies carried out in a batch system, the optimum pH was determined as the original pH of the antibiotic solution (pH 7.5). Adsorption equilibrium was established in 30 minutes for a 10 g/L adsorbent amount. Kinetic and isotherm parameters were calculated using data obtained from experimental studies. The kinetic studies were evaluated with pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models. The tylosin's adsorption results on WS show that it fits the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The isotherm studies on the adsorption of tylosin with WS were performed using the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm models. The tylosin's adsorption results on WS show that it fits the Langmuir isotherm model. In the adsorption studies carried out in the column system, the adsorbent amount and flow rate parameters were 30 g/L and 0.2 mL/min, respectively. In studies carried out in batch and column system environments, 78% and 100% removal were achieved, respectively. This method was successfully applied to determine tylosin in wastewater samples.",

These monoliths exhibited excellent mechanical properties compared to commercial ceramic-based monoliths, with potential for their use in continuous systems due to ease of handling and extraction of the adsorption medium (i.e., packed bed) and having defined meso and macroporosity. Specifically, the clay-based monoliths were obtained along with (i) active iron phases (hematite and magnetite), (ii) bone char and (iii) a combination of both materials. They showed As(V) adsorption capacities of up to 0.56, 3.4 and 8.0 mg g −1 at neutral pH and room temperature conditions. The proposed adsorption mechanism was associated with ligand exchange between the As(V) species and the hydroxyl functional groups, in addition to the presence of inner-sphere bidentate unprotonated arsenate surface complexes that was reflected in the formation of new absorption bands in Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectra related to the Metal-O interaction and changes in the bands associated with the -OH groups. The SIPS isotherm model fitted the experimental data obtained at equilibrium and was related to strong adsorbent/adsorbate interactions and high surface heterogeneity. Finally, the composite ceramic monolith synthesized in the present study exhibits capabilities comparable to those reported in the literature, highlighting the low cost of raw materials, as well as its excellent mechanical properties and well-defined porosity.",

Concrete exhibits variations between adsorbing and desorbing behavior of water vapor. This study conducted experiments on the adsorption and desorption of water vapor of concrete materials to investigate the respective processes. The hysteresis curve obtained from these tests provides insights into the characteristics of the pore structure of concrete material. The results indicate that the desorption activation energy of concrete material exceeds that of the first layer's adsorption energy, making water vapor desorption from inner pore walls more challenging than its adsorption. According to the isothermal adsorption and desorption hysteresis curves associated with humidity variations, the volumetric ratio of different size and shape pores can be determined. In concrete materials, capillary pores account for 22%–43% of the total pore volume, and large-volume pores with narrow throats range from 15% to 25%. For concrete with a certain water-binder ratio, an increase in fly ash content leads to a higher proportion of capillary pores. Besides, when the fly ash content remains constant, an increase in the water-binder ratio results in a decrease in the volume ratio of capillary pores and large pores with narrow throat.",

The efficacy of adsorbent removal was studied concerning adsorption characteristics such as pH, dose of CAC, initial dye concentration, and adsorption time. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and UV-visible analysis all showed that the dye mixture stuck to the CAC surface at the same time. Results revealed the best simultaneous adsorption efficiencies for the investigated dyes were attained in the pH range of 3–10, with a CAC dose of 0.08 g.

The maximum adsorption capacities were CV (239.23 mg·g −1 ), NBB (134.95 mg·g −1 ), and MO (45.93 mg·g −1 ).

The study also evaluated and compared their adsorption capacity, removal, optimum adsorption conditions, as well as adsorption kinetics and isotherms. Both adsorbents were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), elemental analysis, specific surface area, bulk density, pore volume, cation-exchange capacity, and pH pzc . The effects of initial concentration, initial pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and temperature on the adsorption onto olive pomace and biochar were investigated using the batch method. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model controlled the adsorption of Th(IV) ions, as shown by the kinetic analysis. The Langmuir isotherm best presented the isothermal data for olive pomace and biochar. The maximum Th(IV) adsorption capacities onto olive pomace and biochar were obtained as 68.0 and 154 mg/g at pH 4.0 and 45.0°C, respectively. The adsorption of Th(IV) onto olive pomace and biochar was an endothermic (positive ΔH°), spontaneous (negative ΔG°), and random process (positive ΔS°). After column adsorption, Th(IV) ions were recovered by treating the loaded biochar and olive pomace with 1.0 or 0.1 M HNO 3 . The first and second stages of recovery employing 1.0 M HNO 3 produced the highest recovery percent of Th(IV). The results showed that these adsorbents can be utilized effectively and affordably to extract Th(IV) ions.",

    "abstract": "Coal seam water injection is a coal mine safety technology used to inhibit coal dust and reduce the potential risk of gas explosions, but its effectiveness is limited by the wettability of the coal seam. Anthracite coal, due to its strong hydrophobicity, is difficult to fully combine with injected water. To improve the wettability of anthracite coal, this study systematically investigates the regulatory effects and wettability mechanisms of the non-ionic surfactant dodecyl β- d -maltoside (DDM) on anthracite coal, combining physical experiments and molecular simulations from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. The contact angle experiments indicated that DDM significantly reduced the contact angle of anthracite and enhanced its wettability. XPS and FTIR spectral analysis showed that DDM improved the chemical composition of the coal surface by decreasing the content of hydrophobic functional groups and increasing the content of hydrophilic functional groups on the coal surface. Molecular dynamics simulations further revealed the adsorption characteristics and microscopic wettability mechanism of DDM on the surface of anthracite coal. The results showed that the hydrophobic tail chain of DDM adsorbed onto the coal surface, while the hydrophilic head group oriented toward the water phase, significantly enhanced the interactions between water molecules and the coal surface, increased the number of hydrogen bonds and the contribution of electrostatic energy, thereby greatly improved the hydrophilicity of anthracite coal. This study provides theoretical support and technical references for improving the wettability of anthracite coal in coal seam water injection.",

Their adsorption and chemisorption characteristics were recorded using a nitrogen low-temperature adsorption/desorption method and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia, respectively. It was shown that changes in the synthesis conditions had a considerable impact on the micro- and meso-porosity of the samples. A low-temperature band dominated the ammonia TPD spectra of the ZCMS samples, reflecting the retention of ammonia by the sodium cations of the zeolite acting as weak Lewis acid sites. ZCMS was found to display an appreciable activity in cumene cracking at 723 K. It was shown that during the conversion of ZCMS to FCC catalysts through the decationization and ultra-stabilization of the zeolite phase, the latter is appreciably destroyed giving rise to a considerable increase in the mesoporosity of the samples without any change in the average diameters of such mesopores. It was concluded that the catalyst stability is characterized by pores of an intermediate (20-30 A) diameter, thereby demonstrating the strength of the linkage between the zeolite and matrix phases. The zeolite phase content and adsorption characteristics of catalysts prepared on the basis of Prosyana kaolin meet the demands of modern FCC catalysts.",

On the other hand, CI Acid Red 138, which contains a dodecyl group in the chemical structure, was adsorbed to a considerable extent even at higher pH values, suggesting hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl group in the dye molecule and the hydrophobic crosslinker.",

The analysis presented was based on a comparison of the results of sorption and expansion studies of single gases (CO 2 and CH 4 ) and their mixtures on two hard coals (V daf : 40.87% and 22.32%). The work presented was undertaken in an attempt to determine the influence of the sorptive deformation of the coals, caused by the pre-sorption of CO 2 , on the variation of their external dimensions during CH 4 sorption and vice versa, and during sorption of a mixture of these gases. In addition, it was anticipated that the work could answer the question as to which of these gases would enrich the desorbed gas. Knowledge of these effects should facilitate further exploration of the relationship between the properties of a hard coal and methane evolution to establish those factors that enhance the rate and effectiveness of the process.",

A comparison between these three types of adsorbent was performed in terms of dynamic and equilibrium considerations. The adsorption capacity of physically activated rubber was (marginally) greater than that of chemically activated rubber which, in turn, was greater than that of the untreated materials. The effects of activation temperature and time were considered in the physical activation process. Up to 97% of the Cu 2+ ions were adsorbed from aqueous solution when untreated, chemically or physically activated tyre rubber was employed as an adsorbent with initial metal concentrations of 20 mg/ml and 40 ppm, respectively. Increasing the adsorbent concentration resulted in a greater removal of metal ions from the aqueous solution, and increasing the Cu 2+ ion concentration in the presence of a constant adsorbent concentration increased the metal ion loading per unit weight of the adsorbent. An increase in the initial pH value of the metal solutions enhanced the adsorption process with all three adsorbents tested. It was demonstrated that the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms were capable of describing the adsorption of Cu 2+ ions by the adsorbents under consideration reasonably well.",

The adsorption of Mo(VI) and Zr(IV) ions onto TODGA/SiO 2 -P was investigated by examining the influence of nitric acid and oxalic acid concentrations. It was found that the adsorption was strongly affected by increasing the HNO 3 concentration from 0.5 M to 9.0 M either with or without the addition of 0.5 M H 2 C 2 O 4 . In the absence of 0.5 M H 2 C 2 O 4 , the distribution coefficients (K d ) of both Mo(VI) and Zr(IV) ions decreased with an increase in the HNO 3 concentration from 0.5 M to 3.0 M, increased slowly when the concentration of HNO 3 was increased further from 3.0 M to 6.0 M, and then increased gradually above 6.0 M concentration. Furthermore, the adsorption of Zn(IV) ions onto TODGA/SiO 2 -P was considerably greater than that of Mo(VI) ions. In the presence of 0.5 M H 2 C 2 O 4 , Zr(IV) ions showed no adsorption at HNO 3 concentrations below 4.0 M, being partly adsorbed in the presence of 4.0–6.0 M HNO 3 and fully adsorbed when the HNO 3 concentration was greater than 6.0 M. In contrast, Mo(VI) ions showed a much lower adsorption at HNO 3 concentrations below 2.0 M and no adsorption above this acid level. In the presence of HNO 3 at a concentration above 6.0 M and containing 0.5 M H 2 C 2 O 4 , the adsorption of Zr(IV) ions overlapped that from a similar HNO 3 solution which did not include 0.5 M H 2 C 2 O 4 . This was attributed to complete protonation of the C 2 O 2− 2 anion. On the basis of batch experiments, Mo(VI) and Zr(IV) ions were separated from a 6.5 M HNO 3 solution containing 0.5 M H 2 C 2 O 4 by means of a column packed with TODGA/SiO 2 -P at 50°C. The separate components, Mo(VI) and Zr(IV), could be effectively separated from each other by eluting with some selected eluants. The recovery percentage was 100.5% for Mo(VI) ions and 96.8% for Zr(IV) ions.",

Ion-exchange studies showed that over the complete concentration range studied the adsorption ratios for metal cations adsorbed onto kaolin correlated with the linear forms of the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin—Kaganer—Radushkevich (DKR) adsorption isotherms. The cationexchange capacity of kaolin towards each metal ion studied was evaluated. It was found that the adsorption phenomena depended on the charge density and diameter of the hydrated ion. The equilibrium studies demonstrated that the selectivity of the ions followed the sequence Zn(II) &gt; Cu(II) &gt; Co(II) at pH 7.0. Calculation of thermodynamic parameters such as the standard enthalpy (ΔH 0 ), Gibbs free energy (ΔG 0 ) and entropy (ΔS 0 ) showed that the adsorption of the heavy metal ions studied onto kaolin was an endothermic process which was favoured at higher temperatures. These results show that natural kaolin has a considerable potential for the removal of heavy metal cationic species from aqueous solution and wastewater.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the effect of solid surface mediation on the intermolecular potential energy of nitrogen, and its impact on the adsorption of nitrogen on a graphitized carbon black surface and in carbon slit-shaped pores. This effect arises from the lower effective interaction potential energy between two particles close to the surface compared to the potential energy of the same two particles when they are far away from the surface. A simple equation is proposed to calculate the reduction factor and this is used in the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation of nitrogen adsorption on graphitized thermal carbon black. With this modification, the GCMC simulation results agree extremely well with the experimental data over a wide range of pressure; the simulation results with the original potential energy (i.e. no surface mediation) give rise to a shoulder in the neighbourhood of monolayer coverage and a significant over-prediction of the second and higher layer coverages. The influence of this surface mediation on the dependence of the pore-filling pressure on the pore width is also studied. It is shown that such surface mediation has a significant effect on the pore-filling pressure. This implies that the use of the local isotherms obtained from the potential model without surface mediation could give rise to a serious error in the determination of the pore-size distribution.",

Dilute single-solute solutions of cadmium and nickel ions (≤ 1 mM) were used as models. All the biomaterials showed appreciable Cd(II) ion biosorption which was strongly dependent on the dosage used. The maximum Cd(II) ion biosorption capacities (X mL ), as estimated from the experimental isotherms using the Langmuir model, indicated that the red algae (X mL = 0.26–0.52 mmol/g) and the lignocellulosic biomasses with larger lignin contents (X mL = 0.17–0.20 mmol/g) possessed the greatest potential. This behaviour also applied to Ni(II) ion biosorption, although the biomaterials proved to be less effective in this case, especially towards low dosage. Comparison of the Cd(II) ion equilibrium sorption by one of the lowest performing biomasses (sawdust from Arundo donax stems) with that for activated carbons developed from the same biomass under different atmospheres revealed that the biomass behaviour was similar to that of carbons activated by heating in inert or mildly oxidative atmospheres.",

    "abstract": "We report some conceptual and numerical results for a single-column chromatographic process analogous to a simulated moving bed (SMB) with asynchronous port switching. It is shown that the periodic state of the multi-column SMB unit is reproduced by a one-column chromatograph in which the part of its outlet stream that is not recovered as product is recycled back to the column with a lag of (N – 1)τ time units, where N and τ are, respectively, the number of columns and the switching interval of the equivalent SMB unit. This requirement holds true regardless of the port configuration or operational scheme of the analogous multi-column unit. The proposed one-column chromatographic process is a more compact, less expensive and simpler-to-operate alternative to the SMB. By changing the operation of the single-column chromatograph from the classical synchronous port switching to an optimized asynchronous Varicol mode, it is shown that one can easily compensate for a less perfect operation of the plug-flow device that implements the recycle lag.",

    "abstract": "Studies of Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ion adsorption onto vermiculite from buffered and unbuffered aqueous solutions were conducted in order to compare their ion adsorption behaviours in different systems. The use of buffer reagents had a strong and negative effect on the adsorption of the metal ions under study. The experimental data obtained from both the buffered and unbuffered solutions could not be described by a single traditional adsorption isotherm due to the effect of the adsorbent concentration (W). The equilibrium ion concentration in bulk solution (Z) and the equilibrium ion adsorption density (X/W ratio) decreased with increasing W in both buffered and unbuffered systems, indicating that the use of a buffer solution is not an effective measure for eliminating the effect of the adsorbent concentration. The addition of competitive ions (H + , Cd 2+ and Zn 2+ ) greatly reduced the adsorption of the target metal ion. Within the pH range tested (initial pH &lt; 7), the competitive effect of H + ions was equivalent to that of Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ions. In unitary, binary and ternary systems, highly significant linear correlations were obtained between the change in the ionic strength (ΔI) and the quantity of ion adsorption. The results obtained suggest that it is not necessary to control the ionic strength in ion adsorption experiments because ΔI is a function of ion adsorption, and the use of buffer reagents has a negative effect on ion adsorption.",

Such studies were conducted by varying various parameters such as the pH, the adsorbent dosage, the salt concentration, the contact time, the concentration of the adsorbate and the temperature. The kinetic experimental data were analyzed using three kinetic equations, viz. the pseudo-first-order equation, the pseudo-second-order equation and the intra-particle diffusion model equation, to examine the mechanism of adsorption and the potential rate-controlling step. The mechanism of the process was found to be complex, consisting of both surface adsorption and pore diffusion. The values of the effective diffusion parameter, D eff , were estimated to be of the order of 10 −8 cm 2 /s, indicated that intra-particle diffusion was not the rate-controlling step. The equilibrium adsorption data obtained at various temperatures were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich–Peterson isotherm models using non-linear regressive analysis. The equilibrium adsorption results were better fitted by the Langmuir and Redlich–Peterson isotherms relative to the Freundlich model. Calculated thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption of NR onto MRH was feasible, spontaneous and endothermic under the studied conditions. The carboxyl groups on the surface of the modified rice husk (MRH) were primarily responsible for the sorption of NR. It is suggested that MRH may be suitable as an adsorbent material for adsorbing NR from aqueous solutions.",

The adsorption capacity of the resin towards different metal ions from wastewater was determined at different pH values within the range 1–6.

Among the adsorbents studied have been natural clays. The present study was aimed at evaluating smectite clay as a viable adsorbent for the removal of dyes from wastewater in industrial textile laundries. This clay is mainly composed of residue generated in the activities related to the exploration of gypsite which is abundantly available in the Araripe–PE region, located in Northeast Brazil. In the methodology chosen, a solution of the navy blue dye Solophenyl, which is the main dye employed in such laundries, was prepared with the following composition: 0.75 g dye + 11.25 g sodium chloride in 1000 mℓ of water. The clay (0.2 g quantity) was used in two forms: the natural extracted material and product obtained after its calcination at 300 °C. All assays were undertaken employing a porous bed column. The experimental data allowed an assessment of the kinetic behaviour of the dye, and of the removal capacity and removal efficiency of the examined clays. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained with smectite clay calcined at 300 °C, being 10.36 mg Solophenyl dye per gram clay at an output rate of 3 mℓ/min. The results were adjusted to the Logistic function model available in Origin 6.1 software, when an excellent correlation was obtained with the experimental adsorption data.",

The organic cations cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMA), tetramethylammonium bromide (TMA) and Crystal Violet (CV) were selected for producing two bentonites with different layer charges. The results obtained showed that the adsorption capacities of the three organic cations towards bentonite were in the order CTMA &lt; CV &gt; TMA. TMA-bentonite had the smallest basal spacing values but the largest surface area, but both CV-bentonite and CTM-bentonite had small surface areas. The sorption capacity of 2,4-dichlorophenol onto CTMA-bentonite increased with increasing bentonite layer charge, while the reverse was observed with TMA-bentonite. With CV-bentonite, the sample with the lower layer charge showed only a limited capacity towards the sorption of 2,4-dichlorophenol, and exhibited a much smaller sorption capacity relative to CTMA-bentonite and TMA-bentonite. The results obtained in the present study indicate that CTMA aggregates during sorption and that siloxane surfaces provide the major sorption sites on CTMA-bentonite and TMA-bentonite, respectively.

    "abstract": "Surface ion-imprinting technology was applied to prepare a new Sr(II) ion-imprinted polymer [Sr(II)-IP] by grafting chitosan-Sr(II) onto potassium titanate whiskers. The imprinting mechanism of the prepared polymer was examined, using infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of pH and contact time were examined, together with the adsorption capacity and selectivity of the imprinted polymer. The adsorption isotherms could be fitted by the Langmuir model, with the dimensionless separation factor R L indicated favourable adsorption. In addition, the kinetic data were fitted more closely by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model rather than the pseudo-first-order model. The values of the Gibbs' free energy (ΔG 0 ), standard entropy (ΔS 0 ) and standard enthalpy (ΔH 0 ) calculated from the adsorption data suggested that the adsorption of Sr(II) onto Sr(II)-IP was a spontaneous and endothermic process. The relative selectivity coefficients of Sr(II)-IP for Sr(II)/Cs(I) at different initial concentrations were 95.8, 320 and 1428.6, respectively, which were far greater than that of the non-imprinted polymer (NIP).",

    "abstract": "The low gas permeability of coal formations with limited coal pores and fractures leads to difficulty in coalbed methane exploration. High-voltage electrical pulse has a potential application in enhanced coalbed methane recovery. In this study, we discuss the microscopic characteristics of anthracite coals treated by high-voltage electrical pulse. We find that C, O, and other coal elements constituting oxygenic groups, which mainly account for gas adsorption, decreased slightly after high-voltage electrical pulse treatment, indicating that elemental variation may have little influence on gas adsorption. The scanning electron microscopy and low-pressure nitrogen gas adsorption (LP-N 2 GA) results show that the cumulative micropore volumes of high-voltage electrical pulse-treated coals were much larger than those of original coals. The mercury intrusion porosimetry results show that the cumulative macropore volumes, which act as gas migration channels in coal increased. Additionally, high-voltage electrical pulse-treated coals were found to have smaller entrapment areas, indicating that gas migration was enhanced.",

Adsorbent is the key to the adsorptive performance. Both π complexation and direct sulfur metal bonds are efficient methods for adsorptive desulfurization. For construction of these bonds, it is necessary to introduce active metal species on the support. In this work, Ce(NO 3 ) 2 was directly introduced into the as-synthesized SBA-15, and high dispersion of CeO 2 nanoparticles was obtained. With the loading content of 12–46 wt%, the particle sizes of the CeO 2 NPs are in the range of 4.4–6.3 nm. The good dispersion status of CeO 2 nanoparticles is contributed to the template P123 preserved in as-synthesized SBA-15, which provides a confined space for the dispersion of CeO 2 nanoparticles. However, the large CeO 2 particles (7.0 nm) are formed for the sample originated from template-free SBA-15. We also demonstrate that the adsorptive performance of SBA-15 is enhanced with the modification of CeO 2 nanoparticles. Besides, the performances of CeO 2 nanoparticle-modified samples stay in step with the dispersion status of the CeO 2 nanoparticles.",

BEs were obtained by H 2 SO 4 activation of a white calcium bentonite (CaB) sample from the Kütahya region of Turkey. After drying for 4 h at 105 °C, the CaB samples were activated by heating their acidic aqueous suspensions for 6 h at 97 °C, the acid content of the dry bentonite/acid mixture being varied in the 0–70% mass range. The respective specific surface area (S) and specific nanopore volume (V) of the BEs were determined from nitrogen adsorption/desorption data obtained at −196 °C. For natural CaB, the values of S and V were 44 m 2 /g and 0.11 cm 3 /g, respectively. These values attained a maximum of 135 m 2 /g and 0.30 cm 3 /g for the BE sample prepared employing 40% H 2 SO 4 for acid activation. Interestingly, the maximum BP was not associated with the maximum S and V values. The optimum values for the percentage H 2 SO 4 , S and V for attaining the maximum BP were 20%, 100 m 2 /g and 0.17 cm 3 /g, respectively. The mean nanopore radius (r) of each BE was calculated using the corresponding S and V values. Nanopores with a mean radius in the range 3.5–5.5 nm, which was close to the diameter of the coloured pigment, were found to be mostly responsible for the BP towards SO and CSO. The results obtained in the present study indicate that the value of r was more effective than the S and V values of BEs in the bleaching of vegetable oils. Adsorption of a pigment onto a BE was found to depend not only on the physicochemical interaction between the pigment molecule and the BE surface, but also on the mean nanopore size.",

The CO 2 adsorption isotherms of ACFs with different porosities were systematically examined at 273 and 298 K under ambient pressure conditions. The porosities of the ACFs were characterized by the adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K. We analyzed the adsorption capabilities of three types of ACFs (A5, A10 and A20) having different slit-shaped pore widths, specific surface areas and micropore volumes. Our results reveal that A5 had ultramicropores and achieved a higher adsorption of CO 2 at low relative pressure (&lt;0.015) at 273 K. However, A10, which had an average pore width of 0.9 nm, exhibited the highest adsorption capacity of 195 mg g −1 at a higher pressure of about 100 kPa, which is a relatively high value compared with that of conventional activated carbon. By establishing the temperature dependence of CO 2 adsorptivity and using Dubinin–Radushkevich analysis, we characterized the interaction energy between pores and CO 2 molecules. Our results shed light on the fundamental aspects of CO 2 adsorption of ACFs, moving them towards being a viable CCS.",

    "abstract": "Peroxidase catalyzes the oxidation of various substrates at the expense of hydrogen peroxide. Among the various techniques used for the purification of enzymes, expanded-bed adsorption chromatography is particularly popular because it offers several advantages, such as greater interactions between adsorbents and target molecules, increased overall yield, potential for a scale-up and shorter process times. It relies on the interaction between charged molecules in the mobile phase (i.e. buffer and sample) and oppositely charged groups coupled to the resin in the expanded-bed form. Other chromatographic techniques are also commonly used for peroxidase purification and characterization; however, there are no reports in the literature about the use of expanded-bed adsorption chromatography for this purpose. In this paper, the purification of peroxidase from rice bran using ion-exchange chromatography (expanded-bed column) was investigated. Chromatographic assays were carried out using STREAMLINE SP cationic resin with different buffer solutions and pH values in the equilibrium, washing and elution steps. The use of 0.025 mol/l sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.5 (during equilibration and washing) and 4.7 (during elution) allowed for the purification of peroxidase from rice bran, resulting in a purification factor and enzyme recovery of 2.4-fold and 41%, respectively.",

Specification and optimization of carbon structures are vastly examined by different researchers. However, because of complex relations between independent and dependent variables, the proposed statistical and mathematical models are not satisfactory. In this paper, the specifications of some ACs synthesized by chemical activation methods are predicted. The effects of parameters such as agent type, activation time, activation temperature, impregnation ratio and heating rate on the BET surface areas and micropore volumes of ACs are also analyzed. Two models of artificial neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference systems are used. Later on, a number of data on other ACs reported by several researchers are used for the model validation. The obtained results from these two models are found to be satisfactory. The coefficients of determination for these models were 0.982 and 0.984, respectively. Through this modelling of AC production process, which was the main purpose of this study, the specifications of ACs may be obtained without spending extra time and expenses.",

The response surface methodology (RSM) was applied as a tool for the optimization of adsorption operational conditions (temperature, pH and adsorbent dose) with the combined effects of the key processing variables on the Cr removal efficiency (%R Cr ). The following conditions were found to be optimal: pH = 2, temperature = 28 °C, adsorbent dose = 4 g l −1 . The %R Cr obtained experimentally (92%) was in agreement with the value predicted by RSM (88%). The adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and obeyed the Langmuir isotherm model. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔH°, ΔS° and ΔG°) indicated the exothermic and spontaneous nature of adsorption governed by physisorption interactions. Hydrous Ce 0.25 Zr 0.75 O 2 showed high adsorption capacity (25 mg g −1 ), high desorption efficiency (80%), reached adsorption equilibrium quickly (30 minutes) and high chemical stability. The Cr(VI) adsorption on hydrous Ce 0.25 Zr 0.75 O 2 was not completely reversible. The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under acidic conditions was also responsible for Cr(VI) removal.",

We found differences in physicochemical properties of clay samples using isotherms of nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "Investigations of the coal—gas system—in particular, those concerning the amount of the gas adsorbed and the kinetics of its release—are extremely important in the analysis of hazards associated with the presence of methane and outbursts of gas and rocks. Such an investigation is also useful for analyzing the adsorbent parameters. Adsorption analyzers that are available on the market fall into two types: gravimetric and volumetric. Gravimetric analyzers are very complex, stationary devices. Their biggest drawback is the problem pertaining to a sudden pressure change, which initiates the processes of gas adsorption and transportation. This is associated with a higher degree of measurement uncertainty with regard to the determination of the diffusion coefficient. By contrast, volumetric analyzers are usually far cheaper and are capable of processing sudden pressure changes. However, in this case, the measurement is seldom isobaric in nature, which makes it difficult to use for determination of the diffusion coefficient on the basis of the unipore model. The author of this paper intends to show a simple device based on a gas flowmeter, which makes use of a phenomenon known as ‘barbotage’. The cost of constructing such a device is several dozen times cheaper than the cost of gravimetric and volumetric analyzers available on the market. A sudden pressure change is allowed, and the release of methane is measured under quasi-isobaric conditions. The paper discusses the concept of the device and provides an analysis of the results that it generated. These results were juxtaposed with those obtained using a gravimetric reference device.",

Transmission electron microscopy observations showed that the NCs consist of clusters of strongly aggregated nanoparticles (NPs) similarly to a “plum pudding”, where hematite NPs “raisins” are surrounded by ferrihydrite “pudding”. The arsenic adsorption performance of the NCs can be modified for As(III) and As(V) removal, which depends on the NCs composition and the size of hematite NPs. It was found that adequate ferrihydrite/hematite NCs adsorb As(III) faster than ferrihydrite. Otherwise, for As(V), the adsorption exhibited by NCs is slower that for pure ferrihydrite. The data of adsorption isotherms fitted better to the Freundlich model for both As(III) and As(V) adsorption. For all the samples, the model revealed that chemical adsorption is the favorable adsorption process. Additionally, for the ferrihydrite/hematite NCs, the capacity of adsorption for As(III) is higher than for As(V). The high affinity of the NCs for the adsorption of As(III) makes them a good alternative for arsenic removal.",

Aiming to minimize the presence of this polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in aquatic ecosystems, it is important to develop and consider new alternatives that enable its partial or total removal by different mechanisms and/or processes.

Among them, adsorption techniques employing natural adsorbents as peat represent an attractive alternative due to its low cost and high removal efficiency.

Regarding the adsorption equilibrium, the experimental data were adequately fitted by the Freundlich equation for both peat samples.

The modified ACs showed quite different contents of acidic oxygenated groups, which amounted 1.66 and 0.45 mmol g −1 for AC Ox and AC HT, respectively. Despite its lower porosity and specific surface area, AC HT presented better kinetic and capacity for CYN adsorption, which suggests that the presence of acidic oxygenated functional groups hinders CYN adsorption at the studied conditions.

    "abstract": "In this study, a new synthesized magnetic nanocomposite was used as an adsorbent for the removal of toxic cationic dye methylene blue (MB). The adsorbent incorporated three components to produce a nanocomposite named Fe 3 O 4 /GO/natural clay. The characterization techniques were used to study the physical and chemical properties of nanocomposite and approve the successful synthesis. XRD of the Fe 3 O 4 /GO/natural clay nanocomposite indicated the crystalline structure with the appearance of characteristic peaks of each component. Also, the FT-IR of Fe 3 O 4 /GO/clay nanocomposite showed a significant change in the peak intensity of natural clay after the addition of GO and magnetic NPs which attributed to the successful interaction between GO and magnetic NPs with the functional groups on the surface of clay. The TEM and SEM images of the nanocomposite showed that the magnetic NPs, clay, and GO excellently interacted in one appropriate structure with the deposition of clay and magnetic NPs on the GO surface which serves as a matrix holding them. The MB adsorption system was optimized by varying several parameters, including pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, starting concentration, ionic strength, and competing ions. Furthermore, the adsorption isotherm showed that the highest adsorption capacities of 999.34 and 1108.54 mg/g for the Fe 3 O 4 /GO/natural clay and Fe 3 O 4 /natural clay nanocomposites, respectively, followed the Langmuir isotherm. Additionally, the kinetic analysis showed that a pseudo-second-order model better explained the adsorption on both nanocomposites. The nanocomposite can be reused for multiple cycles with a little drop in its initial performance, according to reusability research conducted up to six times using ethyl alcohol as the eluent. As a result, this reasonably priced adsorbent might be employed as a beneficial and effective dye adsorbent for the removal of MB from water while maintaining the safety of the water quality.",

The data obtained revealed the presence of elevated levels of chromium metal ions in waste samples relative to the NEQS (National Environmental Quality Standards) require-ments. A new process entitled IERECHROM (Ion Exchange REmoval of CHROMium) has been developed for the removal and separation of chromium ions from sediments using zeolite-3A. The factors affecting chromium ion removal include exchanger concentration, pH, shaking time and temperature. The applicability of the Freundlich. Dubinin–Radushkevich and virial isotherm equations to the system has been examined. The thermodynamic parameters °LH0, °LG0 and °LS0 were calculated using the virial isotherm expression. The results suggest that natural aluminosilicates such as zeolite-3A can be utilised as low-cost ion-exchange and sorbent materials because of their selectivities for the removal of chromium ions and various other heavy metals.",

In contrast, such treatment brought about a progressive decrease in the catalytic activity of the treated catalyst samples. Thus, the reaction rate constant (k) of the catalyzed reaction measured at 50°C diminished from 8 × 10 −2 min −1 to 0.3 × 10 −2 min −1 on exposure of the supported mixed oxide material to a dose of 160 Mrad. What was surprising was that the activation energy (δE) of the catalytic reaction decreased as a function of the dose employed whereas it should have been expected to increase in the light of the observed decrease in the catalytic activity. This apparent discrepancy was resolved by recalculating the values of ΔE taking into account any possible changes in the pre-exponential factor of the Arrhenius equation brought about by γ-irradiation. The observed decrease in the catalytic activity due to treatment with γ-rays was attributed, mainly, to the enhanced removal of Brönsted acid centres by the action of such irradiation.",

The textural properties of the two series of samples were determined from the adsorption of carbon dioxide and methylene blue at 298 K. Activated carbons with a high adsorptive capacity for methylene blue were obtained. Activation with zinc chloride proceeded with increasing microporosity via the creation of new micropores. At high percentages of zinc chloride, slight partial pore widening may take place. Carbon dioxide was accessible to the entire pore system and was therefore suitable as a probe for the investigation of the textural properties of the activated carbons studied. A fraction of the porosity was inaccessible to methylene blue molecules and consequently lower surface areas were calculated from the adsorption of this dye molecule.",

The bed performance with RO was better than for DR, which was ascribed to a screening effect towards the larger DR molecules and to enhanced adsorption arising from the polyhalogenated nature of the RO molecule.

Thus, a known weight of basic magnesium carbonate was treated with a known amount of copper nitrate dissolved in the least amount of distilled water necessary to make a paste. The paste was dried and then precalcined for 5 h at 400°C, 500°C or 600°C, respectively. The solids obtained were exposed to different doses of γ-rays ranging between 0.2 MGy and 1.6 MGy. Catalytic conversion of ethanol was carried out at 250–400°C over various irradiated solids employing a micropulse technique. Other techniques used were nitrogen adsorption measurements at −196°C, IR spectroscopy and XRD measurements. The results obtained revealed that all the catalysts investigated were selective towards dehydration, their activities decreasing slightly on increasing the precalcination temperature over the range 400–600°C. γ-Irradiation brought about a progressive decrease in their catalytic activities with a dose of 0.8 MGy being sufficient to effect a decrease of more than 90% in the initial value. The irradiated catalysts regained virtually all their initial activity upon increasing the γ-ray dose to 1.6 MGy. These results were discussed in terms of the progressive removal of OH groups from the solid surface by exposure to γ-irradiation in the range 0.2–0.8 MGy. The attainment of the initial catalytic activity upon exposure to a dose of 1.6 MGy was attributed to the creation of surface OH groups due to the interaction between the catalyst samples and water liberated during the early stages of the dehydration reaction.",

Evaluation of the materials produced showed that the metals were well dispersed throughout the carbon pore structure and had a high degree of accessibility. The filtration performance of these materials was assessed against HCN using inverse gas chromatography. The performance was affected both by the selection of metals and the conditions used in the production of the carbon. In-depth studies varying the synthesis parameters were performed with the aim of optimising the manufacturing process. Significant HCN adsorption capacity was developed which exceeded that of the current best available ASC-type carbons.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between pH and heavy metal ion sorption by the biomass of two algal species was studied under controlled experimental conditions. It was observed that increasing heavy metal ion sorption by algal biomass with pH mainly arose from a change in algal cell properties, provided that the pH was below the level where the heavy metal ions started to precipitate. A drastic increase in metal ion sorption capacity (‘inflection point’) was observed at pH 4.5 for the algal biomass used in the study. All the experimental observations on the mutual effects between pH and metal sorption for four heavy metal ions (Cd 2+ , Cu 2+ , Pb 2+ and Zn 2+ ) and two algal species suggested that the mutual effects between pH and heavy metal ion sorption can be explained in terms of ion exchange and coulombic attraction between the heavy metal ions and the algal biomass. A ‘positive feedback’ was also suggested for the mutual effects between pH and heavy metal ion removal at higher initial pH levels, where the sorption of heavy metal ions may enhance their hydrolysis.",

First, it was calculated by assuming the uniform globular model for the structure of the silicon dioxide starting material. Second, within a group of silicas covered by the same substituent, relative surface areas were determined by direct comparison of the adsorption isotherm of a sample with that measured on one of the silicas elected as a standard. Calculated surface areas gave excellent correlation with those obtained by direct comparison.

Kinetic experiments indicated that the processes could be simulated by a pseudo-second-order model and the Elovich equation, suggesting that the process may be chemisorption in nature. The adsorption capacity increased with increasing initial concentration of metal cations. The resulting isotherms could be described by the Langmuir relationship, with the adsorbent showing a higher affinity towards Pb(II) ions than Cu(II) ions. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption process was endothermic and possibly chemical in nature with positive values of ΔH 0 . Positive ΔS 0 values suggested that a dissociative process was involved. The small positive ΔG 0 values indicated that the adsorption processes required a small amount of energy. The adsorption processes were only slightly influenced by the concentration of added electrolyte but were strongly dependent on the pH value.

The uptake of thiocyanate anions did not seem to be directly related to the porous features of the adsorbents, but rather connected to the ion–adsorbent affinity. The highest retention in synthetic solutions was obtained with hydrotalcite, followed by activated carbon, zeolite and the steel-making slags. In real wastewater, the removal efficiency of hydrotalcite relative to industrial wastewater was largely suppressed due to the organic matter present. In contrast, the retention ability of the activated carbon and the slags was less modified in real wastewater due to their open porous networks. These results indicate that steel-making slag could be used as a potential adsorbent for the removal of thiocyanate anions from real wastewater produced in coke-making processes without any additional processing.",

    "abstract": "The results of treating commercial granulated activated carbons with ozone, both gaseous and dissolved in water, were analyzed. The original carbons (Filtrasorb-300 and Carbsorb-38) were carefully flushed with distilled water to remove any water-soluble impurities. For comparison, each of the washed activated carbons was treated separately with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. The following procedures were applied to assess the effects of contact between each carbon and the oxidizing agents: thermogravimetry, alkalimetry, voltammetry, EDX and FT-IR methods to illustrate changes in the surface chemistry, and nitrogen low-temperature adsorption to show up any possible changes in the porous structure. Ozone dissolved in water exhibited the lowest oxidative strength — EDX and FT-IR spectroscopy revealed only a slight oxidation of the Filtrasorb-300 surface layer. Despite its smaller specific area, this carbon surface exhibited greater roughness and was more susceptible to oxidation. The liquid-phase adsorption isotherms of p-chlorophenol from aqueous solution onto this carbon showed that surface oxygen reduced the extent of adsorption. The experimental data were best fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model.",

Appropriate adsorbents were selected for effecting this separation by exploiting adsorption equilibrium isotherm and breakthrough measurements in order to choose the optimum operating conditions for the PSA process. The adsorption and breakthrough characteristics for the pure gas as well as for the mixed gases were also examined. The pure gas adsorption isotherms were obtained employing a static method, while mixed gas adsorption studies were undertaken using a volumetric chromatography technique. Computer simulations, along with breakthrough experiments, were performed to study the adsorption dynamics and thereby identify suitable operating parameters as well as vessel dimensions. Based on these data, a single-column PSA system has been developed for the separation of helium gas. The selection of adsorbent, effect of feed pressure, flow rate and cycle time related to the process performance has been established. It was noted that employing an adsorbent such as LiLSX at a flow rate of 2 ℓ/min, a working pressure of 500 kPa and a feed time of 180 s appears to be appropriate for obtaining 98.3% pure He with 65% recovery for the column dimensions chosen.",

The utility of the proposed method to correlate accurately the experimental data for supercritical gas adsorption system is demonstrated by high-pressure methane adsorption measurements on two groups of shale samples. Taking advantage of the proposed method, we can obtain the adsorbed density and the adsorbed volume corresponding to different pressures.

Mention is then made of non-ideal surfaces (stepped or containing vacancies) and their resulting enhanced potential. The effects of incorporating chemical heterogeneity into the surfaces of these structures are also considered: carbon oxidation mechanisms are discussed in terms of bond energy and disruption of the (conjugated) graphene structure and the resulting polar functional groups are shown to increase interactivity with molecules that possess permanent dipoles or multipoles.

The adsorption process for the pure gases and their mixtures was simulated using the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method and the calculations were then used to analyze experimental isotherms for the pure gases and for mixtures with different molar fractions in the gaseous phase. It was shown that the pore-size distributions (PSDs) “sensed” by each of the pure probe gases was different one from the other and also from the PSDs “seen” by the mixture. A mixing rule for combining the PSDs corresponding to the pure gases is proposed for obtaining predictions regarding the adsorption of the corresponding mixtures, which are then compared with those arising from the classical IAST approximation. For this purpose, selectivity curves for CO 2 relative to CH 4 have been calculated and compared with experimental values. It was concluded that, for the adsorbate/adsorbent system under study, the proposed GCMC mixed model was capable of predicting the binary adsorption equilibrium, and especially the selectivity, more accurately than the IAST.",

The present study is designed for removal of azo dyes (Methyl orange, Congo red and Basic fuchsine) from synthetic aqueous solutions and real textile effluents. For this purpose, cobalt-doped alumina hybrids are synthesized and applied as adsorbents in batch experiment. Two different aluminium precursor (aluminium nitrate and spent aluminium foil) and glucose are mixed following sol–gel method to get hybrids. The synthesized hybrids are characterized for surface and bulk properties using Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray techniques. The characterization of materials under Fourier transform infrared revealed that –OH (3487–3504 cm −1 ), C–H (2935–2985 cm −1 ), Al–O–C (∼1380 cm −1 ), Al–O (∼ 800 cm −1 ), Al–O–Al (659–669 cm −1 ) and Co–O (583–589 cm −1 ) groups participate in the binding of dyes onto the surface of hybrids. Amorphous shaped particles and elemental composition (carbon, aluminium and oxygen) are demonstrated in scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray micrograph. Time-dependent batch experiments under identical experimental parameters showed 74% of basic fuchsine, 68% of methyl orange and 85% maximum removal of Congo red onto the surface of cobalt-doped alumina hybrids probably through ion exchange mechanism. The experimental data when treated with adsorption models and isotherms, pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm are found to be best fitted. The present study accomplishes the successful synthesis of novel and efficient cobalt-doped alumina hybrids provides environmental friendly and economical alternative option to the commercial adsorbents for the treatment of textile effluents.",

Structural changes: phosphoric acid promotes transformation of polyimide copolymer to carbon structure at lower temperatures as compared to thermally treated carbons. Phosphoric acid is responsible for formation of highly developed micro/mesoporous structure that is different from that of thermally treated carbons. Chemical changes: phosphoric acid causes elimination of hydrogen and nitrogen, introduction of phosphorus and oxygen as phosphate-like structure. Significant amount of phosphorus imparts acid properties to carbon.",

Gas chromatography was used to quantify residual cyclopentene and produced cyclopentene oxide using the internal standard method. Type and amount of solvent, addition method, and temperature were important factors to increase the selectivity to cyclopentene oxide. Unlike previous reports on epoxidation of different substrates, additives like sodium acetate and salicylic acid did not improve the selectivity to cyclopentene oxide. One time, single-step addition of hydrogen peroxide/sodium bicarbonate to the solution of cyclopentene/solvent/manganese sulfate produced more cyclopentene oxide than stepwise addition. The maximum selectivity obtained was 56%, possibly due to the high reactivity of cyclopentene that causes the formation of oxidation products different to cyclopentene oxide, which were not detected in the analyzed phase.",

    "abstract": "The gas desorption index of drill cuttings is a basic index that measures the initial desorption capacities of coal seams and predicts coal seam gas outbursts. Following a long period of gas drainage in the No.7 coal seam of the No.86 mining area in the Haizi coal mine, the gas desorption index of drill cuttings was still found to be much higher than the threshold value for outburst risks. This abnormal phenomenon led to the present study of the rational selection of test methods and objects in this context. In this study, particle size distribution, pore structure and gas desorption characteristics of coal samples in anomalous areas were analyzed. We found that desorption characteristics are related to particle size and particle size varies in relation to tectonic stress and magmatic intrusions. It appears that the anomalous readings are related to particle size of the coal, resulting from tectonic/magmatic pulverization. Furthermore, measured particle size of drill cuttings is not actually reflective of coal particle size – larger particles may be comprised of multiple smaller particles. The results show that coal samples with particle size &lt;1 mm accounts for 76.3% of total samples and coal samples with particle size &gt;1 mm only accounts for 23.7% of total samples. The porosity and total pore volume increase as the particle size decreases. The specific surface area increases with decreasing pore diameter. Transitional pores and micropores increase the specific surface area of the coal sample considerably. The desorption capacity increases with decreasing particle size. The additional tectonic stress caused by magmatic intrusion has a crushing effect, and 1–3 mm particles used in test were composed of a large amount of smaller particles, eventually resulting in abnormal gas desorption index phenomena. Therefore, we proposed an improved method for measuring the gas desorption index of pulverized coal.",

The investigation is of great importance in the context of validating the potential CO 2 sequestration in unmined coal seams. Changes in temperature in underground coal beds can influence the sorption balance, resulting in strains in coal strata, which could lead to the desorption of gas and leaks to the ground surface. The research shows that the strains induced by CO 2 sorption are about twice the size of those resulting from the sorption of CH 4 . The linear strains are anisotropic and greater in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane. The results of the non-isothermal experiments show that a temperature increase gives rise to the sample swelling in the presence of methane, but a different pattern is observed for coal–CO 2 systems, where sample contraction occurs. This behaviour is explained by the different mechanism of CH 4 and CO 2 deposition and by the diversity in the maceral composition of the samples.",

Nanogoethite was synthesized by a chemical precipitation method and used to batch adsorb U(VI) in solution. Adsorption experiments were used to understand the role of nanogoethite in controlling the U(VI) adsorption behavior in soil. The morphology and the crystallinity of nanogoethite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and wide-angle X-ray powder diffractometry, respectively. The results showed that the crystallinity of nanogoethite after the adsorption of uranium did not change, but small particles appeared on the surface of the scales. The surface area was determined from N 2 adsorption–desorption experiments using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller to be 81.86 m 2 /g. The effects of factors such as the contact time, pH, adsorbent dosage, and the initial concentration of uranium on the adsorption of U(VI) were investigated. The experimental results showed that nanogoethite removed over 85% of the U(VI) in an aqueous 5.0 mg/L U(VI) solution at pH 4.0 and at 298 K. The pseudo-second-order model was used to simulate the adsorption process. The results show that chemisorption plays a major role in the adsorption process. The results of this study suggest that nanogoethite may play a significant role in controlling the migration and transfer of U(VI) in the soil, thus controlling the presence of U(VI) in soil.",

Zeolite-type silicalite was synthesized and its basic physico-chemical properties were determined. Isothermal adsorption kinetics curves of phenol on zeolite-type silicalite were measured at temperature range from 283 to 313 K. By applying Friedman’s differential isoconversional method it was found that the adsorption of phenol on silicalite has one rate determining step. By using the ‘model-fitting’ method it was established that the kinetic of adsorption can be described with theoretical kinetic model of the two-dimensional phase-boundary controlled reaction (model R2). The kinetic parameters, activation energy ([Formula: see text]) and preexponetial factor ( lnA = 14.1 min −1 ) of phenol adsorption were calculated. The thermodynamic parameters, standard enthalpy (Δ H*), standard entropy (Δ S*) and standard free Gibbs energy of adsorption (Δ G*) were calculated and discussed. A novel model for the kinetics of pollutant adsorption from wastewaters onto zeolites based on the following: zeolite pores have cylindrical shape with average radius r 0 , pores in zeolite are filled simultaneously by the model ‘layer by layer’, the rate of phenol adsorption is higher than the rate of the growth of the thickness of the adsorption layer was suggested. It has been found that the adsorption kinetics can be completely described by this kinetic model.",

In addition, the diffusion rate becomes apparently slower with the increasing carbon numbers of the examined paraffins. In order to improve the adsorption separation efficiency of for n-paraffins, 5A zeolites with mesoporous structures were synthesized by hydrothermal method with the dimethyl octadecyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride as the template agent. Porosity and pore size distribution analysis demonstrated that micropores with the diameter of 0.5 nm were connected with 7–13 nm mesopores in the synthesized samples. The formation of hierarchical pore structure and change of surface morphology of zeolite particles could be controlled by the concentration of [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride used in the synthesis. The normal paraffin/cyclohexane solutions were used to investigate the adsorption kinetics of pentane, hexane, and heptane on the synthesized 5A zeolites. When the [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride concentration is 0.01%, the liquid phase diffusion coefficients of n-paraffins in the hierarchical 5A zeolite are 4–48 times larger than those in the microporous 5A zeolite. Our work demonstrates that the diffusion behavior and adsorption kinetics could be greatly improved by introducing mesoporosity into the pore structure of 5A zeolites.",

The MHDHA was characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The FT-IR study showed that the MHDHA had the characteristics peaks of HA and Fe-O stretching. The XRD analysis revealed that the MHDHA had the [Formula: see text] characteristic for magnetite. The TEM image and EDX analysis exhibited that the MHDHA with an average size of ∼14 nm was partially aggregated and contained ([Formula: see text]) 9.89% carbon, 2.89% nitrogen, and 32.74% oxygen based on functional groups of HDHA. The stability improvement of MHDHA was showed by decreasing HDHA dissolved from 95% to less than 30% at pH 12 after magnetite functionalization. The post-adsorption handling improvement was evidenced by easy and quick retraction by an external magnet with a 62.95 emu/g magnetic strength value. The adsorption capacities were influenced by the pH and ionic strength, whilst the adsorption rates were well simulated by the Ho pseudo-second-order model. The removal uptake of Pb(II) ions increased when the initial concentration was increased and fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model when the monolayer adsorption capacity was [Formula: see text] (equal to 57.64 mg/g). The value of Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption energy ([Formula: see text]) found in this study was 14.78 kJ/mol, which implied that ion exchange is the main mechanism involved in the adsorption process.

Herein, the study investigated the use of CDI for the removal of paraquat (PQ) herbicide from water by using commercial activated carbon (AC) electrodes. The CDI performance was examined as a function of the initial PQ concentration, applied voltage, flowrate, treatment time, and cycle stability testing in the batch mode approach. The applied voltage had a beneficial effect on the removal efficiency, whereas the removal efficiency of PQ declined as the initial PQ concentration increased. However, the electrosorption capacity gradually increased with the increase of initial feed solutions’ concentration. The maximum removal efficiency and electrosorption capacity achieved at 5 mg/L and 20 mg/L PQ initial concentrations, an applied voltage of 1.2 V, and 5 mL/min flowrate were 100% and 0.33 mg/g and 52.5% and 0.7 mg/g, respectively. Washing the electrodes with distilled water achieved sequential desorption of PQ, and the process produces a waste stream that can be disposed of or treated further. Therefore, the CDI method is considered a promising and efficient method for removing organic pollutants from water including pesticides.",

    "abstract": "The performance of a clay mineral geomembrane used in the context of a geological barrier for industrial and radioactive waste confinement must pass through the understanding of its hydrous response as well as the limits of the cation exchange process which are closely related to the solid/liquid ratio constraint. The Na-rich montmorillonite is used, as starting material, to evaluate the link between the applied external constraint (variable solid/liquid ratio) and the structural response of the material. The geochemical constraint is realized at the laboratory scale, and the possible effects are investigated in the cases of Ba 2+ and Ni 2+ heavy metal cations. The structural analysis is achieved using the XRD profile modeling approach to quantify the interlayer space (IS) deformation. The quantitative XRD analysis, which consists of the comparison of experimental 001 reflections with the calculated ones deduced from structural models, allowed us to determine the optimal structural parameters describing IS configuration along the [Formula: see text] axis. The obtained result showed an interstratified hydration character, for both studied exchangeable cations, regardless of the solid/liquid ratio being described probably by a partial cation exchange process. The theoretical mixed layer structure (MLS) suggests the coexistence of more one cristallite species saturated by more than one exchangeable cations, indicating a partial saturation of all exchangeable sites. The optimum structural parameter values, from the theoretical model, allowed us to follow the evolution of several intrinsic properties versus the applied constraint strength. The variable solid/liquid ratio effect on the material porosity is examined by the BET-specific surface area and BJH pore size distribution (PSD) analyses. The adsorption measurement outcomes confirm XRD results concerning mainly the link between several intrinsic clay properties and the constraint strength.",

In the reversed phase-mode HPLC, isocratic separation of alkylbenzenes was achieved with satisfactory resolution on 100 times 4.6 mm i.d. column. Theoretical plate number exceeding 16,000 m −1 could be obtained with benzene as the analyte. The resolving power of the prepared column was maintained when the mobile phase flow rate was increased from 1 to 2 ml/minute.",

    "abstract": "Boron is a problematic pollutant because of the difficulty involved in removing it from water with an acceptable cost-to-benefit ratio, especially at extremely high concentrations (600 mg B/l). It is also necessary to remove the pollutant to comply with the quality criteria for drinking water (1 mg B/l) and even for agricultural irrigation purposes (0.5–15 mg B/l depending on crop tolerance). Although some newly proposed water-treatment technologies use economical adsorbents, they are unable to achieve the residual concentrations. The aim of this work is to show that adsorption using metallurgical slags (SL) can be used either as a pre-treatment of the zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nano-Fe0) or as a final treatment itself for removing boron at high concentrations to obtain effluents complying with the standards established for drinking water and wastewater reuse. Adsorption tests (kinetics and isotherms) were carried out for both adsorbents. The slags showed good results as an adsorbent for boron removal in the pre-treatment and final treatment stages, with a very low cost compared with nano-Fe0. The use of slags instead of expensive commercial adsorbents makes adsorption of water with high boron concentrations feasible, and allows obtaining treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation of very tolerant crops.",

    "abstract": "Accurate determination of the gas content in coalbeds is important for safe mining. Currently, gas desorption by drilling underground boreholes is the most commonly used gas determination method. However, this method is not very accurate and needs to be improved. In this study, we established a laboratory protocol based on coal adsorption studies to analyse factors affecting the measurement accuracy. The results showed that exposure time, sampling method, sample weight, particle size and gas loss estimate significantly affected the gas content measurement using gas desorption by drilling underground boreholes. Longer exposure time and increased particle size resulted in higher relative errors. Sampling by coring is more accurate than sampling by drilling. The higher the sample weight is for samples weighing less than 240 g, the larger the error of the in situ measurements of desorbed gas, residual gas and lost gas is. The error tends to stabilize for heavier samples. The gas losses at different exposure times calculated using the commonly used Barrer model, power function method and negative exponent method were compared. The gas loss error within 0–12 min, computed with the Barrer model, and after 12 min, computed with the power function method, is minimal. The modified formula of gas loss was obtained using the combination of a fitting analysis and the relationship between gas loss and exposure time. Subsequently, the optimal procedure for in situ gas content measurements using gas desorption by drilling underground boreholes was determined. The gas content errors for anthracite, gas coal, lean coal and long flame coal, which were measured using gas desorption by drilling underground boreholes and corrected using the gas loss formula, decreased significantly to less than 10%, thus, meeting the engineering accuracy norm.",

    "abstract": "This present study introduces a contemporary innovation of synthesized polymer–silver nanoparticle nanocomposite adsorbent based on sugarcane bagasse (AgNP-SB- βCD) for the sequestration of emerging micropollutant–bisphenol A from water matrix. Batch adsorption mode was carried out to assess the effectiveness of AgNP-SB- βCD nanocomposites towards eliminating bisphenol A (BPA). Characterization techniques including SEM, FTIR, and XRD have confirmed the successful incorporation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) onto bagasse–polymer. At 25°C, pH 7, and contact time of 120 min, the nanocomposites had a maximum uptake capacity of 158.4 mg g -1 on BPA. The equilibrium isotherm of BPA on AgNPs-SB- βCD has fitted effectively with Langmuir model while the adsorption kinetics conformed to pseudo-second order. The adsorption phenomenon was controlled mainly by physisorption (via host–guest inclusion van der Waals bonding and pore filling effect). In addition, oxidative degradation of BPA by AgNPs-SB- βCD could marginally contribute the removal of BPA due to oxidative dissolution of AgNPs at pH 7. The thermodynamic results substantiate the spontaneity and exothermic behaviors of the adsorption phenomenon. The polymeric nanocomposite adsorbent was regenerated five times (using 75% ethanol) without considerable loss of its adsorption capacity. This authenticates its reusability and consistency performances; accordingly, it can be a market competitor adsorbent for the treatment of water contaminated with BPA.",

    "abstract": "The presence of pirimicarb compounds as pollutants in orchard wastewater has sparked rising worries about their detrimental impacts on the ecosystem and human health, and their removal is critical for Pakistan’s aquatic environment. It not only contaminates fruit, but it also leaches into the soil and contaminates groundwater. However, there is little data on the effective removal of pirimicarb from orchard wastewater. The main purpose of this study is to create a novel family of functionalized imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) using a simple chemical process, which will be utilized for the first time to extract pirimicarb from orchard wastewater in an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally acceptable manner. FTIR, SEM, XRD, TGA, BET, and 1 H NMR spectroscopy were used to characterize the functionalized samples. The impact of the IL substituent on the separation capacity was studied. In addition, the extraction and separation of pirimicarb from orchard wastewater were investigated under a variety of conditions (time, concentration, and temperature) in order to better understand the adsorption behaviors of distinct ILs in an aqueous solution. The adsorption equilibrium was reached in 30 minutes, and the maximum removal of pirimicarb was achieved utilizing the synthesized [C 2 im][C 3 H 6 NH 2 ]Br - , according to the data. The pseudo-first-order model and the Langmuir model both suit well with the adsorption mechanism of pirimicarb with very good adsorptive capacities. Thermodynamic analyses indicated spontaneous, endothermic, and entropy-driven adsorption processes. The synthesized imidazolium-based ILs have good regeneration capability and recycling at least for six adsorption-desorption runs and have also been used to successfully detect pirimicarb orchard wastewater samples. The superior safety of the proposed method nominates it as a promising future strategy for pollution prevention. Consequently, this work has proven that the pirimicarb adsorption to various imidazolium-based ILs was dependent on the structures of the produced imidazolium-based ILs, which specifies its potential for practical applications in water pollutant removal and environmental remediation.",

The best preparation conditions to obtain a tailored adsorbent for itaconic acid purification were identified via a Taguchi experimental design, where its adsorption properties were maximized. The best activated carbon was obtained via coconut shell pyrolysis at 750 °C for 4 h plus an activation with 0.1 KOH and a final treatment at 800 °C for 2 h. This adsorbent showed an adsorption capacity of 4.31 mmol/g at 20 °C and pH 3 with a surface area of 466 m 2 /g. Itaconic acid separation was exothermic and pH-dependent where electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonding were the main adsorption interactions. Calculated adsorption rate constants for itaconic acid adsorption were 0.44–1.20 h -1 . Results of adsorbent characterization analysis indicated the presence of a crystallization of itaconic acid molecules onto the activated carbon surface where 3–4 molecules could interact to form the clusters. This organic acid was recovered from the adsorbent surface via desorption with water or ethanol, thus facilitating its final purification. The best activated carbon obtained in this study is a promising alternative to perform sustainable and energy-efficient downstream separation and purification of itaconic acid produced via fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Nickel has several industrial uses and is a valuable metal, making its selective separation and recycling a priority goal. A novel adsorbent, a Schiff base organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) aerogel, was prepared, for selective nickel removal from wastewater with other metal ions, by including a salen ionophore in the silica-based network. The newly developed adsorbent takes advantage of the salen’s selectivity and of the high porosity of silica aerogels. The aerogel-like adsorbent was prepared via sol-gel chemistry, using a coprecursor approach and ambient pressure drying. The inclusion of the Schiff base in the silica network was accomplished by reacting an amine-containing silica precursor with an aldehyde and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The adsorbent shrunk only 10% after evaporative drying, which resulted in a highly porous material (85% porosity, 4 cm 3 g −1 specific pore volume). The low surface area of 28 m 2 g -1 was due to the predominantly macroporous structure of the material (mean pore diameter of 563 nm). Adsorption isotherms and kinetic curves with single and binary mixtures of cations at room temperature were used to assess the selectivity of the adsorbent. The adsorption follows a BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) trend. Due to the proximity of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the salen and steric hindrance from their neighboring atoms, it is likely that only the smallest hydrated cations can act as a coordination center and interact with both donor atoms. Thus, nickel was fairly removed (50 mg g -1 ), while other cations barely interacted with the adsorbent (cadmium adsorption maximum of 5 mg g -1 ). The estimated selectivity coefficient for nickel ranges from 1.8, in relation to copper, to 9.4 relatively to cadmium, which can be relevant for the separation of nickel in several industrial contexts, for instance, from electroplating sludge.",

It is difficult in understanding the adsorption mechanism of CO 2 in the air as it has a wide range of properties associated with its diverse textures, functional group existence, pressure, and temperature of varying range. These properties influence diversely the adsorption mechanism of CO 2 and pose serious challenges in the process. To resolve this multiobjective formulation, we use a machine learning classifier that maps systematically the CO 2 adsorption as a function of compositional and textural properties and adsorption parameters. The machine learning classifier helps in the classification of various porous carbon materials during the time of training and testing. The results of the simulation show that the proposed method is more efficient in classifying the porous nature of the CO 2 adsorption materials than other methods.",

However, it has low reduction efficiency owing to its oxidation and aggregation characteristics. Thus, nZVI-loaded material is used to alleviate these drawbacks. In this study, nZVI-coated attapulgite (ATP) was prepared for the removal of NO 3 -N from groundwater. ATP-nZVI was prepared using the chemical liquid deposition-coreduction method. The prepared materials were characterized by SEM, XRD, and XPS analyses, which confirmed that the aluminum silicate particles in the ATP structure are effective carriers of nZVI and effectively inhibit self-consumption caused by the oxidation and aggregation of nZVI. The batch experiments examined experimental samples containing 30 mg/L nitrate and analyzed the effects of various parameters, including the material, mass ratio, initial pH, initial temperature, and coexisting anions on the NO 3 -N removal efficiency. The results showed that the optimal removal rate of the composite was 78.61%, which is higher than that using the same amount of ATP, iron powder, and nZVI. When the mass ratio of ATP to nZVI was 1 : 1, the NO 3 -N removal efficiency was the highest. When the pH value increased from 3 to 9, the NO 3 -N removal rate decreased, while an increase in the reaction temperature promoted NO 3 -N removal. The order of the inhibitory effect of coexisting anions on NO 3 -N removal by various nanoions was PO 4 3– &gt;CO 3 2– &gt;SO 4 2– &gt;Cl – . The adsorption kinetic model fitting results indicated that the chemisorption of electron exchange between ATP and nZVI in NO 3 -N removal was the main rate-limiting step in the reaction.

When the two-component isothermal adsorption pressure is less than 0.7595 MPa, the long-flame coal molecule can adsorb both CH 4 and H 2 O; after more than 0.7595 MPa, the average adsorption amount of H 2 O is much larger than that of CH 4 indicating that H 2 O is in a dominant position in the competitive adsorption with CH 4 .",

    "abstract": "The coal matrix can expand after gas adsorption, thus reducing the permeability of coal reservoirs and further affecting the coalbed methane production. Whether the heat released by coal adsorbing gas is a cause of the coal expansion has not yet been determined. Therefore, the anthracite coal with high gas adsorption capacity was used; under the conditions of 35°C and 1-6 MPa, the adsorption capacity and the adsorption heat of coal adsorbing CO 2 and CH 4 were tested. The specific heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient of coal at 35°C were tested. The temperature change of the coal after being heated was calculated by combining the absorption heat and specific heat capacity; also, the thermal expansion rate was calculated by combining the temperature change and expansion coefficient. In addition, the cube law was used to calculate the permeability change of coal before and after the adsorption expansion. The results show that the changes in the gas adsorption capacity and adsorption heat of the coal obey the Langmuir equation, and those to CO 2 are both higher than to CH 4 . The temperature of coal increases after the heat is released in the process of CO 2 and CH 4 adsorption, and the temperature change of coal adsorbing CO 2 and CH 4 reaches 102°C and 72°C, respectively, at 6 MPa. The thermal expansion rate of coal adsorbing CO 2 and CH 4 reaches 5.40% and 3.81%, at 6 MPa, respectively. It is found that a higher gas pressure could lead to a higher temperature change, a higher thermal expansion rate, as well as a higher thermal expansion and coal deformation. After the adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 , the coal permeability is reduced by 20.43% and 14.66%, respectively, at 6 MPa. Both the thermal expansion rate and the permeability change with the gas adsorption pressure obey the Langmuir equation. Therefore, the adsorption expansion of coal may be thermal expansion caused by the heat released by coal adsorbing gas.",

And the in situ leaching mining process was simulated and calculated by using three control equations of solution seepage, ion exchange, and solute migration. The reliability of the NMRI model was verified by the results of the indoor column leaching experiment, and the influence of the injection intensity and leaching agent concentration on the leaching of rare earth ions was analyzed. The results show that there are dominant seepage channels in the ore body, and the rare earth ion exchange reaction and migration in the dominant channel area are completed first. By analyzing the leaching results of rare earth ions under the working conditions of different injection strengths and different concentrations of leaching agent, the results show that the injection strength and the concentration of leaching agent have an obvious promoting effect on the leaching of rare earth ions in a certain range. The injection strength of 0.5~1.0 mL/min and the concentration of 0.20~0.25 mol/L leaching agent are considered to be more economical in practical engineering.",

The adsorption isotherms for all the effects/treatments were in close agreement with the Freundlich equation and yielded S-shaped isotherms. The amount of phosphamidon adsorbed in all cases was higher in medium black (silt loam) soil than alluvial soil (sandy loam) and was related to the organic matter content, clay content, CaCO 3 content, surface area and cation-exchange capacity of the soils. The adsorption on both types of soil follows the order H + -soil &gt; Na + -soil &gt; natural soil at 10°C &gt; natural soil at 20°C &gt; autoclaved soil &gt; organic matter-removed soil &gt; anionic surfactant &gt; natural soil at 40°C, which was in accordance with the Freundlich constant, K F , and distribution coefficient, K d , values. The adsorption capacity of phosphamidon for organic matter and clay content for both the soils was evaluated by calculating the K om and K c values when it was found that phosphamidon adsorption was better correlated with the clay content than with the orgnic matter content on the basis of adsorption isotherms. Various thermodynamic parameters such as the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (K 0 ), the standard free energy (ΔG 0 ), the standard enthalpy (ΔH 0 ) and the standard entropy (ΔS 0 ) changes have been calculated as a means of predicting the nature of the isotherms.",

The amounts of Co 3 O 4 were varied between 5.57 wt% and 32.0 wt% and the resulting solids subjected to heat treatment at temperatures in the range 400–600°C. The amounts of ZnO were varied between 0.36 wt% and 2.12 wt%. The results obtained indicated that ZnO treatment of Co 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 solids followed by precalcination at 400°C resulted in a progressive decrease in the particle size of the Co 3 O 4 crystallites in the resulting samples. The catalytic activity of such solids towards H 2 O 2 decomposition decreased progressively as the precalcination temperature employed was increased in the range 400–600°C. The relationship between the catalytic activity expressed as a plot of the reaction rate constant, k, versus the amount of Co 3 O 4 in the samples showed a progressive increase in the range 5.6–17.7 wt% followed by an abrupt increase when the extent of loading exceeded this limit. Treatment with ZnO effected a measurable increase (42%) in the specific surface area (S BET ) of the treated solids. However, such treatment also resulted in a considerable increase in the value of the reaction rate constant for the catalyzed reaction. Thus, the maximum increase in the value of k 20°C due to doping with 2.12 wt% ZnO attained a value of 543% while the corresponding increase in the value of the reaction rate constant per unit surface area, k̄ 20°C , was 331%. Precalcination at 400–600°C of Co 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 solids subjected to ZnO treatment did not modify the mechanism whereby the catalytically active constituents (surface cobalt species) were involved in the reaction although their concentration was altered without affecting their energetic nature.",

    "abstract": "Powdered wood of Eucalyptus rostrata (Myrtaceae family) obtained as a solid waste was carbonized at 873 K in a nitrogen flow. The resulting products were activated with steam (CS), zinc chloride (CZ) and phosphoric acid (CA) to obtain three series of activated carbon. The textural properties, including surface area, mean pore radius and total pore volume, were examined from the low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K. FT-IR spectroscopy and the base neutralization capacity were used for the detection of surface groups. The adsorption power of the prepared samples for the decolourization of Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBB) and New Coccine (NC) dyes, present as carcinogenic materials in wastewater, was studied at 296 K and 318 K, respectively. FT-IR spectroscopy and the base neutralization capacities indicated the presence of carboxylic and phenolic groups on the carbon surfaces. The type and amount of activator employed had a considerable influence on the textural characteristics of the samples investigated. An increase in the activator/carbon ratio was also associated with the development of porosity and hence with an increase in the specific surface area. The Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR), Langmuir, Freundlich and Weber–Morris equations were all applied satisfactorily for the calculation of various adsorption parameters, e.g. Y m , a, K F and E ads . In addition, the enthalpy of adsorption was also calculated over the temperature interval 296–318 K. It was found that the structures of the two dyes studied and the types and amounts of activators employed had a considerable influence on the adsorption parameters estimated.",

    "abstract": "The storage and delivery of natural gas using adsorbent carbon monoliths at 3.4 MPa is only about 75% that of natural gas compressed to 21 MPa on an equal volume basis. One possible way to increase ambient temperature adsorbed natural gas (ANG) storage is to simply increase the storage pressure. However, this will only be beneficial if there is unfilled micropore capacity within the carbon adsorbent. Carbons that have been optimized for storage at 3.4 MPa may not have sufficient micropore capacity to give increased storage at 6.9 MPa. In the present work, carbons have been prepared which are considered to be more useful for storage at 6.9 MPa than at 3.4 MPa due to their having an increased micropore volume fraction per monolith or storage volume. Although the pore wall separation of these carbons may not be ideal for maximum adsorbate density, these carbons showed that more than 180 v/v can be delivered from 6.9 MPa. This value approaches that of delivery from compressed natural gas (CNG) and exceeds it if the rectangular external envelope is considered as the realistic volume of the storage vessel. The results obtained clearly show the diminishing returns for methane adsorption storage with pressure increase. An increase of only about 30% in storage capacity was achieved from a doubling of the storage pressure from 3.4 MPa to 6.9 MPa.",

Zinc chloride-activated carbons were also prepared by the carbonization of lignite with 20 wt%, 40 wt% and 60 wt% zinc chloride in a limited quantity of air at 600°C. The surface areas of the resulting samples were determined from nitrogen adsorption studies at 77 K and from carbon dioxide adsorption studies at 298 K. The functional acidic groups on the surface were determined by neutralization with aqueous solutions of NaHCO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 and NaOH, respectively. The sorption of Ni 2+ and Cu 2+ ions on the prepared carbons as well as on the as-received lignite (L) were investigated. The influence of the time of contact, the initial ion concentration and the temperature was studied and the kinetics of the process were investigated. Equilibrium sorption isotherms were determined and the results interpreted by applying the Freundlich and Langmuir equations. The surface area was found to generally increase with increasing carbonization temperature. For activated carbons, the surface area increased with an increase in the amount of zinc chloride used in the activation process. The chemisorption of Ni 2+ and Cu 2+ ions on lignite-based carbon was found to be a pseudo-second order process. The acid sites on the surface provide active sites for the chemisorption of Ni 2+ and Cu 2+ ions and a qualitative relationship was found to exist between the maximum sorption capacity of these metal ions and the total surface acidity.",

Results showed that the ash could remove the dye effectively from aqueous solution. The adsorption rate was fast and could be expressed by the modified Freundlich equation. It was found that pH is the most important parameter affecting the adsorption characteristics. The experimental data were correlated well to the non-linear multilayer adsorption isotherm. The ash adsorption capacities for the dye were in the range 3.25–5.70 mol/g and were affected by the pH, ionic strength and temperature. Decreasing pH, ionic strength and temperature increased the adsorption density. The effect of electrical double-layer thickness on the adsorption was discussed. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption was an exothermic process. Values of the first-layer adsorption energy, ΔG 1 0 , ranged from −6.86 to −7.45 kcal/mol, suggesting that the adsorption could be considered as a physical process simultaneously enhanced by the electrostatic effect. The multilayer adsorption energy, ΔG 2 0 , ranged from −4.33 to −4.51 kcal/mol, suggesting that the adsorption was of the typical physical type. On the basis of the monolayer dye adsorption capacity, the specific surface area of the ash was calculated as 3.84–6.73 m 2 /g.",

    "abstract": "Details of the adsorption performance of poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate–methacrylamidocysteine) [p(HEMA–MAC)] beads towards the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution were studied. The metal-complexing ligand and/or co-monomer MAC was newly synthesized from methylacrylochloride and cysteine. Spherical beads of average size 150–200 mm were obtained by the radical suspension polymerization of MAC and HEMA conducted in an aqueous dispersion. The p(HEMA–MAC) beads obtained had a specific surface area of 18.9 m 2 /g. p(HEMA–MAC) beads were characterized by swelling studies, FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Such beads with a swelling ratio of 72%, and containing 3.9 mmol MAC/g, were used for heavy metal removal studies. The adsorption capacities of the beads for selected metal ions, i.e. Cd II , As III , Cr III , Hg II and Pb II , were investigated in aqueous media containing different amounts of these ions (10–750 mg/l) and at different pH values (3.0–7.0). The adsorption rate was fast in all cases. The maximum adsorption capacities of the p(HEMA–MAC) beads were 1058.2 mg/g for Cd II , 123.4 mg/g for As III , 199.6 mg/g for Cr III , 639.1 mg/g for Pb II and 1018.6 mg/g for Hg II . On a molar basis, the following affinity order was observed: Cd II &gt; Hg II &gt; Cr III &gt; Pb II &gt;As III . The adsorption capacity of the MAC-incorporated beads was affected significantly by the pH value of the aqueous medium. The adsorption of heavy metal ions from artificial wastewater was also studied. In this case, the adsorption capacities were 52.2 mg/g for Cd II , 23.1 mg/g for Cr III , 83.4 mg/g for Hg II , 62.6 mg/g for Pb II and 11.1 mg/g for As III at an initial metal ion concentration of 0.5 mmol/l. The chelating beads could be regenerated easily with a higher effectiveness by 0.1 M HNO 3 . These features make p(HEMA–MAC) beads potential candidates for heavy metal ion removal at high capacity.",

The measured equilibrium adsorption isotherms for both surfactant-free and surfactant-amended soils were of type C and in close agreement with the Freundlich isotherm. Higher adsorption of cypermethrin in both types of system was observed on silt loam soil than on sandy loam soil as anticipated by the values obtained for the Freundlich constant, K F , and the partition coefficient, K D . The values of K F and K D confirmed that cypermethrin adsorption on surfactant-amended soils followed the order cationic &gt; non-ionic &gt; anionic under all CMC conditions studied. The K F and K D values also confirmed that cypermethrin adsorption was higher on soils amended with surfactants maintained below the CMC, while lower values of K F and K D confirmed the lower adsorption of cypermethrin on soils amended with both non-ionic and anionic surfactants maintained at or above the CMC value relative to the situation with surfactant-free soils. The higher values of K F and K D showed that the adsorption of cypermethrin increased on soils amended with CTAB when the latter was at or above the CMC value relative to surfactant-free soils. The R f values obtained from soil TLC studies were inversely proportional to the K F and K D values for both surfactant-free and surfactant-amended soils. The affinity of cypermethrin towards the organic carbon and clay content of the soils was evaluated by calculating the K oc and K D values, when it was found that the affinity of cypermethrin was better correlated with the clay content of the soils than with their organic carbon content. The results obtained are interesting in that they afford basic data resulting to the possible use of surfactants for solving problems of soil contamination posed by cypermethrin.",

To separate minor actinide [MA(III)] and rare earth [RE(III)] elements effectively from a HNO 3 solution containing DTPA generated in the MAREC process, a functional polymeric composite impregnated with a novel macroporous silica-based diglycolamide compound, N,N,N′,N′-tetraoctyl-3-oxapentane-1,5-diamide (TODGA), was prepared. Thus, the impregnated functional polymeric composite (TODGA/SiO 2 -P) was obtained by impregnating and immobilizing TODGA molecules in the pores of the SiO 2 -polymer (SiO 2 -P) particles (ca. 50 μm diameter) via a vacuum sucking technique. The effects of H + ions within the concentration range 0.01–3.0 M and of NO 3 − ions within the range 0.1–3.115 M on the adsorption of RE(III) ions onto TODGA/SiO 2 -P were investigated at 298 K. It was found that in the presence of 0.05 M DTPA, the DTPA species strongly affected the adsorption of RE(III) ions. The adsorption capability of TODGA/SiO 2 -P depended on the competitive reactions of RE(III) ions with two species, viz. H 4 DTPA − and H 2 DTPA 3− . The distribution coefficient (K d ) for RE(III) ions increased with increasing NO 3 − concentration, with one RE(III) ion reacting with two NO 3 − ions. The adsorption mechanism of RE(III) ions towards the TODGA/SiO 2 -P polymeric composite in HNO 3 solution containing 0.05 M DTPA was suggested as: [Formula: see text] The formation of H 4 DTPA − and RE(H 4 DTPA)(NO 3 ) 2 which are both capable of adsorbing with TODGA/SiO 2 -P was the main reason why RE(III) ions exhibited such significant adsorption in the presence of 0.05 M DTPA.",

This photocatalyst was prepared by pressure modification of a commercial sample of anatase, TiO 2 (supplied by Zaklady Chemiczne Police SA, Poland). The adsorption of two azo dyes (Reactive Red 198 — a monoazo dye and Direct Green 99 — a polyazo dye) onto the unmodified and nitrogen-modified TiO 2 surface was determined. Adsorption onto unmodified TiO 2 led to an isotherm which could be described by the Freundlich model, whereas that onto the nitrogen-modified TiO 2 surface was best described by the Langmuir model. The adsorption isotherms of Direct Green 99 onto TiO 2 /N from aqueous solutions at various pH values were compared with those onto unmodified TiO 2 during dye removal under UV irradiation. Such a comparison is important since it provides information as to how solutes interact with adsorbents. Zeta potential measurements of TiO 2 provided an explanation for the observed behaviour in terms of the surface charge. The IR spectrum of the photocatalyst obtained exhibited new absorption bands at 1430–1440 cm −1 which were attributed to the bending vibrations of NH + 4 and at 1535 cm −1 associated with NH 2 groups or NO 2 and NO groups.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the adsorption of cellulase (isolated from Aspergillus niger) in a fixed-bed column using chitosan/alginate particles functionalized with epichlorohydrin (Cs/Ag–E) as the adsorbent. The particles were prepared and characterized with respect to apparent density, particle porosity, particle size, surface chemistry and thermal stability. Cellulase solutions were prepared in sodium citrate buffer (20 mM) at pH 5. Several breakthrough curves were obtained by varying the flow rate and feed concentrations in order to evaluate the suitable bed height and determine the adsorption isotherm, respectively. The adsorption isotherm fitted well with Langmuir equation with maximum adsorption capacity of about 11 mg of cellulase/g of adsorbent. Successive cycles (adsorption/washing/elution) were performed and the results demonstrate the reversibility of the process and its potential for enzyme purification and separation. However, cellulase activity in the eluted fraction is only 29% of that of the fresh enzyme fed to the column.",

Ion exchange of RhoZMOF with alkaline and alkaline-earth metal cations was performed up to stoichiometric levels with one single ion-exchange step. Screen effect caused by water-coordinated molecules around the exchanged cations hindered the hydrogen uptake, although slightly higher heats of hydrogen adsorption were observed for Na + , Li + , Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ exchanged samples. Conversely, the same exchange treatment produced a very interesting enhancement in CO 2 adsorption of RhoZMOF at 303 K. Moreover, because there are no water molecules surrounding the metallic cations, RhoZMOF material was exchanged with an Li + –crown–ether complex in the nitrobenzene/acetonitrile mixture, free of water. Nitrogen and hydrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K showed higher specific surface area and hydrogen adsorption capacity than the material with hydrated cations.",

Static adsorption data indicate that the adsorption capacity of indole–MIP is 54.6639 mg g −1 , with the adsorption equilibrium achieved in 40 minutes. The indole–MIP molecule has a high adsorption and elution rate due to the presence of hydrogen bond between the functional monomer (4-vinylpyridine) and the template molecule (indole). According to the results of thermodynamic analysis, the adsorption process is spontaneous. In addition, based on the results of kinetics and isotherm analysis, adsorption performances obey pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir equation. The selectivity of indole–MIP is favourable and can be reused even after 10 cycles.",

The equilibrium nature of the immobilization was described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The kinetic data were tested using the first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models.

Under optimized conditions, immobilized cellulase had a higher K m value (0.83 mM) and a lower V max value (38.2 μmol/min) compared with the free cellulase (0.62 mM and 48.92 μmol/min, respectively), indicating the affinity of cellulase for the MC matrix.",

The incorporated metals, in different oxidation states, were dispersed as nanoparticles on the mesoporous channels of SBA-15. The surface area decreased significantly for samples with incorporated metals, especially for those prepared by solid-mixture impregnation (Cu and Pd), although the hexagonal arrangement and the average pore size remained virtually unaltered. As revealed by batch adsorption isotherms, the incorporation of metals effectively increased the retention of the adsorbent towards the sulphur compound in the following order: Pd &lt; Fe &gt; Cu. DRIFT spectra (under in situ adsorption/desorption conditions) of the samples containing Fe and Pd showed that adsorption of BT onto the former is mainly reversible, whereas BT seems to be chemisorbed in the latter and did not desorb readily upon thermal treatment under He flow.",

The physical and chemical properties of the synthesized ion-exchanger were characterized using Fouriertransform (FT) infrared, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) techniques. Its chemical stability in various mineral acids, bases and organic solvents was also assessed. The data obtained reveal that the prepared exchanger had a good ionexchange capacity (1.34 mequiv/g towards Cs + ions) and a high thermal and chemical stability.

The influences of pH, contact time, initial solute concentration and temperature are reported. Various parameters such as the effective diffusion coefficient under different conditions and the activation energy were determined from the graphical representation of the linearized form of the Arrhenius equation. Thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG 0 , ΔH 0 and ΔS 0 were also calculated. The numerical value of ΔG 0 increased from 7.43 to 9.74 kJ/mol as the temperature was increased from 298 K to 313 K, indicating that the exchange reaction was more favourable at low temperatures. The negative value of ΔH 0 (–49.55 kJ/mol) reflected the exothermic nature of the exchange process.",

The synthesized polymers were characterized by FT-IR, TGA and XRD techniques. To study the adsorption behaviour of the adsorbent, the Cu(II) ion which acts as the template in the salen-functionalized polymer was eluted with 0.1 M HNO 3 . The effect of different experimental conditions on the adsorption capacity was studied. At Cu(II) ion concentrations of 30 ppm and at a pH value of 6.2, an adsorption capacity of 26 mg/g was obtained. Such an adsorption capacity at low Cu(II) ion concentrations is very significant and much higher than that obtained for Zn(II), Ni(II) and Co(II) ions. The relative selectivity coefficient of IIP for Cu(II)/Zn(II), Cu(II)/Ni(II) and Cu(II)/Co(II) was calculated, when it was demonstrated that the polymer is highly selective towards Cu(II) ions. The method was also used for a real sample. The results showed that the new adsorbent can be used for the pre-concentration of Cu(II) ions at low concentration and in the presence of Zn(II), Ni(II) and Co(II) ions.",

All the nanocomposites showed unmonotonous variations in the thermal resistance, the dielectric permittivity and losses, and the annihilation rates for both positrons and ortho-positronium atoms with increasing filler’s loading. The nanoparticle-loading effects can be explained on the assumption that the oxide particles embedded into a cross-linked polyester resin induce rearrangements in its structure. Several mechanisms of particle–polymer interface interaction compete simultaneously and thus promote the alterations in molecular structure of the nanocomposites. The mechanisms may include both chemical and electrostatic fastening of polyester chains and styrene cross-links to the active surface sites, the destruction of the styrene cross-links, and redistribution of electron density in polymers. The features of the loading effects observed in the different nanocomposites can be ascribed to distinctions in both of active surface sites and intrinsic dielectric properties of the filling oxide particles.",

The applicability of classic model (W-P model) and new optimization model in Guizhou mining areas are studied through the statistics of basic parameter data from 107 groups of coal-seam gas in eight mining areas. The results show that the gas content calculated by the classical model is lower than the measured value, while the gas pressure value is larger than that. The average relative error of gas content and pressure data reach 23.98% and 97.86%, respectively. The gas content and pressure data calculated by the optimization model are well fitted with the measured value. The fitting degree gradually rises with the increase of the sample size, and the average relative errors are 6.44% and 14.27%, respectively. Compared with the classical model, the average relative errors of gas content and pressure calculated by the optimization model reduce by 17.54% and 83.59%, respectively. The optimization model controls the tendency of calculated value error which significantly rises as the ΔP increases.

And the average relative error of calculated pressure value ranges from 9.84% to 25.80%, both of them are far superior to that of classical model.

The porous clay material W was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy indicating that porous clay material W was a type of mullite with 63.52 m 2 /g specific surface area. After immobilization, the maximum biomass increased 2.7 times the specific growth rate and the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia (NH 4 + –N), and total phosphorus (TP) by the immobilized PM3 were 42.99, 29.19, and 11.76% higher than the free strain after 24 h.

The adsorption isotherms can well describe the adsorption process. The maximum adsorption capacity of COD and NH 4 + –N on porous clay material W is 2.33 and 0.32 mg/g, respectively.

    "abstract": "Gas occurrence in coal seams shows zonation, and the outburst risk prediction index is significantly affected by coal seam gas. For different coal mine, the sensitivity of prediction index of outburst risk is inconsistent, and the different area of the same coal mine can present different sensitivities to the same index. In this study, we measured the industrial analysis of coals and determined the degree of outburst risk of each coal seam using coal samples with the particle size of 1 ∼ 3 mm. The relationships between the equilibrium gas pressure and gas desorption index of drill cuttings, between the desorption index of drill cuttings and the adsorption pressure, and between the critical values of the indexes of drill cuttings were also analyzed using the fuzzy clustering method. Based on the analysis of the particle size distribution of coal samples, the influence of grain size on the critical value of the drill cuttings desorption index was studied. The results showed that the critical values of the desorption index of drill cuttings were different under different adsorption equilibrium gas pressures, and those critical values increased with increasing adsorption equilibrium gas pressure. The desorption index of drill cuttings and adsorption equilibrium gas pressure had a linear relationship, and the higher the degree of outburst risk was, the greater the slope of the fitting function and the smaller the intercept; under the same gas pressure of adsorption equilibrium, there was a linear relationship between Δh 2 and K 1 , and the higher the outburst risk of coal seam was, the smaller the slope of the fitting function and the greater the intercept. The drill cuttings desorption index Δh 2 was more sensitive than the index K 1 . Under the same test pressure, the smaller the particle size of the coal samples was, the greater the value of desorption index of drill cuttings and the higher the outburst risk of coal seam. The research results have significant theoretical importance and practical value for the prediction and prevention of coal and gas outbursts in coal mines with similar occurrence conditions of coal seams.",

The influence of the composition and thickness of adsorbate layers on the water contact angle of sessile drops on different substrates was systematically investigated in the present work. Measurements were carried out for gold-sputtered substrates. These new results are compared to results from a previous study, in which corresponding measurements were carried out for technical steel and titanium substrates. In all experiments, different pretreatments of the samples were used to obtain variations of the adsorbate layer. The samples were either exposed to an oil bath or not, and different cleaning agents were used. The analysis of the adsorbate layer was carried out with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results for the different substrates reveal that the water contact angle depends mainly on the composition of the adsorbate layer. The substrate has only an indirect influence, as it influences the composition of the adsorbate layer. The thickness of the adsorbate layers was between 1.4 and 14 nm and was large enough to prevent a direct influence of the substrate on the water contact angle. It is shown that using the information on the adsorbate layer composition from XPS and the results for the water contact angle obtained for the gold samples alone, the water contact angles on the steel and titanium samples can be predicted.",

    "abstract": "Mixed-mode chromatography (MMC), which combines features of ion exchange chromatography (IEC) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), is an interesting method for protein separation and purification. The design of MMC processes is challenging as adsorption equilibria are influenced by many parameters, including ionic strength and the presence of different salts in solution. Systematic studies on the influence of those parameters in MMC are rare. Therefore, in the present work, the influence of four salts, namely, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium sulfate, on the adsorption of lysozyme on the mixed-mode resin Toyopearl MX-Trp-650M at pH 7.0 and 25°C was studied systematically in equilibrium adsorption experiments for ionic strengths between 0 mM and 3000 mM. For all salts, a noticeable adsorption strength was observed over the entire range of studied ionic strengths. An exponential decay of the loading of the resin with increasing ionic strength was found until approx. 1000 mM. For higher ionic strengths, the loading was found to be practically independent of the ionic strength. At constant ionic strength, the highest lysozyme loadings were observed for ammonium sulfate, the lowest for sodium chloride. A mathematical model was developed that correctly describes the influence of the ionic strength as well as the influence of the studied salts. The model is the first that enables the prediction of adsorption isotherms of proteins on mixed-mode resins in a wide range of technically interesting conditions, accounting for the influence of the ionic strength and four salts of practical relevance.",

Herein, we report procedures to design and fabricate membranes based on waste polyethylene/porous activated-metakaolinite thin film nanocomposites (WPE/PAMK-TFN). It has been devoted to improving water desalination processes, where efficient removal of trace level (~250 ppm) of toxic heavy metals such as Cd(II), Pb(II), and Cu(II) ions from synthetic wastewater solutions was highly accomplished. Physicochemical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface analysis (BET), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) have been extensively employed to elucidate the structure/composition of the prepared nanomaterials. The effect of concentration (0–0.5 wt%) of porous activated-metakaolinite (PAMK) on water permeation was investigated. The results obtained revealed that 0.5 wt% of PAMK clay particles produced the highest dispersion, as evident by SEM images of the nanocomposite membranes. Significantly, the constructed membrane showed marked improvements in porosity, hydrophilicity, and hydraulic resistance. Moreover, elemental mapping studies have confirmed the intercalation of activated bentonite clay within the polymer matrix. The obtained results demonstrated that increased flux and rejection capability of membranes occurred at high clay dosage. In contrast, the low rejection capability was observed at either lower pH and higher initial feed concentrations. Ultimately, for 250 ppm of Cd(II), Pb(II), and Cu(II) ions, the constructed membranes showed maximum removal capability of 69.3%, 76.2%, and 82.5% of toxic cations, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In China, owing to the methane concentration being below 0.75%, the coal ventilation air methane (CVAM) is usually emitted directly into the atmosphere, rather than utilized, which not only causes huge waste of energy but also exerts potential hazards to the greenhouse effect. It is important and practicable to save costs of development and investment by simulating enrichment and separation of CVAM with an aim to improve the efficiency and recovery of adsorption separation. Above all, it will have important practical significance to the development of adsorption separation. In this paper, the experiment of the pressure swing adsorption process was carried out on double towers built by our laboratory, and the Aspen Adsorption was used to simulate the process. The effect of the operation parameters on the desorbed methane concentration was studied by altering the feed concentration, the adsorbed pressure, and adsorbed and desorbed time. The results of simulation and experiment are basically consistent. The ratio of methane was decreased following the increasing concentration of the feed. The optimum adsorption pressure and time were found to be 210 kPa and 120 s, respectively. The optimum desorption times of experiment and simulation were 150 s and 120 s, respectively. Because there was a man-made 30 s time lag between the experiment and simulation to protect the vacuum pump, the results show that the simulation and experiment were matched well. Therefore, we can make use of Aspen Adsorption to design separation and enrichment of CVAM, providing theoretical and practical guidance for the gas separation and saving resources and energy.",

    "abstract": "The increasing usage of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) inevitably leads to their release into the environment. To understand their fate and toxicity in water systems, a reliable method for the quantitative analysis of ZnONPs in environmental waters is urgently needed to be established. In this study, a quantitative analytical method of ZnONPs in environmental waters was developed by cloud point extraction (CPE) combined inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). To obtain high recoveries of ZnONPs, the CPE parameters including pH, surfactant concentration, salt concentration, bath temperature, and time were optimized. The results demonstrated that the addition of β-mercaptoethylamine could significantly reduce the interference of Zn 2+ on the extraction of ZnONPs, while the CPE approach was not affected significantly by the typical environmental inorganic ion and ENMs (such as Au, TiO 2 , and Al 2 O 3 ). The extraction method of ZnONPs with different diameters was also assessed, and satisfactory extraction efficiency was obtained. The results of ZnONP concentration in collected environmental water were in the range of [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] μg/L. And the recoveries of ZnONPs in different environmental waters were [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] at low concentration spiked levels (12.57-54.68 μg/L), demonstrating that it is efficient to extract trace ZnONPs from real environmental waters. This established method offered a reliable method for the quantitative determination of ZnONPs in environmental waters, which could further promote the study of the environmental behavior, fate, and toxicity of ZnONPs in an aqueous environment.",

The changes of nutrient elements, pH, heavy metals in substrate material, the biological concentration/transfer factor, and the distribution and diversity of bacteria and fungi in rhizosphere soil were investigated. The results show that the plant communities help slow down the loss of nutrient elements and the increase of the concentrations of heavy metals in the eco-restoration process. The Indigofera amblyantha Craib had the advantaged ability to enrich and transfer Cd, Cu, Mn, and its diversity index of microbial communities in rhizosphere soils was higher than that of other quadrats. These excellent properties found in this work help reveal the insight into the adaptability of Indigofera amblyantha Craib in the eco-restoration of stone coal mines.

In this paper, the research progress of activated carbon and its modification, the photocatalytic principle and modification of titanium dioxide, and TiO 2 /AC materials are reviewed. The results show that the pore size distribution gradient and acidic oxygen-containing functional groups of activated carbon play key roles in the formaldehyde adsorption process. TiO 2 doped with metal ions and nonmetal ions can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity.

An AC commercial sample was functionalized with monoethanolamine to obtain nitrogen-enriched AC with two different loadings (ACN10 and ACN20).

Hence, this study is the first to develop a quadratic regression model and artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal under different adsorption conditions. Nanozero-valent iron encapsulated into cellulose acetate (CA/nZVI) was synthesized, characterized by XRD, SEM, and EDS, and used as an efficient adsorbent for BOD reduction. Results indicated that the medium pH and adsorption time should be adjusted around 7 and 30 min, respectively, to maintain the highest BOD removal efficiency of 96.4% at initial BOD [Formula: see text] mg/L, mixing [Formula: see text] rpm, and adsorbent dosage of 3 g/L. An optimized ANN structure of 5–10–1, with the “ trainlm” back-propagation learning algorithm, achieved the highest predictive performance for BOD removal ([Formula: see text]: 0.972, Adj-[Formula: see text]: 0.971, RMSE: 1.449, and SSE: 56.680). Based on the ANN sensitivity analysis, the relative importance of the adsorption factors could be arranged as [Formula: see text]. A quadratic regression model was developed to visualize the impacts of adsorption factors on the BOD removal efficiency, optimizing pH at 7.3 and time at 46.2 min. The accuracy of the quadratic regression and ANN models in predicting BOD removal was approximately comparable. Hence, these computational-based methods could further maximize the performance of CA/nZVI material for removing BOD from wastewater under different adsorption conditions.

Different kinetic and isotherm models were applied to evaluate the adsorption mechanism and estimate values of different adsorption parameters. The adsorption isotherm and kinetics were better explained by the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model whereas the adsorption thermodynamics depicted the endothermic, spontaneous, and favorable nature of the process. The adsorbent was regenerated with acetone and reused for the selected dyes for many cycles. After the 5 th cycle, the hydrogel retained safranin/toluidine removal [Formula: see text] which pointed toward the reusability of the prepared adsorbent for cycles without appreciable reduction in its adsorption capacity. Hence, the GA/AM sorbent can be applied as an alternative of activated carbon to treat dye-contaminated waters.",

    "abstract": "Lime and biochar amendments are widely used to immobilize cadmium (Cd) in agricultural soils and to ensure food security. However, the effects of these two soil amendments on the mechanisms of Cd stress alleviation in crops are unclear. Therefore, the effects of lime and biochar applications on Cd uptake, transport, subcellular distribution, antioxidant system, N metabolism, and related factors were examined in a soil- Brassica napus L. ( B. napus) system. We found that lime application significantly increased the root Cd content by 41.5% but decreased Cd TF and shoot Cd by 81.0% and 74.3%, respectively, whereas biochar amendment decreased root and shoot Cd contents by 67.6% and 34.3%, respectively, but increased Cd TF by 104.1%. Lime treatment immobilized Cd in the cell wall of the root to reduce Cd transport, but biochar treatment increased the soluble fraction of Cd in root cells to improve the migration capacity of Cd. The significant negative relationship between the soil exchangeable Cd and Ca and the positive relationships between Cd and Ca both in shoot and root indicated that the Ca mediated Cd transport from soil to B. napus after lime and biochar applications. Additionally, lime amendment increased Cd proportion in the root cell walls to immobilize Cd, but biochar amendment increased Cd proportion in the soluble fraction to enhance Cd migration. Furthermore, biochar application significantly increased SOD, CAT, and POD by 17.5%, 95.4%, and 26.6%, whereas lime amendment only significantly enhanced CAT by 51.0%. Besides, both of biochar and lime applications increased shoot N content and GDH activity, but only the shoot NO 3 - content and nitrate reductase under biochar treatment were significantly altered. Overall, these findings suggested that lime is more efficient in reducing the transport of Cd from underground to aboveground and in improving Cd tolerance, whereas biochar tends to improve the antioxidant capacity and facilitate N metabolism. These results will provide significant strategies for selecting appropriate amendments to ensure the crops safety.",

    "abstract": "Because biofuels are ecologically beneficial and might possibly lessen global warming, many academics are interested in studying them. Nanoparticles have been added to biodiesel to improve its performance as well as emissions. Diesel engine that operates on waste cooking oil biodiesel is the subject of the present research, which evaluates the impact of MgO nanoadditives on performance and emissions. Transesterification was done to convert waste cooking oil biodiesel into methyl ester. In the present study, SEM (scanning electron microscope), TEM (transmission electron microscope), and EDX spectroscopy are used for investigation of nanoadditives. The sample contained biodiesel blends with and without nanomagnesium oxide, as well as a combination of the two. According to the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials), the biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil met all fuel standards. The results of the testing were obtained by running a single-cylinder, 4-stroke diesel engine under a variety of loads. Using SEM analysis, the diameter of nanoparticles is found to be 20 nm to 38 nm. Magnesium oxide nanoparticles have been shown to include the elements oxygen, iron sulphide, silicon dioxide, and sodium. Oxygen accounted for about 50.74 percent of the samples, magnesium accounted for 45.36 percent, silicon dioxide accounted for 3.24 percent, and sodium accounted for 0.66 percent using EDX spectra. Magnesium oxide develops in unique shapes, with diameters varying from 9.24 to 14.94 nm, as seen in the TEM picture. An investigation found that B20 using 100 ppm MgO nanoparticles increases BTE (brake thermal efficiency) by 2.1 percent while simultaneously reducing SFC (specific fuel consumption) which was found to be ranging from 0.54 to 0.38 kg/kWh, respectively. B20 nanoparticles were used to reduce the amount of HC, CO, and smoke emitted by engines.",

Based on this, this paper chooses Pingdingshan coking coal as the research object, using Hsorb-2600 high-temperature and high-pressure gas adsorption instrument to carry on isothermal adsorption experiment. According to the adsorption theory and the uniqueness of the adsorption characteristics cure, the adsorption model was analyzed and studied. The results show that the predicted curve of coal seam gas adsorption isotherm is in good agreement with the measured curve, the relative error is less than 10%, and the adsorption characteristic curve is logarithmic. At the same time, the model is used to study the variation of adsorbed gas amount with mining depth. The results show that the adsorbed gas amount increases first and then decreases with coal burial depth.",

    "abstract": "The development of low fouling UF membranes with boosting water flux for implementations in water purifications is critical. Organic foulants and ionic strength are the main characteristics of surface water which affect the membrane performance for water generation and seawater desalination. Low fouling hybrid ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated from a combination of sulfonic acid functionalized titanium nanotubes (TNTs-SO 3 H) and polysulfone (PSf) by the nonsolvent-induced phase separation approach. The membrane fouling was explored utilizing a polysaccharide sodium alginate (SA) as a hydrophilic nature organic matter, and the impact of Na + and Ca 2+ ions on alginate membrane fouling were also addressed. The results showed that the membranes’ water permeability and natural organic matter fouling resistances were affected by the proportion of TNTs-SO 3 H in the membranes. The inclusion of TNTs-SO 3 H improves the water penetration fluxes (Jw1) and surface hydrophilicity of the manufactured membranes. In the UF of sodium alginate solution, the produced membrane comprising 5% TNTs-SO 3 H exhibits a higher penetration flux and rejection value than the other membranes. The introduction of Na + and Ca 2+ ions to the SA solution reduces the membrane fouling. Furthermore, the adsorption investigation of sodium alginate solutions at [Formula: see text] was lowered as the amount of TNTs-SO 3 H was increased. After ultrafiltration, the fouled membrane containing 5% TNTs-SO 3 H is readily removed, and recurrent antifouling experiments indicate a consistent and maximum filtration efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Hydroxyapatite (HAP) was a highly efficient decontamination material for its strong adsorption capacity used in the immobilization of heavy metals, while the particle-size effect was insufficiently investigated during the sorption process. In the present study, the mechanisms of nickel (Ni(II)) adsorption on HAPs with two different particle sizes were investigated by combing batch experiments, desorption, and XRD analysis. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of 20 nm HAP (nano-HAP) was much higher than that of 12 μm HAP (micro-HAP). It was noticed that the results of the present study also clarified the distinct mechanisms in each adsorption process. As for micro-HAP, Ni 2+ adsorbed through slow diffusion and replacement with Ca 2+ and then incorporated in the lattice at pH between 6.5 and 9.0, which was confirmed by the results of kinetics, thermodynamics, and desorption. And a more compact crystalline structure and irreversible desorption behavior of micro-HAP after Ni(II) adsorption was confirmed by results of XRD and desorption isotherms, respectively. At [Formula: see text], lattice incorporation and precipitation controlled together. However, for nano-HAP, the sharp increase of Ni(II) adsorption and ionic strength dependent at pH 6.5 to 9.0 revealed that the dominant mechanisms were ionic exchange and inner-sphere complexation. XRD results showed that characteristic peaks of cassidyite appeared in Ni(II)-loading nano-HAP. At [Formula: see text], a precipitate of Ni(II) was the dominant mechanism. The experimental finds demonstrated that nanoscale HAP was a more fast, efficient, and desorbable adsorbent than micro-HAP for Ni(II) removal. These findings would be favorable for investigating the removal mechanisms of heavy metals on the HAP materials and designing the synthesis methods.",

The mixed solids thus prepared had the nominal molar compositions 0.06Fe 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and 0.125Fe 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 (FeAl-I and FeAl-II). The surface and catalytic properties of various irradiated solids (15–200 Mrad) were studied using nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and catalysis of CO oxidation by O 2 at 150–280°C using a static method. The results obtained revealed that γ-irradiation at doses between 15 and 80 Mrad resulted in a progressive decrease (7–22%) in the surface area of the treated solids. Treatment with doses above this limit exerted an opposite effect. γ-Irradiation also resulted in a widening of the pores of the irradiated adsorbents. The catalytic activity of the FeAl-I solid was influenced slightly by γ-rays while the FeAl-II catalyst was significantly modified by this treatment. The reaction rate constant per unit surface area of the catalytic reaction conducted at 280°C over the FeAl-II solid decreased (65%) by exposure to doses up to 120 Mrad, then increased on increasing the dose above this limit. This did not modify the mechanism of the catalytic reaction, but changed the number of catalytically-active sites taking part in chemisorption and catalysis of the CO oxidation reaction without affecting their energetic nature.",

Variations in the free energy of water in the adsorption layer of Carbosils having different carbon contents on the silica surface and their free surface energy have been determined from measurements of the temperature dependence of the NMR signal for non-freezing water in the cooling process.

The results obtained showed that Li 2 O doping followed by precalcination at 500–1000°C enhanced the formation of cobalt ferrite to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant added (0.52–6.0 mol% Li 2 O).

The pilot plant consisted of an equalizer, chemical mixing tank, aerator, clarifier, disinfectant tank and sand filter as the main components. In addition, a set of centrifugal and dosing pumps, an air blower and a pH controller were added. The industrial-scale treatment unit could handle a 50 m 3 /d effluent flow rate composed of combined industrial and municipal wastewater effluents heavily loaded with organic and biologically resistant pollutants (sugars, gums, pesticides and detergents) with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) value extending to 25 000 ppm. House-keeping arrangements and the isolation of some streams were necessary in order to attain an end-pipe effluent capable of treatment by conventional procedures at reasonable cost values. Different operating conditions were tested in order to treat effluent loaded with a COD value reaching 5000 ppm to obtain acceptable limits capable of containment in underground wells or re-use in irrigation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic poly(vinyl alcohol) (mPVAL) gel beads (150–200 μm in diameter) carrying Procion Blue MX-3G (122 μmol/g) were used for the removal of different amounts (50–650 mg/l) of Hg(II) ions from aqueous solutions. The mPVAL gel beads were characterized by swelling tests, electron spin resonance (ESR), elemental analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The swelling ratio of the mPVAL gel beads, which had a spherical shape and porous structure, was 76%. The presence of magnetite particles in the polymeric structure was confirmed by ESR spectroscopy. The capacity of the beads towards Hg(II) ions increased with time during the first 10 min of adsorption and then levelled off towards an equilibrium adsorption capacity. The adsorption of Hg(II) ions on the plain beads was very low (0.57 mg/g) but increased substantially (to 69.2 mg/g) on beads to which Procion Blue MX-3G had been attached. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm was applicable to the description of Hg(II) ion adsorption by Procion Blue MX-3G-attached mPVAL gel beads. Such adsorption increased with increasing pH of the aqueous medium and reached a plateau level at ca. pH 6.0. The optimal pH range for Hg(II) ion adsorption was 6.0–7.0. More than 95% of the adsorbed Hg(II) ions was desorbed within 15 min when 0.1 M HNO 3 was used as an elution agent. Regeneration of the Procion Blue MX-3G-attached mPVAL gel beads under these conditions was also reasonable.",

    "abstract": "The study presented described the influence of temperature as well as pH on phenol adsorption (and the adsorption kinetics) on to three unmodified commercial carbons. The first section of the paper provided a description of the characterization of the carbons employing the most sophisticated method of carbon porosity characterization at present available, i.e. the method of Do and co-workers (the ND method). It was then shown that the ND method leads to the same results as the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The TPD results for D43/1, WD and AHD carbons were then presented and discussed with deconvolution of the peaks being performed. The results obtained together with those already published led to an assignment of the chemical structures of the surface functionalities for all the carbons studied. Thermogravimetric analysis of phenol adsorption indicated that the number of molecules bonded chemically was small. Adsorption of phenol under acidic conditions (pH 1.5) was lower than at neutral pH for all the carbons studied. A description of the corresponding isotherms applying adsorbability, quasi-Freundlich and DA models, together with enthalpy measurements, led to a mechanism for the adsorption of phenol at both pH values. This mechanism was further confirmed by some empirical correlations and by a comparison with data obtained recently for modified chemically carbons. Some new correlations between the properties of the carbon surface and the constants characterizing the process of phenol adsorption suggested recently were extended from data which had been measured for six carbons initially. Analysis of the average hysteresis on the adsorption/desorption isotherms, as well as a comparison of phenol adsorption under oxic and anoxic conditions, led to a mechanism for the irreversible adsorption of phenol. It was suggested that such irreversibility resulted from two effects: the creation of strong complexes between the phenol molecule and surface carbonyl and lactone groups, as well as polymerization. The latter effect arose from the ability of carbon to adsorb oxygen from solution and form superoxo ions. A mechanism for such polymerization was proposed. Finally, the kinetics of the process were considered. The diffusion coefficients were calculated from an application of the analytical solution of Fick's law of diffusion for adsorption in cylindrical particles. It was shown that phenol diffusion occurs via a mixed process involving the carbon surface and pores. The diffusion energy obtained was correlated with the values for the physicochemical parameters of the carbons studied. It was concluded that the mechanism of phenol adsorption was determined not only by so-called ‘π–π interactions’ and ‘donor–acceptor complex’ formation, but also by a ‘solvent effect’ balancing the influence of the two above-mentioned factors, this solvent effect being strongly dependent on the temperature.",

    "abstract": "Cadmium is one of the most toxic heavy metals known and is considered inessential for living organisms. This element is found at low concentrations in natural environments, but human activities have led to increased levels in all continents. In the present study, the removal of cadmium(II) ions from aqueous solutions was investigated. Experimental investigations were undertaken using the ion-exchange resins Amberlite IR 120 (strongly acidic), Amberlite IRC 718 (weakly acidic and chelating), Lewatit TP 207 (weakly acidic and chelating) and Lewatit CNP 80 (weakly acidic). For investigations of the exchange equilibria, different amounts of resin material were contacted with a fixed volume of a cadmium ion-containing solution. Because the uptake of cadmium ions was mainly dominated by the pH of the liquid phase, the pH value was varied between 0 and 3 with sample sizes of 0.5–5.0 g in each series studied. The initial and final cadmium ion concentrations were measured by ICP–AES methods. Exchange equilibria were evaluated for strongly and weakly acidic resins via the surface complex formation theory that considers the sorption of ions as a local equilibrium reaction caused by the amphoteric behaviour of the surface. Application of this theory to exchange equilibria with ordinary and chelating weak acid exchange resins capable of releasing protons led to a comprehensive description of the systems. Binary equilibria were described by a logarithmic equilibrium parameter that was a linear function of the resin phase. For the evaluation of the equilibrium parameters, the generalized separation factors were calculated from the experimental data and plotted against the respective dimensionless resin loadings. Linear relationships were obtained in most cases although systematic deviations were found for small loadings.",

These results were confirmed by TPD studies that showed hydrogen-bonded water and water coordinated to Na + and K + cations located in the main channels of ETS-10. Ammonia TPD measurements on the hydrated material provided evidence for two forms of adsorbed NH 3 , both bonded to water molecules. On the anhydrous material, NH 3 was probably coordinated only to the more loosely bonded Na + and K + ions in the main channels of ETS-10.

Commercial samples with combined acidic and basic properties were also tested with respect to 2-CP adsorption.

These properties included burn-off, apparent surface area, micropore volume, total pore volume and Methylene Blue (MB) adsorption surface area. The total basicity had no relationship with any adsorption parameter. However, total basicity was found to have a relationship with the total pore volume, the micropore volume, MB adsorption and burn-off. The BET surface area showed only a very weak relationship with the total basicity. Burn-off had a relationship with the relative affinity of the adsorbate and the surface and Langmuir constants, but not with the adsorption capacity. De-ashing the sample using HF/HCl decreased the total basicity and MB adsorption but increased the total acidity and the capacity towards 2-CP uptake. The mineral contents of both prepared and commercial samples were analyzed and found to play no role in the adsorption of 2-CP.",

The heteroligand complexes of gold(III) were not formed on the surfaces of the gels. This behaviour was attributed to the different spatial location of covalently bonded complexes with the surface aminopropyl and mercaptopropyl groups on the silica gel surface.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption of chromium(III) ions onto coconut ( Cocos nucifera) husk has been studied using radiotracer and batch techniques. Maximum adsorption (ca. 91%) of Cr(III) ions (2.59 × 10 −5 M) onto the adsorbent surface from deionised water was achieved in 30 min when 100 mg coconut husk was employed. The Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin—Radushkevich (D—R) isotherms all provided an accurate fit of the adsorption data. The Langmuir constants, i.e. Q = 18.25 ± 0.55 μmol/g and b = (2.57 ± 0.15) x 10 4 l/mol, were computed. Similarly, application of the D—R isotherm led to an adsorption capacity of 0.25 ±0.03 mmol/g, a β value of −0.005352 ± 0.000360 kJ 2 /mol 2 and an adsorption energy of 9.67 ± 0.33 kJ/mol. Use of the Freundlich isotherm allowed the constants 1/n = 0.85 ± 0.05 and A = 58.6 ± 36.8 mmol/g to be estimated. Studies of the variation of adsorption with temperature gave ΔH = 10.8 ± 0.8 kJ/mol, ΔS = 48.8 ± 2.7 J/(mol K) and ΔG = −4.6 ± 0.03 kJ/mol at 25°C. Addition of the divalent ions Ba, Co, Pb, Ni and sulphate to the aqueous solution led to an increase in adsorption whilst the presence of borate, carbonate and oxalate ions reduced the adsorption significantly. The use of Zr(IV), I(I), Se(IV) and Tc(VII) ions led to a low adsorption capacity. The results showed that coconut husk can be used to separate Cr(III) ions from all these various ions via a single or multistage operation.",

The present study focuses on the latter factor by investigating the effect of the interstitial velocity on the adsorption of bacteria onto soil. Columns of 10 cm diameter and 130 cm height, respectively, were packed with a sandy soil. The columns were saturated with water containing nalidixic acid-resistant Escherichia coli as a bio-tracer at three different pH levels. The columns were maintained at 20°C for 24 h before connecting the column outlet to its inlet by a pump in a closed loop. Water containing the biotracer was re-circulated through the column for another 24 h at three different interstitial velocities. Water samples were taken from a sampling tap connected to the pump at 4-h intervals. These samples were analyzed to determine the biotracer concentration. The results show that more biotracer cells were retained in the soil at the lower interstitial velocity. The higher interstitial velocity resulted in higher shear forces which caused more desorption of the biotracer cells from the surfaces of the soil particles. Bacterial adsorption was higher at the acidic pH value. The survival of the biotracer cells in soil solution was also tested at three different pH levels. The results show that no decline in the biotracer concentration occurred during the test period.",

It was first used to investigate the adsorption properties of 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulphonic acid (1,2,4-acid), including the corresponding adsorption isotherms, thermodynamics and binary competitive adsorption with 2-naphthol. The Freundlich model gave good fits to both the single and binary adsorption isotherms, indicating an endothermic and favourable adsorption process. The positive value of ΔH 0 for the single solute system was in the range of 30–60 kJ/mol showing the existence of integrated processes involving chemical interaction. The values of ΔG 0 demonstrated the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process while the value of ΔS 0 showed increased randomness at the solid–solution interface, thereby indicating the presence of stoichiometric displacement. Both ΔH 0 and ΔS 0 appeared to vary linearly with increased solid loading, q e . Pre-adsorbed 2-naphthol molecules supplied another adsorption site for 1,2,4-acid, despite the existence of an antagonistic interaction with 2-naphthol. In simultaneous processes, the mechanism for 1,2,4-acid adsorption probably mainly involved van der Waals forces and hydrogen-bonding interaction. Furthermore, the adsorption of a greater amount of 2-naphthol onto the solid phase demonstrated the occurrence of interaction between the tested binary solutes. It was concluded that direct competition for adsorption sites was the dominant competitive mechanism.",

The clay + Ce(OH) n conjugate was prepared by intercalating colloidal cerium hydroxide in the clay inner layer. Similarly, the clay + Ce→OH conjugate was prepared by introducing cerium ions into the clay followed by their hydrolysis. The intercalation of cerium hydroxide and the chemical state of the cerium ion in the clay were evaluated via X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. The conjugates exhibited a mesoporous structure with a high specific surface area of ca. 85–100 m 2 /g. These conjugates adsorbed As(III) and As(V) in a similar manner from aqueous solutions of As 2 O 3 and KH 2 AsO 4 , respectively, over the pH range 4–8. The adsorption isotherms for As(III) and As(V) onto the conjugates were Langmuirian in shape. They exhibited large values for the Langmuir constant, K, thereby indicating the effectiveness of the conjugates in the removal of arsenic ions from dilute aqueous solutions. The adsorption capacity of the clay + Ce→OH conjugate was superior to that of the clay + Ce(OH) n conjugate. Co-existing anions in the aqueous solutions such as chloride, carbonate, sulphate and phosphate had little effect on the removal of arsenic.",

The adsorptivity of the activated carbon spheres towards phenol was measured as a function of oxidation temperature and time, its dependence on the micropore volume being discussed. The development of pores by air oxidation was interpreted in terms of master curves measured at the reference temperature (400°C) for each pore parameter, viz. surface areas and pore volumes due to different pores. The pore parameters were determined via the BET, α S -plot, BJH and DFT methods. The results presented suggest that the effect of oxidation temperature and time on pore development could be converted with each other as well as oxidation yield. The temperature dependence of the different parameters corresponded to an apparent activation energy of ca. 150 kJ/mol. Pore development was assumed to proceed principally via the enlargement and collapse of micropores through mesopores to macropores.",

Adsorption from solutions of relatively low concentrations (HSA, 1 μg/ml; Fn, 0.1 μg/ml) allowed individual adsorbed protein molecules to be imaged. HSA appeared to take one of two forms (N or F) depending upon the adsorption energy and site, whilst Fn appeared to be adsorbed in the coiled, bent form. AFM analysis of films obtained by adsorption from solutions of higher protein concentrations, which were dried slowly over a, period of 24 h, indicated the formation of network structures with the surface coverage increasing with solution concentration. The precise structure, which was very similar for both proteins, appeared to result from dewetting of the hydrophobic HOPG by the protein solution. A grainy structure resulted when films were dried rapidly. In this case, evaporation occurred before dewetting and protein molecules became isolated in even clusters. The XPS nitrogen 1s signal from adsorbed protein was found to increase as the level of adsorbed protein increased, i.e. as a function of the concentration of the protein solution. Water contact angles decreased from 90° for HOPG to 60° after protein adsorption and then increased slightly to 70° as the level of adsorbed protein increased. Plots of the surface nitrogen concentration (atom %) versus the protein solution concentration were type I in the Brunauer, Deming, Deming and Teller isotherm classification. A linear fit was obtained when these data were plotted in the form of the Langmuir equation which resulted in a monolayer equivalent value of N m = 3.3 atom % protein nitrogen. The main mechanism of adsorption appeared to be dispersion- or hydrophobic-dominated, although electrostatic repulsions between polar surface oxygen groups and the negatively charged HSA may also occur.",

The order of the K and K D values also confirmed that endosulfan adsorption was higher in methanol/water mixtures than in acetone/water mixtures and decreased with increasing f s values. The R f values obtained from soil TLC studies were inversely proportional to the K and K D values for both co-solvent systems. The higher K and K D values and lower R f values in methanol/water mixtures relative to acetone/water mixtures for all the three soils studied indicated that acetone had a greater potential for ground water contamination through leaching from potential sites than methanol. The affinity of endosulfan towards the organic carbon and clay content of the soils was evaluated by calculating the K OC and K C values. The data obtained indicated that, although the affinity of endosulfan was better correlated with the organic carbon content, the contribution of the clay content of soils towards endosulfan adsorption cannot be ignored. The adsorption data were used to evaluate the co-solvent theory for describing the adsorption of endosulfan in acetone/water and methanol/water mixtures. The aqueous-phase partition coefficients, K DW (mol/g), normalized with respect to f oc for endosulfan were evaluated via the extrapolation f s → 0.",

    "abstract": "An experimental study of the single, binary, ternary and quaternary fixed bed adsorption of hexane isomers onto zeolite BETA was performed covering the temperature range between 423 K and 523 K and partial pressures up to 0.3 bar. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms were collected from breakthrough experiments. Based on an analysis of sorption events at the molecular level, a Tri-Site Langmuir model (TSL) was developed to interpret the equilibrium data with good accuracy. At the partial pressures studied, it was found that the degree of branching was related to the affinity; the sorption hierarchy was most favourable towards the linear isomer and least favourable towards the di-branched ones. A mathematical model based on a linear driving force (LDF) was developed and used to test the experimental data. It was found that the model predicted the behaviour of the fixed bed experiments with good accuracy. Zeolite BETA demonstrated significant selectivity between branched C6 isomers (especially at low coverage), thereby suggesting a means of solving this difficult separation problem.",

In addition, the high rate of ion selectivity towards Na + and K + ions, together with lower rates for Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ions, indicate that the rate of ion selectivity is negatively correlated with the ionic potential of the ions. Such ion-exchange and ion selectivity result in a decrease in pore size and an increase in the surface area of the modified clinoptilolite relative to the natural form; this may possibly be related to the entrance of the ions into the mineral structure. It was concluded that clinoptilolite modified with exchangeable ions from aqueous solutions at two different normalities exhibits features which differ from those of natural clinoptilolite. Thus, modification of clinoptilolite by different cationic forms from aqueous solutions at different normalities might prove suitable for applications in other fields of study.",

The modified nylon fibres were monitored for their ability to remove copper(II) ions and dyes from aqueous solutions. Evidence for the grafting of MAA onto nylon was provided by weight uptake experiments and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The exchange capacity of MAA–nylon was evaluated by potentiometric titration of the grafted acidic groups. Due to complexation, the acidic grafted groups immobilize Cu(II) ions from Clark–Lub's buffered solution at a pH value of 8. The formation of a 1:1 complex was demonstrated by the values of the adsorption limits. The binary [Cu(II)/MAA–nylon] system was then tested for the adsorption of two Acid dyes, i.e. Acid Blue 25 (AB 25) and Calmagite (Calma), as ligands in the metal-coordinating process. The adsorption of Cu(II) onto MAA–nylon and of the dyes onto Cu(II)/MAA–nylon was followed spectrometrically. The observed stoichiometries of the ternary [dye/Cu(II)/MAA–nylon] complex formed were [[Formula: see text]] for AB 25 and [[Formula: see text]] for Calma at 20°C. Theoretical modelling of the adsorption process was performed employing the Langmuir, Freundlich and Jossen equations. Thermodynamic parameters such as the free energy change (ΔG 0 ), the enthalpy change (ΔH 0 ) and the entropy change (ΔS 0 ) for adsorption were also investigated. The adsorption process is exothermic, which leads to a reduction in the extent of dye adsorption with increasing temperature.",

The amounts of adsorbed polymer and the thickness of the polymer adsorption layer increase with increasing temperature. This is caused by conformational changes in the polymer macromolecules with increasing temperature, changing from a coiled structure at lower temperature to a more stretched structure at higher temperature. The free energies of the PAA segments adsorbed onto the CPG surface at 25°C were calculated from the adsorption data. Decreases in the charges on the surface and diffuse layers of CPG particles were observed in the presence of PAA.

The adsorption characteristics of both materials for both adsorptives were indistinguishable at low adsorption pressures independent of the adsorption temperature employed, suggesting similarities in parts of their porosity (i.e. excluding mesoporosity). We propose that, in addition to its well-acknowledged mesoporosity, MCM-41 includes considerable surface roughness and/or heterogeneities similar to that shown by microporous silica. This surface structure appears to have adsorption characteristics indistinguishable from classical microporosity, and may also be an important feature of this material which is very often not taken into consideration in most of its applications.",

    "abstract": "A laboratory experiment was performed to investigate the potential of biochar (BC) as an adsorbent for removing pymetrozine from aqueous solution. The adsorption data were well described by Langmuir isotherm, with maximum pymetrozine adsorption capacities of 13.8, 20.6, 11.0 and 18.8 mg g −1 for bush-, wheat straw-, peanut- and corn-derived BC in a single solution at 25 °C, respectively. The functional groups of BCs were –NH (1628.25 cm −1 ), –OH (3443.78 cm −1 ), –PO 4 (1089.2 cm −1 ) and –C–Cl (769.23 cm −1 ), which were responsible for binding pymetrozine. The adsorption capacity of BC was increased by 7.2–106.4% at different solution pH (1, 3, 5 and 7). The removal efficiency increased with the addition of BCs and over 70% pymetrozine removal was observed upon addition of up to 8 g l −1 . The rate of pymetrozine adsorption was fast, with 50–80% of the adsorption occurring in the first 120 minutes, followed by a much slower approach to equilibrium. The ΔG° values decreased (increasingly negative) from −165.3% to 235.9% at 298 K compared with 318 K for the adsorption of pymetrozine onto different BCs in a single solution. The study results indicate that plant residue- or agricultural waste-derived BC can act as an effective surface sorbent, but their ability to treat mixed waste streams needs to be carefully evaluated on an individual basis.",

    "abstract": "Activated carbon was impregnated with a copper salt and the surface of the resulting material then reduced either with hydrazine hydrate or by heat treatment under nitrogen at 925 °C. The adsorption of NO was carried out under dynamic conditions at ambient temperature on the samples obtained. To derive the mechanism of adsorption, the initial material and that exposed to NO were characterized using nitrogen adsorption, thermal analysis and potentiometric titration. The introduction of copper and reduction treatment had very positive effects on the amounts of NO retained on the surface. It is suggested that both copper particles and oxygen-containing groups on the carbon surface contribute to the reactive adsorption. Two different mechanisms are proposed to describe NO adsorption depending on the oxidation state of the copper particles. In the absence of reducing treatment, it is believed that NO is oxidized to NO 2 by copper oxide particles. This NO 2 either reacts with the carbon surface to oxidize it and generate oxygen-containing functional groups or reacts with reduced copper particles. Equally, after surface reduction, the metallic copper could activate oxygen which would then participate in the oxidation of NO into NO 2 . This NO 2 would either chemisorb onto copper in the form of the nitrate or react with the surface oxygen functional groups.",

Adsorption behaviour studies were conducted on the prepared MIP, the results of which showed that it has a porous and large surface area. In addition, the prepared MIP showed good adsorptive capacity and selectivity for dibenzothiophene; the adsorption equilibrium time was 180 minutes and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was 20.86 mg/g at 318 K. The adsorptive behaviour followed the Lagergren pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model. Thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic.

    "abstract": "Developing a suitable separation and purification procedure for multi-component gas mixtures is a ubiquitous problem. Very little is known experimentally about multi-component adsorption isotherms, yet these are crucially important for designing separation processes. Multi-component adsorption isotherms over a wide range of composition, pressure and temperature are virtually unknown. Adsorption onto zeolites is widely used in adsorptive separation processes due to the unique characteristics of its structural pores which may be “engineered” to permit adsorption to take place on the basis of molecular shape and size. In this article, we discuss the methodological development of rapidly obtaining multi-component adsorption isotherms using the interplay between the essentially exact (in the statistical mechanical sense) lattice model and configurational bias Monte Carlo simulations. The latter technique has the known capability of being able to reproduce experimental isotherms reliably, but can be very time consuming and expensive. In contrast, the lattice model adsorption isotherms can be parameterized by comparing with those obtained by Monte Carlo simulation and thereafter used to cheaply and rapidly explore a very wide range of mixture concentrations and conditions. The interactions required in the lattice model are effective interaction-free energies. This approach has been applied to the adsorption isotherms of selective binary and ternary mixtures of small alkanes (methane, ethane) and carbon dioxide adsorbed in silicalite. The lattice model results are shown to have the potential, when suitably parameterized, to rapidly and cheaply reproduce the main features of the much more expensive Monte Carlo isotherms over a very wide range of mixture compositions, temperatures and pressures.",

    "abstract": "Chitosan, a natural polymer obtained from the de-acetylation of chitin, has been extensively studied in adsorption applications because its amino and hydroxyl groups can act as chelation sites. However, this material is rarely used as an adsorbent, mainly because of mechanical strength limitations. A possible means of making its use viable is the immobilization of chitosan onto solid matrices using particle-coating techniques. Studies have shown that the use of immobilized chitosan not only improves the mechanical strength of the adsorbent, but also enhances its mass-transfer properties. In this context, the present study has investigated the adsorption application of chitosan coated onto glass beads in batch and dynamic systems for the removal of copper ions from aqueous solution. The adsorption equilibrium properties were measured at different temperatures (25, 40, 50 and 60 o C) and the Langmuir, Freundlich and Langmuir–Freundlich models were used to fit the equilibrium data. Kinetic studies showed that adsorption equilibrium was attained after 10 h. The pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models in both linear and non-linear forms together with the intra-particle diffusion model were used to fit the adsorption kinetics data. The best fit was obtained with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, thereby suggesting that the limiting factor to mass transfer was chemical adsorption. The results indicate that chitosan immobilized onto glass beads demonstrate a good adsorption performance, with similar or even better results relative to other chitosan-based materials. Dynamic adsorption studies using the coated beads in a fixed bed system demonstrated the viability of their use for wastewater treatment.",

When using different derivatives of methanol, the adsorption energies and charge transfer from the adsorbate to the BNNT depending on the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating capability of the subgroups within the derivatives. Subgroups with strong electron-withdrawing capability generally lead to transfer less charge and smaller adsorption energy. The calculated density of state shows that the electronic properties of the BNNT are only slightly changed by the chemical modification. However, preservation of the electronic properties of BNNTs coupled with the enhanced solubility suggests that chemical modification of BNNTs with either methanol or its derivatives may be an effective way for purification of the BNNTs.",

However, in the case of ethyl acetate, similar adsorption and desorption behaviours were observed on these two samples. The interaction between organic molecules and adsorbents was evaluated in terms of the affinity index. It was found that both SBA-15 and MCM-41 exhibited positive adsorption properties towards ethyl acetate but negative behaviours towards toluene. Compared to the MCM-41, the larger quantity of toluene retained by SBA-15 and the higher desorption temperature for toluene relative to MCM-41 were ascribed to the higher adsorption potential existing in the secondary pores of SBA-15.",

The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity at 25 °C of the organobentonite towards the removal of the compounds studied occurred at pH = 3 for MTB and NSA and at pH = 11 for MB. The experimental adsorption rate data were interpreted via a diffusional model that considered the external mass transport, intra-particle diffusion and adsorption onto an active site, intra-particle diffusion being considered as both pore volume and surface diffusion. The surface diffusion model fitted the experimental data quite well, thereby indicating that the overall rate of adsorption was controlled by surface diffusion. Furthermore, the surface diffusion coefficient increased by augmenting the mass of MB, MTB and NSA adsorbed at equilibrium. In addition, the surface diffusion model was used to interpret experimental data cited in the literature, thereby showing that surface diffusion plays an important role in the adsorption of organic compounds onto organoclays.",

Such chemical modification included grafting two different types of silanes onto the external surface and pores of γ-alumina, followed by chemical bonding of the alginate with the characteristic groups of the silane molecules involved.

For Enhanced Coal Bed Methane Recovery and carbon storage, coal swelling induced by gases adsorption may cause significant reservoir permeability change.

The Langmuir constant, coal density, solid elastic modulus, and Poisson’s ratio are required in this model. These model parameters are easily obtained through laboratory testing. The developed model is verified by available experimental data. The results show that the presented model shows good agreement with the experimental observations of swelling. The model errors are within 14% for pure gas, and within 20% for mixed gas. It is shown that this model is able to describe coal swelling phenomena for full pressure range and different gas type including pure gas and mixed. In addition, it is also shown that the errors of the presented model and the Pan’s model are almost the same, but the presented model is solved more easily.",

Adsorption equilibrium, kinetics of CO adsorption and the competitive adsorption of CO/H 2 O (V) within MIL-100(Fe) were evaluated. Results show that the unsaturated Fe(II) can enhance the adsorption amount of CO on MIL-100(Fe). The adsorbed amount of CO on MIL-100(Fe) was 2.56 mmol/g at 298 K and 10 bar with isosteric adsorption heat of 28.31–38.43 kJ/mol. MIL-100(Fe) had two kinds of adsorption sites with desorption activation energy of 53.38 and 109.5 kJ/mol for CO, respectively. The diffusion coefficient of CO through MIL-100(Fe) was approximately 2.85 times higher than that of water vapour (10.54 × 10 −16 cm 2 /s vs. 2.735 × 10 −16 cm 2 /s). The working adsorption amount of CO at 40% relative humidity was approximately 0.631 mmol/g, retaining 75% of the original adsorption amount, indicating that CO is more competitive than H 2 O on the surface of MIL-100(Fe) under humid conditions.",

A procedure based on the model of polydentate binding is recommended as a tool for detection and quantitative characterization of these effects. This procedure allows one to find objective estimations of effective sorption capacities and constants of adsorption equilibria. In this study, adsorption of small probes by two hybrid silica–organic materials has been studied. Ormosil with immobilized n-propylamine was probed with H+ ions, and in addition, CoCl2 adsorption from solutions of ethanol by silica chemically modified with 3-n-propyltrimethoxysilane-1-methylimidazolium chloride was also investigated. In both cases, the model of bidentate binding properly fitted the experimental data. This made it possible to determine the quantitative characteristics of adsorption equilibria and to arrive at conclusions on the cooperativity effects. Negative cooperativity effects are significant in adsorption of H+ ions, while strong positive cooperativity affects CoCl2 binding.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of nickel, cerium, molybdenum and cobalt oxides impregnated on silica–alumina in removing nitrogen and sulphur compounds from a hydrotreated diesel. The incorporation of metal oxides increased the density of acid sites and promoted the removal of nitrogen and sulphur compounds, especially the one impregnated with molybdenum oxide. The influence of molybdenum oxide loading was also studied. It was observed that this synthesis parameter affected acid sites density and contaminant removal.",

The profiles of Q st describe the heterogeneity of the zeolite surface. Zeolites with narrower pore channel (2.6 ∞ 5.7 Å) exhibit higher initial Q st values than zeolites with wide pore channel (7.4 ∞ 7.4 Å), because of the strong dispersion interaction between hydrogen molecules and the surface of the pore channel. Li-exchanged zeolites exhibit high initial Q st values; however, the 6-membered ring zeolite frameworks adsorb less hydrogen at 77 K and 0.1 MPa than Na-exchanged zeolites, because Li cations, unlike larger Na cations, can penetrate the ring, and thus become less accessible to hydrogen molecules. The enhancement of hydrogen uptake for Li-exchanged zeolites correlates with the amount of Li + .",

The proposed method involves combined volumetric/manometric and dynamic measurements, namely, observations of the frequency of small adiabatic oscillations of the adsorptive gas in equilibrium with the adsorbed phase or adsorbate. The oscillations of the adsorptive gas are initiated by small oscillations of a sphere or a cylinder positioned in a vertical tube above the vessel containing the gas and adsorbents [reversion of experiment by Rüchardt (1929), Flammersfeld (1972), Keller (2014)]. Experiments show that adsorbates have two different phases consisting, respectively, of molecules which are only weakly bound to adsorbent's atoms so that they can participate in the low-frequency gas oscillations (&lt;10 Hz) and other molecules that are strongly bound to adsorbent's atoms so they are ‘stiff’, that is, cannot participate in the gas oscillations, with eigenfrequencies being in the range of 10 10 –10 12 Hz. The theory of these measurements will be presented and data of adsorption equilibria of He, N 2 , Ar and CO 2 on activated carbon BAX 1100 and zeolite KÖSTROLITH 4ABFK at near ambient conditions will be given and discussed to a certain extent.",

With the use of suspension–emulsion polymerization, microspheres with different degrees of cross-linking were prepared. Their chemical modification involved several steps: at the beginning, the epoxide ring was opened using sodium cyclopentadienide; in the next step, materials with grafted cyclopentadiene fragments were then subjected to Diels–Alder reaction with maleic anhydride; in the last step, the anhydride groups were turned into carboxylic groups. To confirm the attachment of cyclopentadiene to the microspheres surface, the material obtained was treated with fluorescence marker N-(1-pyrene) maleimide. The resulting material has fluorescent properties in the UV wavelength of 366 nm. Moreover, to confirm the chemical structure of modified materials, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis was performed. Thermal stability in inert atmosphere of prepared microspheres was determined. It was found that chemical modification of the microspheres surface improves their thermal resistance. On the basis of this study, it can be assumed that the Diels–Alder reaction is an expedient tool to obtain microspheres having carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, which can be an interesting option as stationary phases in chromatography.",

Doped solid specimens were prepared by treating Al(OH) 3 samples with known amounts of LiNO 3 dissolved in the minimum amount of distilled water prior to mixing with CrO 3 . Dopant concentrations of 0.75, 1.50, 3.00 and 6.00 mol% Li 2 O were employed. The surface and catalytic properties of the pure and doped solids thus prepared were investigated using nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and studies of the catalysis of CO oxidation by O 2 over the solid specimens at 300–400°C. The results of such studies showed that Li 2 O doping followed by calcination at 700°C led to a maximum increase in the specific surface area, S BET , of 26% for AlCr-I and of 55% for AlCr-II when these samples were doped with 3.00 mol% Li 2 O. The reverse effect was found when the calcination temperature was increased to 800°C, where a decrease of 34% in the S BET value of the AlCr-II sample doped with 3.00 mol% Li 2 O was detected. The catalytic activities measured at 350°C over the pure and doped solids decreased on increasing the dopant concentration, the maximum decrease in such activity being ca. 33% and 50%, respectively, for the AlCr-I and AlCr-II samples calcined at 700°C. Doping led to noticable changes in the magnitude of the activation energy for the catalytic reaction. Such changes were accompanied by parallel changes in the value of the pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius equation. These results may indicate that Li 2 O doping has no effect on the mechanism of the catalytic reaction but modifies (decreases) the concentration of catalytically active sites taking part in chemisorption during the catalysis of CO oxidation by O 2 .",

    "abstract": "Activated carbons were prepared by carbonizing ground apricot stones impregnated with 20–60 wt% phosphoric acid at 300–600°C, in a limited air supply. Highly activated carbons with surface areas amounting to 1200 m 2 /g and pore radii of 8–10 Å were obtained when a mixture of apricot stones and 50 wt% phosphoric acid was carbonized at 450°C. Activation with phosphoric acid proceeds via the creation of pores of radii between 8 Å and 10 Å. The adsorption data for nitrogen at 77 K obey models based on surface coverage satisfactorily and also models based on pore volume filling. Although a slight upward deviation was shown in the Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) plots, this model was still verified and allowed the determination of useful sorption parameters.",

    "abstract": "The BJH equation, [Formula: see text], used for pore structure analyses via its application to the N 2 desorption isotherms at 78 K of porous materials, has been modified by substituting the value of c i and expanding the last term. The quantity v n is the volume of the pores involved in the nth desorption step and is given in terms of the volume of N 2 , (ΔV) n , exuded from the porous material, the constants R n and c i which depend on the average pore size and average thickness of the physically adsorbed multilayer, Δt n being the decrease in thickness of the multilayer as a result of the nth desorption step and A i the surface area of the set of pores involved in the ith desorption step. A derivation of the modified equation is presented. It has been applied to the N 2 desorption data of bone char used by Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH). The effect of the multilayer thickness (t) values given by Pierce and de Boer on the pore size distribution of bone char has been studied. The pore size distribution data are compared with those obtained by the original BJH and Pierce methods. The pore system conforms very well with the idealised open-ended cylindrical pore model. The expanded BJH equation has also been applied to the desorption isotherms of fresh and sintered silica-alumina cracking catalysts over the entire range of silica/alumina ratios. The multilayer thickness (t) values given by de Boer have been used in the calculations. The pore systems of the catalysts, vacuum-dried at 400°C, are observed to conform to the cylindrical pore model as revealed by the excellent agreement between the cumulative surface areas obtained in P.S.D. calculations and the BET surface areas. The pore systems of the catalysts, sintered at different temperatures in a dry oxygen stream, deviate considerably from the cylindrical pore model. Enlargement of the pores and their nonconformity with the ideal pore model are attributed to modifications of the pore structures brought about by the phenomenon known as ‘self-steaming’ with the water vapour released from the catalysts.",

The measured equilibrium adsorption isotherms for the surfactant-free and surfactant/soil/water systems at different critical micellar concentrations were S-shaped and in close agreement to the Freundlich isotherms. Higher adsorption of carbofuran in both systems was observed on silt loam soil followed by loam and sandy soils, and was anticipated by the values obtained for the Freundlich constant, K F , and the partition coefficient, K D . The values of K F and K D obtained also confirmed that the adsorption of carbofuran in aqueous surfactant solutions followed the order cationic &gt; nonionic &gt; anionic at all the CMC values studied. The affinity of carbofuran towards organic matter and the clay content of the soils was evaluated by calculating the K om and K c values, when it was found that carbofuran adsorption was better correlated with the clay content than with the organic matter content. The predicted log K om values were also obtained from the aqueous solubility, 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (K ow ), adsorbability index (Al) and first-order molecular connectivity index ( 1 χ) of carbofuran. Use of the aqueous solubility and the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient of carbofuran to predict the adsorption gave values with a considerable error in comparison with those measured experimentally, whereas the use of the absorbability index and first-order molecular connectivity index for carbofuran improved the predictions considerably. The results obtained are interesting in that they afford basic data relating to the possible use of surfactants for solving problems of soil contamination by carbofuran.",

The pure solids were prepared by wet impregnation of finely powdered solid Al(OH) 3 which had been precalcined at 400°C; the resulting material was then dried and calcined at 500°C with copper nitrate dissolved in the least amount of distilled water. The amount of copper oxide in such solids was fixed at 13.5 wt% while the amounts of Li 2 O added varied between 0.19 wt% and 3.80 wt%. The results obtained showed that such Li 2 O doping enhanced the crystallization of the CuO phase to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant added and increased the concentration of surface OH groups. This treatment led to a progressive small increase in the BET surface areas (S BET ) of the treated solids, which attained a maximum limit at 0.76 wt% Li 2 O but decreased upon increasing the dopant concentration above this limit. The addition of 0.76 wt% Li 2 O effected an increase of 14.6% in the S BET values of the treated solids while the addition of 3.80 wt% Li 2 O led to a corresponding decrease of 38.5% in this value. Doping with Li 2 O resulted in a progressive decrease in the catalytic activity of the solids towards CO oxidation by O 2 while the presence of 3.80 wt% Li 2 O effected a decrease of 72.5% in the value of the reaction rate constant measured at 175°C. In contrast, such treatment of CuO/Al 2 O 3 solids with Li 2 O brought about a progressive increase in their catalytic activity towards H 2 O 2 decomposition, which reached a maximum limit in the presence of 1.90 wt% Li 2 O and then decreased when the amount of Li 2 O added was increased above this limit, falling to values which were smaller than those measured for the pure catalyst samples. The doping process did not modify the activation energy of the catalyzed H 2 O 2 reaction but modified the concentration of the catalytically active constituent present in the system.",

Modified alumina experienced a general weakening of its initial Lewis acid centres on loading with Li + ions. These ions did not act as new Lewis-type acid centres even on high loading. Under these circumstances, in addition to lithium aluminate, they might generate a lithium oxide-type layer or clusters capable of behaving as new basic species forming lithium carbonates upon adsorption of CO 2 .

The extent of adsorption under these conditions rarely reaches a saturation value (q max ) and in general the gradient dq/dp is not zero.

The first-order uptake of Hg(II) ions conformed to the Freundlich and Dubinin and Radushkevich (D–R) isotherms over the entire adsorptive concentration range (10 −7 –10 −2 M), whereas the Langmuir isotherm was followed only at moderate concentrations.

The radiation stability of polyaniline was also investigated by exposing it to an 11.1 GBq (Ra/Be) source associated with a γ-dose of 1.72 Gy/h. Irradiation had practically no significant effect on the adsorption capacity of polyaniline.

    "abstract": "As a conservative technology, ion exchange allows the removal and recycling of metals from liquid effluents. A process was applied for the removal of chromium(III) from wastewaters by ion exchange. This process was based on a weakly acidic cation-exchange resin (Amberlite IRC 86) capable of removing chromium(III) from the effluent, followed by selective separation and recovery during a regeneration procedure. Because of the difficult regeneration behaviour of the metal form of the carboxylate resin, special emphasis was given to the regeneration step of the resin where most of the practical problems were found. Five different regeneration procedures were adopted: elution with 1 M NaOH; elution with 1 M H 2 SO 4 ; elution with 1 M NaOH followed by 1 M H 2 SO 4 or vice versa; elution with NaOH followed by 1 M H 2 SO 4 /Na 2 SO 4 solution; and elution with alkaline H 2 O 2 /NaOH solutions followed by 1 M H 2 SO 4 . A non-conventional regenerant solution such as hydrogen peroxide in an alkaline medium seemed very promising. The anionic species formed (chromate) was eluted quantitatively from the cation-exchange resin and separated. The regeneration efficiency of chromium(III) was 89.5%. Influent chromium concentrations employed during the tanning process used in the leather industry were also considered. For this purpose, influent concentrations in the range 60–100 mg/l, service flow rates of 10 and 20 l/h and appropriate retention times were selected and experiments undertaken in a column system. The exhaustion step was carried out at 250 l/h with the recovery of chromium being 95.6%. The ion-exchange capacity of Amberlite IRC 86 was found to be 1.28 equiv/l. This study undertaken under laboratory conditions demonstrated that Amberlite IRC 86 resin was suitable for the removal of chromium(III) from wastewater.",

At low concentrations, the amounts of BTEA exchanged did not reach the value of the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of the bentonite. To obtain full displacement, it was necessary to add an amount of BTEA four-times greater than the CEC. Synthesized organobentonites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, particlesizeanalysis and infrared spectroscopy. The basal spacings of the organobentonites increased slightly with increasing amounts of BTEA cations. Particle-size analyses of the original bentonite and organobentonites showed that the organobentonites contained a greater number of coarse particles than present in the original bentonite. Toluene and xylenes were used as solutes to determine the adsorption properties of the BTEA–bentonites.

The dimensions of the particle aggregates and the crystalline particles were altered as a consequence of the thermal decomposition of CuC 2 O 4 • 0.5H 2 O to CuO, and this led to an increase of ca. 1.5-times in the specific surface of the CuO obtained relative to that of the initial substance.

A finite increase in the volume of the intra-crystallite pores in CuO was also observed, although this did not change the average size of the intra-crystallite pores in the oxide obtained nor the character of the pore-size distribution with respect to the starting material. In addition, as a result of the thermal decomposition of CuC 2 O 4 • 0.5H 2 O, the mesoporosity of the prepared oxide also developed.

In particular the influence of fluid–solid interactions on the transport coefficient is examined, showing that such interactions reduce the value of the coefficient by almost an order of magnitude in comparison to the Knudsen theory for non-interacting systems. The activation energy and potential energy barriers for diffusion in smooth pores with a one-dimensional potential energy profile are also discussed, indicating the inadequacy of the commonly used assumption of proportionality between the activation energy and heat of adsorption or the minimum pore potential energy. A further feature affected by fluid–solid interactions is the nature of the reflection of fluid molecules colliding with a pore wall surface, varying from being nearly specular — such as in carbon nanotubes — to nearly diffuse for amorphous solids. Diffuse reflection leads to momentum loss and reduced transport coefficients. However, fluid–solid interactions do not affect the transport coefficient in the single-file diffusion regime when the surface reflection is diffuse, and the transport coefficient in this case is largely independent of the adsorbed density.",

The hydrotalcite aged by autoclaving under microwave irradiation at a higher temperature (453 K) and for a longer time (120 min) exhibited a higher surface area and a higher basicity than the hydrotalcites aged by refluxing under microwave irradiation or by traditional refluxing. This can be explained by the generation of surface-defective sites accompanied by a loss of aluminium due to the effect of microwave irradiation. However, after calcination, high-area mixed oxides obtained from hydrotalcites aged by refluxing under microwave irradiation exhibited a higher basicity per square metre than those obtained from hydrotalcites aged under more drastic conditions. For the hydrotalcites aged under microwave irradiation, this may be related to the surface characteristics of the amorphous alumina generated during calcination. The sample with the lowest amount of alumina was that obtained from the hydrotalcite which had been aged at a higher temperature and for a longer time.",

This allowed the simultaneous interpretation of the surface potential, electrokinetic potential and adsorption data for the adsorption of oxalic acid onto a hematite surface. Based on the Surface Complexation Model, this interpretation suggested that the oxalate ion is bound to a metal ion at the solid surface to form a singly-charged oxalate-surface complex, with the charge being exposed to the potential at the outer Helmholtz layer. A number of equilibrium parameters describing the interfacial equilibrium were obtained. Thus, for the two protonation steps of the surface sites, the thermodynamic equilibrium constants were log K 1 = 7.1 ± 0.4 and log K 2 = 5.2 ± 0.4, respectively. Two assumptions were tested with regard to the adsorption equilibrium constant, i.e. the charge of the surface complex is exposed to the inner surface potential, ψ 0 , or to the outer surface potential, ψ d . The constancy of the interfacial equilibrium constants led to the conclusion the latter assumption was the more appropriate. The observed value of the adsorption equilibrium constant was log K ads = 3.0 ± 0.8. It was shown that measurement of the surface potential by Single Crystal Electrodes is a helpful tool in elucidating the equilibrium behaviour of the complex at the interface.",

This was achieved by impregnating and immobilizing DtBuCH18C6 and 1-octanol molecules in the pores of macroporous SiO 2 -P particles possessing a mean pore diameter of 50 μm. The adsorption of some fission and non-fission products contained in highly active liquid waste (HLW) such as Ru(III), Mo(VI), Pd(II), Na(I), K(I), Cs(I), Sr(II), Ba(II), La(III) and Y(III) onto (DtBuCH18C6 + Oct)/SiO 2 -P was investigated at 298 K. The effects of contact time and HNO 3 concentration within the range 0.1–5.0 M were examined. Increasing the HNO 3 concentration from 0.1 M to 2.0 M led to a significant increase in the adsorption of Sr(II), followed by a decrease when the HNO 3 concentration was increased further to 5.0 M. The optimum concentration of HNO 3 in the adsorption of Sr(II) onto (DtBuCH18C6 + Oct)/SiO 2 -P was determined as 2.0 M. For the other ions examined with the exception of Ba(II), very weak or almost non-existent adsorption capacities were observed at all HNO 3 concentrations.

Significant reduction of TOC leaching from the macroporous silica-based DtBuCH18C6-impregnated polymeric composite was achieved in 2.0 M HNO 3 .

Molecularly-imprinted calcium phosphate/calcium alginate composite microspheres (CP/CA MICMs) were then prepared by surface imprinting using CP/CA CMs as the supporting matrix, ethylene tri(β-methoxy)ethoxysilane (A-172) and γ-amidopropyltriethoxysilane (KH-550) as the functional monomers and crosslinking agents, respectively, and Methyl Orange as the template in aqueous solution. The CP/CA MICMs and non-imprinted composite microspheres (NICMs) were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and optical microscopy. The adsorption behaviour of the CP/CA MICMs and NICMs were determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The results indicated that molecular imprinting occurs via the crosslinking of silanes on the surface of the CP/CA CMs, and that CP/CA MICMs possess an adsorption capacity which exhibits greater selectivity. A schematic representation of the imprinting and recognition process of CA/CP MICMs by surface imprinting via silane crosslinking was presented.",

    "abstract": "Corn stover (CS) is mainly composed of three parts: pith (CSP), rind (CSR), and leaf (CSL). These parts have different lignocellulosic constituents and structural properties. Herein, biosorbents derived from individual corn stover constituents were prepared in an effort to determine the significance of each constituent for multipollutant removal. In this study, SEM, BET, XRD, FTIR, XPS, fibre composition, and contact angle measurements were used to characterize and analyse the physical and chemical properties of the three components of CS and to study their adsorption effects, adsorption isotherms, and kinetics. The lignocellulosic compositions of CSP and CSR were similar, the cellulose content in CSP and CSR was significantly higher than that in CSL, and the hemicellulose content of CSL was much higher than those of CSP and CSR. The minimum lignin content was found in CSP, and the maximum lignin content was found in CSR. The results show that each component had a certain adsorption effect on typical organic pollutants (antibiotics, oils, and dyes). CSP had the strongest oil adsorption capacity, CSR was more suitable for adsorbing antibiotics, and CSL had outstanding adsorption capacity for dye. The pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model could describe the adsorption processes well, and they consisted of monolayer adsorption accompanied by chemical adsorption reactions. The focus of this study was to provide references for selecting effective adsorbent precursors to remove organic pollutants from wastewater.",

    "abstract": "In this investigation, the possibility of wood waste (hardwoods such as oaks’ and alternatives’ staves from Balkan cooperage) revalorization for simultaneous cadmium removal and wastewater disinfection was examined. All samples were characterized in terms of their crystallinity index and crystallite size, amount of functional groups, and surface chemistry (determined by ATR-FTIR) as well as antibacterial activity. Mulberry is characterized by the lowest crystallinity index which can be ascribed to the highest crystallite size disabling crystallite denser packaging, while myrobalan plum has about 23% lower crystallite size that enables crystallite better packaging, thus resulting in a 42.4% higher crystallinity index compared to the mulberry. All oaks have a significantly higher amount of carboxyl groups compared to the alternatives (0.23-0.28 vs. 0.12-0.19 mmol/g). The adsorption experiments revealed that with increasing the initial cadmium concentration from 15 up to 55 mg/g, samples’ adsorption capacity increases by 89-220%. The equilibrium data fit well with the Langmuir isotherm model implying monolayer coverage of cadmium ions over a homogeneous wood surface. The relationship between the samples’ maximum adsorption capacities (ranged from 5.726 to 12.618 mg/g), their crystallinity index, and crystallite size was established. According to ATR-FTIR spectra, aldehyde, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and phenyl groups present on the wood waste surface are involved in Cd 2+ adsorption which proceeds via the interplay of the complexation, cation- π interactions, and ion-exchange mechanisms. Mulberry and myrobalan plum showed about 89% and 80% of the total uptake capacity of cadmium within 60 min, while the equilibrium was attained after 240 min of contact time. Good compliance with pseudo-second kinetic order indicated that cadmium adsorption was mediated by chemical forces. Thermodynamic parameters revealed the spontaneous and exothermic character of cadmium ion adsorption onto mulberry and myrobalan plum. All studied samples provide maximum bacterial reduction (&gt;99%) for E. coli and S. aureus. Wood waste from Balkan cooperage can be successfully used for simultaneous cadmium removal and wastewater disinfection.",

Montmorillonite decreases the affinity of LAP to the substrate ([Formula: see text]), while kaolinite increases the affinity of LAP to the substrate.

These quantities can be calculated from the intercept (A) and slope (B) of a linear fit to the elapsed time as a function of the logarithm of the ratio of the adsorbate concentration (C 0 – C x )/C x based on the breakthrough curve. Because k ν varies with the flow rate (F), numerous measurements at different values of F were performed to find the appropriate value of k ν . One relatively simple method for calculating k ν directly from the WJ equation is presented and the physical meaning of A and B revealed. The key factors that lead to a simplified calculation of k ν are the ratio of the breakthrough time to the equilibrium time (t 0.05 /t 0.50 ) and the ratio of the equilibrium time to the saturation time (t 0.50 /t 0.95 ), both of which remain nearly constant for different values of F, concentration and temperature. Knowledge of k ν , A and B, and their relationships, are very helpful for predicting the breakthrough behaviour of packed bed adsorbents using the WJ equation.",

The adsorbed state of ethyl acetate was studied using nitrogen adsorption at 77 K after the pre-adsorption of ethyl acetate. The adsorption isotherms of ethyl acetate were of Type I in the IUPAC classification, suggesting micropore filling by ethyl acetate molecules. The micropore volume of the activated carbon as evaluated from ethyl acetate adsorption using the liquid density of ethyl acetate agreed well with that from nitrogen adsorption. Nitrogen adsorption after pre-adsorption of ethyl acetate indicated considerably packed molecular states of ethyl acetate molecules within the micropores. Thus, ethyl acetate molecules can migrate to the deeper parts of micropores in the case of static adsorption measurements. However, the specific surface area evaluated from ethyl acetate adsorption was nearly 40% smaller than that from nitrogen adsorption under the assumption of an isotropic structure. The assumption of a highly orientated adsorption structure for ethyl acetate molecules on the pore wall led to a good correlation even as far as the surface area was concerned. In addition, 26 kJ/mol of the excess stabilization energy determined from the temperature dependence of the ethyl acetate adsorption isotherm supports the favourable molecular alignment of ethyl acetate molecules which increases the molecule–pore wall interactions.",

In this study, a novel adsorbent with good adsorption properties [Al 3+ –oligomer–pillared diatomite (Al 3+ –oligomer–PD)] was prepared and was used to adsorb Cd 2+ ions in a solid/liquid system. The property and nature of the Cd 2+ ions adsorbed on the surface of the Al 3+ –oligomer–PD were studied by performing a series of adsorption tests and related surface property analyses. Our study results show that owing to a more favourable pore structure, the PD has a higher adsorption property compared with natural diatomite (ND) and most other common adsorbents. The adsorption capacity of PD is 27.36% greater than ND and also achieves an optimal value of 10.05 mg/l. Certain parameters have a significant effect on Cd 2+ ion adsorption. The most suitable isotherm and kinetics models for describing the adsorption of Cd 2+ ions are the Freundlich and pseudo-second-order models. The nature of Cd 2+ ion adsorption on PD is favourable, physical, spontaneous, exothermic and disorder increasing. The results of the study suggest that PD is an ideal adsorbent for the removal of cadmium ions from aqueous solutions.",

The synthesized MSn copolymer was characterized by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The ability of MSn to disperse iron(III) increased as the value of n increased from 5 to 13; however, the ethylene oxide chain in MS20 was so long that the molecule readily curled and hence its dispersion capability towards iron(III) decreased. It was also shown that MS13 exhibited the best dispersion activity towards iron(III), with ca. 28% light transmittance being achieved when the dosage of MS13 was 10 mg/ℓ. The proposed dispersion suggests the formation of a core–shell superstructure, with interactions between various kinds of iron ions and the side-chain oxygen atoms of ethylene oxide being the principal means whereby iron(III) may be dispersed in cooling water systems.",

SBA-15 was also studied for comparative purposes. Characterisation by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy confirmed the characteristic spheroid cell structure of the MCF pores. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K revealed the different pore structural parameters of the MCF, viz. pore volume (1.8–2.4 cm 3 /g), cell size (24.6–28.5 nm) and window size (11.3–17.3 nm), as obtained by the NLDFT method. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms and the kinetic adsorption data for BSA at 298 K and pH 5 were well fitted by the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. The results showed that adsorption onto the material possessing a window size of 11.3 nm was mostly restricted to the external surface, while a considerable increase in the maximum adsorption capacity from 120 mg/g to 500–600 mg/g was observed when the window size was above the critical dimension of 13.9 nm. In the latter cases, the maximum adsorption capacities could be related to the pore volume rather than to the total surface area. The confined BSA molecules were strongly immobilised in the cells, since only a small proportion was desorbed from the material with windows of 17.3 nm dimensions on contact with a buffer solution of pH 7.",

Our results showed that weakly acidic pH (∼5.0) favoured the adsorption of phosphates, which attained equilibrium within 180 min. The interactions followed second-order kinetics. Our data fitted well with linear isotherm models. A part of the phosphate interacts chemically with kaolinite, while some amount may be weakly held. Experiments at 303, 313, 323 and 333 K showed that the interactions are exothermic, with decreasing entropy and Gibbs' energy.

Reagent-grade ZnCl 2 and FeCl 3 ·6H 2 O solutions were mixed with deionized water to prepare the feed solutions with total ion concentrations in the range of 0.5–5.0 meq/ℓ.

Results of our analysis revealed that NaY zeolite has a higher affinity for Zn 2+ than Fe 3+ ions. The equilibrium data were best fit to the Langmuir-type model. Zn 2+ ions are removed through an ion-exchange process while the Fe 3+ ions may be preferentially adsorbed onto the already exchanged zeolitic sites. This equilibrium model was then applied to a dynamic mathematical model. We describe the equilibrium in this model by assuming the binary Langmuir-type model and mass transfer in the zeolite based on the linear driving force model.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the adsorption behavior of manganese oxide nanowires as an adsorbent for the removal of dissolved toluene from underground water. The nanowire membrane, composed of three-dimensional porous nanostructures plus superhydrophobic character, is very suitable for removal of the hydrophobic molecules. The effects of adsorbent dose, contact time, initial solution concentration, pH, salinity, and recyclability on the uptake of toluene by the adsorbent in batch mode are examined. The adsorption data compared to the adsorption of two kinds of activated carbons show that manganese oxide nanowire is competitive to activated carbons. Furthermore, the equilibrium data are fitted to different types of adsorption isotherms. Freundlich isotherm model illustrated the best fit to the data. The results of this study suggest that nanowires of manganese oxides can be used as a low cost, highly efficient adsorbent for the removal of dissolved hydrocarbon from aqueous solution.",

    "abstract": "The pore size distribution of activated carbon is conventionally characterized with nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K. The adsorption isotherms are commonly analyzed with a nonlocal density functional theory in combination with a mathematical model for the pore size and geometry. While nonlocal density functional theory is significantly more accurate than the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller theory for gas adsorption, its application to materials characterization is mostly based on a mean-field approximation for van der Waals attractions that is only qualitative in comparison with alternative versions of nonlocal density functional theory or molecular simulations. Toward development of a more reliable theoretical procedure, we compare mean-field approximation-nonlocal density functional theory with three recent versions of non-mean-field methods for gas adsorption at conditions corresponding to experiments for porous materials characterization. The potential applicability of different nonlocal density functional theory methods for pore size distribution predictions is evaluated in terms of the theoretical error bound scale analysis. We find that the weight density approximation is the most reliable for predicting the pore size distribution of amorphous porous materials. In addition to accurate isotherm, weight density approximation yields the theoretical error bound scale for pore size distribution prediction nearly 10 4 times narrower than that corresponding to mean-field approximation. The new theoretical procedure has been used to analyze the pore size distribution of four activated carbon samples and to predict the adsorption capacities of these materials.",

The maximum adsorption efficiencies of APTES coated micro/nanoparticles for MO and XO dye molecules were calculated to be around 98% and 75%, respectively. The adsorption behavior of the LCFA against dyes is also assessed by investigating the effect of adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH, and temperature. The optimum dye removal was observed at a pH of 4.0, and the equilibrium was achieved within 5 min.

This value is approximately 3 − 5 times higher than the similar adsorbent in the literature.

    "abstract": "In current history, adding nanoscale and micron-sized filler materials to composite materials for fabrication has been a popular approach for improving the composite’s mechanical characteristics. Due to their lower friction coefficient, excellent mechanical strength modulus, and low moisture uptake, filler-based hybrid composite materials are replacing metallic materials. Glass/Dharbai hybrid composites with nano-SiO 2 fillers have been created in this study. After manufacture, the composite materials were treated with liquid nitrogen at 177 K for various durations. Every sample material was cut according to ASTM standards to investigate mechanical features such as ILSS, impact test, and flexural strength. The broken composite specimen was studied using a scanning electron microscope. Water retention studies have been conducted under two distinct liquid solutions: tab or regular water and seawater. ILSS, flexural strength, and water retention were all greater in 4 wt.% of nanofiller-rich composites than in ordinary composites. Compared to 30 minutes, the 15-minute cryo-treated specimens provide the highest mechanical strength. On the other hand, the automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding sectors would benefit from a nanofiller-based composite.",

The HF adsorption isotherms on zeolite 3A were well described by the Dubinin–Astakhov (DA) model. The isosteric heat of HF adsorption was calculated based on the DA model and Clausius–Clapeyron equation, and different kinetic models were used to analyze the HF adsorption kinetic. The results showed HF adsorption isotherms are type I of the IUPAC classification. The maximum adsorption capacities by the DA model are 0.443–0.5631 mg/g. The [Formula: see text] values decrease with increasing surface loading indicating the surface energy heterogeneity of zeolite 3A. The HF adsorption kinetics on zeolite 3A follows simple first-order kinetics. The calculated film diffusion parameter [Formula: see text] values show nonlinear characteristics with time. The order of magnitude of interparticle HF diffusion coefficient [Formula: see text] is 10 −9 m 2 /s. The higher pressure and temperature are in favour of HF diffusion. The intraparticle diffusion curves for HF adsorption on zeolite 3A show quart-linear characteristics, indicating the presence of four consecutive HF adsorption steps including film diffusion, interparticle diffusion, intraparticle diffusion, and surface adsorption. The intraparticle diffusion is a rate-controlling stage.",

    "abstract": "Water hyacinth ( Eichhornia crassipes) is a wild floating plant that can be found widely in pond or river areas. The plant grows fiercely and causes many harmful issues to the ecosystem around its covered area. This work provides a utilization method that converts wild water hyacinth to reliable magnetic biochar which can be used as a very effective adsorbent for the removal of lead ion Pb(II) in industrial wastewater. The mentioned magnetic biochar can be prepared via a modified pyrolysis process at 550°C with the support of cobalt sulfates as magnetite precursors and limited oxygen from the sweeping gas (the gas mixture ratio is 4 : 1 nitrogen/oxygen). The produced samples were hydrophobic biochar with high oxygen-containing functional groups that are suitable for the removal of inorganic contaminants. The impregnation of cobalt (II, III) oxides provided high magnetic separation performance and additional adsorption sites on the produced magnetic biochar. As indicated by the obtained result, the WHB-Co2M sample possesses a highly porous structure (0.126 cc/g), higher thermal stability (thermal durability reaches 900°C), relatively stable magnetic properties (14.74 emu/g), and a larger surface area (192 m 2 /g). These beneficial properties led to its suitability to serve as an adsorbent in removing lead ions in the contaminated effluent, recording 95% of removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of 67.815 mg/g. As indicated in the result, all prepared magnetic biochar samples were fitted to two-parameter (Langmuir models) and three-parameter (Sips model) isotherm models. Therefore, the adsorption process in this work could be carried out on both homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces. The adsorption kinetics of the removal process also was described by the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Elovich models to reveal the adsorption and desorption rate of the as-prepared magnetic biochar. This work indicates a successful waste refinery route of converting lignocellulosic biomass such as water hyacinth into value-added material for use as promising heavy metal adsorbents.",

Crosslinked polymers (CPs) are a type of porous materials that have a variety of potential applications. Because of simple methods of modification of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), the crosslinked PMMA considers the most commonly polymeric adsorbents. A new crosslinked melamine-based polymethyl methacrylate (C-PMMA/Mel) was prepared via a polycondensation reaction between PMMA and melamine used as a crosslinking agent. Different characterization methods were carried out to investigate the molecular structures, thermal stability, and morphology. C-PMMA/Mel was applied for the adsorption behavior toward different metal cations and detected a selective to Pb(II). The evaluation of the new polymers as adsorbent against Pb(II) ion was studied using the contact time, adsorbent dose, initial concentration, and effects of pH. The adsorption efficiency of heavy metals was improved in the presence of melamine in polymeric matrix. The C-PMMA/Mel has high efficacy in the removal of ~94% of Pb at pH 6 for one hour. Noticeably, the adsorption performance of C-PMMA/Mel perfectly suited with Freundlich isotherm and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Additionally, the new materials showed no obvious loss in Pb(II) removal after 7 cycles.",

Due to its good characteristics, perovskites are used in solar photovoltaic power generation, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, photocatalysis, and sensors and many other fields. Considering the wide application of perovskites and the study of potential bifunctional devices, the application of perovskites in energy storage devices is relatively small, and a small number of studies focus on organic-inorganic hybrid lead-halide perovskites. However, the related energy storage research on all-inorganic lead-halide perovskites with better stability, which has also been widely concerned, is very scarce. And nontoxic all-inorganic nonperovskite has zero research in energy storage. Based on the above situation, this paper selects the lead-free perovskite Cs2AgSbCl6, and two lead halide perovskites with different dimensions, -0-dimensional Cs4PbBr6 and 3-dimensional CsPbBr3, these three all-inorganic perovskites.

The scanning electron microscopic examination for both PSU/GNP and PSU/CNT composites illustrates good interfacial bonded PSU structure with the uniform distribution of GNP and CNT nanofillers. Due to the effect of percolation, the thermal adsorption characteristics and heat storage of PSU nanocomposite were increased progressively with the additions of GNP/CNT. The PSU composite contained 6 wt% GNP and 7 wt% CNT nanofillers, which showed effective thermal conductivity of 1.23 W/m.K and 1.52 W/m.K, which is 1.7 times larger than the unreinforced polysulfone.

To decolorize MG, a composite ceramsite adsorbent composed of coal fly ash (CFA), sewage treatment sludge (STS), and waste glass (WG) with a quality ratio of 3 : 3 : 4, respectively, was prepared. The optimal preparation parameters were determined as follows: preheating [Formula: see text], sintering [Formula: see text], and sintering [Formula: see text]. Under optimal conditions, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the X-Com-ceramsite sample exhibits rough features and a porous structure.

The [Formula: see text] value of MG can reach up to 37.6 mg/g. The retention degree of MG in the X-Com-ceramsite with a relatively higher pH is stronger, and the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic. Synchronous fluorescence, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) proved that the sensitivity of the C-O/C-O-O functional groups of the carbohydrates on the surface of the X-Com-ceramsite has a higher binding affinity toward MG as the initial concentration of MG changes.",

Among the processes involved in the retention of these contaminants, adsorption is advantageous for removing toxic metals because of its environmentally friendly aspect, efficiency, and low-cost operation. Information on the adsorption of heavy metals in soils from the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil is still scarce. In this study, the adsorption of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb) by a semiarid Brazilian bentonitic soil is investigated. This soil has been used as a bottom liner in an experimental municipal solid waste (MSW) cell located in Campina Grande, State of Paraíba, Brazil. The experimental cell consists of a landfill unit on an experimental scale, with the same constructive elements of a sanitary landfill. Disturbed and undisturbed samples of the investigated soil were collected at a quarry in the rural zone of Boa Vista (state of Paraiba, Northeast Brazil). Sorption attributes were determined via batch tests with a soil-solution ratio of 1 : 12.5 (4 g of dry soil to 50 mL of solution). Linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir isotherms were fitted to the experimental data, using as fitting parameters Pearson correlation coefficient ([Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] value with a significance level [Formula: see text]. The ascending order of maximum adsorption capacity for heavy metals followed the series Ni &lt; Cr &lt; Zn &lt; Cd &lt; Cu &lt; Pb. The maximum adsorbent capacities obtained were similar to those of other Brazilian soils and other adsorbents. Therefore, the studied soil has a high potential to be used in the retention of heavy metals.",

In the batch adsorption experiments, the anthocyanin extracts were put in contact with the adsorbents, and different parameters were evaluated to determine the best conditions for their adsorption and recovery. It was noted that the highest levels of adsorption (28.0 mg g -1 ) occurred using a porous clay heterostructure (PCH) material as adsorbent, with a mass of 25 mg and 120 min of contact. Under the same conditions, the sepiolite only presented an adsorption capacity of 14.0 mg g -1 . The desorption results showed that the 60% methanolic solution recovered 60% of the anthocyanins adsorbed on PCH, while the 80% ethanolic solution recovered 35% of those adsorbed on sepiolite. The eluted anthocyanin solutions showed a 98% lower sugar concentration than the crude extract, indicating the low affinity of the adsorbents for sugars. Six types of acylated cyanidins were identified via UPLC-QToF-MSE in the extract, and it was confirmed from the FTIR analyses that the highest affinity of the clays occurred with the anthocyanins that presented more organic acid in their structure. The results show that PCH and sepiolite have high selectivity for anthocyanins and low affinity for the sugars present in the plant extract, facilitating the process of partial purification and application of these pigments.",

Equilibrium isotherms have been determined for the adsopriton of Acid Blue 25 (AB 25) and Acid Red 114 (AR 114) onto maize cob. The L-shaped adsorption isotherms suggest that adsorption proceeds through ionic bonding and that the dye molecules are adsorbed in a flatwise manner on the surface of the maize cob particles. The maximum adsorption capacity of the maize cob was found to be 47.7 and 41.4 mg dye per g maize cob for AR 114 and AB 25, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Eight clay–organic complexes were synthesized by placing quaternary ammonium cations (QUATs) on to bentonite (B) and kaolinite (K) by cation exchange. The organic cations used were hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA), dodecyltrimethylammonium (DDTMA), trimethylphenylammonium (TMPA) and tetramethylammonium (TMA). These organoclays were characterized via their organic carbon contents with the aid of XRD and FT-IR spectroscopic analyses. The organoclays were examined for their ability to adsorb phenol (P) and several of its methyl congeners [2,4-dimethylphenol (2,4-DMP) and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (2,4,6-TMP)]. It was shown that inorganoclays (Na–clays) and organokaolinites were incapable of adsorbing any of these organic pollutants. It was also determined that the adsorption of phenol compounds from water decreased in the order: 2,4,6-TMP &gt; 2,4-DMP &gt; P for HDTMA–B and DDTMA–B, 2,4-DMP &gt; P &gt; 2,4,6-TMP for TMPA–B and P &gt; 2,4-DMP &gt; 2,4,6-TMP for TMA–B. With n-hexane as a solvent a different adsorption trend was found, which depended on the type and degree of solvent interaction with the organic compounds and the organoclays. It was observed that the degree of adsorption of phenols on to organoclays was dependent on the relative adsorbent-adsorbate energies and adsorbate–solvent interactions. The adsorption isotherms of phenols on to organophilic clays were evaluated according to the Giles classification.",

It has been found that dark adsorption of the Cr VI ion on to TiO 2 is mainly dependent on the acidity of the system and the initial concentration of the Cr VI ion. As the pH of the system increases, so the extent of adsorption of the Cr VI ion decreases. The greatest adsorption was obtained with an initial Cr VI ion concentration of ca. 300 μmol/l. The presence of phosphate or acetate ions in the system dramatically decreases the adsorption efficiency of the Cr VI ion. In contrast, the addition of formic acid leads to a limited increase in the extent of Cr VI ion adsorption. Other organic ions and organic compounds examined showed no interference in Cr VI ion adsorption. FT-IR spectroscopic methods were used for the characterization of Cr VI ion adsorption on to TiO 2 .",

Nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K for a series of low-surface area graphitized and non-graphitized carbons were used to examine this method and to compare it with the BET procedure. Additional testing was undertaken for argon, nitrogen and krypton adsorption isotherms at 87 K on a highly graphitized carbon.

The polymeric nature of the fluidizing agents is demonstrated by an increase in adsorption with molecular weight and by adsorption/desorption experiments where the reaction has been shown to be irreversible.

Preliminary experiments indicated that the carbon fibre composite was capable of separating oxygen and nitrogen from air on the basis of the different diffusion rates of the two molecules in the micropore network of the composite. It is proposed that the relatively high electrical conductivity of the carbon fibre composite material could be exploited for air separation by facilitating the production of O 2 and N 2 through electrical swing adsorption rather than the depressurization of adsorber beds.",

    "abstract": "A thin-layer film comprising poly(methyl methacrylate) with an incorporated pyrazolo[3,4- b]quinoline derivative was prepared. The dye was anchored onto the polymer film to form a molecular assembly at the surface. Fluorescence quenching of this thin-layer sensory system was observed when the film was incubated in the presence of the nucleotide guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques were used to study the fluorescence quenching of this sensory system in the presence of nucleotides. The results suggest that quenching of a pyrazoloquinoline fluorosensor by nucleotide anions cannot be described simply by a collision mechanism employing the Stern-Volmer equation, but there is a possibility of the formation of a more stable association. This type of sensing polymer layer plays a role in biotechnology because it can be immobilized at the end of a fibre optic and used for measuring nucleotide concentrations within a biological system.",

In addition, an increase in polymer adsorption and a decrease in the thickness of the polymer adsorption layers were observed as the ionic strength of the solution increased. This was due to the fact that the repulsion interactions between the negatively charged surface and the negatively charged PAA macromolecules were screened by the NaCl used for adjusting the ionic strength.

The sorption capacities of leaves, stems and fruit peelings towards Pb(II) ions were found to be 81.30, 80.10 and 53.26%, respectively, at an initial Pb(II) ion concentration of 200 mg/dm 3 , optimum pH conditions of 6.0, a particle size of 0.354 mm and a contact time of 120 min.

The adsorption rates of Pb(II) ions were found to decrease in the order: leaves &gt; stems &gt; fruit peelings. Possible cell–metal ion interactions may be due to the involvement of –COOH, –OH and –NH groups in the sorption process.

The adsorption of carbaryl in surfactant–soil–water systems followed the order cationic &gt; anionic &gt; non-ionic as anticipated from the Freundlich constant, K F , and distribution coefficient, K D , values. The R f values obtained from soil TLC studies were inversely proportional to the K F and K D values. The affinities of carbaryl towards organic carbon and the clay content of the soil were compared using the K OC and K C values. The behaviour of carbaryl in surfactant–soil–water systems mainly depends on the degree of hydrophobicity of the pesticide and the type and concentration of surfactant used. The K D */K D ratios were used to evaluate the remediation efficiency of surfactants and it was found that anionic surfactant is a better choice for remediation of contaminated soils. The remediation efficiency of non-ionic surfactant varies with the nature of the soils whereas cationic surfactant leads to poor remediation efficiency. The results obtained are interesting as they afford the basic data relating to the possible use of surfactants for solving pollution problems posed by carbaryl.",

Two cluster models of silica were chosen to represent the terminal ≡SiOH groups and the siloxane bridges ≡Si–(O) 2 –Si≡ on the silica surface. The Hartree–Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) approaches, employing a 6–31G(d) basis set, were used to calculate the geometries, electronic structures, vibrational frequencies and adsorption energies of the adsorption complexes formed. The calculated adsorption energies were corrected for zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVE) and basis set superposition errors (BSSE). The results favoured a most likely surface configuration for the physisorbed species in which 2-PrOH molecules are bound to exposed silanol groups via two hydrogen bonds, with the alcoholic –OH group acting simultaneously as a proton acceptor and donor. Moreover, bonding of 2-PrOH with strained surface siloxane bridges (≡Si–O–Si≡) was shown to lead to chemisorption of the alcohol molecule.

In this paper, the method of mesoscopic dynamics (MesoDyn) has been applied to simulate the aggregation behaviour of the triblock copolymer P123 (PEO 20 PPO 70 PEO 20 ), and to further explore the structure-formation mechanism and analyze the feasibility of accurately adjusting the pore size of SBA-15. In particular, the effect of the synthesis temperature on the P123 micelle size in the SBA-15 synthesis process has been investigated in detail due to its importance in adjusting the pore size of SBA-15. In addition, in order to validate the simulation results, a series of SBA-15 samples were synthesized at temperatures within the range 293–328 K. The simulation results show that uniform spherical micelles of P123, composed of hydrophilic PEO coronas and hydrophobic PPO cores, can be formed in aqueous solutions. This provides a perfect explanation of the experimental findings of previous work. Moreover, it has also been found that the P123 micelle gradually expands as the temperature increases, which leads directly to an increase in the mesopore diameter of SBA-15. The relevant experimental results reported in this paper demonstrate this conclusion. Overall, the mesoscopic simulation method has been shown to be a valuable tool for exploring structure fabrication and for providing an accurate guide for adjusting the pore size of SBA-15, as well as being a strong complement and extension to the experimental approach.",

    "abstract": "Natural and modified kaolinitic clays were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM and EDS) and N 2 adsorption techniques. Disordered, poorly crystalline kaolinite, containing some quartz and very little mica, was calcined at different temperatures and different times and then leached with 25 wt% sulphuric acid for 1 h at 98 °C. Calcination led to a reduction in both the specific surface area and the total pore volume due to dehydroxylation of kaolinite to meta-kaolinite (MK). However, subsequent leaching of the meta-kaolinite had a striking effect on the microporosity of the modified products. Thus, heating at 886 °C at 2 h (to yield MK 2 886°C) and subsequent leaching for 1 h produced porous silica with a specific surface area of 233 m 2 /g and a total pore volume of 0.22 m 2 /g. The increase in the specific surface area (S BET ) of the porous silica was due to the formation of micropores of 1.2–1.8 nm diameter and mesopores of 4.0–5.5 nm diameter inside the porous structure. The variation in the specific surface area and the porosity of acid-leached meta-kaolinite was found to depend not only on the calcination temperatures but also on the calcination time. Increasing the calcination time up to 6 h had a negative effect on the microporosity, attributed to a condensation reaction. The characteristics of the hysteresis loops in the corresponding adsorption/desorption isotherms indicated the formation of mainly slit-shaped pores. A broad band at 2θ = 21.8° in the XRD patterns of the modified samples was assigned to amorphous silica. The infrared spectra of acid-leached meta-kaolinite showed bands at 1095 cm −1 and 795–802 cm −1 , respectively, which could be assigned to a three-dimensional amorphous silica phase.",

Adsorptive gas purification is a highly auspicious technology to provide pollution-free biogas for solid oxide fuel cell-based power units. In this work the authors examined the influence of different parameters onto the adsorption capacity of three commercially available sorbents. Experimental runs in a laboratory glass downflow fixed-bed reactor were carried out to analyse the adsorption capacity of a potassium carbonate impregnated activated carbon and two sorbents based on a mixture of aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide. Hydrogen chloride removal was accomplished with the impregnated activated carbon and metal oxide-based sorbents. Hydrogen chloride adsorption capacity was analysed under space velocities 8000 and 16,000 h −1 . In addition, the effect of a hydrogen chloride inlet concentration of 100 and 1000 ppmv was investigated. Furthermore, pellets in the size of 3–4 mm in diameter were crushed into a fraction between 500 and 1000 µm to investigate the influence of particle size on hydrogen chloride adsorption capacity. Additionally, the combined adsorption of hydrogen chloride and hydrogen sulphide was realized using the impregnated activated carbon. The experimental runs and the results obtained in this work provide useful data for designing an adsorption reactor to clean up biogas and optimizing the process.",

    "abstract": "The removal mechanism of a microbial flocculant produced using a novel Paenibacillus sp. strain A9 (MBFA9) for two heavy metal ions, lead and zinc, from an aqueous solution is studied and compared. The removal rate of Pb(II) or Zn(II) by MBFA9 increased with an increase in the pH when the pH was less than 6.0. The removal rates were 91.26% for Pb(II) and 76.28% for Zn(II). The optimum condition was found at a pH of 5.5 and dosage of MBFA9 of 5% (v/v, 150 mg/L). When the initial concentration of metal ions was 100 mg/L, the removal capacity was 453.70 mg/g for Pb(II) and 398.48 mg/g for Zn(II). The capture process of a single metal ion of Pb(II) or Zn(II) by MBFA9 agreed with the Langmuir adsorption model with fitting coefficients of 0.9907 and 0.9408, respectively. Both the adsorption kinetics and adsorption equilibrium, usually described as adsorption isotherms, showed that this process of Pb(II) or Zn(II) capture by MBFA9 involved simple adsorption of a single molecular layer. The maximum reaction rate constant, K2, of MBFA9 in the captured Pb(II) decreased from 0.0497 to 0.0095, with an increase in the Zn(II) concentration under different Zn(II) concentrations (0, 20, and 40 mg/L). This indicated that the presence of Zn(II) competed with PB(II) for the binding sites of MBFA9 and led to a decrease in the removal rate. The process was controlled by chemical adsorption.",

    "abstract": "During hydraulic fracturing in gassy coal, methane is driven by hydraulic fracturing. However, its mathematical model has not been established yet. Based on the theory of ‘dual-porosity and dual-permeability’ fluid seepage, a mathematical model is established, with the cleat structure, main hydraulic fracture and methane driven by hydraulic fracturing considered simultaneously. With the help of the COMSOL Multiphysics software, the numerical solution of the mathematical model is obtained. In addition, the space–time rules of water and methane saturation, pore pressure and its gradient are obtained. It is concluded that (1) along the direction of the methane driven by hydraulic fracturing, the pore pressure at the cleat demonstrates a trend of first decreasing and later increasing. The pore pressure gradient exhibits certain regional characteristics along the direction of the methane driven by hydraulic fracturing. (2) Along the direction of the methane driven by hydraulic fracturing, the water saturation exhibits a decreasing trend; however, near the cleat or hydraulic fracture, the water saturation first increases and later decreases. The water saturation in the central region of the coal matrix block is smaller than that of its surrounding region, while the saturation of water in the entire matrix block is greater than that in the cleat or hydraulic fracture surrounding the matrix block. The water saturation at the same space point increases gradually with the time progression. The space–time distribution rules of methane saturation are contrary to those of the water saturation. (3) The free methane driven by hydraulic fracturing includes the original free methane and the free methane desorbed from the adsorption methane. The reduction rate of the adsorption methane is larger than that of free methane.",

In fact, a silver complexation system based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor with a functional film of helicenes has been designed and developed at four temperatures. The developed system, in which the sensor response reflects the adsorption of the hexahelicene and the heptahelicene, was able to control the complexed mass of silver for each concentration. Experimental outcomes indicated that the quartz crystal coated with heptahelicene is the adequate material for silver adsorption. Then, a theoretical study has been performed through two statistical physics models (SMPG and SMRG) in order to analyze the experimental adsorption isotherms of the two helicenes at the ionic scale. The SMRG model was developed using the real gas law and was satisfactorily applied for the microscopic investigation of the hexahelicene isotherms indicating that the lateral interactions between the adsorbates are responsible of the decrease of the adsorbed quantity at saturation. The interpretation of the two models’ parameters indicated that the adsorption of the two helicenes is an endothermic phenomenon. Interestingly, the heptahelicene is recommended for silver complexation because it shows the highest adsorption energies involving chemical bonds during the complexation process. The SMPG model and the SMRG model also allow prediction of three thermodynamic functions (configurational entropy, Gibbs free enthalpy, and internal energy) which govern the adsorption mechanism of silver on the two helicenes.",

Simultaneously, the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), full-automatic physical-chemical adsorption instrument, and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) to analyze the effect of Ce addition on the adsorption capacity and catalytic activity. Experimental results validated that the activity of the MnO[Formula: see text]/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was greatly promoted with Ce addition. According to the characterization results, it could be concluded that Ce doping led to significant changes in the crystalline phase on the catalyst surface, which increased the relative content of surface lattice oxygen and promoted the catalytic oxidation of NO. By observing the physical properties of the surface and analyzing the surface elements of the catalyst, it could be inferred that a manganese-cerium solid solution was formed on the surface of Mn 0.4 Ce 0.05 /Al. Moreover, Ce addition increased the catalyst pore size, which enhanced the adsorption and contact of NO and O 2 with the active sites on the catalyst surface, and reduced the resistance of the reactants during internal diffusion. All these variations assigned to Mn 0.4 Ce 0.05 /Al were favorable for the catalytic oxidation of NO.",

To evaluate the regulation of ISS, natural bentonite was modified by ISS at different concentrations in this research. Water vapour adsorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were carried out to interpret the hydration mechanism of bentonite. Meanwhile, an associated analysis between hydration pore structures and hydration mechanisms was implemented through variation of pore characteristic tests at different relative humidities (RHs) to distinguish multiscale pore adsorption of water during the corresponding hydration process. In addition, the pore characteristics were studied via XRD, nitrogen adsorption, and mercury injection tests. Finally, the origins that adsorbed water and pore structures changed by adding ISS were discussed. The results showed that for calcium bentonite, the cations hydrated first in the range of [Formula: see text], accompanied by the expansion of micropores. Then, adsorption occurred on the basal surface of the crystal layer in the range of [Formula: see text], with water mainly adsorbed into the mesopores. With further hydration when [Formula: see text], diffused double layer (DDL) water ceaselessly entered the macropores. Both adsorbed water and multiscale pore size decreased when ISS was added to bentonite. The origins of the reduction were the regulation of ISS to exchangeable cations and the basal surface of the crystal layer.",

The existence of this ET process has been proved in many studies using either experimental or computational approaches. In this study, a ternary nanocomposite system of Ag/TiO 2 /GO was prepared to evaluate the performance enhancement in two experimental models: a physical model (i.e., surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor) and a chemical one (i.e., catalytic reduction reaction). The metal/semiconductor heterojunction between Ag and TiO 2 , as well as Ti-O-C bonds, has allowed plasmonic hot electrons to be transferred in the internal structure of the material. An investigation on the role of Ag content on the SERS sensing and catalytic reduction efficiency of Ag/TiO 2 /GO was performed in both models. Interestingly, they all resulted in the same optimal Ag content of 50 wt%. It was then further discussed to provide a convincing evidence for the plasmon-induced electron transfer phenomena in the Ag/TiO 2 /GO nanostructure. These findings also suggest a pathway to design and develop high-performance, cost-effective, facile-preparation, and eco-friendly multifunctional nanostructures for detecting and removing contaminants in environment.",

Adsorption experiments, involving a batch column study and a batch equilibrium study, were conducted to investigate the efficiency of synthesized P-GSC from PKS as a base material in the removal of MB dye. The batch column study demonstrated that small-sized synthesized P-GSC from PKS as a base material could remove up to 98.5% for concentration. Therefore, the following batch equilibrium study was carried out on small-sized P-GSC only. Adsorption isotherms and kinetic isotherms were studied, from which the experimental data showed that the adsorption exhibited a good fit with the Freundlich model ([Formula: see text]) and followed the pseudo-second order model ([Formula: see text]). FESEM, XPS, and XRD morphological and elemental analysis indicated the successful graphinization of POME on the P-GSC surface. The concept of deploying POME as the carbonaceous source to produce P-GSC, and then, deploying the resultant P-GSC as the adsorbent for MB dye removal has presented promising practical potential. Such cost-effective and environmentally friendly reuse of waste materials is envisioned to promote a ‘zero-waste industry.’",

Application of the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models to the kinetic data showed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model provided an excellent fit (R2 > 0.99). In addition, the film diffusion, pore diffusion and intra-particle diffusion models were also used to investigate the adsorption mechanism. Intra-particle diffusional analysis indicated that 2,6-DCP molecules diffused rapidly during the initial adsorption stage, followed by a slower stage and finally the establishment of an equilibrium condition. Thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption of 2,6-DCP onto the three sorbents examined occurred spontaneously and that the process was endothermic in nature. The results indicate that the surfactant-modified palygorskite exhibited a significant potential as a sorbent material for the removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous solution.",

The adsorption of homocysteine and homocystine is in fact the adsorption of mercury(II) cysteine thiolate and mercury(I) cysteine thiolate. The differences in the capacity curves result probably from the formation of mercurous thiolate at the mercury surface. It seems that the changes in Ez and γz values accompanying the change in the amino acid protonation in the basic electrolyte solution, confirm the altered arrangement of the cysteine mercury thiolates on the electrode surface.",

It has been observed that the faster ethanol adsorption proceeds on the macroporous sulfonic resin and the slower ethanol adsorption on the gel-type one. It is due to different swelling ability. It was found that the transfer of the ethanol molecules through the gel phase of sulfonic resin proceeds by means of the adsorption–desorption mechanism. The ratio of ethanol adsorption on sulfonic resin is one molecule per one acid site. During the ethanol adsorption on the gel and mixed sulfonic resin, one type of adsorbed complex is formed, whereas on the macroporous and loaded samples two adsorbed complexes with different energies are formed. This is probably because of the different localization of the acid sulfonic groups.",

The results show that the Freundlich-type metastable-equilibrium adsorption equation, the power function model, and the Freundlich-surface component activity equation can adequately describe the C s effect observed in the batch adsorption tests as all the correlation coefficients ( R 2 ) of the nonlinear plots are higher than 0.96. In other words, their intrinsic parameters simulated from the experimental data are independent of C s value.

The BET specific surface area decreased from 358 m 2 /g to 35–90 m 2 /g mainly because of a decrease in micropore volume as determined by the t-plot method. The rate of sorption of p-xylene on all the samples investigated followed Fick's second law of diffusion, leading to an effective diffusivity of ca. 1.7 × 10 −11 m 2 /s, irrespective of whether the H-form or the modified forms were investigated. The sorption isotherms for o-xylene showed some unusual steps. Values for the effective diffusivities decreased from 2.6 × 10 −12 m 2 /s for the H-form to 2.0–2.3 × 10 −12 m 2 /s for the modified forms.

Specific surface areas of ca. 90 m 2 /g were recorded up to the end of the third cycle, which then decreased thereafter with appreciable pore widening. Pore size distributions for the fresh and activated char indicated two peaks corresponding to micropores (13–15 Å) and mesopores (35–40 Å). Subsequent to the end of decolourization, the second peak diminished due to deposition of the adsorbed colouring matter inside the mesopores. After regeneration, the mesopores appear again. Use of the Freundlich and Langmuir equations allowed the adsorption data for methylene blue to be linearized properly. The monolayer capacity of the dye appears to be independent of the age of the char. Iodine numbers were generally comparable to the BET surface areas as measured by nitrogen adsorption.",

The solids were prepared by mechanical mixing of CrO 3 with finely powdered Al(OH)3, followed by drying at 120°C and calcination in air at 700°C. The amounts of chromia in the samples were 8.2 wt% and 27.1 wt%, respectively. The results obtained show that doses of 20–40 Mrad brought about a measurable increase in the surface characteristics (SBET, 46%; VP, 93%; r, 31%) of the sample containing 27.1 wt% Cr 2 O 3 but doses above this limit had the opposite effect. However, the various surface parameters of the sample treated with 160 Mrad were still higher than those of the untreated sample. With the sample containing 8.2 wt% Cr 2 O 3 , varying the dosage of γ-irradiation in the range 20–160 Mrad led to smaller variations in the surface parameters. The catalytic activities of both types of sample were decreased by γ-irradiation, with the decrease being more pronounced for samples rich in chromia. Curves relating catalytic activity to dosage exhibited minima at 40 Mrad. The observed decrease in catalytic activity with γ-irradiation was attributed to a decrease in the concentration of catalytically active sites taking part in chemisorption and catalysis of the oxidation of CO by O 2 without any change in their energetic nature.",

The non-isothermal desorption curves thus obtained were described using empirical equations. Extrapolation of the equation constants obtained enabled the desorption curves to be calculated for the limit of decrease in rate of the external gas pressure and of grain size.

    "abstract": "The catalytic conversion of ethanol and isopropanol was conducted over Co 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 solids (19.3 wt% Co 3 O 4 ) precalcined at 400°C and subjected to different doses of γ-radiation. The reaction was studied at different temperatures in the range 250–400°C and monitored using nitrogen as a carrier gas flowing at a rate of 18 cm 3 /min. The γ-ray doses employed were 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 MGy, respectively. The results obtained indicated that γ-irradiation effected a progressive decrease in the catalytic activity of the solids towards alcohol conversion, reaching a minimum value after 0.8 MGy irradiation. The irradiation process also effected a measurable decrease in the dehydration selectivity towards the alcohols investigated and an increase in their dehydrogenation selectivity. These results were discussed in terms of an effective decrease in the concentration of sites exhibiting Brönsted acidity brought about by γ-irradiation, which also generated a small decrease in the particle size of the Co 3 O 4 crystallites and a measurable increase in the specific surface areas of the solids investigated.",

Results show that the CuII adsorption rate was fast and could be described by a modified Freundlich equation. The rate of adsorption decreased with increasing surface loading. It was observed that the pH value of the solution was the key factor affecting the adsorption characteristics. The Langmuir adsorption model described the equilibrium adsorption well. The sludge adsorption capacities of CuII were in the range 17–59 mg/g and were affected by the ionic strength. Values of ΔG0 ranging from −7.24 to −7.65 kcal/mol suggested that the adsorption is a physical process which is simultaneously enhanced by the electrostatic effect. The binding strength for CuII adsorption was proposed as: digested sludge > secondary sludge > primary sludge.",

Such treatment led to a change in the point of zero charge (PZC) and the adsorption capacity (Q max ) of the carbon concerned. The adsorption capacity and affinity (K 1 ) of each carbon was determined using the Langmuir homogeneous and binary models to compare the effects of different treatments on these and relative parameters. The variation of the model parameters with the solution pH was also studied. The fitted parameters obtained from both models showed the pH value had the most significant effect on the adsorption capacity (Q max ) and the adsorption affinity (K 1 ) of a given carbon, with both quantities showing a decrease with increasing pH. It was found that the uptake of the molecular forms of the aromatic solute was dependent on the PZC of the carbons. Treatment with H 2 increased the PZC whilst treatment with H 2 SO 4 led to a decrease in this factor. At higher pH (when the solute was in an ionic form), it was found that electrostatic forces played a significant role on the extent of adsorption. Under these conditions, the adsorption of the solute depended on the concentration of its anionic form. It was shown that the effect of pH must be considered from the viewpoint of its combined effect on the carbon surface and on the solute molecules.",

The propene/benzene (P/B) molar ratios in the reaction mixtures, which amounted to 0.60–2.7, deviated considerably from the expected stoichiometry depending on the nature of the samples, their mode of preparation, their preliminary thermal treatment and steaming as well as on the experimental conditions employed. At the same time, the total yields of cracking products and non-converted cumene were, as a rule, 1.5–3-times less than the amounts of cumene fed into the system. The infringement of the stoichiometry and the considerable material imbalance observed may be attributed to the chemisorption of both cumene and the final conversion products on Lewis acid sites, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated aluminium atoms and zeolite cations, present on the catalyst surface. Chemisorption of the intermediates — phenyl carbocations — on Brönsted acid sites, as well as coke formation as a result of propene polymerization on these sites, must also be taken into consideration. The balance between these various processes and interactions leads to the overall reaction situation observed, thereby enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding both the nature of the catalyst surface and the individual processes, which appear to depend on the strength, amount and correlation between the Brönsted and Lewis acid sites on the samples studied.",

Frequently practical catalysts have such a broad pore size distribution that neither method alone is adequate to measure the total pore size range. The present results suggest a direct comparison, without recourse to a scaling factor, is appropriate when comparing results from the two methods even though the pore size distribution maximum may vary by at least 50% depending upon the model chosen for the calculation. Better agreement may be obtained between the two experimental techniques by adjusting either the nitrogen adsorption data using a packed sphere model or the mercury penetration data by an earlier reported correction ratio. The difference between the two methods becomes less than 20% when a correction procedure is used; however, further studies are needed to define the range of material shaped that these procedures are applicable to.",

Coupling interactions influence spectra in three ways: frequency shifts, changes in absolute molecular absorption intensities, and transfers of intensity from one absorption band to another. The magnitude of frequency shifts depends on the size of the adlayer, and may consequently vary with the size of the catalyst particles, while depolarization effects can reduce molecular absorption intensities by a factor of three or four at high adsorbate densities. The most striking influence of coupling on spectra from supported catalysts, however, arises from intensity transfers between molecules adsorbed on dissimilar sites. At high surface coverages the apparent importance of a small number of defect sites can be greatly enhanced by this effect, and it is even possible for a strongly bound minority species to be wrongly identified as a weakly bound majority one. Such errors can be avoided if spectra from isotopic mixtures are recorded.",

    "abstract": "The comparative adsorption of o-nitrophenol, m-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol onto a macroporous polymeric adsorbent (Amberlite XAD-4) and a hypercrosslinked polymeric adsorbent (NJ-8) was investigated. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms were measured by batch equilibration over the temperature range 283–323 K, and two kinds of isotherm model (Langmuir and Freundlich) provided the best fit of the experimental data. The adsorption capacity for each adsorbate on NJ-8 was ca. twice that on Amberlite XAD-4, which is explained by the micropore structure and stronger donor–acceptor interaction of NJ-8 resin. Mini-column experiments showed that NJ-8 resin exhibited the longest breakthrough time. The enthalpy of adsorption was estimated from the temperature dependence of adsorption.",

The adsorption of nitrogen at −196°C and of carbon dioxide at 0°C was followed and the data obtained analyzed through the use of models based on theories of surface coverage and micropore filling. Chemically-activated carbons obtained from cherry and wild cherry stones exhibited high surface areas and large total pore volumes. Most of the pores lay in the micropore region while a small fraction of the total surface area was located in non-micropores. Fair agreement was established on comparing the textural parameters derived from models based on the theory of surface coverage with those derived from the micropore filling theory. Micropores should be classified into ultrafine pores, micropores and super-micropores, such sub-division helping in the prediction of the adsorption behaviour and in the interpretation of the data derived therefrom.",

The resulting active carbon exhibited properties in line with those expected from precursors of vegetable origin, with the carbonisation stage appearing to have only a limited influence on the final porosity. In the case of carbonisation at 400°C, the initial micropore system of the char was accessible to dichloromethane, CO2 and water, but presented a strong gate effect at ca. 0.35–0.40 nm. The pore volume, W0, was equal to 0.13 cm3/g and the average pore width 0.70 nm. The pore size distribution was obtained from CO2 adsorption at 0°C, using isotherms derived from computer modelling. With the char prepared at 750°C, the initial porosity was only accessible to water and its presence was confirmed by extrapolation of W0 for the activated carbons.",

A comparison of the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviours of the adsorbate towards three different polymeric adsorbents was made. It was found that the equilibrium adsorption data for the three polymeric adsorbents were well fitted by the empirical Freundlich isotherm. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of the multi-functional polymeric adsorbent NJ-99 was the largest among the three adsorbents studied. This may be attributed to strong hydrogen-bonding interaction and electrostatic interaction between the amino groups on the resin and the carboxyl group of p-aminobenzoic acid. In contrast, because of its smaller micropore volume, the adsorption capacity of macroporous XAD-4 was lower than that of the hypercrosslinked adsorbents CHA-111 and NJ-99. Calculation of the sorption enthalpy changes enabled the adsorption mechanism to be interpreted. In addition, a kinetic study of the sorption of p-aminobenzoic acid onto NJ-99 was also undertaken. The results showed that the adsorption process was mainly controlled by intraparticle diffusion.",

In order to extend this force field from siliceous to cationic zeolites, it is proposed that account be taken of the polarization component of the zeolite-molecule interaction energy. A first-order polarization term is explicitly considered for this purpose, using standard molecular polarizabilities. Polarization appears to amount to 30–40% of the zeolite-alkane interaction energy as a consequence of the strong electric field created by the sodium cation distribution and the negatively charged framework. This approach is compared with the experimental adsorption isotherms of ethane, propane, n-octane and n-decane in NaY taken from the literature and with original measurements of n-butane isotherms in NaY obtained by thermogravimetric methods. Henry constants and heats of adsorption at zero coverage of n-alkanes (n = 6–10) have also been compared with experimental measurements. Although no specific parameter was invoked for extending the force field, general agreement between the simulation results and experiment was satisfactory. Cation redistribution upon alkane adsorption was not observed in these simulations.",

Two different metal-loaded zeolites were prepared by exchanging H-beta zeolite (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 75:1) with copper. The influence of exchanged copper on the uptake level was assessed. The effect of varying the silica-to-alumina ratio of the H-beta zeolite on the aniline uptake level was also examined, using three different H-beta zeolites with ratios of 25:1, 75:1 and 150:1 as adsorbents. The sorption experiments indicated an uptake level of ca. 110–120 mg/g for each zeolite and this level was also adsorbed by the copper-modified H-beta zeolites (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 75:1). In all cases, the adsorption process followed the Langmuir model for adsorption and the level of aniline adsorbed was largely unaffected by a change in temperature or the presence of extra framework copper. The stability of the exchanged copper on these zeolites was then examined by measuring the quantity of copper leached from each zeolite into solution as a function of pH. Minimum copper leaching was observed in the pH range 5–11. This provided a stable pH working range for the adsorbent materials.",

The oil samples (0.5–5.0 ml in 100 ml water) were emulsified mechanically in the presence of 1.0–5.0 mg of the protein. The stability of the emulsions was investigated via the effective diameter and multimodal size distribution of the droplets using the dynamic light-scattering technique. In addition, the zeta potentials of the emulsions were measured and found to be negative and in the range −5 mV to −20 mV in all systems. Multimodal size distribution analysis showed that soon after preparation the emulsions were quite well monodispersed. In general, α-lactalbumin appeared to be a good or even better emulsifier than β-casein for both kinds of emulsion (vegetable oil and n-tetradecane in water). Moreover, it appeared that for stability of these emulsions, the optimal ratio of oil and protein content was very important.",

The experimental data presented demonstrate the feasibility of separating glucose from trans-galacto-oligosaccharides and fructose from fructo-oligosaccharides using resins as adsorbents. Comparison of the sorption properties of a resin functionalised with the bisulphite (HSO − 3 ) ion with its original chloride (Cl − ) form showed that the sorption of glucose increased due to interaction with the bisulphite group. In addition, functionalisation with bisulphite resulted in selectivity towards glucose relative to fructose and lactose. Moreover, chromatographic separation of glucose from trans-galacto-oligosaccharides on a bisulphite-loaded resin was improved compared to the same resin in the chloride form. However, the bisulphite unfortunately oxidised. Boronic acid-functionalised resin was selective towards fructose at pH 6.0 compared to glucose, indicating complex formation between fructose and boronic acid. Although complex formation with boronate has been assumed to be even stronger than with boronic acid, increasing the pH to a value above the pK a of the functional group did not improve fructose sorption. Chromatographic separation of fructose from fructo-oligosaccharides was obtained on boronic acid-functionalised resin as a result of complex formation with fructose. These results show that reversible chemical reactions can lead to an improvement in the performance of adsorbents for sugar separations.",

However, treatments for the recovery and re-use of the wastewaters generated from these processes are sparse and little known. The aim of the present work was the study of the influence of different variables on the sorption of L-cysteine from aqueous solution onto the mineral clinoptilolite. For this purpose, L-cysteine (Cys) was sorbed by clinoptilolite (Clino) from aqueous solutions of variable concentrations at various temperatures and pH values. The materials employed were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and thermal analysis (TG, DTG and DSC) techniques. The results indicated that the sorption process depended strongly on the pH, temperature and concentration of amino acid. L-Cysteine was specifically sorbed onto the surface sites of clinoptilolite probably via its NH + 3 moiety. The pH dependence suggests that these sites may be silanolate groups (≡Si – O − ). Analysis of the experimental data obtained for the sorption isotherms via the Langmuir model gave a good fit. The calculated thermodynamic parameters (Δ;H 0 , Δ;S 0 and Δ;G 0 ) indicated that the sorption process was exothermic.",

Nevertheless, their physical interpretation is very limited because the particle geometry is not considered. In this work, the adsorption kinetics of p-nitrophenol onto two commercial activated carbons with different textural and geometrical characteristics was studied. For this purpose, two types of models were used: zero-dimensional models which do not take the system geometry into account; and the Boyd model, which takes the shape of the adsorbent molecule into account. In contrast to previous published works, the Boyd model was solved by means of the finite element method using the commercial software COMSOL. This paper provides a new insight into the modelling of adsorption kinetics when non-spherical adsorbents are employed.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an investigation of argon adsorption into carbon nanotubes at temperatures below the triple point, using a grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation to study the effects of confinement and surface strength on the 2D transition. In large pores, it was found that 2D transitions can occur in more than one layer, but are absent in higher layers for small pores. The 2D critical temperature of the first layer for a small pore (R = 1.2 nm) was found to be ca. 66 K (MWCNT) and 65 K (SWCNT), compared to 55–59 K observed experimentally for a flat graphite surface. This is because of the overlapping effects due to the surface curvature or the confinement in a carbon nanotube. Assuming a weaker carbon surface by reducing the graphene surface strength by 40% for SWCNT, the 2D critical temperature was only modestly reduced to 63 K. This suggests that the experimental data at 59 K might be attributed to other factors, other than confinement effects. An imperfect surface is suggested and, employing 5% defects on this surface, the 2D critical temperature has been determined as 58 K which is in better agreement with the experimental value of 59 K.",

    "abstract": "The removal of heavy metal ions from water and wastewater has received a great deal of attention. Although adsorption methods are those most frequently used for the treatment of polluted water, such methods generally employ high-cost adsorbents such as activated carbon. The purpose of the present study was the exploration of the use of natural materials as a low-cost adsorbent in such technological applications. Thus, experiments have been conducted to test the efficiency of bael tree leaves in removing heavy metal ions, viz. Zn(II) ions, from wastewater derived from the electroplating industry. The percentage removal of Zn(II) ions was evaluated under varying experimental conditions, i.e. adsorbent dosage, initial metal ion concentration and contact time. To this effect, batch adsorption experiments were undertaken employing 2 g of 40–50 mesh bael tree leaves as an adsorbent in 100 mℓ of synthetic wastewater containing ca. 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg/ℓ of Zn(II) ions. The initial pH of the synthetic wastewater was ca. 5. The experiments showed that the highest removal rate for Zn(II) ions was 88.58% under optimal conditions. Such Zn(II) ion adsorption followed reversible first-order rate kinetics. Thus, the tree leaves investigated in this study showed a good potential for the removal of Zn(II) ions from synthetic wastewater. The ultimate goal of the work described is the development of inexpensive, readily available, effective metal ion adsorbents from natural waste products as an alternative to existing commercial adsorbents.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption of water by the graphene surfaces of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in either the untreated (4.3 atom% oxygen) or oxidised (22.3 atom% oxygen) surface states has been studied. Different concentrations of surface oxygen groups, which have been directly measured using XPS, give rise to distinctly different shapes of water adsorption isotherms. Those from the untreated materials follow the pressure axis which lends them a Type III character in the BDDT classification. However, since they display a clear point of inflection at the lowest pressure, they are strictly speaking Type II isotherms but indicative of relatively few polar interactions and weak water adsorptivity. In sharp contrast, the isotherms from the oxidised MWCNTs are typically Type II and are characterised by a marked positive curvature in their low pressure region due to the increased numbers of specific interactions occurring between water molecules and the polar surface oxygen groups. The water adsorption data were modelled by the equation of D'Arcy and Watt with a direct correlation being observed between the surface polarity parameters (a mL and a 0 ) and also a s (the limiting water uptake) and the surface oxygen levels of the MWCNTs. The difference in polar surface energy was confirmed by measurements of the calorimetric enthalpies of immersion in water (Δh i ), which were −54 mJ/m 2 for the untreated and −192 mJ/m 2 for the oxidised materials. These values also reflect the difference in the integral net enthalpies of adsorption for the two hydrophilic surfaces: a value of ca. −35 mJ/m 2 being obtained for an oxygen-free (hydrophobic) surface. Water adsorption on these hydrophilic graphene surfaces was shown to occur by specific hydrogen bonding and was therefore strongly dependent on the numbers of oxygen-containing polar surface sites. This behaviour is well known for other types of porous and non-porous carbon materials and is also predicted for carbon nanotubes by molecular simulation studies. The work described herein therefore provides early experimental confirmation of the quantitative role of surface oxygen chemistry in determining the water adsorption character of MWCNT graphene surfaces; it also validates previous simulation studies.",

An antisolvent crystallization method was proposed to strengthen the crystallization process of carbonized ammonia, and heating the crystal products instead of rich solution can greatly reduce renewable energy consumption. The main component of the crystal product was NH 4 HCO 3 analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Therefore, it is very important to study the thermodynamic properties of ammonium bicarbonate in the ternary system of NH 3 –H 2 O–ethanol. In this paper, the solubility curves under different temperature and solvent compositions were determined by static method and the mathematical model of solubility was established. The effects of the addition of ammonium carbamate which was produced in the initial stage of the CO 2 absorption process and the addition of ammonia on the solubility in ternary system of NH 4 HCO 3 –H 2 O–ethanol were studied. The dissolution heat was also calculated in the end. The research of this article has a guiding significance for the antisolvent method to strengthen the crystallization of carbonized ammonia of ammonia-based carbon capture technology. It is helpful to further strengthen the crystallization process of low carbonized ammonia and improve the crystallization yield.",

    "abstract": "Adsorption and desorption of coalbed methane are generally at a dynamic equilibrium state under the undisturbed coal reservoir. However, as the reservoir pressure drops to a certain value during the extraction of coalbed methane, the equilibrium state is destroyed and thus more coalbed methane desorbs and escapes from coal to wellbore. Here the corresponding bottom-hole fluid pressure is called initial gas production pressure (IGPP) in the development practice of coalbed methane wells. This paper, which has taken Changzhi-Anze block in the central-southern part of Qinshui basin as the study object, addresses the distribution characteristic and control factors of IGPP of coalbed methane wells and then explores the key factors affecting IGPP using grey correlation analysis theory. The results indicate that IGPP varies from 1.09 MPa to 6.57 MPa, showing a distribution law with high in the middle and low in the west and east of the study area, which presents a similar distribution characteristic with burial depth, thickness, coal rank, gas content, original reservoir pressure, and in-situ stress. Further, through grey correlation analysis, it concludes that the correlation degrees of control factors affecting IGPP of coalbed methane wells in the descending order are decline rate of working fluid level, water yield before gas production, reservoir pressure, coal thickness, coal rank, minimum horizontal principal stress, burial depth, and gas content. Among these factors, engineering factors, including decline rate of working fluid level and water yield before gas production, present a key controlling effect, because they can determine the smooth migration pathway directly during initial water production. And another key factor, original reservoir pressure also builds strong and positive correlation with IGPP under the interaction of other geology and reservoir factors, revealing the capability of gas desorption and the transmission of pressure drops.",

The adsorption capacity of the treated PTFE film that was not further modified by dopamine was also evaluated. The characteristics of the two materials (coated and non-coated) were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. The difference in adsorption capacity between the two materials was mainly due to the different functional groups introduced in these materials, which show difference in their ability to form hydrogen bond with the analytes. The number of hydroxyl groups in the analytes and the ability of the analytes to form intramolecular hydrogen bond are the two factors that affect the adsorption capacity of the adsorbates.",

The monolithic porous polymer was prepared by the in situ stepwise polymerization of epoxy resin and diethylenetriamine as the curing agent and polyethylene glycol (PEG-1540) as the pore-forming reagent. The working electrode consisting of a metal wire coated with epoxy resin-based polymer was connected to a direct high-voltage power supply, employing a platinum wire as the counter-electrode. The aqueous solution of Cresol Red selected as a model target analyte was extracted by electrosorption-enhanced micro-column solid-phase extraction, and the concentration determined by UV–vis spectrophotometric methods. The experimental conditions, including the electric potential, the extraction and desorption time, the pH of the initial solution and ionic strength, were optimized. The results showed that the adsorption rate and capacity towards Cresol Red could be improved significantly by anodic polarization, while cathodic polarization had a smaller effect on the adsorption process. The kinetics of the process were determined as Lagergren first-order. The electrosorption isotherm was in good agreement with the Freundlich and linear equations. The equilibrium adsorption capacity was four-times higher at 300 V and 20 min, in comparison with the absence of an electric field.",

A simple experiment has demonstrated that such concentration fluctuations can be dampened by flowing the polluted gas through a layer of adsorbent. Measurements of balancing the concentration fluctuations of triethylamine (TEA) by flowing through an activated carbon bed showed that balancing average TEA inlet concentrations of 7–30 g/m 3 occurs at a superficial velocity lower than 4–0.6 cm/s, which corresponds to a residence time of 37–250 s. An important notion is that balancing the fluctuations may be achieved independently of dividing the time of TEA presence in the inlet air if the given average 8 h TEA concentration at the inlet can be retained.",

To verify the U- and L-curve methods, the originally generated AED functions with different number of peaks are compared with those obtained back from the synthetic isotherms using the INTEG regularization method.

    "abstract": "In this work, nitrogen adsorption and desorption onto solid surfaces were studied using computer simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, for systems with complex porous structures at the mesoscopic and microscopic levels. A hysteresis cycle between the adsorption and desorption processes appears and it was found that its characteristics are dependent on the geometry of the pore and on the strength of the surface–fluid interaction. We also obtained an average adsorption isotherm, which represents a combination of differently shaped pores, and shows robust jumps at certain values of the chemical potential as a consequence of the shape of the pores. A comparison of the results of this study with experimental data is also made. In addition, we report the filling of microscopic pores connected with mesopores. It is argued that these predictions are useful for researchers working on the enhanced recovery of oil and for the design of new nanomaterials, among others.",

Morphology of the prepared nanocomposites was assessed by SEM coupled with EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy). HRTEM was used to measure the size of the nanocomposites with shape and morphology. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the nanocomposites were recorded by a UV-visible spectrophotometer. Finally, the crystal structures of the nanocomposites were confirmed by XRD.

Several advanced wastewater treatments have been shown to be effective for R40 removal but some of them present disadvantages such as by-products obtention, high energy consumption, and high cost of the reactants used in the removal process. In the present work, α-Alumina (Alu) and γ-Alu spheres were synthesized by the encapsulation method. The prepared spheres were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, SEM/EDS, and S BET , and it was determined the presence of only inorganic bonds from ceramic material, and the amorphous alumina was observed in spheres with a smooth and uniform surface and with pores. R40 adsorption kinetics and isotherms were performed, as well as material regeneration for consequent sorption cycles. Sorption tests for R40 removal were carried out under different conditions of initial concentration, pH value, and the presence of interfering ions. The maximal sorption capacity of the synthetized α- and γ-Alu spheres were situated between 0.1765 and 18.9865 mg/g. Different kinetic and isothermal equations were applied and finally, the experimental data was described by Elovich and Freundlich models. The γ-Alu spheres after five heat treatment regeneration cycles showed stable behavior and potential re-use in new sorption processes with R40 removal &gt;97.7% at pH 3 and &gt;85.6% at [Formula: see text] =10 mg/L. The obtained results showed that the γ-Alu spheres are novel, alternative, and sustainable synthesized materials for the advanced treatment of wastewater by adsorption process for the removal of Allura red azo dye in aqueous media.",

    "abstract": "Activated carbon is one of the most highly proven adsorbents for organic chemicals from wastewater. It acts as a filter and adsorbs various chemicals from the wastewater. It has large pore size and strong adsorptive capacity. The quality of wastewater is generally determined by chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) , total suspended solids (TSSs), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN). Wastewater contaminant measurement is significant for saving aquatic life and reusing treated water. Adsorption of contaminants that contribute for wastewater quality indicators uses machine learning algorithm for prediction. Many research works have been done, and the issues are inefficiency and time consuming in the adsorption of contaminants by activated carbon in wastewater management. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces hybrid technique of Voting-Based Extreme Learning Machine with sine cosine algorithm (VELM-SCA).

By studying the effects of iminodisuccinic acid (IDS), an easily biodegradable and environmental friendly chelating agent, on Cd distribution at the organ and cellular level, we found IDS promoted dry matter accumulation of rapeseed and increased the contents of photosynthetic pigment in leaves. Inhibited root-shoot Cd transport resulted in higher activity of antioxidant enzymes and decreased hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation in leaves, which indicated that IDS contributed to alleviating Cd-caused oxidative damage in leaf cells. Additionally, IDS increased Cd subcellular distribution in cell wall (CW), especially in covalently bound pectin (CSP), and relieved Cd toxicity in organelle of leaves. IDS also enhanced demethylation of CSP. The Cd content in CSP, demethylation degree, and pectin methylesterase activity of CSP increased by 37.95%, 13.34%, and 13.16%, respectively, while IDS did not change the contents of different CW components. The improved Cd fixation in leaf CW was mainly attributed to enhance demethylation of covalently bound pectin (CSP) and Cd chelation with CSP.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases drastically affect human beings without distinction; it does not matter if they are male or female. Sometimes, it is not clear why a person in their life developed a well-known disease in the world such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Nowadays, various novel machine learning-based algorithms for evaluating Parkinson’s disease have been designed. The most recent strategy, which was developed using deep learning and can forecast the severity of Parkinson’s disease, is the one described here. To identify this disease, a thorough medical history, previous treatment history, physical examinations, and some blood tests and brain films must be completed. Diagnoses are more critical since they are less expensive and less time-consuming. Voice data from 253 people used in the current study corroborates the doctor’s diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. To acquire the best results from the data, preprocessing is done. To perform the balancing procedure, a systematic sampling strategy was used to select the data that would be analyzed. Several data groups were constructed using a feature selection technique based on the label’s effect strength. Classification algorithms and performance evaluation criteria employ DT, SVM, and kNN. The classification algorithm and data group with the highest performance value were chosen, and the model was created due to this selection. The SVM approach was employed when constructing the model, and 45% of the original data set data were used. The data was sorted from most relevant to least important. 86% performance accuracy was achieved, in addition to excellent results in all other areas of the project. As a result, it has been established that medical decision support will be provided to the doctor with the assistance of the data set obtained from the speech recordings of the individual who may have Parkinson’s disease and the model that has been developed.",

    "abstract": "Clay minerals are considered as a promising material in the context of geological barrier for the confinement of radioactive and industrial waste. Understanding the usefulness of the smectite mineral, in this approach, remains insufficient. The deep investigation about structural response/changes, hydrate stability, cation exchange process, permeability, and heavy metal/radionuclide adsorption/removal efficiency under external constraints is needed. To explore the structural alteration, the hydration stability, and the evolution of montmorillonite porosity under a first order of external applied constraints coupling, a reference Na-rich montmorillonite specimen is used as a starting material, and three exchangeable heavy metal cations (Ba 2+ , Cu 2+ , and Co 2+ ) have been selected. The applied constraint coupling is realized at laboratory scale and assured by simultaneously varying of the soil solution pH and the thermal gradient. The evaluation of the mineral fraction response is established by correlation of quantitative XRD analysis results, thermal analysis, and porosity measurements. The quantitative XRD analysis allows rebuilding of the theoretical model describing the interlamellar space (IS) configurations/damages, structural heterogeneity degrees, and hydrous stability. Obtained results show a dominant interstratified hydration character, for all studied complexes, attributed to a new IS organization versus the applied constraint strength. Furthermore, all samples exhibit a heterogeneous hydration behavior traduced by the coexistence of different layers of type population within the crystallite. Additionally, the theoretical XRD profile decomposition allowed us to prove link between the domination of the segregated stacking layers mode against the constraint strength. Thermal analysis allowed us to develop theoretical models describing the decrease of the water molecule amounts as a function of the increase in temperature and soil solution pH. Moreover, a specific hydration footprint response and an interstratification mapping are assigned for each corresponding stress degrees. The evolution of montmorillonite porosity is determined by adsorption measurement, based on Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution analyses which confirms for all samples, the exfoliation process, and the mesopore diameter rise by increasing the constraint intensity.",

Waste FS are valorized to chitosan by demineralization, deproteination, and deacetylation successively. Cellulose was extracted from sugarcane bagasse using acidic hydrolysis. Chitosan-based cellulose composite porous membrane was fabricated by evaporating solvent from polymer solution in petri dish. The impact of pH, contact time, and absorbent dosage on the removal of Cr(III) from an aqueous solution was investigated. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to check the Cr(III). Results showed that chitosan comprising 85% degree of deacetylation was achieved by alkali treatment, while yield was 22%. FTIR analysis confirmed the chitosan and chitosan-cellulose-based composite membrane. Morphology studies showed that the cellulose was strongly staggered and due to the chitosan, the surface of cellulose became rougher, which is good to enhance the adsorption capacity. The maximum removal 57% of Cr(III) from aqueous solution was observed at pH 6 at 60 min and 50 mg dosage of adsorbent. The minimum removal (47%) of Cr (III) was found at pH 2. These results confer that Labeo rohita-based chitosan-cellulose composite membrane has great potential for the removal of metals from industrial effluents.",

    "abstract": "Tetracycline (TC) is a commonly used antibiotic and enters the soil environment continuously. As humic acid (HA) is one of the most important components in soils, it is necessary to investigate the adsorption behavior of TC by HA under different conditions. In this paper, the factor of “aging” was considered. The methodology of coating CaCO3 precipitation on the surface of HA was adopted to simulate the aging process. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm demonstrated that the uptake of TC over HA was quicker with more amount than aged HA, meaning that aging affected the mass transfer of TC from the bulk solution to the outer surface of HA as well as from HA outer surface to its interior pores. To explain the effect of aging, BET was utilized to characterize the morphology of HA and aged HA. It was found that aging resulted in a decrease in specific surface area and pore size. XPS, FTIR, and 2D-COS revealed how aging influenced the chemical composition of HA. Five kinds of functional groups carried by HA contributed to the adsorption of TC, in which the binding affinity towards TC followed the order of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mo>−</mo> <mtext>COO</mtext> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mtext>N</mtext> <mo>−</mo> <mtext>H</mtext> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mo>−</mo> <mtext>C</mtext> <mo>−</mo> <mtext>C</mtext> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mtext>C</mtext> <mo>−</mo> <mtext>O</mtext> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mtext>O</mtext> <mo>−</mo> <mtext>H</mtext> </math> . These results indicated that -COO was the most sensitive adsorption site. Compared to HA, the content of -COO for aged HA decreased obviously. In summary, aging affected the morphology and chemical position of HA and consequently lead to the change in adsorption kinetics and isotherm of TC.",

How to develop and utilize clean energy while improving the environment and reducing pollution has become one of the important issues that countries need to solve urgently. Biomass energy (referred to as biomass energy) is widely distributed, renewable, and easy-to-use green energy, and its effective development and utilization is of great strategic significance for driving the development of emerging energy industries, preventing global warming, and promoting the establishment of a circular society. Therefore, it is of great scientific, economic, and social significance to develop and utilize biomass energy efficiently, relieve the pressure of energy demand, improve the environment of the ecosystem, and ensure regional economic development.

    "abstract": "With the popularization of natural gas and the requirement of environmental protection, the development and utilization of natural gas are particularly important. The status of natural gas in China’s oil and gas exploration and development is constantly improving, and the country pays more and more attention to the exploitation and utilization of natural gas. The tight sandstone of Upper Paleozoic in Ordos Basin has the characteristics of low porosity, low permeability, and large area of concealed gas reservoirs. With the increasing demand for natural gas in China, systematic analysis and research on the geological conditions and enrichment law of large area gas reservoirs of tight sandstone of Upper Paleozoic in Ordos Basin to guide exploration and production also pose a great challenge to the current level of natural gas exploration and development in China. In order to solve this problem, this paper takes the Upper Paleozoic tight sandstone in Hangjinqi area in the north of Ordos Basin as the research object, summarizes the natural gas accumulation conditions of tight sandstone according to the geological characteristics of Ordos Basin, determines the main control factors of gas accumulation by superposition method in combination with the distribution characteristics of natural gas, simulates the dynamic process of gas accumulation, establishes the gas accumulation model, analyzes the conditions of gas accumulation and enrichment by statistical methods, summarizes the accumulation and enrichment rules of natural gas, and predicts the favorable exploration areas for natural gas. The results show that the relationship between hydrocarbon source rocks, traps, migration and transportation, and other reservoir-forming conditions and the distribution characteristics of natural gas is summarized, and the main controlling factors of reservoir-forming are determined by superposition method. We simulate the evolution process of faults, strata, oil, gas, and water flows in the study area and establish the dynamic reservoir-forming process of natural gas. By combining the reserve data with the reservoir source distance, reservoir facies type, and gas filling times, the reservoir-forming and enrichment conditions are studied by statistical analysis method, and the reservoir-forming and enrichment rules are summarized by combining the main controlling factors. The enrichment of natural gas is controlled by the development degree of source rocks, favorable tight sandstone combination, confluence channel, and local structure. According to the law of accumulation and enrichment, the division standards of favorable areas in different horizons are established, and the favorable exploration areas in the study area are predicted. The results provide theoretical data support for natural gas exploration in the study area.",

Mesopore structure parameters in the two coals increase with decreasing particle size, which are attributed to the opening of closed mesopores during the pulverization process. The closed mesopores with different pore size ranges are opened with a certain percentage in high volatile bituminous coal, but opened irregularly in anthracite during pulverization. Micropore structure parameters of the two coals show different variations with decreasing particle size, which are not related to the reconstituted micropore structure. Mineral matter contributes more mesopores than organic matter in anthracite and exerts the negative effect on micropore in the two coals. An evolution model is established to elaborately describe the change of pore structure during the pulverization process, where mineral matter plays a mediating role in the effect of particle size on pore structure.",

    "abstract": "A Scottish wood biochar sample was investigated for water remediation against persistent organic pollutants as a potential renewable material for adsorption processes. Textural characterisation gave a high surface area (588 m 2 /g) and a mix of microporous and mesoporous nature with an average pore width of 4 nm. Morphological analysis revealed a layered carbon structure and spectroscopic analysis showed the presence of oxygen and nitrogen-based functionalities alongside 80% atomic carbon. The biochar had an average point of zero charge of 7.44 ± 0.2. 3,4-Dichloroaniline kinetic rates were rapid (&lt;5 min), restricting kinetic analysis, while a pseudo-second-order kinetic model was best suited to represent the kinetic data for acetaminophen and carbamazepine, suggesting chemical control. The adsorption equilibria were most appropriately described by the Sips isotherm model, further supporting the chemical control theory for a multilayer system. Maximum adsorption capacity was 126 mg/g for acetaminophen removal, 40 mg/g for carbamazepine and 83 mg/g for 3,4-dichloroaniline. The biochar demonstrated good removal efficiency against all target species, showing potential as an adsorbent for water remediation.",

    "abstract": "Textile industries use dyes that play a significant role in polluting water bodies. The current work examines the acid-modified palmyra palm male inflorescence activated carbon as a novel, environmentally feasible, and economical adsorbent to eliminate methylene blue in synthetic effluent. The adsorbent is chemically activated by nitric acid to enhance pores and active sites. The palmyra palm male inflorescence activated carbon adsorbent is characterized by some characterization techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, BET, and scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray, for analyzing its physio-chemical properties and nature. The prepared adsorbent has a large surface area of 343.781 m 2 /g. Batch adsorption tests were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the palmyra palm male inflorescence activated carbon. The adsorbent capacity and the highest removal efficiency of the adsorbent are 38.82 mg/g and 98.5%, respectively. It is obtained by maintaining the batch study parameters at their optimum conditions. For this process, 5 g/L will be the suitable dosage for effectively eliminating methylene blue dye. The appropriate dye concentration and contact time for the maximum removal were determined as 100 mg/L and 50 min. Reusability evaluation of the adsorbent was done by utilizing 0.1 Mole of NaOH, and the adsorbent was successfully regenerated and used for up to four cycles.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this study is to assess the adsorption behavior of boron using a tannin-based biosorbent known as tannic acid resin, synthesized from Turkish acorns (valonia) through the spray-drying method. The resulting biosorbent, named Valex, underwent modification into a tannic acid resin-based structure, rendering it suitable for use as a biosorbent. Comprehensive characterization studies involving Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis were conducted on this biosorbent. The outcomes demonstrated the effectiveness of tannic acid resin, a tannin-based biosorbent, in removing boron from aqueous solutions. Various parameters such as pH, initial boron concentration, and adsorbent dosage were investigated for their impact on boron removal. The study also delved into adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm models, and adsorption thermodynamics. Maximum boron removal, reaching 92.9%, was achieved using 1 g of tannic acid resin-based biosorbent with an initial boron concentration of 8 mg L −1 within 6 h at pH 3. The Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin–Radushkevich, and Temkin isotherm models were applied to experimental data, with the Temkin model demonstrating a good fit. Adsorption kinetics were explored using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, first-order, second-order, and intraparticle diffusion models, with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitting the data effectively. The negative values of Δ G° at all temperatures indicated the spontaneous nature of boron adsorption on the tannin resin, and the positive value of Δ H° suggested the endothermic nature of adsorption. This study shows the efficacy of Valex in boron adsorption and suggests its potential application as an effective method for boron removal. This study's findings on the impact of various parameters on boron removal provide insights for optimizing the boron adsorption process in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript analyzes the valorization of agricultural wastes as heavy metal adsorbents and their eco-friendly final disposal as mineral admixtures to manufacture cement-based construction materials. The adsorption properties of nutshell, pistachio shell, and agave fiber for the removal of Pb 2+ and Ni 2+ from aqueous solution were analyzed under different operating scenarios (i.e., pH, temperature, waste dosage, CaCO 3 concentration). Taguchi L9 experimental design was applied to identify the best removal conditions for both heavy metal ions. The maximum experimental adsorption capacities of Ni 2+ were 14.8, 17.8, and 16.4 mg/g for pistachio shell, nutshell, and agave fiber, respectively, whereas the maximum Pb 2+ adsorption capacities of these residues were 6.25, 16.25, and 103.5 mg/g. Adsorption studies showed that CaCO 3 concentration of aqueous solutions affected the removal of these heavy metal ions. However, these agricultural residues showed a competitive removal performance under different water hardness conditions. On the other hand, the setting and compressive strength of cement paste samples containing these residues loaded with heavy metals (i.e., as mineral admixtures) were also investigated. The results indicated that the setting process of the cement paste samples was accelerated when the agave fiber was used in its natural form (without heavy metals), as well as when the pistachio shell and nutshell were saturated with heavy metals. These findings were associated with the agricultural residue structure, which allowed better adherence to the cement particles by hydrating the elongated form of the agave fiber and the globular form of the nutshell and pistachio shell. Finally, the compressive strength of cement-based specimens was evaluated at 7, 14, and 28 days after their preparation. The results showed that the cement paste samples incorporating nutshell had a higher compressive strength than those of the pistachio shell and the agave fiber because of the high lignin content in the nutshell. This circular economy approach for the valorization and final disposal of agricultural wastes is attractive to face their waste management problem, and the secondary pollution problem generated by the spent adsorbents used in water treatment.",

Attention is focused on the adsorption energy distribution which, in the case of one-site-occupancy adsorption, leads to the Dubinin–Astakhov isotherm equation. In effect, a generalized form of that isotherm equation is developed for the common case of multisite-occupancy adorption in actual adsorption systems. The generalized equation is sensitive to surface topography; hence, fitting it to experimental adsorption isotherms creates a chance to study the surface topography of carbonaceous surfaces. An example of such computer exercises is reported here before a more systematic study is published.",

    "abstract": "Non-activated carbon has been prepared by carbonizing waste products manufactured from phenol formaldehyde at 1073 K in a nitrogen atmosphere. Activated carbons were obtained by gasifying the non-activated product with air at 673 K, or with steam at 1173 K, to different levels of burn-off. The adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K and of carbon dioxide at 298 K was measured for all the carbons prepared using volumetric apparatus. The adsorption of iso-octane and α-pinene at 320 K was carried out gravimetrically using silica spring balances. The adsorption of methylene blue and of phenol from their aqueous solutions was determined spectrophotometrically. The adsorption of ammonia from its aqueous solution at 308 K was determined colorimetrically. The surface area of the activated carbons increased with increasing percentage burn-off to reach a maximum and then decreased with further increase in percentage burn-off. Gasification with oxidizing gases changed the porosity of the carbon with the change depending on the extent of gasification. The adsorption of iso-octane and α-pinene increased with increasing percentage burn-off as a result of pore widening. The low burn-off carbons obtained from phenol formaldehyde wastes are characterized by extremely high surface areas and microporosity, and a high CO/CO 2 ratio on outgassing. The carbons exhibit high phenol adsorption capacities. Ammonia adsorption is favoured on carbons of a low CO/CO 2 ratio.",

The solids obtained were treated with NaNO 3 (0.75–6 mol%) solution and dried at 110°C, then calcined in air at 500°C and 800°C for 6 h. The phases produced were identified by XRD analysis. The surface properties (S BET , V p and r̄) of the pure and doped solids were studied by using N 2 adsorption at – 196°C and their catalytic activities were determined by studying the oxidation of CO by O 2 at 125–300°C. The results obtained reveal that pure and doped mixed solids preheated in air at 500°C and 800°C consist of Mn 2 O 3 (partridgite) and a poorly crystalline γ-alumina. Doping with sodium oxide at 500°C and 800°C resulted in a small decrease (14–19%) in the S BET value of the treated solids. However, this treatment brought about a significant modification in the catalytic activity of the doped solids. Doping with 0.75% Na 2 O at 500°C led to an increase of about 30–50% in the specific catalytic activity which was found to decrease on increasing the percentage of Na 2 O above this limit, falling to values smaller than that measured for the undoped catalyst. Doping at 800°C led to a progressive decrease in the activity of the treated solid to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant present. The doping process at 500°C and 800°C did not modify the mechanism of the catalytic reaction but altered the number of catalytically-active sites contributing in the catalysis of CO oxidation by O 2 without changing their energetic nature.",

The adsorption capacity of the biomass increased with increasing pH. This behaviour was attributed to decreased protonation of the binding sites and decreased competition for binding between the cadmium ions and protons with increasing pH. The equilibrium data measured at different pH values were consistent with the influence of pH on the zeta potentials of the biomass, indicating that the dominant binding mechanism is likely to involve electrical attractions.",

The amounts of dopants added were varied within the range 0.75–6 mol% Al 2 O 3 , and 0.025–6 mol% MoO 3 . The influence of this treatment on the specific surface areas and catalytic activities of the Co 3 O 4 solids was investigated using nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and studies of the decomposition of H 2 O 2 at 30–50°C. The results obtained revealed that doping of cobaltic oxide solids with either Al 2 O 3 or MoO 3 , followed by calcination at 500°C and 700°C, resulted in a progressive increase in the BET surface areas. This increase was, however, more pronounced in the case of MoO 3 doping. Calcination of the doped solids at 900°C led to an increase in the BET surface areas of the Al 2 O 3 -treated solids and to a small decrease in the specific surface areas of the MoO 3 -doped samples. Calcination of the variously doped solids at 500–900°C brought about a decrease in their catalytic activity to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant added. Thus, treatment of Co 3 O 4 solids with 6 mol% Al 2 O 3 followed by calcination at 500°C, 700°C and 900°C effected a decrease of 36.9, 42.8 and 67.5% in their activities (expressed as reaction rate constant per unit area) measured at 30°C. The decrease in the catalytic activity of Co 3 O 4 solids due to MoO 3 doping was greater than that effected by Al 2 O 3 doping. The doping process did not change the mechanism of the catalytic reaction but effectively decreased the concentration of CO 3+ –CO 2+ ion pairs acting as the active sites involved in the catalytic process.",

Adsorption in the practically most interesting 10–80% range of zeolite filling may adequately be described by Langmuir isotherms. The Langmuir adsorption constants are similar for β-zeolite, MCM-22 and silicalite. This indicates that the adsorption is independent of the pore structure for the alcohols tested in this study.

The amounts of chromium oxide employed were 5.66 and 20 mol% Cr 2 O 3 , respectively. The calcined solid specimens were then treated with different doses of γ-rays (20–160 Mrad). The surface and catalytic properties of the different irradiated solids were investigated using nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and the catalysis of CO oxidation by O 2 at 300–400°C. The results revealed that γ-rays brought about a slight decrease in the BET surface area, S BET (15%), and in the total pore volume, V p (20%), of the adsorbent containing 5.66 mol% Cr 2 O 3 . The same treatment increased the total pore volume, V p (36%), and the mean pore radius, r̄ (43%), of the other adsorbent sample without changing its BET surface area. The catalytic activities of both catalyst samples were found to increase as a function of dose, reaching a maximum value at 80–160 Mrad and 40 Mrad for the solids containing 5.66 and 20 mol% Cr 2 O 3 , respectively. The maximum increase in the catalytic activity measured at 300°C was 59% and 100% for the first and second catalyst samples, respectively. The induced effect of γ-irradiation on the catalytic activity was an increase in the concentration of catalytically active sites taking part in chemisorption and in the catalysis of CO oxidation by O 2 without changing their energetic nature. This was achieved by a progressive removal of surface hydroxy groups during the irradiation process.",

The associated water displacement curves and effluent temperature profiles are also presented. At first, as the experimental RH increases, the slope of the breakthrough curves gradually decreases. However, at high RH (i.e. 80%) the curve becomes distinctly biphasic. It is proposed that the initial steep part of the curve is the result of a build-up of water in the macro (transport) pore structure of the carbon which restricts access of chloropicrin to the micropores. The accumulation of water in the transport pores is a consequence of both the high carbon water content at RH 80% and the limitation on the amount of water that can be carried away in the air- stream (which rapidly reaches saturation). The shape of the water displacement curves is also influenced by re-adsorption of displaced water further along the filter bed. In most experiments there is a significant depression in the temperature of the effluent airstream. At RH 80% the overall process is notably endothermic.",

With each adsorbent, the adsorption measurements were made after outgassing at temperatures of 298, 373, 423 and 573 K, and finally at 298 K in the case of the pure rutile. An upward displacement of the isotherms with an increase in the outgassing temperature was found with each system but a pronounced change in isotherm character was found only with pure rutile. It is concluded that ligand water is incorporated into the surface structure of rutile, thus providing additional sites for the physisorption of water in the hydrogen-bonded form. The addition of 0·6 wt% of silica appeared to be sufficient to block off the cationic sites and the resulting surface then became remarkably similar to that of precipitated silica.",

At 673 K, the H and O coverages of Pt were about the same as for Pt supported on SiO 2 (Euro Pt catalyst). The increase in T R from 673 to 873 K was accompanied by a strong decrease of the hydrogen to oxygen chemisorption ratio.

Attention was given both to the dehydration and rehydration processes under different conditions. The evolution of OH species was investigated in the 298–1073 K range. Evidence has been obtained for two species; isolated free (3750 cm −1 ) and adjacent interacting (3670 cm −1 ) hydroxyls. The presence of isolated silanols (which are usually created at a silica surface by outgassing at T &gt; 450 K) on the initial ‘virgin’ sample (i.e. prior to any thermal treatment) accounts for the intrinsically low hydrophilicity of this specimen. By raising the outgassing temperature, the extent of the 3750 cm −1 species increases in parallel with the disappearance of the 3670 cm −1 species. The progressive development of surface hydrophobicity was monitored by the decrease in the adsorption capacity and of the heat of adsorption, the latter falling far below 44 kJ/mol (latent heat of liquefaction of water) even for the sample treated at 423 K. Upon contact with water vapour at r.t., rehydration occurs only to a limited extent and depends on both the thermal pretreatment undergone by the sample and the time of exposure to H 2 O vapour.",

    "abstract": "The present paper offers an assessment of using wastes such as palladium–activated carbon (Pd/AC) catalysts through their regeneration or metal recovery. In order to regenerate a catalyst it has been found necessary to clean up its surface completely and restore the original form of the metal. Supercritical fluid extraction can be useful in removing organic substances from the surface of a spent catalyst whereas microwave mineralisation can be used to recover palladium from the mass of a spent catalyst.",

    "abstract": "Gas stirring was used to study the adsorption of basic dyes onto montmorillonite clay. This technique had been demonstrated previously as being more efficient than mechanical stirring. The experimental set-up employed was a fixed-bed column connected to an air-supply system with provision for controlling different airflow rates at different temperatures. The dyestuff used was Basic Red (a commercial dye). The rate of dye removal was found to increase with increasing gas flow and increasing temperature. Dye removals of 86% to 55% could be achieved for contact times of 35 min to 50 min using dye concentrations between 200 mg/l and 500 mg/l at a gas flow rate of 100 cm3/s. The calculated Langmuir constants demonstrated that clay is a favourable adsorbent for the basic dye. Compared to powdered activated carbon (PAC), the adsorption capacity of the clay was 41.3% while the relative cost of basic dye removal was 0.024-times that of PAC. The external mass-transfer coefficient (Ks) and the intraparticle diffusion rate parameter (Kp) were calculated and evaluated as functions of gas stirring and temperature. It was found that an increase in the rate of adsorption effected by gas stirring was double that obtained by increasing the temperature due to the high turbulence induced by axial and radial flow created by gas stirring. The activation energy (E) of 5.95 kcal/mol demonstrated that adsorption of the basic dye onto clay was diffusion-controlled. The energy consumption (W) for removing a known percentage of the dye was evaluated and found to correlate with the equation W = 8.56Q1.02X8.63 for 50 < Q < 100 cm3/s, where Q is the gas flow rate and X is the percentage dye removal.",

The results showed that the adsorption capacity increased from approximately 0.2 to 1.9 mg NH 3 /g carbon as the concentration of ammonia in the gaseous mixture increased (600, 1200, 1800 and 2400 ppm) at the three temperatures employed (40, 80 and 120°C). Increasing the temperature at the concentrations studied caused a decrease in the adsorption capacity, which was affected to a more significant extent by temperature than by the ammonia concentration in the gaseous mixture.",

The texture of the studied catalyst and the mode of surface dispersion of the supported NiPc were investigated through the adsorption of N 2 and O 2 , respectively. The activity of the diluted samples could be attributed to the presence of separate highly dispersed molecules of NiPc on the bentonite surface without having a marked effect on its pore system for most active samples. The selectivity towards styrene was found to depend strongly on the NiPc surface area and the degree of dispersion. The activity was a function of the whole structure including modifications of both acid sites through different interactions and of the pore system through a penetration mechanism.",

The dependence of the zeta potential of titanium dioxide particles in aqueous suspension on the pH of the system was typical for metal oxides and passed through an isoelectric point at pH 0 = 6.2. Adsorption of poly(methacrylic acid) on to titanium dioxide particles had a considerable effect on the dependence of the zeta potential of the particles on the pH of the suspension medium. The change of zeta potential both in the absence and presence of PMAA correlated well with the aggregation stability of the suspensions, which was estimated from the mean radius of the particles. The influence of the adsorbed poly(methacrylic acid) macromolecules on the zeta potential of the particles can be explained according to a scheme which envisages both a decrease in the particle surface potential and a change in the potential distribution in the electrical double layer.",

The modified zeolites were tested with respect to the adsorption of n-butylamine or n-butylthiol via the pulse method employing a column micro-adsorber directly attached to a gas chromatograph. Thus, 200 mg portions of the adsorbent were activated by heating at 400°C for 2 h after which the temperature was decreased to 200°C. The column was held at this temperature for 1 h and then 10 μl portions of n-butylamine and n-butylthiol were injected on to it at 15-min intervals. It was found that the zeolites containing iron(III) ions were much more effective as adsorbents (by 30%) than those containing chromium ions, with this difference reaching 60% in the case of n-butylthiol. Furthermore, zeolites containing iron(III) ions underwent much less deactivation than those with chromium(III) ions. Increasing the iron → sodium or chromium → sodium ion exchange led to increased adsorption of the organic compounds studied. It was shown that Y-type zeolites modified with iron(III) are effective adsorbents for deodorising atmospheric air.",

The method has also been used to measure the binary equilibrium data of benzene–hexane, benzene–pentane and hexane–pentane mixtures on three types of activated carbon. The ‘Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory’ (IAST) was used to predict the binary adsorption equilibria from the adsorption isotherms for the single components. Good agreement was obtained between prediction and measurement for the total amount of components adsorbed, as well as for the ratio of compounds in the adsorbed phase. The small deviation noted was probably a result of using the Freundlich adsorption isotherm in IAST modelling.",

On both molecular sieves, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of ethylene was larger than that of oxygen and close to that of carbon dioxide, indicating that it would not be possible to remove oxygen and carbon dioxide gases from their mixture with ethylene in order to effect recovery of the latter via equilibrium separation methods. However, during the early stages of adsorption, the adsorption rates of carbon dioxide and oxygen were faster than that of ethylene thereby suggesting recovery of the latter from the gaseous mixture via kinetic separation based on the difference in adsorption diffusivity. Such separation was conducted using a two-bed column pressure swing adsorption arrangement with the effects of the experimental conditions on the separation being investigated. Oxygen and carbon dioxide may be adsorbed and removed from the gaseous mixture, leaving the output gases rich in ethylene.",

Two forms of by-pass kiln dust were used in this study without any treatment, i.e. in powder and pelletized form (the latter being achieved using water or sodium silicate). Equilibrium isotherms to assess the maximum capacity of the two basic dyes on the two forms of CKD were evaluated using a computer program. This allowed two-, three- and four-parameter adsorption models to be studied; it was found that the piecewise Freundlich isotherm yielded an excellent overall fit. Washing with water led to the loss of some active sites responsible for the sorptive capacity. The increase in capacity observed after pelletization with water rather than with sodium silicate could be explained by an increase in hydroxy moieties that undergo exchange reactions. In both cases of pelletization, the adsorption capacity was less than for the unwashed powdered form. The uptake order was found to be: unwashed powder &gt; pellets with water &gt; pellets with sodium silicate.",

    "abstract": "Anew approach is developed to analyze the thermodynamic properties of a sub-critical fluid adsorbed in a slit pore of activated carbon. The approach is based on a representation that an adsorbed fluid forms an ordered structure close to a smoothed solid surface. This ordered structure is modelled as a collection of parallel molecular layers. Such a structure allows us to express the Helmholtz free energy of a molecular layer as the sum of the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy specific to that layer and the potential energy of interaction of that layer with all other layers and the solid surface. The intrinsic Helmholtz free energy of a molecular layer is a function (at given temperature) of its two-dimensional density and it can be readily obtained from bulk-phase properties, while the interlayer potential energy interaction is determined by using the 10–4 Lennard-Jones potential. The positions of all layers close to the graphite surface or in a slit pore are considered to correspond to the minimum of the potential energy of the system. This model has led to accurate predictions of nitrogen and argon adsorption on carbon black at their normal boiling points. In the case of adsorption in slit pores, local isotherms are determined from the minimization of the grand potential. The model provides a reasonable description of the 0–1 monolayer transition, phase transition and packing effect. The adsorption of nitrogen at 77.35 K and argon at 87.29 K on activated carbons is analyzed to illustrate the potential of this theory, and the derived pore-size distribution is compared favourably with that obtained by the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The model is less time-consuming than methods such as the DFT and Monte-Carlo simulation, and most importantly it can be readily extended to the adsorption of mixtures and capillary condensation phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic metal which occurs in surface and ground waters as the Hg 2+ ion. The aim of the present study was to develop carbon-based adsorbents that contain chlorine (Cl), sulphur (S) or nitrogen (N) functional groups in an attempt to enhance the removal of Hg 2+ ions from aqueous environments. Thus, activated carbon (AC) was oxidized by treatment with nitric acid and then with thionyl chloride, followed by reaction with ethylenediamine, dithio-oxamide and 1,2-ethanedithiol, respectively. Such chemically-modified activated carbons were characterized by scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDS), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and potentiometry. Batch experiments to study the kinetics and equilibrium of Hg 2+ ion adsorption were performed to evaluate the efficacy of the functionalized carbon adsorbents. Sample characterizations indicated that chlorine, sulphur or nitrogen functional groups were effectively immobilized onto the activated carbon surface, thereby generating more negative surface charges favouring cation adsorption. Adsorption kinetics and equilibrium experiments showed that Hg 2+ ion adsorption by activated carbons modified with ethylenediamine (ACNN), dithio-oxamide (ACNS) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (ACSS) was fast (e.g. ACNN &lt; 30 min) and had a high capacity (e.g. ACNN =/&gt; 200%) over AC. The adsorptive capacity decreased in the order ACNN (120 mg/g) &gt; ACSS (105 mg/g) &gt; ACNS (90 mg/g) &gt; AC (60 mg/g), suggesting a high Hg 2+ ion affinity for the modified carbons.",

Molecular dynamics computer simulations in Grand Canonical ensemble were used as the methodological tools. It was shown that the microscopic structure of the fluid is characterized by anomalies similar to those found in a bulk model, but that it is affected by the fluid-matrix interactions. The dynamic properties also exhibit anomalous dependence on fluid density, but the magnitude of these anomalies is suppressed in comparison to the bulk fluid model. The anomalous behaviour of the diffusion coefficient is attributed to structural changes in the first coordination shell of a given fluid particle. It seems that the anomalies can only be suppressed at matrix densities which are higher than those studied in the present work.",

Such data are necessary in BET-like theoretical modelling of adsorption process. The proposed fluid state equation (PVT relationship) combines a theoretical description of the fluid entropy (based on a hard-sphere model) with cohesion energy relationships obtained via high-accuracy approximations of universal compression factor data and vapour-liquid equilibria. The resultant relationships are incorporated into a BET-like description of adsorption in materials of irregular microporous structure (LBET model). The set of formulae gathered together in this paper allows the possible effective calculation of adsorption isotherms at near- and super-critical temperatures relative to the pore structures. A multi-variant fitting of the LBET model to the empirical data is proposed to detect active constraints for multilayer adsorption and, hence, to obtain information on the structure of the pores. Application of the formulae to the analysis of methane and carbon dioxide adsorption onto an active carbon is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the interaction of uranyl species with the surface of quartz are reported. Two approaches were applied. These were (i) the classical static batch adsorption approach in which only the forward adsorption uptake reaction is usually studied and (ii) a dynamic column approach in which the retention of a solute during its migration through a porous medium is investigated and where adsorption and desorption are both relevant for the final breakthrough curve. In this paper, we present the results of a column study at pH 4. Under these conditions, the interference of the carbonate ion (via the formation of dissolved or adsorbed uranyl-carbonato species), the effects of quartz surface charge (quartz/silica is virtually uncharged under these conditions) and the potential effects of quartz dissolution on uranyl speciation (via the formation of dissolved or adsorbed uranyl-silicato species) are minimised. The reported batch adsorption results are reasonably predicted by a model which under similar conditions successfully described batch and column data on a quartz sample with grains smaller than the quartz particles used in the present study by a factor of ca. 25. However, this model was incapable of describing the breakthrough behaviour of uranyl species. This failure was attributed to the heterogeneity of the quartz particles used, which may be more important for column breakthrough than for batch adsorption data.",

Cerium(IV) was then added by an ion-exchange method. The structures, morphologies, chemical compositions and thermal stabilities of the resulting materials were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and TGA techniques. Both the morphologies and the surface properties of the materials synthesized by these two methods were different. Thus, the material prepared via the sol–gel process possessed a higher surface area and exhibited both a different type of adsorption isotherm and smaller crystallite sizes than the material synthesized by redox reaction under reflux conditions. The physical and chemical properties of the Ce–K-OMS-2 materials were similar to those of pure cryptomelane. TGA and XRD studies showed that the K-OMS-2 and Ce–K-OMS-2 materials exhibited a greater thermal stability in O 2 rather than N 2 atmospheres. In fact, the Ce(IV) derivatives were more stable thermally than the pure material. For Ce–K-OMS-2 R , the data obtained showed that part of the manganese in the framework was substituted by Ce(IV) ions. In contrast, the data for Ce–K-OMS-2 S indicated that not only did Ce(IV) ions substitute part of the manganese in the framework but that Ce(IV) ions also replaced the K + ions in the tunnel structure of the material.",

The predicted concentration decay curves were compared with the experimental findings. The optimum best-fit values of the external mass-transfer coefficient and effective diffusion coefficients were found by minimizing the difference between the experimental and model-predicted phenol solution concentration. It was found that, under the experimental conditions employed in this study, the influence of the external mass-transfer resistance was low. A single value of the mass transport coefficient, k f , of (4.8 ± 1.3) × 10 −3 (cm/s) described the whole range of system conditions. The difference between the corresponding values of the effective diffusivity, D eff , was not statistically significant. Consequently, a constant value of the effective pore diffusivity of (4.1 ± 0.4) × 10 −6 (cm 2 /s) was sufficient to provide an accurate correlation of the decay concentration curve.",

By using the membrane as a pre-bulk separation unit and coupling it to the intrinsically dynamic periodic operation of the PSA, the separation performance of the hybrid scheme is enhanced with respect to that of the two stand-alone units. Instead of constant-composition regular feed, the PSA is fed with a mixture which is progressively enriched in the more adsorbed component during the pressurization and high-pressure adsorption steps of the cycle. This results in sharper concentration fronts. The hybrid scheme detailed here has been applied successfully to the bulk separation of an 30:70 mol% CO 2 /N 2 mixture over activated carbon. Process performance is reported in terms of product recovery and purity at cyclic steady state. Numerical simulations were validated by experimental work on a composite membrane and a laboratory-scale PSA unit. For the examples studied, product purity and recovery for the hybrid process were increased by 23% and 58% for CO 2 , and by 14% and 5% for N 2 , compared to an equivalent stand-alone PSA.",

This is the first report on Mn-coated hollow polymer as a substitute for widely used materials like green sand or MN-coated sand. Hollow polymethylmethacrylate (HPM) was prepared by using a literature procedure. Manganese oxide (MnO) was coated on the surface of HPM (MHPM) by using the electroless plating technique. The HPM and MHPM were characterized by using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Optical and scanning micrographs were used to monitor the surface properties of the coated layer which revealed the presence of MnO on the surface of HPM. TGA showed the presence of 4-5% of MnO in MHPM. Adsorption isotherm studies were carried out as a function of pH, initial ion concentration, and contact time, to determine the adsorption efficiency for removal of Mn 2+ from contaminated water by the synthesized MHPM. The isotherm results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of MnO-coated HPM to remove manganese contaminants from water is 8.373 mg/g. The obtained [Formula: see text] values of Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm models were 1 and 0.87, respectively. Therefore, [Formula: see text] magnitude confirmed that the Langmuir model is best suited for Mn 2+ adsorption by a monolayer of MHPM adsorbent. The material developed shows higher adsorption capacity even at a higher concentration of solute ions, which is not usually observed with similar materials of this kind. Overall findings indicate that MHPM is a very potential lightweight adsorbent for removal of Mn 2+ from the aqueous solution because of its low density and high surface area.",

The objective of the present study was to understand how the cationic surfactants (CTAB; cetyltrimethylammonium nitrate) affect the adsorption of EDCs (17 α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and bisphenol A (BPA)) on graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxides (RGOs), and the few-layered commercial graphene (CG). It was observed that the presence of CTAB showed different effects on the adsorption of EDCs to different GMs. The adsorption of EDCs on GO was enhanced because of the enhanced hydrophobicity of GMs after the adsorption of CTAB and the newly formed hemimicelles by the adsorbed CTAB, which could serve as the partition phase for EDCs. Moreover, the electron donor-acceptor interaction and cation bridging effect of the –NH 4 + group of the adsorbed CTAB between EDCs and GMs could also enhance the adsorption of EDCs to GMs. With the increase of the extent of GM reduction, the adsorption enhancement by the presence of CTAB weakened. This could be attributed to the competition and pore blockage effect caused by the adsorbed CTAB. It is worth noting that the enhancement of CTAB on the adsorption of BPA to GMs was more profound than that of EE2. This is likely because the pore blockage effect plays a less important role in the adsorption of BPA due to its smaller molecular diameter and deformable structure.",

The organic geochemical test, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and high pressure mercury injection and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption experiments have studied the microscopic characteristics and gas content characteristics of shale reservoirs. The results show that the organic matter type of the sample is type III; the TOC content ranges from 0.28% to 16.87%, with an average of 2.15%; [Formula: see text] is from 2.45% to 3.36%, with an average value of 2.86%; the shale pores in the study area are well developed, containing more organic pores and intergranular pores of clay minerals. Based on the two-dimensional SEM image fractal theory to study different types of pores, the fractal dimension of shale pore fracture morphology is between 2.34 and 2.50, and the heterogeneity is moderate. The high-pressure mercury intrusion experiment characterizes the pore size distribution of shale macropores and transition pores. The pore diameters are mostly nm-scale. Transition pores are the main pores of the shale in the study area. Based on the characteristics of the pore structure, the adsorption capacity and gas content of CH4 in shale reservoir were analyzed by methane isothermal adsorption and gas content experiments. The results showed that the pore volume and specific surface area were positively correlated with clay mineral content, TOC, and RO, but negatively correlated with the quartz content. In clay minerals and brittle minerals, pore volume and specific surface area are positively correlated with illite content and negatively correlated with the quartz and kaolinite content. The measured total gas content and desorbed gas content are significantly positively correlated with TOC, but are weakly positively correlated with the quartz and illite content. This study finely characterizes the physical properties, micropore characteristics, gas-bearing characteristics, and influencing factors of shale reservoirs, which has certain theoretical guiding significance for the research and development of coal-measure shale in the Ordos Basin.",

The soil samples from the ore district and the sewage irrigation area showed an obvious enrichment of HMs in different depths, and the difference in the longitudinal migration depth of Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cd was insignificant, which might be due to the migration behavior of HMs mainly controlled by carbonate in alkaline soil. With the sewage irrigation activities, the content of soil organic matter was no longer the main controlling factor for the migration behavior of HMs. In ore district and sewage irrigation area, the HMs contents of nonresidual fractions in topsoil were much higher than that in the corresponding deep soil, which indicated that HMs activities in topsoil were significantly high. The Pb isotopic compositions of profile soils indicated that the long-term mining and smelting activities remained the main source of vertical enrichment of HMs in Baiyin district. Moreover, the Pb isotope ratios 206 Pb/ 207 Pb of nonresidual fractions (1.1359-1.1916) were all lower than that in the corresponding residual fractions (1.1641-1.2010), showing the characteristics that HMs input from anthropogenic source were in different degrees. The Pb isotopic compositions of residual fractions in the topsoil of ore district and sewage irrigation area (1.1641 and 1.1703) were between the two end-members composed of background soil and local mineral samples, which suggested that some anthropogenic HMs might enter into the residual components in the soil that was greatly affected by the input of HMs.",

These nanohybrids were then homogeneously dispersed into the diacrylate urethane/1,6-hexanediol diacrylate resin system at a content of 2 wt%. The structural morphology, mechanical resistances, and crosslinking of the as-prepared nanocomposite coating (nanocoating) were evaluated. The antimicrobial characteristic was tested by keeping track of the lag-log growth phase of E. coli bacteria in the coating existence among cell cultures. The obtained data indicated that the nanohybrids added into the UV curing diacrylate urethane matrices had significantly increased the abrasion resistance, relative hardness, and conversion of the acrylate groups of the nanocoating. In addition, the antibacterial test revealed that the nanocoating had good antibacterial property against E. coli, whereas for the pure coating (without ZnO-Ag nanoparticles), there was no antibacterial activity observed.",

These spherical substrates were examined using XRD and TEM methods, and by nitrogen adsorption studies at −196 °C. Subsequently, such cerium oxide particles prepared by calcination at 400–600 °C were used as catalysts for the conversion of isopropanol at 250–450 °C, using a flow method. The results obtained showed that increasing the heating temperature of the system investigated from 400 °C to 600 °C stimulated the formation of a well-crystallized CeO 2 phase having a crystallite size varying between 10 and 20 nm. Both the surface area and catalytic activity of cerium oxide were found to decrease on increasing the calcination temperature. All solids investigated behaved as dehydrogenation catalysts which were selective towards the formation of acetone. The heat treatment did not alter the mechanism of dehydrogenation of isopropanol, but changed the concentration of active sites involved in the catalyzed reaction without altering their energetic nature.",

MAS, prepared by calcining magnesium chloride-impregnated silicon dioxide at 773 K, exhibited an adsorption capacity towards metal ions that was 15- to 30-times larger than that of silicon dioxide. Batch sorption studies were performed as a function of contact time and pH. X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD), infrared spectral analysis (FT-IR), porosity and surface area measurements were used to characterize the physicochemical properties of MAS. At an initial concentration of 50 mg/ℓ, more than 90% removal of metal ions was achieved within 8 h contact time at a weak acid pH value. Of the kinetic models tested, the pseudo-second-order model gave the best fit to the kinetic data, while the Langmuir isotherm model provided the best fit to the equilibrium adsorption data for metal ions onto MAS.

The materials used generally presented good performance for ASA adsorption. Among the zeolites studied, HZSM-5 adsorbed large amounts of drug than the others. The Si-MCM-41 samples synthesized with fumed silica presented better adsorption performance than those synthesized with tetraethyl orthosilicate. The best mesoporous sample for adsorption synthesized with fumed silica was chosen for the kinetic assay. The adsorption kinetics of ASA for this sample fitted well to a second-order model. The initial loading rate and diffusion coefficient for the ASA–mesoporous sieve system were 0.153% (mg ASA)/(mg solid/minute) and 5.02 × 10 −17 m 2 /s, respectively.

Immobilization strategies studied were non-specific adsorption and covalent coupling through amine groups. Adsorption isotherms were well fitted by the Langmuir–Freundlich model. The coverage of TNWs containing HRP adsorbed by covalent coupling was 1.56 mg HRP m−2 and the residual enzymatic activity was approximately 40%. The enzymatic activity of free HRP and immobilized HRP was monitored as a function of storing time.

An increase in copper loading or silica content resulted in an increase in the adsorption capacity of the zeolite for phenol.

Carbon aerogel (CA) was used as the carbon material. Several kinds of CAs with different pore sizes were prepared. Porosities of CAs were characterized by a nitrogen adsorption measurement at 77 K. Adsorption measurements showed that mesopores with diameters between 15 and 25 nm were the most suitable for lysozyme adsorption. However, because the size of lysozyme is less than 5 nm in length, this adsorption behaviour suggests that lysozyme molecules may associate with one another to form clusters on mesopores of CAs. This is a unique behaviour because it is well-known that lysozyme indicates monolayer adsorption on the flat surface. The X-ray diffraction patterns of lysozyme-adsorbed CA showed a few peaks originating from the structure of lysozyme. The strongest peak of a bulk species of lysozyme was shifted by heating because of changes in its secondary structures. Lysozyme-adsorbed CA showed behaviours different from that of bulk species of lysozyme on heating. The recovery of biological activity of lysozyme denatured by heating was promoted by CA. Thus, hydrophobic mesopores of CA influence the stability of the structure of lysozyme.",

In order to reduce the irreversible adsorption capacity of the resin, styrene monomer was polymerized in microparticles of the resin. Effects of polymerized styrene concentrations and multi-cycle polymerization on irreversible adsorption capacity of the resin were investigated.

Isotherm experiments revealed that the maximum Pd(II) uptake estimated by the Langmuir model was 156.03 mg/g, which was 22.4 and 35.6 times higher than that of the oyster shell powder (OSP) and calcium silicate hydrate (CSH), respectively. The Pd(II) adsorption equilibrium was established in 180 minutes, according to kinetic experiments. These results suggested the possibility of Pd(II) recovery from oyster shell-based adsorbent. Through five adsorption and desorption cycles, the reusability of PEI-CSH was confirmed. PEI-CSH can therefore be considered a potential adsorbent for Pd(II) recovery.",

The resulting material was characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), infrared spectroscopy (IRS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Then, the removing performance of the DR/PPy material for anionic dyes was explored. The impact of key variables such as the amount of adsorbent, initial dye concentration, pH, adsorption temperature, and contacting time on the adsorption efficiency was examined. The result disclosed that the adsorption efficiency of DR/PPy for methyl orange, sunset yellow, and amaranth was satisfactory. In pH of 7, initial concentration of 100 μg mL -1 , and DR/PPy dosage of 1.5 g L -1 , the removal efficiency reached 97.31%, 98.48%, and 98.20%, respectively. The adsorptive kinetics and thermodynamic process were analyzed subsequently. The adsorption of anionic dyes on DR/PPy conforms to the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models with maximum adsorption capacity ([Formula: see text]) of 193.05, 171.23, and 147.71 mg g -1 for methyl orange, sunset yellow, and amaranth, respectively. Finally, a possible mechanism involved in the adsorption system was put forward. This study implies a reasonable feasibility for the effective utilization of waste to control the pollution.",

    "abstract": "Ferrihydrite and fulvic acid are prevalent components of soils and can significantly influence the environmental behavior of Cr(VI) in these matrices. Prior research has investigated the sorption behavior of Cr(VI) by ferrihydrite and fulvic acid independently; however, the sorption-reduction capacity of Cr(VI) by the ferrihydrite-fulvic acid complex, which is ubiquitously present in soils, has been less explored. In this study, ferrihydrite-fulvic acid complexes (Fh-FA) with varying C/Fe mole ratios were synthesized, and the adsorption-reduction behaviors of Cr(VI) on Fh-FA were examined using batch experiments, FTIR, BET, XRD, SEM-EDS, and XPS. The results demonstrate that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model can accurately describe the adsorption process of Fh-FA on Cr(VI), which can be delineated into three stages: rapid adsorption (0-30 min), slow adsorption (30-120 min), and reaction equilibrium (&gt;120 min). The adsorption of Cr(VI) on Fh-FA primarily occurs through chemisorption. FTIR and XPS analyses revealed that Cr(VI) is initially adsorbed by Fe-OH on the Fh-FA surface. However, as the C/Fe mole ratio of Fh-FA increases, more Fe-OH is complexed by -COOH from FA, resulting in a decrease in the adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) by Fh-FA. The number of phenolic hydroxyl groups from FA also increases, providing additional electrons to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) with increasing C/Fe mole ratio. This study not only emphasizes the adsorption-reduction behavior of Cr(VI) by ferrihydrite-fulvic acid complexes but also uncovers the interplay between C/Fe mole ratios and Cr(VI) adsorption-reduction, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the relative roles of Fe hydroxides and natural organic matter in soil environments. These findings have significant implications for Cr(VI) management in soils, enhancing our capability to protect and sustain the environmental quality.",

In this study, hydrochar was made by hydrothermally carbonizing corncob wastes and then activating them with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). According to the findings, the adsorption capabilities of hydrochar generated at prolonged retention durations, lesser liquid-to-solid ratios, and elevated temperatures were considerably greater. The hydrochars were then analyzed utilizing a variety of characterization methods, and batch tests involving the sorption of rose bengal dye were carried out under a variety of conditions. According to the findings, activated hydrochar has a specific surface area of 12.794 m 2 /g. In order to better understand and characterize the process of rose bengal dye adsorption, sorption kinetics, and sorption equilibrium onto the produced hydrochars, sorption kinetics and isotherms were further examined through experimental data fitting. The NaOH-activated hydrochar’s adsorption capacity was 799.9 mg/g, respectively. The objective of this research was to assess the viability of using NaOH-activated hydrochar derived from corncobs as an economical and efficient sorbent for eliminating anionic dyes like rose bengal from aqueous solutions.

    "abstract": "This review examines the significance of the zeta adsorption model in physics and its integration with statistical mechanics within the field of interface adsorption. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing research, this study presents the collective findings and insights derived from the reviewed literature. The zeta adsorption model, proposed by Ward, has gained recognition for its seamless extension into the thermal disequilibrium region without encountering singularities. By incorporating principles from quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics, this model offers fresh perspectives on the adsorption of gas molecules on solid surfaces. Notably, it demonstrates enhanced accuracy in describing the adsorption performance of mesoporous materials and nanomaterial surfaces, surpassing the limitations of traditional models such as the BET isotherm. Additionally, this review explores the behavior of cluster formation under varying temperature and pressure conditions. It highlights the correlation between increasing pressure ratios and the decreased availability of empty adsorption sites, resulting in the formation of larger clusters within the adsorbate. Ultimately, this process leads to a transition from adsorption to condensation, where the liquid phase wets the solid surface. Moreover, the zeta adsorption model provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding crucial aspects of gas-solid interface adsorption. It enables the determination of the distribution of adsorbate clusters on gas-solid interfaces, facilitates the identification of wetting pressure ratios during phase transitions, and allows for the calculation of solid surface tension under conditions of zero adsorption. Noteworthy parameters such as the bonding strength ( β) between the solid surface and adsorbed atoms significantly influence the overall strength of the solid-fluid interaction. Furthermore, the phenomenon of surface subcooling, which necessitates sufficient energy for the transformation from adsorbed vapor to condensate liquid, plays a pivotal role in studying interface phase transitions. Additionally, this review investigates the thermodynamic stability of the adsorbate through an analysis of molar latent heat. It reveals that beyond a critical adsorbate coverage, the formation of critical-sized clusters and the ensuing interactions among these components render the adsorbate unstable. This instability prompts a transition from the interface to a liquid phase, followed by subsequent adsorption onto the surface. In summary, this literature review highlights the significant contributions of the zeta adsorption model to the field of physics, particularly in the context of interface adsorption. It serves as a valuable tool for studying various materials and cluster formation, thanks to its seamless extension into the thermal disequilibrium region and its incorporation of principles from quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics. By presenting a synthesis of existing research, this review sheds light on the advantages of the zeta adsorption model and paves the way for further investigations into gas-solid interface adsorption phenomena.",

The results obtained showed that Na 2 O doping followed by heating in air at 600°C leads to enhanced crystallization of the CuO crystallites to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant present, while doping followed by heating in air at 700°C hinders the solid–solid interactions between CuO andA12O 3 , and leads to the production of CuAl 2 O 4 . The specific surface area was found to increase progressively as a function of the dopant concentration for the solid calcined at 700°C.

It has been shown that the use of simple oxides as catalysts led to the extensive oxidation of ethane while the use of aluminosilicates allowed the generation of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. The presence of phosphorus in the modified catalysts favoured the formation of aldehydes and led to an increase in aldehyde concentration as well as the appearance of alcohols among the oxidation products of n-alkanes, e.g. ethane. Thus, the addition of phosphoric acid to γ-Al 2 O 3 resulted in the formation of formaldehyde as a useful product.",

The effects of this treatment on the surface characteristics of these solids and their catalytic properties in relation to CO oxidation by O 2 have been investigated. The results reveal that Li 2 O doping at 0.75 mol% concentration resulted in an increase of 24% and 18%, respectively, in the value of the specific surface areas, SBET, of the solids precalcined at 500°C and 800°C, while the addition of 3 mol% Li 2 O led to a slight decrease of ca. 10% in the SBET value of the same solids. In contrast, irrespective of whether the doping process involved solids precalcined at 500°C or 800°C, a significant decrease of 37% and 78%, respectively, was observed in the catalytic activity of these materials. This decrease in catalytic activity was not accompanied by any appreciable change in the magnitude of the activation energy for the catalytic reaction, i.e. Li 2 O doping brings about a decrease in the concentration of catalytically active sites without changing their energetic nature.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of energetic heterogeneity has been discussed in the investigation of ion-binding and chemisorption processes. Both the calculation and the interpretation of the distribution of affinity constants are ambiguous. Methodological difficulties arise connected to the fact that electrostatic effects are difficult to separate from energetic heterogeneity because of the chemical biography of a given material. Only a close similarity between the distribution functions calculated for different ionic strengths allows the electrostatic interactions to be neglected. The numerical estimation of the distribution functions is complicated by the ill-posed nature of the problem. Some computational methods are briefly compared and methods for providing robust and unbiased estimations outlined. In contrast to differential distribution functions, the computation of integral ones may be transformed into the conventionally correct problem. On this basis, a fast and robust method for calculating integral distribution functions is proposed. In addition, this ensures numerically stable estimations of differential distribution functions. The method has been applied to a study of the energetic heterogeneity of 20 silicas chemically modified with aliphatic amines. When H + ions are chemisorbed, the energetic heterogeneity observed is dependent on the surface topography and its hydration state. In addition, the binding properties of ashless fulvic and humic acids relative to H + , Hg 2+ and Pb 2+ ions have been examined. The existence of functional groups with different acidities and complexing abilities has been established.",

In this context, oscillatory adsorption/desorption, phase transitions of the supported metal employed as the catalyst in the relevant oscillatory oxidation–reduction reactions as well as the reactions themselves have been considered. Based on an analysis of two oscillatory systems, of which one (i.e. the oscillatory alkylation of isobutane with butenes on a metal-free zeolite catalyst) is not complicated by any phase transitions, whilst the other (i.e. the oscillatory formation of an urea–octane complex via the interaction of urea with a binary vapour mixture of octane and non-complex-forming hydrocarbons) is not complicated by any chemical reactions, it is possible to infer that the source of the oscillatory properties of heterogeneous systems which involve the chemical interaction of their components is oscillatory adsorption which occurs as an uncomplicated self-supporting process which appears to proceed without any increase in the entropy of the system. The occurrence of oscillatory adsorption in a heterogeneous system leads to an oscillatory behaviour in the corresponding process, involving its simultaneous retardation in a similar manner as does the pendulum of a clock with respect to the untwisting of a spring or the oscillatory circuit of an electromagnetic system with respect to the discharge of a dry battery.",

As far as ion exchange properties are concerned, the effects of isomorphously increasing the number of aluminiums per unit cell are fourfold: (a) the unit cell volume increases; (b) the framework charge density increases; (c) there is a decrease in the ratio of the number of available crystallographic cationic sites to the number of framework charges on the lattice; (d) the zeolite becomes more hydrophilic. The effects of changing isomorphously the framework charge on the degree of hydrolysis, stability, and selectivity of the zeolite are discussed. The problems of attempting to correlate changes in selectivity with bulk properties of zeolites is first considered and then experimental data on hydronium exchange, the sodium/ammonium exchange in faujasites and lead exchanges in faujasites are presented.

The pure solids were prepared by wet impregnation with copper nitrate dissolved in the least amount of distilled water of finely powdered solid Al(OH) 3 precalcined at 400°C, followed by drying the resulting product and subjecting the same to calcination at 500°C. The doped solids were prepared by treating Al(OH) 3 precalcined at 400°C with a known amount of dopant, i.e. cerium or zirconyl nitrate dissolved in the least amount of distilled water, prior to impregnation with the copper nitrate solution. The amount of copper oxide thus introduced was fixed at 13.5 wt% while the amounts of dopants were varied between 1 wt% and 10 wt% CeO 2 or ZrO 2 . The results obtained indicated that ZrO 2 doping increased the degree of dispersion of the CuO phase, while CeO 2 treatment had the reverse effect. Doping the CuO/Al 2 O 3 system with CeO 2 or ZrO 2 led to an increase of 15.4% or 8.1%, respectively, in its BET surface area. The catalytic activity of the system towards the decomposition of H 2 O 2 decreased on doping with ZrO 2 but increased when CeO 2 was used as a dopant. γ-Irradiation (at 20–160 Mrad) of CuO/Al 2 O 3 solids resulted in a measurable and progressive decrease in their catalytic activity towards H 2 O 2 decomposition. In CO oxidation with O 2 , ZrO 2 treatment of the CuO/Al 2 O 3 solids brought about a progressive increase in their catalytic activity with the maximum value (a 31% increase) being observed in the presence of 3 wt% ZrO 2 but then decreasing with further increases in the amount of dopant present until the final value attained with 10 wt% ZrO 2 was smaller than that measured for the pure CuO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst sample. In contrast, the addition of the smallest amount of CeO 2 (1 wt%) led to an effective increase of 69% in the catalytic activity of the CuO/Al 2 O 3 system towards the O 2 oxidation of CO, which then decreased when further amounts of CeO 2 were added to the system although still exhibiting a catalytic activity greater than that of the undoped catalyst sample. Doping or γ-irradiation of the CuO/Al 2 O 3 system had no influence on the activation energy for the decomposition of H 2 O 2 in the presence of the resulting solid catalysts although the concentrations of catalytically active sites present on the surfaces of the solids investigated were modified by such treatment.",

The Cu 2+ ion uptake by oak shells increased with decreasing sorbent concentration or with an increase in Cu 2+ ion concentration or solution pH. The fractional factorial design technique was applied in order to determine the average Cu 2+ ion uptake, the contribution of each operating variable to the value of the uptake and the interaction among the operating variables when the sorbent type, sorbent concentration, Cu 2+ ion concentration, pH, contact time and salt were all varied from one level to another. Application of this technique showed that the sorbent concentration had the largest influence on the value of the Cu 2+ ion uptake followed by Cu 2+ ion concentration and sorbent type. Interaction among the different operating variables played an important role in the adsorption process.",

    "abstract": "Results of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of hydrogen storage at 303 K in ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) which are inverse replicas of cubic Im3¯m silica are presented. Of the ones investigated here, the highest gravimetric total storage of hydrogen (ca. 2 wt% at P = 22 MPa and 303 K) was observed for the OMC replica of the cubic Im3¯m material which was characterized by the largest lattice parameter and internal pore radius of the carbon sphere (a = 9.98 nm and R int ≈ 3.0 nm). However, the corresponding volumetric density of hydrogen did not exceed 17 kg H 2 /m 3 . The highest excess storage was observed for a threshold value given approximately by a ≈ 7.98 nm and R int ≈ 2.4 nm. Above this value, the excess storage and volumetric density of hydrogen did not change. The adsorption was dominated by the bulk storage, with the adsorbent serving as a tank whose storage properties were governed by the available space for hydrogen molecules (bulk storage) and not by physical adsorption (i.e. densification of the supercritical fluid on the walls of the porous material). The calculated average value for hydrogen adsorption in internal spaces was twice as high as in the internal spaces of the spherical cavities, i.e. in the lattice parameter range of the Im3¯m OMC replicas that were studied experimentally at 303 K. Our calculations indicate that the calculated maximum gravimetric weight per cent and volumetric density of hydrogen lay well below the target of 2010 for 6.0 wt% and 45 kg H 2 /m 3 indicated by the United States Department of Energy. The storage of hydrogen at 303 K and P &lt; 22 MPa in the OMC replicas of the cubic Im3¯m silica was effective against compression of the hydrogen fluid. However, it was not sufficiently effective to justify the application of these materials for the development of fuel cells for the automobile industry.",

A simple model enabling the prediction of the adsorption equilibria of butan-1-ol/water vapour and toluene/water vapour mixtures on SKT activated carbon is then presented. Such predictions were made on the basis of data for the pure components, with the equilibrium data for both pure components and mixtures being taken from the literature. The model, which is simple to simulate and verify using experimental data, is based on the Polanyi theory and the Dubinin–Astakhov isotherm equation. With this model, fairly good agreement was observed between predicted and experimental binary mixture adsorption data for the systems examined.",

The differential heat of adsorption exhibited three descending segments corresponding to the adsorption of n-heptane on three types of surfaces. The mean molar adsorption entropy of n-heptane in the monolayer was less than the entropy of the bulk liquid by ca. −23 J/(mol K), thus revealing a hindered state of motion for the n-heptane molecules on the surface of rutile. Simulations of the adsorption of n-heptane were performed on the three most abundant crystallographic faces of rutile. The adsorption isotherm obtained from the combination of the isotherm for each face weighted by the respective abundance was found to be in good agreement with experimental data. A structural characterization of n-heptane near the surface was also conducted which indicated that the substrate strongly perturbed the distribution of the n-heptane conformations relative to the situation found for the gaseous phase. Adsorbed molecules are predominantly orientated with their long axes, with the zig-zag planes of their backbones parallel to the surface and preferentially aligned along the five-fold cus Ti 4+ ions of the faces. Fewer gauche conformations were observed for molecules near the surface than was characteristic of the bulk phase.",

Low-pressure adsorption techniques coupled with derivative isotherm summation (DIS) analysis of the experimental curves gave quantitative information on the decrease in the calcite surfaces and the increase in the WRM surfaces. The modelling results enabled the monolayer capacity for WRMs as measured by argon adsorption to be correlated with the disappearance of calcite surfaces and the disappearance of high-energy adsorption sites as measured by nitrogen adsorption. In addition, the argon results suggested that WRMs first adsorb on argon low-energy carbonate faces and then on low- and high-energy faces. With water, the adsorption energy distribution remained unchanged in shape, indicating that this molecule can diffuse into the adsorbed layer between and around the adsorbed hydrophilic heads of the WRMs and thereby interact directly with the carbonate surface.",

However, such adsorption processes are quite complicated and are influenced by the solubility of oxycellulose, its composition and the character of the components released into the supernatant, as well as by the presence of other competitive substances and ions in the aqueous solution. The adsorption capacity of oxycellulose increases with increasing –COOH group content and is distinctly increased by the presence of other competitive ions in the aqueous solution.

The experiment results indicated that the adsorption denitrogenation performance of allochroic silica gel was more superior to other three adsorbents. The silica gel and allochroic silica gel were confirmed by characterization with X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption–desorption, and ammonia temperature programmed desoption (NH 3 -TPD). X-ray diffraction results indicated that both the samples were amorphous structures. The average pore diameters of silica gel and allochroic silica gel were 18.46 and 1.80 nm, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas were 437.86 and 623.39 m 2 /g, and the pore volumes were 0.9724 and 0.3442 cm 3 /g, respectively. The results of TPD showed that the acidity of allochroic silica gel was far stronger than that of silica gel which greatly enhanced its adsorption denitrogenation performance. The adsorption denitrogenation performance of allochroic silica gel for quinoline, aniline, and pyridine from model diesel was as follows: aniline, pyridine, and quinoline. Adsorption temperature, particle size, and arenes added in model diesel had little impact on the removal of aniline and pyridine except quinoline. The adsorbent-to-oil ratio had significant effects on adsorption denitrogenation, especially for quinoline. The N–Co bond between Co in allochroic silica gel and N atom in the basic nitrogen compounds molecule played a significant role. Furthermore, the allochroic silica gel could be easily regenerated by its adsorption denitrogenation performance for quinoline and pyridine by using calcination once or several times, except aniline. The adsorption isotherm results revealed that the adsorption of pyridine and aniline belonged to the Langmuir–Freundlich binding model, but the adsorption of quinoline belonged to Freundlich model.",

Results present that the characteristics of excess adsorption isotherm under high pressure is different from the characteristics of excess isotherm under low pressure; adsorption obtained by adsorption experiment increases with pressure going up until reaching a peak and then declines with further increase in pressure.

In addition, the effect of different parameters such as air flow rate, initial dye concentration and clay mass on the adsorption using clay has been investigated.

Our results showed that the calculated external mass transfer coefficient increased with the increase in air flow rate and mass of clay, but decreased with the increase in initial dye concentration. For the external mass transfer, different coefficient variables can be correlated by the following dimensionless correlation: Sh/Sc 0.33 = 261.65 (F) 0.165 (C 0 ) −0.743 (m) −0.311 . The intra-particle diffusion coefficient, K P , was found to increase with the increase in air flow rate and initial dye concentration, and with the decrease in the mass of clay. For the intra-particle diffusion, the studied variables can be correlated by the equation K P = X (variable) Y . The results of this study reveal that air flow rate has more influence on increasing the rate of adsorption than the initial dye concentration and mass of clay.",

Moreover, different gases generate distinct distributions for the same AC. These facts go against the concept of PSD, which must be unique for a given sample, irrespective of the probe gas used. We analyzed adsorption isotherms of WV-1050 AC sample with nitrogen at 77 K, carbon dioxide at 298 K and methane at 303 K, yielding their respective PSDs, based on local isotherms database (kernels) generated through grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. The PSD obtained for nitrogen and carbon dioxide was used (individually) to reproduce the three experimental isotherms and significant deviations were observed. By applying a volume normalization methodology, the isotherm fitting was significantly enhanced. Furthermore, a more realistic model of AC pores considering etched slit walls was tested to improve PSD similarity. The new model presented tends to unify the PSDs obtained from different probe gases evaluated.",

The materials under study were characterized in terms of surface area and cation-exchange capacity (CEC). Our study results indicate that treatment with formic acid can increase the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, CEC and adsorption capacity of clinoptilolite. The maximum adsorption on these non-metallic minerals was 25 mg/ml, beyond which the adsorption decreased as the amount of adsorptive increased. Time-dependent studies showed that the adsorption process reached equilibrium after 2 hours. The adsorption on E. coli K 88 increased with increasing concentration of the adsorption agent as well as with increasing concentration of the bacteria in suspension. The desorption of H + was studied by washing with a sterile physiological saline solution for 2 hours. The adsorption–desorption hysteresis suggests that the desorption rate of acid-modified clinoptilolite was much lower than that of natural clinoptilolite (P &lt; 0.05). Acid modification of clinoptilolite increased the amount of bacterial adsorption due to the attractive interactions between the clinoptilolite and the bacteria. This increase may also involve the BET surface area and the surface characteristics of clinoptilolite.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen adsorption studies have been employed to examine the structural properties of micro-/meso-porous carbons obtained by colloidal templating and post-synthesis KOH activation. These carbons were prepared by polymerizing phenol and formaldehyde in the pores of a colloidal silica template followed by carbonization, silica dissolution and post-synthesis KOH activation. Colloidal silica was used to create spherical mesopores, while KOH activation was performed to create additional microporosity and to enlarge the surface area of the resulting carbons. Nitrogen adsorption studies showed that a single impregnation of the colloidal silica template with phenolic resin precursors afforded carbons with relatively thin pore walls which did not withstand the post-synthesis KOH activation; however, a double impregnation generated mesoporous carbons with thicker pore walls. Activation of these latter carbons with KOH created micropores in the mesopore walls without significant deterioration of the mesopore structure. The resulting mesoporous carbons possessed high specific surface areas (ca. 800 m 2 /g) and large single-point pore volumes (ca. 1.8 cm 3 /g). The post-synthesis KOH activation enlarged the surface area up to 1500 m 2 /g, which was achieved via the creation of microporosity. Hence, the carbon obtained by double impregnation and activation exhibited a single-point pore volume of ca. 2 cm 3 /g with a relatively high microporosity which attained 17% of the total porosity. High-surface-area micro-/meso-porous carbons are attractive for adsorption, catalysis and energy-related applications such as capacitors and batteries.",

Base uptake versus time profiles in all cases indicated a rapid initial change followed by a slower process. These can be interpreted in terms of either a solution kinetic model or an adsorption kinetic model. In the former analysis, the adsorption-time profile can be interpreted in terms of two, or at most three, exponentials. The contribution of the first fast step increases with decreasing average particle size (or increasing surface area), consistent with its interpretation as being associated with the replacement of accessible protons on the exposed surface of the EMD by metal ions. The slower rate processes can be considered to be associated with adsorption in less accessible clefts or pores in the structure. In the diffusion model, the experimental data were fitted to the equation of diffusion in a sphere, fitting again requiring a first initial step followed by a slower step, with one diffusion coefficient having typically an upper limit of 10-9 and the other a lower limit of 10 -11 cm 2 /s. For the complete reaction, the moles of protons released per mole of metal ion adsorbed were also measured and found to be relatively insensitive with respect to pH, metal ion concentration, electrolyte concentration and EMD size fraction. At pH 4, the H + : M n+ ratio ranged from 1.4 to 2.1 (±0.1) for divalent transition metal ions, consistent with dominant chelation of the divalent metal ion to two adjacent oxygen sites on the surface; for thallium(I), a low ratio (0.5) indicated a different mode of surface attachment.",

    "abstract": "By employing a sodium silicate + titanium tetrabutoxide + trimethylmyristylammonium bromide system, it has been possible to obtain mesoporous titanosilicate Ti–MCM-41-type molecular sieves containing systematically varying titanium contents. The samples obtained possessed a high BET specific surface area and exhibited the perfect hexagonal mesoporous structure characteristic for MCM-41 materials even when the titanium fraction present was as great as 20 mol%. It has been shown that most of the titanium can be expelled from the structure when the materials are treated with sulphuric acid solution. However, such treatment does not destroy their inherent hexagonal structure, thereby suggesting that the titanium is preferentially localized in the mesopore surface layer. The structure/sorption properties of the materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction methods and by the adsorption of n-hexane and water vapour. A possible mechanism for the formation of such MCM-41-type molecular sieves is proposed which suggests that the use of organometallic ethers M(OR) n , accompanied by ether solubilization with organic micellar templates, leads to the preferential localization of M in the mesopore surface.",

The adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K and of carbon dioxide at 298 K was investigated using a volumetric adsorption apparatus of a conventional type. The adsorption of water vapour at 298 K and the chemisorption of pyridine at 423 K was followed by means of quartz spring balances. Gasification with oxidizing gases increased the surface area and total pore volume, as measured by nitrogen or carbon dioxide adsorption. In most cases, comparable surface areas were measured by nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The adsorption of water vapour depended on the percentage burn-off and the gasification conditions. Chemisorption of pyridine at 423 K was found to be related to the chemistry of the surface rather than to the surface area or total pore volume.",

Simple theoretical models are presented in order to allow an approximate analytical treatment of TPDMS data. The ‘unimolecular’ decomposition of alkoxide groups was studied. The rate constants of the reactions were derived from TPDMS measurements. The kinetics of thermal transformations of phosphorous and phosphoric acids on a pyrogenic silica surface were investigated by TPDMS. Oxidation–reduction reactions in samples containing phosphorous acid resulted in the removal of molecular phosphorus (P 4 ). Two stages of phosphorus evolution were observed which were attributed to the disproportion of phosphorus in the surface monolayer (high-temperature stage) and in the bulk layers (low-temperature stage). The biologically active samples obtained by adsorption of cyanocobalamine, glucose and raffinose on ultrafine oxide surfaces were studied via a combination of temperature-programmed desorption and solid-state thermal analysis mass spectrometry (TPD/TA MS). The role of the charged cobalt atom and of the propionamide and benzimide groups in the adsorption mechanism is discussed. It was shown that the adsorption of cyanocobalamine on the silica surface transformed the propionamide group to a weakly bound form. TPD/TA MS data were obtained confirming the stable adsorption of glucose and raffinose on an ultrafine pyrogenic silica surface modified by amino groups.",

Modelling sorption phenomena involving the interactions of chemicals and particularly herbicides is very difficult because of the strong heterogeneity of the soil matrix. The present work presents the results of applying the most common models, i.e. Freundlich and Linear, as well as the newer concept of the Dual Reactive Domain model. The data obtained were validated using various statistical and chemometric methods. The results suggest that applying the non-linear least-squares method to obtain isotherm parameters gave a much better description of the sorption phenomena than often obtained using linear transformations of the adsorption equations. The study also showed that appropriate weighting schemes should be included in any model calculations. To test the goodness-of-fit of the model to the experimental data both the correlation coefficient and the Residual Root Mean Square Error were obtained. The models were also compared using the Extra Sum of Squares Principle statistical test.",

Batch adsorption tests were undertaken to study the removal of Cu 2+ and Ni 2+ ions from aqueous solutions using the above-mentioned types of activated bentonite. The adsorption capacity of the bentonites towards both Cu 2+ and Ni 2+ ions followed the order: Al-bentonite &gt; SDS-bentonite &gt; T-bentonite &gt; natural bentonite. The initial metal concentration, solution pH, temperature and salinity of the solution affected the adsorption capacity towards both metal ions. The uptake of Cu 2+ ions increased with an increase in temperature (25–45°C) as well as with an increase in the initial pH of the solution (3–5). The uptake of Cu 2+ and Ni 2+ ions decreased significantly with an increase in the NaCl and KCl concentrations present in the aqueous solution.

The experimental isotherms were fitted to the homogeneous Langmuir model and the binary Langmuir model. Variation of the model parameters with solution pH was studied. The fitted parameters obtained from the Langmuir equations (homogeneous and binary models) showed that both the maximum amount of solute adsorbed (Qmax) and the adsorption affinity of the carbon (K1) towards the electrolytic adsorbate exhibited the more significant decrease. Under pH conditions below the pKa value of p-nitrophenol (when the adsorbate existed in a molecular form), both the solubility of the adsorbate and the electron density of its aromatic ring were significant factors affected the extent of London dispersion interactions. At higher solution pH values, electrostatic forces had a significant impact on the extent of adsorption. The influence of pH must be considered in terms of its combined effect on the carbon surface and on the solute molecules. It was confirmed that the uptake of the molecular forms of the aromatic solutes was dependent on the substituents attached to the aromatic ring. The adsorption of p-nitrophenol at higher pH values depended on the concentration of the anionic form of the solute present in the aqueous solution.",

To model such systems, a common approach is to define a pseudo-adsorbent with equilibrium properties equal to the mass fraction weighted average of the components in the mixture. The selection of an appropriate mass-transfer rate constant for the mixture is, however, more complicated. In this study, we have derived simple relationships between the linear driving force rate constants for a pseudo-mixture in terms of the rate constants, equilibrium parameters and mass fractions of the components of the mixture. The reciprocal rate constant for a mixture of adsorbents was shown to be related to the mass fraction weighted average reciprocal rates of the components of the mixture for the case of equal equilibrium isotherms. Expressions of greater complexity resulted for non-linear and non-equal isotherms. Experimental testing was undertaken of the breakthrough behaviour in adsorbent mixtures using the air system with mixtures of CaX and NaX in an adiabatic packed column. The mass-transfer behaviour of the solid mixtures was in good agreement with that predicted by the simple models.",

Various pore models were used for the carbon phase. The pyrocarbon structure and distribution on the TiO 2 /SiO 2 supports depends primarily on the structural features of the titania phase which exhibits catalytic activity in the pyrolysis of organic materials. The formation of relatively large concentrations of pyrocarbon typically reduces the porosity and specific surface area of the hybrid adsorbents produced.",

The kinetics, adsorption isotherm, equilibration time and effect of pH on such removal were studied to optimize the conditions necessary for large-scale application. Rapid equilibration was observed with adsorption equilibria being attained within 10 min. The adsorption of cobalt ions onto the plain (undoped) sol–gel silica was negligible. The maximum adsorption of Co(II) ions onto the TAR-doped sol–gel silica from single solutions was 12.6 mmol/g. The TAR-doped sol–gel silica could be regenerated by washing with a 0.1 M HCl solution to give a maximum regeneration value as high as 98.5%. The TAR-doped sol–gel silica could be used for more than three consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles without experiencing any considerable loss of adsorption capacity. The adsorption process and the nature of the Co–TAR complex were discussed.",

All the adsorption isotherms in the studied systems could be adequately fitted by the Langmuir model, thereby indicating the existence of an exothermic adsorption process for phenol, BCA and aniline. At low equilibrium concentrations, the individual uptakes in the single-component systems were higher than those in binary-component systems because of competition between the two types of adsorbate molecules towards the adsorption sites. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the total molar uptakes of adsorbates in the binary-component systems at high equilibrium concentrations were larger than the uptakes in the single-component systems. In binary-component systems, a large excess of aromatic acids was noted on the adsorbent surface at saturation, presumably as a result of a cooperative effect arising primarily from acid–base interaction between the loaded adsorbates.",

The method does not require an analysis of the sorptive gas phase in adsorption equilibrium and can be automated fairly simply. It consists of a simple volumetric/manometric gas expansion arrangement combined with the measurement of the density of the sorptive gas mixture in equilibrium via the buoyancy of a sinker fixed to a microbalance. These gas density measurements can be performed on-line preferably with a magnetic suspension balance (MSB) (Rubotherm GmbH, Bochum, Germany, 2-site-type). The experimental lay-out of the instrument used is given and the measurement procedure is outlined. The theory of the measurement is presented and expressions for experimental uncertainties of component masses adsorbed are provided.

The results obtained showed that the sediment sample was negatively charged over a large range of pH values, with the model calculations matching well with the experimental results. Increasing pH value and low ionic strength, as well as high solid concentrations, led to a decrease in the adsorption of AT. The existence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the sediment/water system also influenced the uptake of AT by the sediment. A large increase in AT adsorption occurred for sediment pre-incubated with DOM, with a decrease in AT uptake occurring when herbicide was pre-incubated with DOM.

The aim is to prove new insights about the appropriate adsorption materials for metalloporphyrin fabrication. The equilibrium isotherms were measured at five adsorption temperatures (from 290 to 330 K) through the microbalance (QCM) method. The discussion of the experimental observations indicated that the adsorption of the aluminum chloride and the iron chloride was performed via a monolayer process. On contrary, the participation of the chloride ions in the double-layer adsorption of the indium chloride was explained by the layer-by-layer process. Overall, the statistical physics modeling of the experimental curves indicated that the number of ions per adsorbent site [Formula: see text] was found inferior to 1 for all the adsorption systems (multi-interaction process for the three ions). Interestingly, the physicochemical investigation of the three adopted models showed that the complexation mechanism of the tested porphyrins was an endothermic process since the two steric parameters ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) increased with the rise of the temperature. The FeCl 3 curves were discussed via a monolayer adsorption model which includes the parameters [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (lateral interaction description), indicating the lowest stability of the formed iron-porphyrin complex. The energetic study showed that the adsorption energies [Formula: see text] of AlCl 3 on H 2 TTPP and H 2 TPP are superior to 40 kJ/mol (chemical adsorption mechanism), whereas the adsorption mechanisms of FeCl 3 and InCl 3 took place via a physical process since they presented adsorption energy values lower than 40 kJ/mol.",

    "abstract": "The mobility of Cd(II) in soils, sediments, and aquatic systems is strongly dependent on adsorption behaviors occurring at the mineral-water interface, and this process may be influenced by the presence of organic phosphorus (OP). In this study, we investigate Cd(II) adsorption onto amorphous aluminum hydroxide (AAH), both in the presence and absence of OP, represented by the widely abundant myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP). Isothermal adsorption experiment coupled with attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and 1 H solid-state NMR spectra were employed. Physiochemical characterization shows that IHP can increase the surface negative charge and the number of surface sites. Isothermal results show that high IHP loading enhances Cd(II) adsorption while no obvious increase is observed at low IHP loading. The overall effect of IHP on Cd(II) sorption depends on the extent of two positive processes, i.e., (1) IHP can form ternary complexes with adsorbed Cd(II) on AAH and (2) IHP can increase the negative surface charge of AAH, and a negative process, i.e., AAH competes with Cd(II) for AAH surface sites. ATR-FTIR results confirm the possible formation of three structurally distinct ternary complexes, i.e., the AAH-IHP-Cd, AAH-Cd-IHP, and AAH-Cd-IHP-Cd. The analysis of 1 H solid-state NMR demonstrates that IHP only increases the number of surface OH groups rather than changes their chemical environment and speciation. Cd does not bind to the AAH surface but mainly binds with the OH groups of IHP. All findings of this work suggest that the presence of high dose of OP promotes the retention of Cd(II) in soils, thereby decreasing their bioavailability to biota.",

In this study, after vernadite was synthesized by two different methods, the removal performance difference between the samples synthesized by the new and traditional methods (Ver-H and Ver-OH, respectively) was explored by sample characterization, phenol degradation, and Pb 2+ adsorption experiments. The results show that, compared with Ver-OH, Ver-H has a larger particle size, specific surface areas, and total organic carbon (TOC) degradation capacity; the equilibrium degradation capacity of TOC of Ver-H was increased by 31.3%. The difference in the amount of TOC degradation may be attributed to more Mn(IV) oxygen vacancies in Ver-H, which facilitate the removal of intermediate products formed during phenol degradation. In addition, the larger specific surface areas provide the mineral surface with a larger number of active sites; Ver-H can therefore adsorb more intermediate products to promote their mineralization into CO 2 . The adsorptions of Pb 2+ by Ver-H and Ver-OH are both consistent with Langmuir isothermal adsorption, and the maximum adsorption capacities are 569.79 g/kg and 623.10 g/kg, respectively. The lack of significant difference indicates that both vernadites have strong adsorption capacities for Pb 2+ .",

Moreover, it can change its color from olive drab to light cyan depending on the adsorbed Ce 4+ concentration, and the chroma is linearly related to the Ce 4+ concentration. So, UA can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively detect Ce 4+ by its color changing. The kinetics of adsorption course was investigated in details.

    "abstract": "Magnetic composite fabricated from polyaniline and Fe 3 O 4 -hydrotalcite (Pan/MHT) was successfully applicated for removal of methyl orange (MO) from wastewater. The structure and properties of Pan/MHT were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometer, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller adsorption isotherm. Adsorption kinetic results indicated that the adsorption process followed pseudosecond-order kinetic model ([Formula: see text]), MO adsorption onto Pan/MHT was well described by Freundlich isotherm ([Formula: see text]), and the MO adsorption capacity of 2 Pan/MHT obtained the highest with [Formula: see text]. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out using magnetic composite with the effects of initial MO concentration, solution pH, and adsorbent dosage. The results revealed that the magnetic Pan/MHT exhibited efficient adsorption of MO in the aqueous solution as a result of the affinity for organic dyes, microporous structure, and suitable surface area for adsorption (15,460 m 2 /g). The superparamagnetic behavior of Pan/MHT (with[Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and[Formula: see text]) helps that it could be separated from the solution and performs as an economical and alternative adsorbent to removal and degrade azo dye from wastewater. Pan/MHT was also investigated to reuse after desorption of MO in 0.1 M HCl, and the results show that 2 Pan/MHT can be reused for 4 cycles with [Formula: see text]",

    "abstract": "Terpenic oil (TO) is commonly used as a flotation frother for the selective separation of sulfide minerals. As a frother, most reports have mainly focused on its effect on froth stability and froth entrainment, whereas its influence on the floatability of sulfide minerals has received little attention. In this work, the influence of TO on the flotation behavior of sphalerite was investigated by using microflotation tests, contact angle and zeta potential measurements, and FT-IR and SEM-EDS analyses. Microflotation tests conducted in a modified Hallimond tube indicated that compared with the collector potassium butyl xanthate (KBX), the flotation recovery of sphalerite was significantly increased when TO was added to the pulp, but the recovery of Cu-activated sphalerite with the addition of TO was lower than that with the addition of KBX. Contact angle measurements demonstrated that the contact angle of sphalerite was distinctly increased by the addition of TO, but the contact angle of sphalerite treated with TO was lower than that treated with KBX after Cu activation. Zeta potential measurements demonstrated that the zeta potential of sphalerite particles was slightly decreased when treated with TO, and the isoelectric point (IEP) was decreased from 3.3 to 3.1 due to the interaction of TO with sphalerite particles. FT-IR and SEM-EDS confirmed that TO could be adsorbed on the sphalerite surface on the formation of the oil film due to its low solubility, thereby increasing the surface hydrophobicity of the sphalerite. In addition, the TO absorbed on the surface acts as a bridging role and promotes the hydrophobic agglomeration of sphalerite particles. These results suggest that except for froth entrainment, the influence of TO on the flotation behavior of sphalerite may be another reason for the misreporting of sphalerite in concentrates.",

The chitosan was characterised in terms of its average degree of de-acetylation (DD) and by XRD, TGA/DTG, IR, SEM and specific BET surface area methods. Batch adsorptions experiments were carried out at different pH values and dye concentrations. It was found that the adsorption process was favoured by acidic pH conditions (4.0–6.0). The adsorption followed second-order rate kinetics and the experimental equilibrium data followed the Langmuir isotherm, thereby suggesting that chemisorption might be the major adsorption mode. Such adsorption also occurred on chitosan fibres, although to a significantly lower extent than on crushed chitosan. The corresponding thermodynamic parameters (ΔG 0 , ΔH 0 and ΔS 0 ) were calculated. The positive values obtained for ΔH 0 (161.7 kJ/mol) and ΔS 0 [559.9 J/(mol K)] suggest that the adsorption process was endothermic, with the randomness of the system increasing during the adsorption process. A simplified adsorption model has also been proposed.",

The mesoporous materials, characterized by a varied pore structure with highly developed surface and large pore volume, were obtained. The porous structure of materials under investigations was characterized by the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption–desorption method as well as by power spectral density calculated from the calorimetric investigations of water confined in the pores. Moreover, the thermodesorption of water using the quasi-isothermal thermogravimetry was used to characterize their thermal and surface properties. The adsorbed water layers and the concentration of weakly and strongly bound water as well as the surface free energy on the adsorbent–water interfaces were calculated. It was stated that the increase of titania content causes a gradual decrease of specific surface area and has a significant effect on the porous structure formation. The water thermodesorption from the surface proceeds in few stages because of the porosity created by TiO 2 . The decrease in the total surface free energy (Δ G Σ ) can be observed with the increasing TiO 2 content. The largest Δ G Σ value at the adsorbent/strongly bound water interface is exhibited by the adsorbents of Si-100 series. The lowering of the freezing/melting points of water contained in the pores of the studied materials is strongly connected with their porous structure.",

However, the precondition to realize this method is to define the characteristic particle size of drilling cuttings. Therefore, this paper performed adsorption and desorption experiments under different particle size ranges and dissimilar adsorption equilibrium pressures, solved the gas migration control equation in coal particles, and determined the characteristic particle size from experimental results and simulation effect. The results showed that gas desorption quantity was positively correlated with adsorption equilibrium pressure, while negatively correlated with the size of a particle size range. The greater the adsorption equilibrium pressure, the better the linear fitting relationship with the maximum desorption quantity, and the maximum correlation coefficient could reach 0.9658. Based on Darcy’s law, Langmuir adsorption equation, and mass conservation law, the theoretical control equation of gas migration in coal particles was derived and solved by Open source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM). The accuracy of the calculation results of the solver was verified by the derived analytical solution of the gas pressure change of coal particles without considering the adsorption. From the experimental results and simulation results, the characteristic particle size of drilling cuttings was determined to be 0.5-1 mm. The research can provide help for the subsequent development of direct gas content measurement technology based on image processing.",

The wild willow tree found in Tonglushan is a fast-growing Euphorbiaceae plant, which has strong tolerance to the heavy metal copper (Cu) and has the characteristics of developed root system, barren resistance, and high economic value. Taking willow as the research object, this paper studied the composition, copper enrichment sites, morphology, subcellular distribution characteristics and absorption, transportation, and enrichment mechanism of willow root exudates under copper stress through hydroponic and pot experiments. By adding phosphate fertilizers, inducers, and other agronomic control measures, the strengthening technology and mechanism of Cu-contaminated soil phytoremediation were studied. The main research contents and results are as follows: the results of hydroponics and pot experiments show that the willow tree has a certain tolerance to Cu, and Cu mainly accumulates in its roots. Oxalic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, and malic acid are the main organic acids in willow root exudates. Root exudation activity acidified the rhizosphere soil, increased acid exchangeability, and reducible Cu content, while other forms of Cu content decreased. Root exudates affect the uptake and accumulation of copper by willow trees by altering the bioavailability of copper in soil.",

The main intent of this work is to assess the combination of pressure sand filter (PSF), ultrafiltration (UF), ozone (O 3 ), and granular activated carbon (GAC) to treat wastewater and evaluate its suitability for water reuse. The experiments were carried out in a following condition: [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text]. Configuration 1 was found to be more effective when compared to the other two and almost there occurred complete removal of contaminants. Whereas configuration 2 had the lowest removal efficiency of all, and configuration 3 had quite positive results. The influence of process parameters such as ozone dosage, flow rate, and filtration time was optimized. The optimized filtration time was 20 min with the filtration feed flow rate of 300 LPH. The best configuration of this treatment process produced a removal efficiency of about 80 to 90% with the ozone dosage of 8.33 mg/L with a flow rate of 4 l/min, whereas there occurred complete removal by the subsequent action of GAC. Moreover, the biodegradability of wastewaters as measured by the BOD 5 /COD ratio increased from 0.45 to 0.53. The proposed integrated pilot-scale process was effective in removing contaminants to the required level of discharge in the environment or reuse and it will pave the way to provide significant benefits to wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "The inaccurate calculation of the gas lost is the principal cause of inaccurate determinations of the coalbed methane content via air reverse circulation sampling (ARCS). The positive pressure environment has a significant impact on gas desorption during the sampling process. To obtain the gas desorption mechanism of coal particles under positive pressure, positive pressure desorption experiments were conducted on coal samples with different particle sizes under different adsorption equilibrium pressures using a self-designed positive pressure desorption experimental device. And a positive diffusion model for coal particles was established, in which the diffusion coefficient was calculated based on the results of the positive desorption experiments. The diffusion model was then used to simulate the diffusion capacity of coal particles and compared with the test data. The results show that the responses of the positive pressure desorption and atmospheric pressure desorption to the adsorption equilibrium pressure are similar. The gas desorption velocity increases as the adsorption equilibrium pressure increases. Positive pressure can effectively inhibit gas desorption. The initial gas desorption velocity decreases as the positive pressure and coal particle size increase. Concurrently, the entire sample desorption process during ARCS can be divided into three stages: a slow desorption stage, an accelerated desorption stage, and an atmospheric desorption stage. The relationship between the diffusion coefficient and the positive pressure exhibits an exponential distribution, and the positive pressure diffusion model can describe the gas diffusion from coal particles well. The results of this study could help to establish a gas loss compensation model for the ARCS process.",

The adsorption mechanism of coal to H 2 S was explored, and an occurrence equation for H 2 S in coal seams was fitted through adsorption experiment results. The results showed that under ambient temperature and pressure conditions, the H 2 S adsorbed by coal reached equilibrium within 24 h. The increase in H 2 S concentrations and the moisture content of coal samples resulted in an increase in the adsorption capacity of H 2 S. Chemical adsorption of H 2 S by the coal also occurred. The total sulfur content in the coal increased, and water promoted the conversion from H 2 S to sulfur in coal. After adsorption, most of the H 2 S remains in the coal structure in the form of inorganic sulfur, such as sulfur hydride, iron sulfide sulfur, and monomeric sulfur, and a small proportion of H 2 S is bonded in the structure of the coal in the form of organic sulfur such as thiophene, C-S-C, and C-SH. Therefore, the higher the total sulfur content in coal, the greater the occurrence of H 2 S. The total amount of H 2 S increased exponentially with the concentration of free H 2 S and the moisture content of coal at equilibrium. This meant that the total amount of H 2 S in the coal seam could be estimated by fitting an equation according to the concentration of free H 2 S and the moisture content of coal seams. The concentration of free H 2 S decreased linearly with the increase in moisture content of the coal, therefore, the concentration of H 2 S in space could be reduced by injecting water into coal seams.",

Analysis of the natural clay under test showed that it was composed, approximately of 51% kaolinite, 46% montmorillonite and 3% illite, having a specific surface area of 65 m 2 /g. The natural clay was treated with different activators (HCl, NaCl and H 2 O 2 ) to enhance its adsorption capacity towards nickel. The efficiency of such activation was greater by 16.0% and 23.2% in the case of NaCl and H 2 O 2 , respectively, relative to untreated clay. No significant increase in the adsorption capacity was brought about by HCl treatment. A limited comparison has been made between clay and activated carbon by performing isotherm studies under similar conditions. The results indicate that the adsorption capacity of clay activated with H 2 O 2 , clay activated with NaCl and natural clay is 216.9%, 204.2% and 176.1% that of activated carbon, respectively. Based solely on the adsorption capacity, an economic analysis demonstrates that natural clay is the cheapest material, followed by clay activated with NaCl and clay activated with H 2 O 2 . The relative costs of removing nickel using natural clay, clay activated with NaCl and clay activated with H 2 O 2 were found to be 2.8%, 5.4% and 25.4%, respectively, that of activated carbon.",

The textural parameters of all the samples prepared were determined from the adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) techniques were used to elucidate their structures. The catalytic properties of the solids so prepared in the catalytic cracking of cumene were investigated using a pulse microcatalytic technique. The surface areas evaluated for the various Cr 2 O 3 /SiO 2 samples studied were found to decrease gradually on increasing their Cr III content, the calcination temperature and on addition of Ni, Mo and V oxides. DTA and XRD studies demonstrated the absence of any interaction between the SiO 2 and Cr 2 O 3 , with the latter being the only phase capable of detection by these techniques. Samples impregnated with Ni, Mo and V ions also showed no interaction between these ions and Cr 2 O 3 and SiO 2 , with only the corresponding oxides being detected. The results obtained for the catalysis studies also indicated that the cracking of cumene depended on the metal content, impregnant cations and thermal treatment of the solids employed.",

Pure and treated solid samples were subjected to thermal treatment at 300°C, 500°C and 700°C, respectively. The results obtained revealed that Li 2 O treatment of NiO solid brought about a measurable decrease (30–63%) in its BET surface area, S BET , and a decrease of 20–44% in its total pore volume, V p , especially for the solid samples calcined at 700°C. The observed decrease in the S BET value of NiO due to treatment with Li 2 O was attributed to transformation of some of the Ni 2+ ions into Ni 3+ ions with a subsequent contraction in the lattice and also to pore widening. The catalytic activities of all the doped catalyst samples investigated showed that their catalytic activity was smaller than that measured for the untreated samples. The catalytic activity, expressed as the reaction rate constant per unit surface area (k), was effectively decreased by the doping process. Although this process increased the number of Ni 3+ ions, it decreased the activity of the treated solids because of the formation of Li + –Ni 3+ ion pairs which could not readily exchange electrons with the reacting substrate (H 2 O 2 ). The formation of such ion pairs may take place at sites associated with the most active Ni 2+ ions. The doping process did not modify the mechanism of the catalytic reaction but decreased the concentration of active sites involved in the catalysis of H 2 O 2 decomposition without changing their energetic nature.",

The pure sample was prepared by thermal decomposition at 600°C of aluminium hydroxide impregnated with a calculated amount of Co(NO 3 ) 2 dissolved in the least amount of distilled water. The MoO 3 -treated samples were prepared by thermal decomposition at 600°C of aluminium hydroxide treated with different proportions of ammonium molybdate followed by treatment with Co(NO 3 ) 2 solution. The crystalline phases produced by thermal treatment of the pure and treated samples precalcined at 600°C were characterized using an XRD technique. The surface and catalytic properties of the various catalysts were studied using nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and CO oxidation by O 2 at 100–150°C. The results obtained revealed that molybdena treatment of the Co 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 solids followed by precalcination at 600°C resulted in a decrease in the degree of crystallinity of the Co 3 O 4 phase produced. This treatment effected a progressive small increase in the specific surface area of the treated solids (ca. 10%). However, the catalytic activity was found to be increased considerably by increasing the amount of MoO 3 added (184%), reaching a maximum limit at 1.00 mol% MoO 3 . The activation energies of the catalytic reaction calculated for both the pure and MoO 3 -treated solids suggested that MoO 3 treatment did not modify the energetic nature of the active sites (surface cobalt species) but increased their concentration.",

It was established that, in water medium, the nature of the solid surface as well as the monomer concentration has only a very slight influence on the rate of grafting and the amount of polymer grafted, both of which depend on the specific surface area of the filler and the temperature. To explain these features, a microreactor polymerization model is proposed in which the filler particles or aggregates of the particles together with the immobilized macroinitiator and adsorbed monomer are considered as microreactors. As a result of graft polymerization, compatibilizing polymer shells were formed on the Al(OH) 3 and BaSO 4 particles. Due to solvation, such shells enhance the organophilicity of the filler surface sufficiently and provide a high steric stabilization of the filler dispersions in organic media. When both the adsorption of the macroinitiator and the graft polymerization of the monomer proceed in water medium, the efficiency of the process and its ecological cleanliness are increased greatly.",

Alternate oxidation–reduction on the Ni–NiO phase boundary occurred at temperatures higher than 633 K (Curie temperature of pure nickel). Using a magnetogravimetric method, it was found that the nickel catalyst was transformed by the reaction mixture into a heterophase (Ni/NiO) system both in the presence of a carrier and in its absence. Hence the carrier did not influence the size of the Ni particles. The high catalytic activity of the catalyst supported on graphite may be explained by an increase in the number of Ni particles.

Ruthenium red was used as the metal precursor of Ru/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The infrared spectra of ruthenium red and EDTA adsorbed on alumina indicated that interaction occurs between adsorbates and the support surface. An extension of the impregnation time by ruthenium red caused a slight shift of the asymmetric –COO − band that may be explained by interaction between ruthenium and adsorbed EDTA. The small change in the –COO − band position was due to the nature of the metal–EDTA bond formed. An increase in metal loading led to an increase in ruthenium dispersion. Measurements of the rate of hydrogenolysis of n-butane were carried out in a gradientless reactor. All kinetic experiments were conducted under conditions where the hydrogen/n-butane molar ratio was 9:1, and involved isothermal determination of the relationship between the n-butane reaction rate and the corresponding degree of conversion (iso-X).

The sorption kinetics followed the model of sorption from a semi-infinite solution, with sorption being of a two-stage nature. The first stage, involving the overwhelming majority of sorption centres, was very fast. In contrast, the second stage was rather slow and diffusion-controlled. A proper description of the protolytic equilibria on the aminosilica surface required account to be taken not only of the protonization of the grafted amino groups but also of their homoconjugation. The latter reaction resulted from interactions between neighbouring groups and led to the non-random (islandlike) coverage of the surface by amino groups. Both the nature of the background electrolyte in the solution and its concentration had no effect on the model structure. The thermodynamic equilibrium constants for the heterogeneous protonization reaction were determined from the dependencies of the mixed equilibrium constants on the concentration of the background electrolyte in solution. Chemisorption of H + ions, accompanied by penetration of the counterions into the subsurface layer, was of an endothermic nature and associated with increasing entropy.",

The structural properties of pure and doped oxide samples were determined by XRD methods, the textural properties were investigated via the adsorption of nitrogen at −196°C while the hydrogen peroxide decomposition activity of the investigated solids was determined by oxygen gasometric measurement of the reaction kinetics at 20–40°C. The dissolution of calcium ions in the Co 3 O 4 lattice at temperatures in the range 400–600°C was accompanied by a marked decrease in the mean hydraulic radii (r h ) and an increase in the surface area (S BET ) and total pore volume (V p ) of the prepared oxide samples.

The catalytic activity for H 2 O 2 decomposition on cobaltic oxide calcined at 400–700°C was found to decrease considerably on doping with CaO. The activation energy for sintering (ΔE s ) of the pure and doped solids was determined from the variation in their S BET values as a function of the calcination temperature of these solids.

    "abstract": "Batch adsorption experiments of copper(II) ions from aqueous solutions on to powdered marble wastes (PMW) have been performed. The latter is an effective inorganic sorbent which is inexpensive, widespread and may represent an environmental problem. The main parameters influencing the sorption process, i.e. initial solution pH, sorbent and Cu 2+ ion concentrations, stirring times and temperature, were examined. The results obtained revealed that the sorption of Cu 2+ ions on to PMW was endothermic in nature and followed first-order kinetics. Moreover, it was well described by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) adsorption models over the concentration range studied. Under the optimum experimental conditions employed, the removal of ca. 100% Cu 2+ ions was attained.",

    "abstract": "A micaceous mineral (MicaM) available locally in Kenya was utilized as an inexpensive and effective adsorbent for the removal of Cu 2+ ions from aqueous solution. The effects of contact time, pH, temperature, adsorbate and adsorbent concentrations, and the concentration of electrolyte on the removal of Cu 2+ ions were studied. Maximum removal of Cu 2+ ions occurred over the pH range 4.0–7.0. The adsorption of Cu 2+ ions increased with an increase in the dose ratio of mineral to Cu 2+ ion concentration and decreased with adsorbent particle size. Isotherm analysis of the adsorption data obtained at 25°C showed that the adsorption of Cu 2+ ions on MicaM followed both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The uptake of Cu 2+ ions increased on increasing the pH of the solution from 1.5 to 7.0 as well as on increasing the temperature from 25°C to 60°C. An adsorption capacity of 0.850 g/g was achieved for MicaM towards the Cu 2+ ion. This study has demonstrated that locally abundant micaceous mineral can be used as an effective adsorbent for the treatment of waters containing Cu 2+ ions without any prior chemical pretreatment.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption of Lennard-Jones fluids (argon and nitrogen) onto a graphitized thermal carbon black surface was studied with a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation (GCMC). The surface was assumed to be finite in length and composed of three graphene layers. When the GCMC simulation was used to describe adsorption on a graphite surface, an over-prediction of the isotherm was consistently observed in the pressure regions where the first and second layers are formed. To remove this over-prediction, surface mediation was accounted for to reduce the fluid–fluid interaction. Do and co-workers have introduced the so-called surface-mediation damping factor to correct the over-prediction for the case of a graphite surface of infinite extent, and this approach has yielded a good description of the adsorption isotherm. In this paper, the effects of the finite size of the graphene layer on the adsorption isotherm and how these would affect the extent of the surface mediation were studied. It was found that this finite-surface model provides a better description of the experimental data for graphitized thermal carbon black of high surface area (i.e. small crystallite size) while the infinite-surface model describes data for carbon black of very low surface area (i.e. large crystallite size).",

The adsorption affinity of proteins strongly depended on the Ca/P molar ratio of the Hap particles. In the case of BSA, the initial slopes of the adsorption isotherms increased remarkably with an increase in the Ca/P ratio. In contrast, the initial slopes of the adsorption isotherms for LSZ changed gradually with increasing Ca/P ratio. Finally, no Ca/P ratio dependence was observed in the MGB system. These results were explained in terms of the electrostatic interaction between the proteins and Hap. The negative values of ΔG ads for the BSA system increased from −34.0 kJ/mol to −36.1 kJ/mol with increasing Ca/P ratio whereas those for the LSZ system decreased from −37.9 kJ/mol to −30.8 kJ/mol. A diminished dependence of ΔG ads on the Ca/P ratio was observed in the MGB system. The adsorptions of LSZ and MGB onto Hap were exothermic which again supports an electrostatic attraction mechanism. In contrast, the adsorption of BSA onto Hap exhibited a large positive value for ΔH ads , indicating that the process was endothermic. The ΔS ads value of the LSZ system was negative while those for the BSA and MGB systems were positive. Positive values for ΔS ads , especially for the BSA system, indicate that the adsorption processes for BSA and MGB (both with a lower structural stability) were driven by an entropy gain, i.e. ΔS ads &gt; 0. Adsorption of these proteins onto the Hap surface was accompanied by a structural rearrangement.",

The catalysts employed were characterized by N 2 adsorption, O 2 chemisorption, TEM, XRD and FT-IR spectroscopy. Benzene and cyclohexene were the main components of the products, with the benzene and cyclohexene selectivities depending on the wt% cerium loading, the order of cerium and vanadium impregnation, and the reaction temperature. The best cyclohexane conversion and good benzene selectivity were obtained at 500°C using a vanadium catalyst modified by 10 wt% cerium. The same catalyst exhibited a maximum selectivity for cyclohexene at 300°C. Different types of vanadyl species present in the system were identified by IR measurements. Thus, vanadium-oxygen clusters were detected in the V 2 O 5 /Al 2 O 3 material, although such clusters were not found in the cerium-vanadium catalysts. Polymeric CeVO 4 species were detected in cerium-modified V 2 O 5 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts by XRD. The concentration of these species depended on the wt% cerium loading and the order of cerium and vanadium impregnation on alumina. The selectivity of cerium-modified V 2 O 5 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts towards cyclohexene was attributed mainly to the presence of such polymeric CeVO 4 species. Oxygen chemisorption and electronic microscopic studies attributed the marked improvement in cyclohexane conversion of the cerium-vanadium samples to the presence of relatively high-dispersed vanadium species.",

The pore structure, elemental composition and chemical nature of the functional groups attached to the surface of the activated carbon were investigated after such oxidation. The results obtained show that oxygen-containing complexes may be introduced efficiently via the combustion of nitrocellulose, with the adsorption capacity of the resulting activated carbon towards α-amylase being enhanced due to interaction between the amino groups of α-amylase and the oxygen-containing surface groups. Thus, oxidized activated carbons with α-amylase immobilized on their surfaces exhibited a hydrolysis activity greater than 63% (based on free α-amylase) after five runs, while the hydrolysis activity of α-amylase immobilized on the original activated carbon was only 15% after two runs. A simple method for introducing oxygen-containing complexes onto the surface of activated carbon through the use of nitrocellulose combustion is described in the present work. The resulting oxidized activated carbon may be used as a support for the immobilization of α-amylase, with the immobilized α-amylase exhibiting a high hydrolysis activity even after repeated use.",

Analysis of the structure and energetics of these clusters showed that their formation is governed primarily by the formation of hydrogen bonds, whilst energetic effects related to the change in the state of motion of the molecules during their adsorption also play a certain role. It was shown that the generalised Langmuir equation derived from molecular statistical considerations is capable of providing a good description of the experimental isotherm over a wide surface coverage range.

However, when the quantity of functional groups was increased to over 1.5 mmol/g, the amount of ammonium ions removed gradually decreased due to steric hindrance of the functional groups on the surface of the electrode and/or redox reactions with these groups. Similarly, it was found that the EDLC easily adsorbed nitrate ions but did not easily desorb them, whereas the opposite was the case for phosphate ions.

We have found that the turnover frequency (TOF) of sulphonated cation-exchange resins reflects the effect of morphology expressed in terms of fractal geometry. The correlation between the catalytic activity of various types of sulphonated resins and their fractal dimension was established. Difference in observed TOF of sulphonic resins of various morphological types is caused by various accessibilities of acid sites. Catalysts of more ordered structure (characterized by smaller fractal dimension) provide the best conditions for the adsorption–desorption of reactants and products resulting in large values of TOF.",

The establishment of the model was based on the assumption that the change in the standard chemical potential of the adsorption system should be zero if ion adsorption taking place spontaneously at a constant temperature is purely a thermodynamic process in which, driven by the electrochemical potentials, the ions move between liquid and solid phases without changing their chemical nature. Experiments have been conducted to test this assumption using the adsorption of Zn2+, Cd2+ and K+ ions from aqueous solutions onto swelling vermiculite, natural zeolite and synthetic zeolite. The results showed that the proposed model fitted the experimental data well. This study provides evidence that, under the conditions employed, ion adsorption reactions are essentially physical processes and the change in the standard chemical potential of the adsorption reaction is negligible.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new generic synthesis route for the single-step production of adsorbent hollow fibres, based on polymer dry/wet spinning followed by a phase inversion process, is presented. This main advantage of this preparation technique is that it avoids impregnation of precursors or the use of chemicals for zeolite deposition, while dramatically reducing production times and costs. Primary factors (polymer, solvent and temperature) affecting the structure and adsorption performance of adsorbent hollow fibres are studied. The adsorptive properties of HiSiv 3000 hollow fibres and their commercial particulate counterpart have been obtained in a laboratory-scale flow system using n-butane as the adsorbate. The fibres prepared from solvents such as N, N-dimethylformamide, N, N-dimethylacetamide and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and from three types of polymers, namely, polysulfone, polyethersulfone (PESF) and polyvinylidenefluoride, are compared. The adsorbent hollow fibre prepared from NMP/PESF gave the sharpest breakthrough curve and the longest breakthrough time compared with others including commercial adsorbent pellets. By applying this novel technique, fibres with unique adsorbent properties and a high surface area per unit volume ratio can be prepared with a range of adsorbents to target a range of pollutants. The proposed method is not just limited to HiSiv 3000; in principle, many adsorbents or catalysts may be used, which means that this method can pave the way for a new generation of energy-efficient low-pressure-drop adsorbent fibres with low mass transfer resistance.",

However, the amount of Cu(II) ions adsorbed at pH 6 was significantly higher than that adsorbed within the above pH range.

The equilibrium adsorption data for all the metal ions could be fitted by the monolayer Langmuir model.

FT-IR studies of indole, the metal oxides and the indole–metal oxide adduct showed that interaction occurred through attraction between the positively charged surface of the metal oxides and the negatively charged indole moieties.

The adsorption rate could be modelled by 1.3-order kinetic equations; first-order kinetic treatment only approximately described the process, but gave a better description than second-order kinetics. The hypothesis that adsorption was controlled by the intra-particle diffusion mechanism was not supported by the data. In addition, the technique enabled the construction of adsorption isotherms of ionic surfactants onto particles. In this case, the adsorption equilibrium was described by a Langmuir isotherm.",

It was observed in MCM-41 just above the capillary full filling. In SBA-16 samples, it only appeared for the fully hydrated sample exposed to the saturated vapour pressure, P 0 . When the pore remained hydrated below P 0 , expulsion of water was not observed. This is explained by the fact that expanded water fills the outermost vacant spherical pores at the particle surface. When an SBA-16 particle was fully wetted with liquid water, the freezing temperature of the pore water decreased slightly. This was caused by the pressure increase derived from occlusion of pore water with surrounding frozen ice. This form of water occlusion should be common in nature at low temperatures (biological cells, liposomes, porous stone, etc.) and was clearly identified in a well-defined porous system.",

The isotherm shape was in agreement with that predicted by the classic Langmuir equation. This model was therefore fitted to the experimental data in order to determine the adsorption equilibrium constant and the total concentration of adsorption sites. Kinetic parameters of adsorption were also determined. To do so, a theoretical model that predicts the tungsten concentration profiles in impregnated thin layers was fitted to the experimental profiles. The diffuse reflectance spectra of dried samples used for isotherm determination and of thin alumina layers impregnated with tungsten solutions exhibit a band at 215 nm which is accompanied by a shoulder at 250 nm. For samples having a greater tungsten concentration, the shoulder develops and then transforms into a second band. The maximum at the lowest wavelength (first maximum) is assumed to correspond to tungsten in a tetrahedral coordination (monomeric species) while the second maximum is due to distortion in the tetrahedral symmetry caused by strong interactions between the support and the monomeric species.",

It was found that protonation of mordenite eliminated any possible removal of CO 2 by specific adsorption but induced the dissociative adsorption of NO 2 with the formation of nitric acid-like adsorbed species and NO oxidation. FT-IR spectroscopic results confirmed that the Brönsted acid sites existing on H-type mordenites exhibit no interaction with CO 2 molecules but can catalyze the dissociative adsorption of NO 2 . Such properties, together with the lower adsorption temperature and the thermal stability of the adsorbent, suggest a promising process involving H-type mordenites whereby NO x can be selectively captured and returned to the dissolving solution while trace amounts of 14 CO 2 -containing carbon oxides pass through the system allowing their subsequent complete removal by entrapment in a solid matrix.",

In the presence of CO the ethene reacts with surface oxygen to give a surface acetate.

Samples with varying amorphous contributions were characterized by sorption uptake, XRD and chemical composition. The sorption uptake changes observed were found to be helpful in estimating the progress of the crystallization process. The influence of the amorphous contribution on the BET and Langmuir surface areas, and on the micropore void volume was examined using low-temperature nitrogen sorption methods. Estimation of the amorphous contribution by XRD has been compared with that estimated via sorption uptake using different probe molecules such as water, n-hexane, cyclohexane and benzene. The sorption uptake was found to be sensitive to the extent of amorphous content in the sample and to the characteristics of the probe sorbates. The sample with a 100% amorphous contribution as estimated by XRD methods exhibited lower values for this contribution when estimated by sorption techniques. The estimation of the amorphous contribution using benzene sorption data was found to be in excellent agreement with the amorphous contribution as estimated by XRD methods. A lower agreement was exhibited by the other sorbate probes studied.",

The extent of adsorption decreased with increasing adsorbent content and this has been explained by the decrease in surface available for macromolecular adsorption. Such decreases can arise from coagulation processes as well as from incomplete redispersion of the titanium dioxide particles. It has been shown that the maximum stability of the titanium dioxide suspensions occurs at polyelectrolyte concentrations well below the concentration necessary for adsorption saturation. As the degree of neutralization of the macromolecules increased the extent of adsorption decreased, the aggregation stability of suspensions in the presence of low molecular weight polymethacrylic acid remaining unchanged while that in the presence of high molecular weight poly-acid molecules decreased.

This is especially visible for oxidized carbon black.

    "abstract": "Various CuO/SiO2, Mn2O3/SiO2 and CuO–Mn2O3/SiO2 systems having different compositions were prepared using a wet impregnation method employing finely powdered SiO2 solid. The CuO content was varied in the range 5–20 wt% whilst that of Mn2O3 was changed in the range 5–30 wt%. In the tertiary systems studied, the Mn2O3 content was fixed at 5 wt% whilst that of CuO was 5 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively. The supported solids thus obtained were subjected to heat treatment at 300–700°C and the crystalline phases produced identified by XRD methods. The surface and catalytic properties of the various calcined solids were studied by nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and studies of the catalyzed decomposition of H2O2 in aqueous solution at 30–50°C. The results obtained revealed that although the silica support material employed was normally amorphous in nature when calcined at 500°C and 700°C, it crystallized after treatment with CuO followed by calcination at 700°C. Diffraction lines corresponding to CuO and SiO2 phases were detected in the XRD patterns of all CuO-treated silica samples calcined at 700°C. In contrast, only diffraction lines for a poorly crystallized Mn2O3 phase were observed in the patterns for all Mn2O3-treated silica samples calcined at this temperature. The specific surface areas of the systems investigated were found to decrease on increasing both the extent of loading and the calcination temperature. Thus, after calcination at 300°C, all the various systems examined contained mainly narrow pores whose diameter increased after calcination at 700°C; nevertheless, these adsorbents behaved as mesoporous materials. Their catalytic activity was strongly dependent on the extent of loading and the calcination temperature employed. The activation energy of the catalyzed reaction conducted over the various solids examined was not greatly affected by the extent of loading. When expressed in terms of the reaction rate constant per unit surface area (k̄), the catalytic activity for the catalyzed reaction carried out at different temperatures over the various solids decreased in the order: CuO–Mn2O3,/SiO2 > Mn2O3–CuO/SiO2 > Mn2O3,/SiO2 > Mn2O3 > CuO/SiO2. The mechanisms for the catalytic reaction in contact with the various solids were discussed.",

The formed complexes are suggested to be of the type (≡MeO)4–nCu(H2O)n+2, n = 2 for δ-Al2O3, one type of SiO2, (≡MeO)4Cu(H2O) for TiO2(Anatase), and one type of SiO2. An empirical relationship has been found between thermodynamic stability constants of the complex and the EPR-parameter g‖. This method is applied in a series of ternary complexes on δ-Al2O, of the type (≡AlO)2Cu L1L2(H2O)2(L1L2 = bidentate ligand) to yield information about speciation of Cu(II) and the corresponding stability constants. The copper hyperfine data are interpreted in terms of an LCAO-MO – approach. New possibilities arise for the interpretation of the behaviour of Cu(II) in biological systems. An alternative description is presented to the current picture of cation adsorption in layer silicates and systems of interest in catalysis (e.g. zeolites). ENDOR spectroscopy of copper(II) complexes on δ-alumina confirms the conclusions reached at EPR stage.",

The equilibrium adsorption of MB solutions of 6.5–7.0 × 10 −4 mol/l concentration and its dependence on pH were studied. At this concentration, ca. 30% of the adsorbent surfaces investigated were covered with MB molecules under optimal adsorption conditions. The presence of carbon deposits on the silica surface did not lead to a decrease in the adsorption capacity of Carbosils relative to that of hydroxylated silica. However, such deposits increased the resistance of the adsorbent towards the action of alkalis. Oxidation of the carbon deposit in the HTT process caused a further increase in this resistance. Hence, the adsorption mechanism of MB at equilibrium in individual systems of the type investigated can differ significantly. On the one hand, this mechanism is associated with the differing behaviour of silica over a wide range of pH relative to treated and untreated Carbosils and on the other hand with the specific properties of MB.",

All the samples studied contained a fixed amount of CuO (13.5 wt%) while the amount of ZnO dopant was varied in the range 0.68–6.46 wt%. The pure and variously doped solids were subjected to heat treatment (precalcination) in the temperature range 400–600°C. The samples obtained were investigated by XRD methods, nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and studies of their catalytic influence on the decomposition of H 2 O 2 at 20–40°C. The results obtained indicated that ZnO treatment of CuO/Al 2 O 3 followed by precalcination at 500°C led to a progressive decrease in the degree of crystallinity of the CuO phase to an extent proportional to the amount of ZnO present in the system. This suggests that such treatment led to a significant decrease in the particle size of the CuO crystallites produced. The BET surface areas of the treated solids increased on increasing the amount of ZnO present in the system. Similarly, the catalytic activity, as expressed in terms of the reaction rate constant for the decomposition of H 2 O 2 , increased on increasing the amount of dopant added to reach a maximum value (ca. 67%) when 1.7 wt% ZnO had been added to the system, and then subsequently decreased on further addition of dopant. It was found that ZnO treatment of CuO/Al 2 O 3 did not modify the activation energy of the catalyzed reaction but rather changed the concentration of catalytically active constituents without changing their energetic nature.",

The pure and MgO-treated solids were subjected to precalcination (thermal treatment) at 600°C and 800°C, respectively.

This system has the advantage that the mixture is ideal in the liquid state, which provides a convenient reference for the study of the adsorbed phase. The activity coefficients, as well as the excess enthalpy of immersion of the carbon into the liquid mixtures, provide information on the modifications in the adsorbed state with respect to the ideal mixture. It is also shown that the introduction of the activity coefficients derived from the solid–liquid equilibrium increases considerably the accuracy of the Myers–Prausnitz–Dubinin model for the adsorption of the vapour mixtures.",

Maximum activation with H 3 PO 4 occurred at 450°C. However, the adsorption capacities of the ZnCl 2 -activated carbons were far higher than those of carbons activated with H 3 PO 4 . Carbons activated with H 3 PO 4 or ZnCl 2 are mainly microporous with the non-micropores representing a small fraction of the total porosity. Although, the nitrogen isotherms are Langmuirian in shape, application of the Langmuir equation led to large monolayer capacities of uncertain confidence. The surface areas and micropore volumes determined by the application of the t-method of de Boer and the α S -method of Sing were comparable and were slightly higher than those determined by the application of the DR model based on micropore filling. The t-method and the α S -method are complementary to each other and would seem to give confident values because they are based on standard reference non-porous materials. The micropore region may be sub-divided into two sub-regions distinguished by the different filling mechanisms involved.",

The lowest adsorption capacity (45 ng/mg) was found for MIP synthesized in chloroform, while MIP prepared in acetonitrile had the highest adsorption capacity. In order to complement the experimental observations, HyperChem software-based computer simulations were used to calculate the interaction energy between B[α]P and the functional monomer (methacrylic acid) in different solvents.

The presence of an organic solvent plays an important role in the formation of pores which, in turn, have a profound effect on the polymer adsorption properties.",

The adsorption/desorption properties of areca alkalids on six macroporous adsorption resins and a macroporous cation-exchange resin D151 were evaluated. The results showed that D151, AB-8 and XAD-7 resins presented a higher adsorption capacity, adsorption ratio and desorption ratio than the other resins studied. Equilibrium and kinetic adsorption data for areca alkalids onto these three resins were obtained. Such data were best fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters showed that D151 resin possessed the greatest adsorption capacity and the highest adsorption rate of the three resins, with the adsorption of areca alkalids being spontaneous and endothermic. To optimize the operating parameters for enriching areca alkalids, dynamic adsorption and desorption tests were undertaken employing a column packed with D151 resin. The optimum parameters for adsorption were an inlet areca alkalid concentration of 2.24 mg/mℓ, a feed volume of 7 BV and a flow rate of 6 BV/h; for desorption, the corresponding conditions were the use of ethanol as the elution solvent at a feed volume of 8 BV and a flow rate of 1.5 BV/h. After treatment for only one cycle with D151 resin, the content of areca alkalids in the product was increased from 8.28% to 81.78% with an overall recovery of 87.40%. Moreover, D151 resin exhibited excellent re-usability for at least three adsorption/desorption cycles. The results obtained showed that macroporous resin could provide a feasible means for the large-scale preparation of areca alkalids from areca nut extract.",

A new form of linearity relationship connecting the current rate and the equilibrium constant at definite degrees of surface coverage is derived. The relationship can be applied to complex chemisorption processes when determination of the rate constant is impossible. Linear correlations between the activation energy and the adsorption enthalpy, as well as between the entropy characteristics and pre-exponential factors, are obtained. The complex effect of the energy and entropy factors on the kinetics and the equilibrium is discussed theoretically and verified experimentally. These factors operate through a thermodynamic and a kinetic compensation effect. The present paper illustrates the correlation methods employing experimental results derived from the study of the chemisorption of the optical brighteners Leucophor AP and Tinopal UP onto pulp, of Fe 3+ and Cu 2+ ions onto fibrous polyampholyte and of hydrolysis-modified polyacrylonitrile (HMP) onto pulp.",

These sequential procedures yielded the following: magnetite–polyvinyl alcohol, nanoparticles of magnetite–polyvinyl propenepoxide and nanoparticles of magnetite–PVAC–ADA (Fe–PVAC–ADA).

Assuming a pore-filling impregnation of alumina spheres, a model that interprets this process was used for the calculation of theoretical profiles which showed a smooth decrease in concentration along the sphere radius. In turn, the experimental profiles were similar to those predicted for impregnations with solutions of heptameric molybdate, monomeric molybdate and monomeric tungstate. For polymeric tungstate, however, the experimental tungsten concentration rapidly fell to zero near the sphere surface. Using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, it was observed that the molybdenum was in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination in spheres impregnated with polymeric or monomeric molybdenum solutions; in addition, the ratio of the concentrations of these species was approximately the same. The species observed in spheres impregnated with tungsten solutions was monomeric tungstate, indicating a distortion in tetrahedral symmetry as a consequence of interaction with the alumina.",

Ammonia adsorption increases appreciably upon surface oxidation of carbons with oxidizing gases and solutions. The acidic groups on the surface of carbons differ in their strength. Only a fraction of the surface covered by the carbon–oxygen groups is responsible for the capacity of the carbon towards ammonia.

The inhibiting effect of TPP is estimated as 100% for an inhibitor concentration of 0.0005 M. Potentiodynamic polarization data indicate that both compounds act predominantly as cathodic inhibitors. The maximum inhibition efficiency was afforded by CMTPP at low concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations the protection efficiency of TPP increases. This was discussed on the basis of steric hindrance. The mode of adsorption of the inhibitors on the steel surface is proposed, as well as empirical kinetic equations based on the cathodic reaction.

The best results were obtained in the purification of copper(II) and nickel(II) salts on Chelite S with functional thiol groups, Duolite ES-346 with functional amidoxime groups and Lewatit TP-214 with functional thiourea groups. A decrease of palladium(II) content below 5 × 10 −5 % was obtained in the process of purification of macroquantities of these salts. In addition, these ion exchangers possess a considerable ion-exchange capacity (e.g. 3.18 mequiv. Pd/g for Lewatit TP-214) and a high resistance to mineral acids.",

From these descriptions, their surface charge heterogeneity and new definitions of ‘pure’ phyllosilicates, especially ‘pure’ montmorillonite and ‘pure’ kaolinite are inferred. The heterogeneity of cation-exchange sites in some English soils is compared with those of the 2:1 phyllosilicates. Differences in the ‘differential heat:fractional K saturation’ relationships between soil phyllosilicates before and after treatment with potassium salts and with farmyard manure illustrate the effects of such treatments on site heterogeneity.",

Comparison of Henry constants K 1 and initial heats of adsorption q̄ 1 of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds with those of hydrocarbons of a similar structure has shown that adsorption of the studied heterocyclic compounds on HTGTCB depends on the number and position of nitrogen atoms in their molecules. An increase in the number of nitrogen atoms in flat molecules of azoles (pyrrole, pyrazole, 1,2,4-triazole) brings about the growth of K 1 and q̄ 1 . In six-membered cycles the growth of K 1 and q̄ 1 is observed only during the transition from pyridine to 1,2-diazine (pyridazine), whereas in transition to 1,3- and 1,4-diazines (pyrimidine and pyrazine), and further on to s-triazine, the retention greatly reduces. In azanaphthalenes (quinoline, cinnoline, quinoxaline) and benzazoles (indole, indazole) the growing number of nitrogen atoms also results in weaker retention.",

It eliminates the use of carriers and allows catalysis to be conducted via an aerosol of finely milled active catalytic materials. Problems associated with the strength and thermal stability of catalysts are thereby avoided. A high and constant catalytic activity is ensured for the aerosol catalyst by integrating the chemical reaction zone and the mechanical treatment zone. Thus, solid particles that move with the reactant flow or special devices that allow mechanical treatment of the catalyst particles may be located in the reactor. Such aerosol catalysis has been tested in processes involving partial and complete oxidation, recovery, vinylation, chlorination and dechlorination. Relative to traditional systems, i.e. placement of the active catalytic active material on the carrier, the reaction rate was increased by 4-5 orders of magnitude. The production of catalysts and the implementation of chemical reactions are thereby both simplified simultaneously.",

Two industrial insulin-processing fractions (one glucagon-rich and the other insulin-rich) were evaluated qualitatively under these conditions, resulting in an increase in glucagon purity for both fractions with a purification factor of five for the latter.",

    "abstract": "A generalized mathematical model is presented to describe the process of multi-component adsorption onto porous media in fixed beds. The model was applied to the binary adsorption, without reaction, of aromatics and sulphur compounds onto a fixed bed of Porocel clay for kerosene deodorization using linear, Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms independently. A computational scheme for the solution of the model equations is presented. The scheme is based on orthogonal collocation for spatial discretization of the resulting set of coupled hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equations for the macro-and micro-system, respectively. Michelsen's modified third-order semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method combined with step-size adjustment strategy was used to integrate the resulting 4N ordinary differential equations. Excellent agreement between the simulated results and pilot plant data was obtained for the breakthrough profiles for the non-linear adsorption isotherms of Freundlich and Langmuir. No agreement was obtained for the linear isotherm. Also, using the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, the exit concentration of the less preferentially adsorbed component (aromatics) exceeded its inlet concentration to the adsorption column for a certain period. This is indicative of the behaviour of competitive multi-component adsorption: relative to aromatics, sulphur compounds are selectively adsorbed onto Porocel clay. The relationship between solid- and liquid-phase concentration profiles for the Freundlich isotherm revealed the formation of multiple adsorption layers upon the primary mono-molecular layer. Again, for the Freundlich isotherm, the structure of the profiles exhibited a highly pronounced maximum for sulphur. An experimental breakthrough time of 8 h was also predicted for both aromatics and sulphur compounds using the non-linear Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms.",

In this study, kaolinite-supported Ni catalysts (1–7 wt%) were prepared and characterized, and their activity in the catalytic hydrogenation of toluene at atmospheric pressure established. XRD, DSC, N 2 adsorption and TPR methods were used as characterization techniques. XRD revealed that interaction occurs between the Ni species and the support at low Ni content (up to 3 wt%) but decreases as the Ni loading increases. This results in an increase in the number of Ni active sites with increased Ni loading and is reflected in the catalytic activity towards toluene conversion into methylcyclohexane, which increased as the Ni content of the catalyst increased. Modification by post-impregnation with KNO 3 or Zn(NO 3 ) 2 (2–6 wt% K or Zn) affected the extent of interaction between the Ni species and the support. Thus, the catalytic activity increased in the presence of 2 wt% modifier (K or Zn). However, at higher levels of modification (4 and 6 wt%), the catalytic activity decreased relative to that for the unmodified sample containing the same Ni loading. This loss in catalytic activity increased as the modifier content increased. Furthermore, in the presence of K as a modifier, the decrease in toluene conversion was accompanied by a shift in the temperature of maximum conversion from 200°C for the unmodified sample to a value of 250°C. This was attributed to the covering of the Ni active sites by some incompletely decomposed KNO 3 .",

Irrespective of the presence of the surfactant, the alkylphenols were always adsorbed by the same mechanism. However, on adding the non-ionic surfactant TX100 to the medium, the adsorption properties were modified in a manner which depended on the alkyl chain length of the alkylphenol molecule. The longer the chain length, the weaker the influence of the TX100 surface aggregates on the adsorption behaviour. In terms of the relative hydrophobicity of these molecules, this behaviour is unexpected. However, it may be due in part to the adsorbing properties of the alkylphenols that are capable of self-aggregating at the bentonite/water interface and in part to the limited swelling capacity of the TX100 micelles or surface micelles.

    "abstract": "Yttria-stabilized zirconia powders with 3, 5, 8 and 10 mol% yttria added (Z3Y, Z5Y, Z8Y and Z10Y, respectively) were prepared. XRD studies indicated that the Z3Y and Z5Y samples were tetragonal whereas Z8Y and Z10Y were found to be cubic in shape. The specific surface areas of the various samples were obtained from nitrogen adsorption isotherms. These showed that as the mol% Y 2 O 3 increased in the samples, an initial increase in surface area occurred up to 5 mol% Y 2 O 3 but thereafter started to decrease. The microporosity of the powders was calculated by applying the Dubinin—Radushkevich (D—R) equation to the data obtained from the nitrogen adsorption studies. D—R plots were found to be linear over the low relative pressure region, followed by an upward deviation at higher relative pressures for all five systems examined. This deviation from linearity corresponded to the existence of a heterogeneous system of micropores, capillary condensation in the transitional pores or multilayer formation on the macropore walls. The adsorption of methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), n-propanol (PrOH) and n-butanol (BuOH) on pure and yttria-stabilized zirconia was undertaken at temperatures between 273 K and 303 K. The corresponding isotherms obtained were all of type II in the BDDT classification. Specific surface areas were calculated from these isotherms using the Langmuir and BET adsorption isotherm equations and found to be a maximum for the Z5Y powder.",

The differences and similarities between chemisorption and the formation of a solid oxidation product on metals are indicated.

The dependence of the heat of adsorption on the surface structures being formed and their concentration is discussed. It was shown that the relationships discussed in various published works between the values of the initial heat of adsorption and the formation enthalpies of the compounds are only experimental and not based on thermodynamic principles. The initial heats of adsorption, binding energies in gaseous molecules and cohesive energies for the oxidation products of metals are discussed for O 2 and H 2 chemisorption.",

The development with activation temperature of several characteristic parameters of the resulting carbons, i.e. bulk density, yield, surface area, meso-, micro- and ultra-micropore volumes, and cation-exchange capacity, was examined. All these parameters were recalculated relative to the volume of adsorbent (to obtain their practical effectiveness) and then related to the same quantity of precursor (to yield their economic efficiency).

This paper focuses on the static equilibrium adsorption behaviours and the confirmation of chemisorption characteristics. An equation relating the amount chemisorbed and the assumed chemisorption equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in the aqueous solution was established. This shows that the data may be fitted perfectly by the Langmuir equation. The adsorption capacities measured at different temperatures and the static desorption efficiency reveal that the adsorption of 2,4-dichlorophenol from water onto ZH-01, ZH-02, ZH-03 or GAC occurs via a simultaneous process involving physical adsorption and chemical reaction.",

In this study, the effects of several environment factors on As(III) removal ability of complex minerals are determined through the analysis of mineralogical characteristics of the complex synthesis of hematite and kaolin, using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and specific surface area. In the results, the XRD patterns of hematite and kaolin complexes indicate that the loading covers up some characteristic peaks of minerals in kaolin, which can be that hematite loading decrease the order of structure for some minerals. With increasing Fe content, the hydroxyl sites gradually increase, therefore strengthening the As(III) removal ability of complexes. With increasing the As(III) concentration, the removal ratios of kaolin on As(III) almost keep unchanged and that of complexes show no obvious regularity. However, with the pH increasing, the removal ratios of all samples keep increasing. Furthermore, the increasing of As(III) concentration and pH both improve As(III) removal amount significantly, especially for As(III) concentration. In addition, there is no forming of new mineral through it as observed by XRD. Therefore, hematite loading can promote the As(III) removal on kaolin through adsorption in different environments, which can provide a better method for the remediation of arsenic pollution.",

The results showed that the soil substrate of the tested rare earth tailings exhibited four forms of degradation: soil acidification, soil desertification, nutrient depletion, and heavy metal contamination by rare earth elements (REEs). The application of fertilizer alone (CK treatment) did not support Chinese cabbage growth, whereas different amounts of lime combined with fertilizer supported plant growth and significantly reduced the activity of the rare earth heavy metals. The height, fresh weight, and REE content of the Chinese cabbage plants were significantly reduced with an increase in the amount of lime applied. Addition of lime not only significantly improved the soil pore space and reduced soil acidification but also significantly increased the soil nutrient content. Our findings suggest that lime combined with fertilizer can improve ionic rare earth mine tailing soil degradation, thus promoting plant growth and achieving the improvement of ionic rare earth mine tailings without soil dressing.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is one of the key limiting factors for the growth of forests and their net primary productivity in subtropical forest ecosystems. Phosphorus leaching of the forest soil to the catchment and groundwater in karst region is the main source of water eutrophication. Strong P sorption capacity of minerals is generally assumed to be a key driver of P leaching in subtropical ecosystems which varies among different soil types. Here, we estimated P adsorption capacity of the O/A and AB horizon in both limestone soil and red soil of subtropical forests by fitting the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm to investigate the potential environmental risks of P. The maximum P sorption capacity ([Formula: see text]), P sorption constant ([Formula: see text]), P sorption index (PSI), degree of P saturation (DPS), and maximum buffer capacity (MBC) were calculated. The results indicate that [Formula: see text] of the O/A horizon in both soils were similar. Comparing these two soils, the red soil had a higher [Formula: see text] and MBC in the AB horizon; [Formula: see text] of limestone soil was larger but [Formula: see text] was lower, indicating that the adsorption capacity of limestone soil was weaker and MBC was lower. There was no significant difference in PSI between the two soils. The DPS values of both soils were below 1.1%, indicating that P saturation is low in both subtropical forest soils due to the lack of marked anthropogenic disturbance. In the O/A horizon, P saturation associated with available P (DPS M3 and DPS Olsen ) and that associated with P in the Fe-Al bound state (DPS citrate ) were higher in the red soil than in the limestone soil. DPS did not differ significantly in the AB horizon, except for higher DPS M3 and DPS citrate in the red soil. The findings highlight the influence of the soil types on P adsorption. The P adsorption and buffering of red soils were higher than those of limestone soils, indicating a lower risk of P leaching in red subtropical forest soils.",

The extent of oxalic acid removal was increased by optimising parameters such as the adsorbent employed, the contact time, the initial concentration of oxalic acid, the pH value of the aqueous solution and the temperature. Activated carbon removed a higher percentage of oxalic acid than any of the other adsorbents studied. The experimental data obtained could be fitted by the Langmuir adsorption model and also followed first-order kinetics. In addition, the negative value of the enthalpy obtained indicated that the adsorption process was exothermic in nature.",

    "abstract": "The behaviour of different polymers in the adsorption and removal of bisphenol A (BPA) from aqueous solutions was examined in order to identify the mechanism controlling the process. Three polymers with different functional groups were prepared and employed in our laboratory; they were characterized both texturally and chemically in terms of their surface areas, pore-size distributions, total exchange capacities and other parameters. The adsorption isotherms of bisphenol A were obtained and accurately modelled by the three-parameter Langmuir–Freundlich (LF) isotherm, the binding parameters calculated directly by the LF fitting coefficients indicating that increasing temperature was helpful in causing the adsorption process to move from positive cooperativity to negative cooperativity. The kinetic data were found to be well represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the functional groups of the polymers had a significant influence on the adsorption mechanism of BPA. The adsorption of BPA basically depended on the chemical nature of the polymers and the pH value of the solution. The adsorption process was favoured by the molecular form of bisphenol A, since this controlled the surface complexes produced between the polymer surface and the bisphenol A molecules, with the resulting increase in adsorbent–adsorbate interactions being positively influenced by the temperature.",

The first set of experiments employed an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/ℓ and 3 g of tree barks in order to determine the contact time for breakthrough. Then, the adsorption isotherm constants were obtained for BB41 and BY51 employing concentrations varying between 25 mg/ℓ to 800 mg/ℓ and between 25 mg/ℓ to 500 mg/ℓ, respectively, using the same amount of E. camaldulensis barks. The constants determined via the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms indicated that both isotherm models were adequate for explaining the adsorption process. According to the Langmuir isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacities (Q max ) of the E. camaldulensis barks for BB41 and BY51 were 164.17 mg/g and 54.68 mg/g, respectively. The applicability of various kinetic models was also investigated. The results indicated that the adsorption kinetics conformed to intra-particle diffusion. Finally, the dimensionless constant separation factor for the adsorbent/adsorbate system was determined.",

The system with hydrolysable tannic acid (AL) initially provided quite small spherical particles at concentrations up to 10 −2 wt% and finally irregular small hematite particles at 2 × 10 −2 wt%. In the system with condensed non-hydrolysable tannic acid (KT), on the other hand, the hematite particles became ellipsoidal in shape at concentrations above10 −2 wt%. The formation of ellipsoidal particles was explained by the adsorption of KT molecules onto the growing polynuclear primary particles. TEM and XRD measurements revealed that all the hematite particles produced from FeCl 3 /HCl solutions with tannic acids are polycrystalline. The rate of phase transformation from β-FeOOH to hematite was accelerated as the concentration of AL increased, whereas no significant change was observed for the KT system. Analysis by t-plots revealed that the porosity of the hematite particles changed from mesoporous to microporous when the concentration of AL increased. In contrast, the presence of very low amounts of KT molecules (10 −5 and 10 −4 wt%) produced non-porous hematite particles via strong aggregation of polynuclear (PN) particles by hydrogen bonding between hydroxy and carboxy groups. Not only the morphology but also the pore size of hematite particles was controlled from non-porous to mesoporous by using different kinds of tannic acids.",

The gas retention capacity of coal seams can be estimated using indirect methods based on the adsorption/desorption isotherms obtained in the laboratory. However, the gas sorption capacity can be overestimated or underestimated depending on the sample preparation. This work evaluates different sample preparations and their theoretical adsorption capacity using coal samples from the Cambui coal field (Parana Basin), southern Brazil. Experiments using a thermogravimetric balance were done to calculate the theoretical adsorption capacity, while sample characterization was done through immediate analysis, elementary analysis, and mineralogical studies. The sample preparations used in this work were powder, pellets, and fragments. While the powder form presents an average behavior, without any experimental complication, the pellet is extremely sensitive to any variation in the sample preparation, such as fractures, and the fragment requires a much longer experiment time than the other sample preparations, being impracticable for some cases.",

The adsorption of carbofuran was higher on loam soil, followed by silt clay loam and sandy loam soils, and decreased with increasing f S values on all soils. From the adsorption data, adsorption partition coefficients K D (ml/g) were evaluated and the K D values converted to mole-based partition coefficients K m (mol/g). These values were utilised to test the cosolvent theory. The K m values for soils, when normalised on foc, gave values of K moc , and a plot of log K moc versus f S resulted in a single line whose equation was determined by linear regression analysis as log K moc = –1.12 + 2.84; r 2 = 0.96. The aqueous phase partition coefficient K Dw (mol/g) normalised on f ∞ for carbofuran extrapolated from this relationship was 4.1, The slope may be related to the effect of carbofuran solubility and to carbofuran–soil and solvent–soil interactions. The data presented suggested that methanol–soil interaction may not increase the accessibility of carbofuran to soil organic matter to the same extent as reported for less hydrophobic organic solutes.",

The activity of phenol hydrogenation showed a dependence on the irreversible uptake of hydrogen. Among the catalysts studied, Pd/Al 2 O 3 showed a decrease in activity with increasing temperature while Pd/MgO passed through a maximum at 503 K. The Pd/MgO catalysts exhibited a higher dispersion of smaller Pd crystallites leading to higher activity and total selectivity for cyclohexanone. The higher resistance towards deactivation and better stability of the Pd/MgO catalysts suggest that the acidic sites of alumina may be responsible for deactivation, thereby accounting for the lowering of activity with Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts.",

It has been shown that the sorption of lanthanum(III) nitrate complexes in both methanol and ethanol systems increased as the degree of crosslinkage increased from 2% to 8% DVB, and then decreased with further increase in crosslinking. This can be interpreted in terms of a ‘sieve action’ arising from the partial removal of large complex ions from the anion-exchanger phase [not all the ion-exchange centres are accessible to La(NO 3 ) 3-n n species].",

Their structural characteristics were examined using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction techniques. The catalytic activities of the prepared samples towards the conversion of isopropanol and cyclohexanol and the kinetics of these catalytic conversions were studied with the aid of a microcatalytic pulse technique. In addition, the surface acidities of selected samples were measured from the percentage of propene produced by the poisoned catalysts. X-Ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis revealed that the only detectable phase was α-Cr 2 O 3 with the presence of all other phases or spinel not being confirmed. The order of the surface acidities was found to lie in the sample sequence: 3 wt% V 2 O 5 –20 wt% Cr 2 O 3 /SiO 2 &gt; 3 wt% MoO 3 –20 wt% Cr 2 O 3 /SiO 2 &gt; 20 wt% Cr 2 O 3 /SiO 2 &gt; 3 wt% NiO-20 wt% Cr 2 O 3 /SiO 2 , all samples having been precalcined at 500°C. Catalytic conversion of isopropanol gave propene and acetone, whereas cyclohexene, cyclohexanone and methylcyclopentene (as an isomerization product) were produced from the catalytic conversion of cyclohexanol. The catalytic activity was found to be influenced considerably by the type of impregnating ion employed and by the precalcination temperature, and hence by the surface acidity of the examined catalysts. On the other hand, the Bassett–Habgood and Kiperman equations could be applied in a satisfactory manner to the generation of the various reaction products. The calculated activation energies for the catalytic conversion of isopropanol and cyclohexanol were compared.",

The various parameters for the porous structure were calculated by different methods on the basis of the low-temperature adsorption isotherms of nitrogen measured at 77 ± 1 K. It was shown that an increase in the degree of ACF activation led to the development of a porous structure which exhibited increasing values of the micropore and mesopore volumes. Relationships between the structure, the physicochemical properties of the surface and the adsorption characteristics of ACF were established. The kinetic curves for HSA adsorption from aqueous solution at an initial concentration of 0.5 mg/ml were characterized by negative adsorption ranges. This phenomenon may be explained, on the one hand, by the energetic heterogeneity of the protein–surface interaction and, on the other hand, by the possibility of alterations in the conformations of the protein molecules at the interface. The latter suggestion was confirmed by the hyperchromous shift observed in the UV spectrum of the HSA solution after protein–surface contact had been established.",

The amounts of dopant, in the form of the corresponding nitrate, were varied between 0.5–6.0 mol% cobalt ions and 2.0–6.0 mol% nickel ions. Pure and variously doped solids were subjected to thermal treatment at 300–700°C. The techniques employed were XRD, nitrogen adsorption at −196°C, decomposition of H 2 O 2 at 30–50°C and estimation of the amount of surface excess oxygen on the variously prepared solids as determined by the hydrazine method. The results obtained revealed that the pure and variously doped NiO samples precalcined at 300°C consisted of a finely divided NiO phase having an average particle size of ca. 40 Å. Pure and variously doped Co 3 O 4 specimens preheated at 500°C and 700°C were composed of a Co 3 O 4 phase with a much bigger particle size (230 Å and 350 Å, respectively, for the solids precalcined at 500°C and 700°C). Doping of NiO followed by thermal treatment at 300°C and 500°C resulted in a measurable decrease in its BET surface area (19–23%), while doping of Co 3 O 4 with nickel species followed by heating at 500°C and 700°C brought about a significant increase in its specific surface area (56–60%). Doping each of the NiO and Co 3 O 4 solids with cobalt and nickel species greatly increased the amount of surface excess oxygen and effected a considerable increase in their catalytic activities. This increase was, however, much more pronounced in the case of NiO which attained a value of ca. 100-fold. Doping of NiO with cobalt species followed by thermal treatment at 300°C and 500°C decreased the activation energy (DE) of the catalyzed reaction to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant added. On the other hand, doping of Co 3 O 4 with nickel species followed by thermal treatment at 500°C and 700°C did not change the value of DE. These results suggest that doping of Co 3 O 4 with nickel species did not modify the mechanism of the catalyzed reaction but increased the concentration of catalytically active sites without changing their energetic nature.",

The irradiated samples were left for one year in sealed tubes before any measurements were undertaken. γ-Irradiation of the investigated solids resulted in a progressive decrease in the particle size of the Co 3 O 4 and MgO phases. This treatment also led to a measurable increase in the specific surface area of the treated solids to an extent proportional to the γ-ray dosage. Treatment of the Co 3 O 4 /MgO system with different doses of γ-rays brought about a significant increase in the catalytic activity expressed both as the reaction rate constant and as the reaction rate constant per unit surface area. However, the curve relating to the catalytic activity and dosage of γ-rays showed maxima located at 40 and 80 Mrad for samples having the formula 0.05Co 3 O 4 /MgO and 0.2Co 3 O 4 /MgO, respectively.

The results demonstrate the role of γ-rays in inhibiting the deterioration of the catalytic activity of the investigated systems as a function of aging time. The irradiation process did not modify the activation energy of the catalyzed reaction but altered the concentration of active centres on the surfaces of the solids without changing their energetic nature.",

The optimised conditions for producing activated carbons with well-developed porosity were investigated and the influence of activating agent (KOH)/char ratio, temperature and duration of the pyrolysis process established. Additionally, for comparative purposes, two different designs for the stainless-steel basket in which the sample to be activated was inserted were tested in selected cases to determine the quality of the activated carbons produced. The results obtained showed that micropore development depended strongly on the KOH/char ratio, which was the most important variable under the conditions studied. The activated carbon with the largest adsorption capacity produced had a well-developed porosity, providing a total micropore volume of 0.678 cm 3 /g and an apparent surface area (as estimated by the DR method) of 1908 m 2 /g. The activated carbons prepared exhibited high benzene adsorption rates that increased with increasing micropore volume. The initial adsorption coefficient (γ) appeared to correlate strongly with the micropore volume deduced from nitrogen adsorption data.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption of benzoic acid on to a modified bentonite (ODTMA-bentonite) was studied. ODTMA-bentonite was synthesized by the incorporation of a quaternary ammonium surfactant (octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) on to Ç ankiri sodium bentonite (Ç Na-B) with a cation-exchange capacity of 85 mequiv/100 g clay. A 2 4 full factorial central composite experimental design followed by multi-stage Monte-Carlo optimization was used in designing the experiments and analyzing the results. This procedure limited the number of actual experiments performed whilst allowing for possible interactions between the four parameters studied. These parameters were temperature (20–40°C), agitation rate (30–170 rpm), the amount of organobentonite used (0.1–1.5 g) and the initial benzoic acid concentration (40–200 mg/l). Of these parameters, the amount of organobentonite and the temperature had significant effects in comparison with the agitation rate and initial benzoic acid concentration. To effect the maximum adsorption of benzoic acid on to ODTMA-bentonite, the optimum values for the tested variables over the selected ranges were as follows: initial concentration of benzoic acid = 200 mg/l, agitation rate = 170 rpm, amount of organobentonite = 1.5 g and temperature = 40°C. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) for the model employed was 0.99343 with a probability value of 9.44 × 10 −14 (p-value &lt; 0.01). This p-value indicates a very high significance for the regression model. The maximum adsorbed concentration of benzoic acid predicted by the equation (169.05 mg/l) agreed well with the value (163 mg/l) obtained from the experimental data measured under optimum conditions.",

However, significant changes in the texture, surface acidity and catalytic activity were observed as a result of changing the chemical composition of the solid, with the surface area, total pore volume and surface acidity generally increasing with increasing alumina content. Sintering commenced above 550°C leading to a decrease in the surface area and to pore widening. Dehydration of isopropanol appeared to be insensitive to the structure of the catalysts investigated but was related to the surface acid density.",

The FeAC surface was characterized by measuring the surface area, using scanning electron microscopy and electron dispersive spectroscopy to confirm the presence of Fe, and determining the species at the carbon surface [Fe oxides, predominately hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3 )] using X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis. Potentiometric titrations of FeAC were performed at three ionic strengths (I) and surface complexation modelling was used to determine the surface-site and electrical double layer (EDL) representations. FeAC was modelled as one component for simplicity, as it was comparable to modelling FeAC as its two separate components (GAC1240 and Fe oxide). The diprotic and two-monoprotic surface-site representations coupled with either the diffuse layer (DLM) or triple layer (TLM) EDL models adequately fitted the data. Parameters for the I = 10 −2 data set were used to predict the acid-base behaviour for I = 1.94 × 10 −3 and 10 −1 . The TLM predicted titration data better than the DLM. Both diprotic and two-monoprotic representations in conjunction with the TLM may be used to predict FeAC surface acidity over a range of I values and can be used as the foundation for arsenic adsorption modelling.",

    "abstract": "Catalytic oxidation is considered a viable method for reducing the sulphur level of transportation fuels and H 2 O 2 is usually used as the oxidant. For this reason, it is essential that any extraction operation must remove the oxidation product from the fuel. A new oxidation method is studied in the present work. Instead of H 2 O 2 , air was used as the oxidant and phosphotungstic acid (PW) was used as the catalyst; the latter was imbedded in the pore spaces of the mesoporous silica material SBA-15 to form a PW/SBA-15 composite. The oxidation reaction occurred in the pore spaces of the composite and the polar reaction products were immediately adsorbed there. As a consequence, there was no need for a subsequent exaction operation. Desulphurization experiments were carried out using a model fuel composed of n-octane and thiophene. The content of thiophene was reduced from 2000 ppmw to less than 1 ppmw at 50°C and ambient pressure. The saturated PW/SBA-15 composite was regenerated at 350°C by using a nitrogen flow for 4 h. Such conditions allowed the catalytic activity to be recovered.",

    "abstract": "Heavy metals and metalloids are common cooccurrence in contaminated soils, making their behaviors more complex than their individual presences. Adsorption to soil minerals and organic components determines the solubility and mobility of heavy metals. However, little information is available regarding coadsorbing metals (e.g., Cd) and metalloids (e.g., Sb) to soil components, and whether there is a universal coadsorption rule needs to be illuminated. This study investigated the coadsorption behaviors of Cd(II) and Sb(V) to goethite, kaolinite, and bacteria ( Bacillus cereus) at both acidic (pH 4.5) and alkaline pH (pH 8.5). Equilibrium adsorption experiments, coupled with scanning electron microscopy- (SEM-) energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were applied to determine the batch adsorption phenomena and possible mechanisms. Batch results showed that Cd(II) adsorption was greater at pH 8.5 whereas Sb(V) adsorption was greater at pH 4.5. The presence of Cd or Sb promoted each other’s adsorption to goethite, kaolinite, and bacteria, but slight differences were that Sb(V) preferred to enhance Cd(II) adsorption at acidic pH, whereas Cd(II) was more able to increase Sb(V) adsorption at alkaline pH. SEM-EDS analyses further showed that the distribution of Cd and Sb was colocalized. The surface FeOH, AlOH, and COOH groups participated in the binding of Cd(II) and Sb(V), probably through the formation of inner-sphere complexes. Two possible ternary complexes, i.e., sorbent-Cd 2+ -Sb(OH) 6 – and sorbent-Sb(OH) 6 – -Cd 2+ , were possibly formed. Both the charge effect and the formation of ternary complexes were responsible for the collaborative coadsorbing of Cd-Sb. The universal synergistic rule obtained suggests that current models for predicting Cd(II) or Sb(V) sequestration based on single systems may underestimate their solid-to-liquid distribution ratio in a coexistence situation. The results obtained have important implications for understanding the chemical behavior of Sb and Cd in contaminated soils.",

The adsorption properties of the surfactant load, adsorbent weight, contact time, initial Cr(VI) concentration, and temperature of the MTBs were evaluated. The results revealed that a higher surfactant load significantly affected the Cr(VI) adsorption, and the equilibrium adsorption was achieved at 60 min. The adsorption capacity improved when the adsorbent weight, contact time, initial concentration, and temperature increased as the highest adsorption capacities of 1CPC and 1HDTMA were 45.55 and 46.03 mg g -1 , respectively. The isotherm and kinetic adsorptions were described by the Freundlich model and pseudo-second-order model, respectively, while thermodynamics indicated endothermic adsorption. After adsorption, X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure data showed that Cr ions did not change the valency state between Cr(VI) and Cr(III). Additionally, the adsorption mechanism can be depicted as the ion exchange between the Cr(VI) ion and the surfactant molecule. Structural evaluations by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDS, and TEM found that both MTBs (1CPC and 1HDTMA) with the best adsorption performance for Cr(VI) had obvious changes at both the interlayer structure and the external surface. The interlayer spacing was expanded from 14.85 Å to 20.48 Å (1CPC) and 18.79 Å (1HDTMA), and the new functional groups (CH 2 scissoring, C–H symmetric stretching, C–H asymmetric stretching, and N–CH 3 scissoring) and elemental compositions (Br and Cl) were observed in both MTBs. They demonstrated that the complete intercalation of surfactant molecules on bentonite structures supported Cr(VI) adsorption. Overall, the data indicate that MTBs were perfectly adsorbed on Cr(VI), and CPC was demonstrated to be a cheap alternative agent due to its adsorption capacity compared to the popularly capable HDTMA.",

    "abstract": "Chronic wounds threaten the geriatric society worldwide irrespective of their social status. The current treatment approach to cure chronic ailments is associated with its demerits. A novel treatment approach that is coordinated is required to adsorb water from wounds and cure chronic wounds. Star anise condiment used in the Indian kitchen is shown to have the potency to cure various ailments. In this study, silver nanoparticles were prepared using the star anise extract. The biological potency of star anise extract was confirmed through Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy, antioxidant assay, and anti-inflammatory study. From the DPPH assay result, it was inferred that star anise extract was able to scavenge the free radicals at the concentration of 10 μg/ml using the aqueous extract silver nanoparticles were prepared. The prepared particles were characterized by UV-visible, scanning electron microscopy, and their biological efficacy was determined for their potency against bacteria and prevention of protein aggregation. The anti-inflammatory assay suggests that nanoparticles prevent the aggregation of proteins in a dose-dependent manner. IC50 was found to be 20 μg/ml. The synthesized nanoparticle was incorporated into the chitosan biomaterial and characterized by various physicochemical parameters such as differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, and thermogravimetric analysis. According to the findings, silver nanoparticles incorporated in chitosan biomaterials can be used to adsorb water from wounds and wound healing materials.",

The removal of the cationic dye malachite green (MG) and azo dye methyl orange (MO) onto ATP-RGO CA from unitary and binary systems was investigated. Morphology and microstructure studies of ATP-RGO CA were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and specific surface area and porosity analysis. Experiments were carried out as a function of pH, contact time, initial dye concentration, and temperature in unitary and binary systems. The adsorption kinetics, isotherms, thermodynamics, and dye desorption were studied in unitary and binary dye systems. The adsorption kinetics was modeled using the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion kinetics equations. The equilibrium adsorption data of MG and MO dyes on ATP-RGO CA were analyzed. Thermodynamic parameters of dye adsorption were obtained. In addition, the regeneration of ATP-RGO CA was studied using dye desorption in unitary and binary dye systems. The adsorption kinetics of the dyes followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The results indicate that the Langmuir model provides the best correlation of the experimental data. The thermodynamic studies showed that the dye adsorption onto ATP-RGO CA was a spontaneous and endothermic reaction. High desorption of MG and MO showed the regeneration of ATP-RGO CA. It can be concluded that ATP-RGO CA is suitable as an adsorbent material to remove MG and MO dyes from unitary and binary systems.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are contaminants that can propagate through a variety of environmental media. They contribute to an increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant microbes and thereby pose a danger to human health. Discharge from hospitals is the most significant contributor of ARGs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the natural environment. A comprehensive understanding of the microbiological structure and the distribution of ARGs in hospital wastewater can facilitate appropriate treatment of such wastewater and can improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of several epidemic illnesses. In this work, metagenomics techniques were used to compare the microbial species and ARGs in a control group with those in untreated wastewater from three types of hospitals (a general hospital, a hospital of traditional Chinese medicine, and an oral specialty hospital). The microbiota found in the hospital wastewater represented 6,415 species and 244 phyla. The composition of the bacterial community in the wastewater from the three hospitals was significantly different from that in the control group. The ARGs in the samples were also analyzed using the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB) and Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). Finally, the link between abundant species and ARGs in the samples was examined. The findings of this study indicate that a connection exists between the microbial species and the ARG composition found in the wastewater samples. A variety of distinct genera of ARGs, each having their own unique correlations, have been found in wastewater from various hospitals. Consequently, the ARGs and microbial species found in the untreated wastewater from various hospitals have unique characteristics. Therefore, more detailed protocols need to be established to treat wastewater from various types of hospitals. Further studies should examine whether a connection exists between the various microbial species found in the wastewater of various types of hospitals and certain illnesses.",

The X-ray diffraction results showed that the obtained metal crystallites exhibited different sizes depending on the kind of noble metal, as indicated by significant differences in intensity and width of diffraction profiles for metal phases. Such difference in sizes of individual components causes different kinds of interaction between metal nanoparticle and solid support. The binding energy of reactants depends on the particle size.

The ACF, predominantly with microporous pores, fulfils the requirements as an excellent adsorbent for methane adsorption. The optimal carbonization conditions for improving methane adsorption capacity were achieved using concentrated H 2 SO 4 at 250 °C, followed by activation at 900 °C.

Before adsorption, the TiO x particles have spherical profiles agglomerated on the PE surface. The diameter was between 70 and 120 nm in agglomerates of around 500 nm; however, as the pH of the Cr solutions increased, the morphology of these particles changed to fibred patterns.

A reaction chamber is designed to allow the carbonization and activation of sewage sludge in a saturated steam environment generated inside the chamber (semi-static). The semi-static steam process is carried out in the absence of any external gas flow into the reaction chamber. The activated sample is subjected to acid treatment. Other SBA samples are also prepared at the same temperatures using a conventional method in the presence of external flow of nitrogen gas. The surface chemistry for the SBA samples is characterized using Boehm titrations, pH measurement, ash content and scanning electron microscope integrated with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX). The semi-static steam method results in the formation of an SBA sample with acidic surface and higher carbon content as compared with the samples prepared by the conventional method. The metal contents of the SBAs are significantly different and depend on the methods of preparation. Nitrogen sorption isotherms are measured and used for the analysis of structure and porosity. The BET surface area for the SBA sample produced in the proposed method is calculated to be 838 m 2 /g. The SBA samples are then compared for adsorption efficiency of lead ions from aqueous solution, which is observed to be dependent on the microporosity and surface basicity.",

Due to high purity requirement in food applications, it is majorly produced in the acetate form through chemical routes. However, the isolation of food grade vitamin E acetate (VEA) is critical due to the co-generation of close characteristic impurities in the production processes. The work undertaken here provides a new kinetic chromatography method for production of food grade VEA. In this work, suitable adsorbent for chromatography separation was selected based on shallow-bed binding–elution characteristics. Loading conditions were identified by frontal adsorption behavior. Kinetic parameters and bed height for the purification was predicted by establishing the relationship between bed height, purity and the relative separation factor (RSF). The RSF of 2.8 and corresponding bed height is predicted from the established relationship for the separation of VEA from impurities. The bed height of 170 cm with isocratic mobile phase of 2% (wt/wt) water in methanol provides 98 wt.% purity of VEA with recovery of 90%. This work has highlighted methodology based on kinetic parameters for the separation of close characteristic impurities from target molecule. This work also provided the application of simple handy tools like RSF and dual wavelength detection for the rapid development of preparative separation process for VEA and other such valuable components from unknown impurities.",

Adsorption isotherm was calculated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo method implemented in MCCCS Towhee. We show that predicted n-perfluorohexane loading at relative pressures of interest are significantly lower than the experimental ones. The underprediction is attributed to the low aromatic carbon interaction strength and sensitive calculations of chemical potential. Adjusted interaction parameter of aromatic carbon and chemical potential led to n-perfluorohexane adsorption that agreed well with the reported experimental values.",

The force field parameters were derived from data calculated using quantum mechanics density functional theory with dispersion energy correction, and the total adsorption amount was calculated as the sum of the adsorption amounts of microscopic and mesoscopic pores. It was found that the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo method can efficiently calculate adsorption on microscopic pores but not on mesoscopic pores. Thus, we divided the mesoscopic pores into surface and free-volume regions and calculated the density and thickness of the adsorbed layers and the density of the vapor phase using canonical ensemble simulations.

    "abstract": "The uptake of radiocesium (RCs) by plants is key to the assessment of its environmental risk. However, the transfer process of RCs in the water-vegetable system still remains unclear. In this work, the uptake and accumulation processes of Cs + (0-10 mM) in lettuce were explored under different conditions by using hydroponics. The results showed that the higher exposure concentration of Cs + could lead to a faster uptake rate and would be beneficial to the uptake and accumulation of Cs + . The uptake of K + by roots and leaves was inhibited significantly when Cs + concentration increased, but unapparent for Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ . It was found that the higher K + and Ca 2+ concentration was, the higher inhibition was found for the uptake of Cs + in root. The uptake of Cs + leads the decrease of chlorophyll content and brought a negative effect on plant photosynthesis, consequently, a negative effect on lettuce morphology and obvious decrease of biomass and root length. The contents of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and root vitality were increasing during the growth following stress of high concentrations of Cs + , which caused stresses on the antioxidant system of lettuce. The enrichment coefficient for Cs + in leaves was in the range of 8-217. Moreover, the transfer factor was in the range of 0.114-0.828, which suggested that the high Cs + concentration could enhance the transfer of Cs + from lettuce root to leaf. This study provides more information on the transfer of RCs from water to food chain, promoting the understanding of the potential risk of RCs.",

    "abstract": "Due to the obvious minimal doses of drugs in biological matrices as well as the societal difficulties caused by methamphetamine usage, methamphetamine identification is critical in clinical and forensic laboratories. Because of their simple and inexpensive production procedure, as well as their excellent selectivity and sensitivity, polymeric carbon-based nanocomposites are strong contenders for the diffusive solid-phase extraction approach. The diffusive solid-phase extraction absorbent nanographene oxide polypyrrole composite was produced and used to recover methamphetamine from a complicated urine substrate. The generated NGPPC was fully characterized, and the significant extracting parameters have been explored using the one-parameter-at-a-time strategy. NGOPC is being used to extract methamphetamine using a urine medium with high efficiency. The NGPPC synthesizing procedure was easy, and the extraction method will demonstrate good repeatability. Moreover, the practical and efficient synthesis process stimulates the use of carbon-based compounds in various extraction procedures. As for detecting and quantifying equipment, HPLC monitors are being used. 300 mL methanol, 7 min extracting and desorption duration, 5000 mixing frequency, urinary pH value of 20, 40 mg adsorption, and 5 mL amount of urine were the optimal extraction variables. Following tracing the calibration graph, the method’s linear ranges were determined to be 40-600 ng/ml. The detection limits (LOD) and quantitation limits (LOQ), correspondingly, were 10 and 35.80 ng/mL. The proposed methodology seemed to have a detection range of 9 ng/mL. The suggested approach’s applicability in numerous characterization and medical facilities was proven by the examination of addicted subjects using the proposed technique. For successful extraction of methamphetamine using biological urine samples, the carbon-based adsorbent was being used as diffusive solid-phase extraction adsorption.",

    "abstract": "With significant benefits over many other commercialised thermal storage methods, activated carbon fiber (ACF) is believed to be among the finest biosorbents for adsorbent purposes. If correctly made, it is an outstanding mesoporous lightweight material with micropores and, in most cases, no micropores. ACF’s higher bulk densities and great dynamic capacity demonstrate its value and are used in adsorbent technologies. The present study’s primary goal is to create active carbon fiber from organic hemp fiber. The following parameters were selected: (i) activating temperatures, (ii) activating timing, (iii) carbonization temperature, (iv) activating ingredient %ages, and (v) speed of activation temperature, all with four levels to achieve the goal. Taguchi optimization techniques were used to optimize the adsorbent characteristics. The current study used an L16 orthogonal array to accomplish that improvement. According to the previous Taguchi, the optimal conditions were 300°C combustions, insemination with 22.5% [Formula: see text] K 2 HPO 4 solution, and activating at 800°C for 3 hours at 20°C/min. The greatest contribution is 54.75%, followed by the rate of temperature activation at 23.35%, carbonated temperature at 10.14%, duration of stimulation at 8.82%, and H 3 PO 4 concentrations at 2.94%. The results show that the activation temperature and rate of the temperature of activations are the essential elements in the current study’s accomplishment of the best adsorption capacities.",

The influence of the element ratios (Mg 2+ , Co 2+ , and Zn 2+ ) in magnetic Mg x Co y Zn (1-x-y) Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles on their properties was explored. To acquire a larger specific surface area for better adsorption of methyl blue (MB), magnetic Mg 0.4 Co 0.5 Zn 0.1 Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles calcined at 400°C for 2 h with 25 mL anhydrous ethanol were selected, and their average particle size and the saturation magnetization were about 81.3 nm and 13.5 emu·g -1 , respectively. Adsorption kinetics models and adsorption isotherm models were applied to research the adsorption characteristics of MB onto magnetic Mg 0.4 Co 0.5 Zn 0.1 Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles. The pseudo-second-order kinetics model ([Formula: see text]) and Temkin isotherm model ([Formula: see text]) were the most consistent with the data, indicating that the adsorption was the chemical multilayer adsorption mechanism, and the process was an exothermic reaction. The E of the Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model was 0.2347 KJ·mol -1 , indicating the adsorption involved physical adsorption besides chemical adsorption. The [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] KJ·mol -1 ) of the adsorption process of MB adsorbed onto magnetic Mg 0.4 Co 0.5 Zn 0.1 Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles measured through the thermodynamic experiment were both less than 0, which proved that the process was a spontaneous exothermic reaction. The adsorption capacity of MB onto magnetic Mg 0.4 Co 0.5 Zn 0.1 Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles increased with the pH of MB solution increasing from 2 to 4 at room temperature, and it had no significant change when the pH of MB solution was 4-12, while the relative removal rate was 98.75% of the first one after 2 cycles. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) data further demonstrated that MB was adsorbed onto magnetic Mg 0.4 Co 0.5 Zn 0.1 Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles.",

According to the calculation of pore size and the BET equation, the pore size and specific surface area of the MGM were larger. The results of adsorption kinetics and isothermal adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption capacity of MGM for phosphate increased from 0.1 mg/g to 0.71 mg/g, which was obviously better than that of GM. The GM and MGM accorded with the quasi-second-order kinetic model. The isothermal adsorption data of GM accorded with the Freundlich model, and the isothermal data of MGM accorded with the Langmuir model, which indicated that the model of GM and MGM was an adsorption process from a double layer to a single layer. Thermodynamic data showed that the increase in temperature was beneficial to the adsorption of MGM. The internal diffusion model showed that due to the change of pore size structure after modification, the number of adsorption sites that could provide phosphate was increased, and at the same time, the change of internal elements led to the extension of the chemical reaction time by 700 min. Because of the ligand exchange and electrostatic interaction between phosphate, GM, and MGM, the adsorption results showed that acidity was better than alkalinity. To improve the recycling ability of MGM, hydrochloric acid with a concentration of 0.1 mol/L was determined as the best phosphorus resolving agent, and the resolving rate was still close to 80% after five cycles. The results showed that the MGM could be a promising adsorbent for the removal of phosphorus, providing a new way for resource utilization of mining waste residue.",

Pristine titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanofibers, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, and reduced graphene oxide-wrapped titanium dioxide (rGO-wrapped TiO 2 ) nanofibers were presented in the form of integrated suspension used for a gas-sensing layer. The TiO 2 nanofibers were firstly synthesized by using an electrospinning method with a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer. The rGO sheets were then wrapped around TiO 2 nanofibers by a hydrothermal method. Scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, and Raman spectrometer confirmed the presence of rGO sheets onto the surface of TiO 2 nanofibers. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer was also considered and displayed to calculate the band gap of TiO 2 and rGO-wrapped TiO 2 nanofibers. After preparing the gas-sensing suspensions, they were dropped onto the polyethylene terephthalate substrates with silver-interdigitated electrodes. The gas-sensing properties of sensors were evaluated for H 2 S adsorption at room temperature. Based on the results, the rGO-wrapped TiO 2 nanofiber gas sensor exhibited higher H 2 S sensitivity and selectivity than pristine TiO 2 nanofiber and pure rGO gas sensors. The H 2 S-sensing mechanism of rGO-wrapped TiO 2 nanofiber gas sensor was discussed based on a formation of p-n heterojunctions between p-type rGO sheets and n-type TiO 2 nanofibers. Furthermore, a direct charge-transfer process by physisorption was also highlighted as a second H 2 S-sensing mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Among the wide variety of dyes present in the environment, cationic dyes are more toxic and have complex structure. The adsorption process of rhodamine B dye was successfully carried out by sulphuric acid-treated inexpensive modified fly ash (MFA) adsorbent via batch experiments. The nature of the adsorbent was characterized by techniques, namely, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The maximum removal efficiency of RhB dye was found to be 99.78% by using 0.5 g of adsorbent dosage in 50 mg/L of dye concentration. The SEM images displayed the porous nature of the adsorbent where the EDS analysis displays the elemental compositions present in the adsorbent. XRD pattern shows the crystallinity nature of the adsorbent. Among the batch study parameters, effect of pH plays an important role in the adsorption process. The pH of 4 was found to be an ideal setting for the efficient removal of the dye RhB. The preferable elimination ability was found by keeping the dosage at 5 g/L, contact time 120 min, and dye concentration at 50 mg/L. Adsorption capacity was found to be 36.36 mg/g. This shows the ability of the MFA for the removal of wastewater contaminants. This adsorption process is well suited for the Freundlich isotherm, which displaces the process as a multilayer adsorption. Studies in kinetics and thermodynamics demonstrate that the process was well suited for its exothermic nature and pseudo-second-order. Thermal regeneration studies were carried out, and the adsorbent was effectively recycled and utilized up to four more times with minimal loses in its effectiveness. Therefore, from these obtained results, it is clear that the MFA is an effective adsorbent for the effective removal of dyes from wastewater.",

A good agreement is found between the calculated and the experimental adsorption, but in the case of water the model must take into account the decrease of the characteristic energy E(H 2 O) with increasing co-adsorption of benzene.

    "abstract": "The surface of an intermetallic amorphous alloy has a low density of localized energy centres which does not facilitate the adsorption of substances on the alloy surface. However, the active diffusion of amorphizators (usually B, Si) in these materials leads to their concentration on the surface. These amorphizators have a high affinity for organic compounds and can form non-covalent bonds with some of these compounds. Such behaviour has been observed for the adsorption of organic nitrogen-containing inhibitors on an iron-based amorphous alloy surface, although when the quantity of iron atoms is sufficient chemisorption with the formation of surface compounds of planar orientation is possible. The chemical bond is formed via the free electron pair associated with nitrogen, which results in a high activation energy (E a ) for the adsorption process. The adsorption of inorganic ions (Cl − , NO − 2 , NO − 3 ) increases as the iron content in the alloys increases (55–78.5%). This effect is most significant for the adsorption of chloride ions. The injection of piperidine, morpholine or diethylamine in a 3% sodium chloride solution results in significant changes in adsorption. In this case, it is believed that the adsorption mechanism changes leading to the formation of a two-layer adsorption film on the amorphous alloy surface.",

    "abstract": "The authors have recently advanced a hypothesis for the phenomenon of oscillatory adsorption suggesting that it is caused by a number of factors such as the competitive filling of the surface by A and B components, the ‘spotty’ nature of component adsorption, the dramatic change in the configuration of such ‘spots' at a certain step during surface filling with one of the components resulting in a transition of the adsorption layer from an ‘ A in B’ state to a ‘B in A’ state and vice versa, and the dependence of the values of the chemical potential of A and B on the configuration of the adsorption ‘spot’ causing a change in the direction of the sorption process. In the present communication, an attempt is made to examine the phenomenon from the viewpoint of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. By relying on the Gibbs equation, particularly with respect to the flux and affinity equations, and taking account of the equality of the reciprocal influence coefficients, it is possible to conclude that the chemical potentials of the competitive components are either equal or approximately equal at the periphery of the sorption ‘spots’. This indicates that the entropy of the system remains constant (i.e. dS = 0) leading to the possibility of sustained oscillations occurring in the adsorption process.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption of caesium ions on potassium copper nickel hexacyanoferrate(II) (KCNF) was carried out under optimum conditions to ascertain whether such adsorption occurred via an ion-exchange process. The results show that the adsorption takes place by means of a pure caesium-potassium ion-exchange reaction. Batch kinetic studies of the replacement of potassium ions on KCNF by caesium ions were carried out in aqueous solution at a pH value of 4.0 over the temperature range 293–333 K at a caesium ion concentration of 7.5 × 10 −3 mol/l. From the various thermodynamic quantities calculated, it was deduced that the ion-exchange process was endothermic. Kinetic studies of caesium adsorption on KCNF were carried out as a function of the particle size of KCNF and of the temperature. The data obtained at a caesium ion concentration of 7.5 × 10 −7 mol/l fitted the film diffusion model. Different physical parameters such as the effective diffusion coefficient and the activation energy were calculated. From an Arrhenius plot at a caesium ion concentration of 7.5 × 10 −7 mol/l, the activation energy was evaluated as 19.3 kJ/mol, thereby confirming the film diffusion nature of the process. However, the data obtained at the higher caesium ion concentration of 7.5 × 10 −3 mol/l could not be interpreted via the particle diffusion model but rather by a fast chemical reaction model. At this concentration, the reaction followed shell progressive reaction kinetics as confirmed by the linear Arrhenius plot obtained. This plot gave an activation energy of 68.5 kJ/mol for the process, thereby confirming the applicability of shell progressive reaction kinetics under these circumstances.",

The extent of loading was maintained at 38 wt% Co 3 O 4 and the amount of dopant varied between 1.2 wt% and 11.0 wt% Fe 2 O 3 . The pure and doped solids were prepared by calcination at 400–1000°C of pure and ferric nitrate-treated magnesium carbonate impregnated with cobalt nitrate solution. The samples thus obtained were examined by TG, DTA and XRD methods, nitrogen adsorption studies at −196°C and the catalysis of H 2 O 2 decomposition at 30–50°C. The results revealed that Fe 2 O 3 treatment of the Co 3 O 4 /MgO system followed by calcination at 400°C resulted in an increase in the particle size of the Co 3 O 4 and MgO phases, whilst the opposite effect was observed when the doped solids were calcined at 600°C. Doping of the Co 3 O 4 /MgO system followed by calcination at 400°C effected a measurable decrease in its BET surface area with the reverse effect being observed upon heating at 600°C. An increase in the calcination temperature of pure Co 3 O 4 /MgO up to 800°C brought about an abrupt decrease in the intensity of all the diffraction lines associated with the Co 3 O 4 phase. These disappeared completely upon heating the system at 900°C or 1000°C due to dissolution of the cobalt oxide in the MgO lattice to form a solid solution. A cobalt ferrite phase was detected in the variously doped solids calcined at 800–1000°C even when the initial solids had been treated with 2.4 wt% Fe 2 O 3 . This finding suggests that most of the ferrite phase produced was contained in the outermost surface layers of the treated samples. Treatment of the investigated system with Fe 2 O 3 followed by calcination at 400°C and 800°C led to a progressive decrease in the catalytic activity of the resulting solid due to an increase in the particle size (a decrease in the degree of dispersion) of the catalytically-activeconstituent, i.e. the Co 3 O 4 phase, and due to the conversion of Co 3 O 4 into a CoFe 2 O 4 phase, respectively. In contrast, doping followed by calcination at 600°C led to an increase in the catalytic activity of the resulting solid due to an effective decrease in the particle size of the Co 3 O 4 phase. Calcination of the Fe 2 O 3 -doped system at 400–800°C did not modify the mechanism of the catalyzed reaction but changed the concentration of active sites without changing their energetic nature.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) has emerged as an important unit operation in many chemical engineering processes such as iron and aluminium smelting, making oxygen the third largest man-made chemical commodity in the world. Although a mature technology (with the first patents published in the 1970s), oxygen VSA processes are still not well understood due to their complicated batch-like operation, inherent non-linearities and inverse responses associated with the operating conditions. Step perturbations of manipulated variables together with the process response provide valuable information for the study of system dynamics, the extent of interaction and control loop pairings. The first part of this study presents data from input perturbations gathered from a pilot-scale experimental oxygen VSA process. The interesting time-variant temperature profiles, and bed and system pressures, flows and purity are the main focus of the discussion. Furthermore, the possible applications of this knowledge for heuristic-based control are discussed.",

The XRD results indicated that the interaction of titania with the loaded anions, i.e. ClO − 2 and S 2 O 2- 8 , resulted in an increase in the volume of the unit cell mainly due to an increase in the c 0 value of the tetragonal crystal lattice. The IR spectra showed that both ClO − 2 and S 2 O 2- 8 anions were linked to the surface via bidentate bridging. Such behaviour created strong acidic sites as probed by pyridine (pK a = 5.3) whose number increased with increasing anion loading. The acidity of the perchlorated samples was higher than that of the persulphated materials. Textural analysis showed that the specific surface areas of both samples responded to the loading process to a lower extent than the total pore volume and correspondingly to the average hydraulic radius, since the latter changed in relation to the total pore volume.",

It was found that the equilibrium adsorption data for the three aromatic compounds could be well fitted by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The results showed that the equilibrium adsorption capacities for p-toluidine and p-aminophenol on NG-5 were all greater than on CHA-111. This may be attributed to the strong hydrogen-bonding interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate, electrostatic interaction and π–π interaction. However, the adsorption capacity for phenol on NG-5 was lower than that on CHA-111 because of the larger surface area and micropore volume of the latter adsorbent. The sorption enthalpy changes were used to interpret the adsorption mechanism. In addition, the sorption of p-toluidine and p-aminophenol onto NG-5 was studied kinetically. The results showed that the adsorption process was mainly controlled by intraparticle diffusion.",

All the samples prepared were heated in air to 350, 450 or 600°C, respectively, before being cooled to room temperature and stored. X-Ray studies of these materials showed that the undoped (pure) solid calcined at 350°C exhibited all the diffractions lines associated with the AlO(OH) and CuO phases with an excellent degree of crystallinity. Doping the pure solid resulted in the effective progressive decrease in the degree of crystallinity of both the above-mentioned phases to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant added. Increasing the calcination temperature of the pure and doped solids to 650°C led to a significant decrease in the degree of ordering of CuO due to the formation of poorly crystalline γ-Al 2 O 3 having a much better dispersion power relative to AlO(OH). The specific surface areas of the various samples were found to decrease progressively as the amount of dopant added was increased, especially for samples calcined at 650°C. Increasing the calcination temperature of the pure sample within the range 350–650°C led to a small increase in their catalytic activities in H 2 O 2 decomposition. In contrast, MoO 3 treatment followed by calcination of the resulting materials in the range 350–650°C resulted in a significant increase in their catalytic activities in the same catalytic reaction. The maximum increase in the catalytic activity at 30°C attained values of 720%, 735% and 976% for the doped solids calcined at 350, 450 and 650°C, respectively. In contrast, however, such doping brought about a progressive measurable decrease in the catalytic activity of the treated solids towards CO oxidation by O 2 when this latter reaction was conducted over the temperature range 150–250°C.",

The methodology employed eliminates objections raised concerning gravimetric methods which are most frequently employed in the study of the rate of coking of catalysts. Qualitative agreement between the results obtained using both methods was demonstrated for catalysts differing both in composition and texture. The new method allows a better characterization of the resistance towards coking of nickel on various supports and in the presence of various promoters.",

Pure and doped samples were prepared by the thermal decomposition in air at 500–900°C of pure cobalt carbonate and carbonate samples treated with different proportions of silver or zinc nitrates. The results showed that Ag 2 O doping followed by precalcination at 500–900°C resulted in a significant decrease (ca. 25%) in the BET surface areas of the treated Co 3 O 4 samples. Treatment of Co 3 O 4 with ZnO followed by precalcination over the same temperature range effected a corresponding increase in the specific surface areas (ca. 28%). The addition of Ag 2 O to Co 3 O 4 effected a record increase in the corresponding catalytic activity towards the decomposition of H 2 O 2 . Thus, the maximum increase noted in the catalytic rate constant (k) measured at 30°C over Co 3 O 4 doped with 3.00 mol% Ag 2 O exhibited a 36-fold, 26-fold and 3.5-fold increase for catalysts precalcined at 500°C, 700°C and 900°C, respectively. Treatment of Co 3 O 4 with ZnO also effected an increase in the catalytic activity of the resulting solid. Thus, treatment of Co 3 O 4 with 6.00 mol% ZnO followed by precalcination at 500°C, 700°C and 900°C effected an increase of 109%, 28% and 36%, respectively, in the catalytic activity expressed in terms of the reaction rate constant measured at 30°C. The doping process did not modify the activation energy of the catalyzed reaction but increased the concentration of catalytically active constituents considerably without changing their energetic nature. Doping with Ag 2 O or ZnO led to an increase in the concentration of Co 3+ –Co 2+ ion pairs in the system and also generated corresponding Ag + –Co 2+ and Zn 2+ –Co 3+ ion pairs, thereby increasing the number of active constituents involved in the catalytic decomposition studied.",

TX showed no discernable adsorption onto γ-alumina over the pH range 3.8 &lt; pH &lt; 12.1 and a temperature of 15°C or onto calcite at the same temperature and pH range 7.7 &lt; pH &lt; 11.7. However, significant and reversible adsorption from solutions was found for silica powder suspensions. The adsorption isotherms obtained for TX uptake onto silica powder were best fitted by the Freundlich model. An increase in the ionic strength of the electrolytic solution led to a decrease in the surface concentration of TX on silica powder, indicating significant electrostatic interactions between TX and silica powder particles, possibly through interaction with the surface silanol groups of the solid substrate. Increasing the pH value of the electrolyte solution from 6 to 9 led to a considerably decrease in the amount of TX adsorbed, while a decrease in the solution pH from 6 to 3 had only a slight effect on the surface concentration of adsorbed TX. The adsorption of TX onto silica powder decreased as the temperature was increased in the range 15–45°C, indicating that the adsorption process was exothermic. The magnitude of the calculated enthalpy of adsorption (ca. 10 kJ/mol) demonstrated that the uptake at the solid/liquid interface at an equilibrium pH of 6.1 was largely due to physisorption.",

In this process, ethanol regeneration is the only step with significant energy consumption, in which the adsorbent column saturated with liquid ethanol is purged with a hot inert gas to recover ethanol by condensation. Despite many showing interest in applying CTSA, the method has received little attention in the open literature, and consequently little information is available about its energy requirement. In this work, we experimentally measured the regeneration dynamics of a heated silicalite column saturated with liquid ethanol by air purge using different column wall temperatures and purge gas flow rates. Using a theoretical model based on conservation equations, the mass and heat transfer kinetics in this process are adequately reproduced. The proposed model has been used to estimate the overall energy requirement of the ethanol vapourization/desorption and the subsequent condensation processes.",

An analogous series of catalysts were phosphated by impregnation with up to 6 wt% PO 4 3– from aqueous solutions of (NH 4 )H 2 PO 4 and then calcined similarly. The catalysts thus obtained were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, infrared spectroscopy and nitrogen sorptiometry at 77 K. The adsorption data were analyzed by the BET method and the t-method. The results suggested that lanthanum(III) oxide loadings up to 30 wt% exist as high-dispersion two- and three-dimensional structures on the surface of alumina that are not XRD-detectable (particle size &lt; 2 nm). Strong interactions not only at the liquid/solid interface established during impregnation, but also at the solid/solid interface established during drying and/or calcination, are suggested to be important events in the dispersion mechanism. Phosphation led to the improvement of the two-dimensional lanthanum(III) oxide dispersion (probably in monolayers) rather than the three-dimensional one, most likely through direct bonding of the phosphate groups to exposed La 3+ sites. It is inferred that nitrogen adsorption data can provide valuable qualitative information on the dispersion of supported oxide materials.",

    "abstract": "The physicochemical and luminescent properties of tetrapyrrole macrocycles, such as the porphyrins (H 2 P) and phthalocyanines (H 2 Pc), were preserved by trapping or bonding these species in silica matrices. The method involved used hydroxy-aluminium tetrasulphophthalocyanine OH(Al)TSPc as a probe to find optimal conditions for the entrapment of tetrapyrrole molecules. This methodology made possible the trapping or fixing of macrocyclic species or their respective complexes in the interior of pores existing in monolithic, translucent, normal, or organo-modified silica xerogels. The average pore sizes ranged from 2.0 to 3.6 nm in these systems and depended on the structure, the nature of the cation in the complex and on the identity and position of the substituents at the periphery of the macrocyclic species. Under appropriate conditions, the tetrapyrrolic species can be trapped or bonded to the pore network in stable and monomeric form; however, the interactions with Si–OH groups on the pore walls inhibit the efficient displaying of its properties. To avoid this deleterious effect, some strategies are used, such as to place the macrocycle far from the pore walls through long bridges or by substituting Si–OH groups with alkyl or aryl species. Average pore diameters vary from 3.5 to 9.4 nm when long unions are established between the macrocycle and the pore walls or when more of one macrocyclic species are trapped inside each pore. The spectroscopic properties of the macrocycles trapped in these systems are similar to those displayed by the same species in solution. When phthalocyanines or porphyrins are trapped or bonded to the pore walls of organo-modified silica, the spectroscopic properties are better preserved and their intensities are a function of the chain length of the alkyl group present in the silica matrix. This last result suggests the possibility of tuning the pore size and polarity inside them by choosing the tetrapyrrole species that can be trapped or bonded; in this way, it is possible to create more efficient systems for catalytic, optical, sensoring and medical applications.",

Breakthrough experiments were carried out at ambient temperature either in dry or moist air. The second-stage waste obtained in the extraction of silica from fly ash using sodium hydroxide exhibits the better adsorption capacity compared with that of caustic-modified activated carbons. The high performance is related to the presence of residual sodium hydroxide and other metals such as calcium, which react with acidic gases forming corresponding salts. Moreover, a high dispersion of the alkali and alkaline earth metal sites in the mesopores renders the pH of the solution basic, aiding in the dissociation of hydrogen sulphide, thereby facilitating its oxidation. The oxidation of species is also catalyzed by the carbonaceous surface. While in the case of hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide, water helps in acid–base reactions, the opposite effect is found for NO 2 . Because its reactivity with water is limited, reactive metal species present in small pores are likely screened by water adsorbed at pore entrances, and therefore the adsorption of NO 2 on the surface is limited.",

Another one is that Hg penetration in pores of this sort cannot proceed gradually but only in a jump-like manner. Virtual penetration curves indicate Laplace stable or unstable states as well as the virulence of the irreversible penetration of pores with a varying cross section. It is also important to point out that, in structures depicting a sinuous cavity to throat inter-connections, a single meniscus can be transformed into more than one meniscus by a sort of snap-off mechanism. Hysteresis in these structures can be expected to be more intense as the pore entities become more sinuous. Finally, it is also important to mention that the onset of liquid penetration is not always occurring at the minimum cross section of a pore channel, but at a specific point beyond this occlusion.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of the type of surface oxide of ACs on the adsorption of dimethoxon, a model molecule with multiple groups, from chloroform. The surface oxides and the pores and/or carbon surface of ACs were found to adsorb dimethoxon in accordance with the Langmuir isotherm, with a linear correlation between the surface oxides and adsorbed dimethoxon (R2 ≈ 0.95). The interaction between ACs and dimethoxon was further investigated by replacing the adsorbed dimethoxon with compounds containing different substituent groups. At the same amount of the compound added, the amount of dimethoxon is replaced in the following order: butanoic acid > butanol > butanone > ethyl acetate. This finding indicates that both the type of oxide and steric hindrance are important for an AC to adsorb an adsorbate or for a compound itself to replace the dimethoxon adsorbed onto ACs. The results also showed that dimethoxon adsorbed on the surface oxides may be displaced, whereas those adsorbed in the pores, carbon surface of ACs or both cannot be displaced by those compounds.",

Experimental results show an important effect of the support, which can be considered as an additional parameter to tailor pore size on these carbon membranes.

Similarities were found between adsorption and calorimetric analysis. The pore volume of the samples analyzed ranged from 0.016 to 0.263 cm 3 /g.

The zeta potentials of the oxides and their isoelectric points were determined as a function of pH in the presence of constant concentrations of both surfactants and electrolytes. The mechanism of adsorption of surfactants on cassiterite and quartz surfaces modified by salt cations is discussed. In general, in the presence of the above-mentioned salts, the zeta potentials and the isoelectric points (IEPs) of the oxides are considerably changed on addition of different surfactants.",

The media studied were butanol, butane 1,4-diol, isopropyl alcohol, butane 1,3-diol and propylene glycol. The results show that the organic solvents improved the corrosion resistance of mild steel to an extent depending on the concentration of the acid and the solvent as well as on the different protic and stereochemistry properties of the alcohols considered. The inhibition efficiency increased in the order: butanol &gt; butane 1,4-diol &gt; isopropyl alcohol &gt; butane 1,3-diol &gt; propylene glycol. The effect of chloride ions (HCl and CaCl 2 ) on the rate of dissolution of steel in the presence of mixtures of phosphoric acid and alcohol has been investigated. Aqueous solutions containing Cl– ions inhibit the dissolution of steel in phosphoric acid, such inhibition being enhanced in the presence of propylene glycol or butanol. The corrosion rate of steel in phosphoric acid was also measured as a function of the concentration of aniline derivatives. It was found that 3% vol/vol inhibitor was sufficient to level off the protection efficiency. The order of inhibition efficiency was n,n-dimethyl aniline &gt; n-methyl aniline &gt; aniline. Good agreement was obtained between the kinetic–thermodynamic and Flory–Huggins models. At 35% and 50% phosphoric acid concentration, each molecule of the inhibitor occupied more or less than one active site on the metal surface depending on the molecular structure of the inhibitor. The corresponding negative values of the free energy of adsorption varied between 21.5 and 23.3 kJ/mol and 17.0 and 21.1 kJ/mol respectively for inhibitors at low and high acid concentrations.",

For different concentrations and polymer molecular weights, a 'hydrodynamic layer' of fluid was detected on each solid surface which did not contribute to the flow. These thicknesses, denoted as LH, are compared to the characteristic polymer dimensions and the hydrodynamic (R H ) and gyration (R g ) radii. It appears that in contrast to the molecular weight, polymer concentration has little effect on the relative hydrodynamic layer thickness (L H /2R H , L H /2R g ). Indeed, this ratio indicates that two coils of low molecular weight and one coil of high molecular weight are 'immobile' on the solid surfaces. The mechanism responsible could be entanglement of the free (unattached) chains in the bulk with immobilized chains on the surface.",

These materials consist of regular nonporous primary particles which have been approximated as monomodal size distributions of spheres. Two models (semi-infinite slab and spherical particle) were used to make the FHH plots. The results from these plots indicate that the FHH coefficient and exponent vary with particle size. A model is proposed for a particle having a featureless Lennard-Jones surface which predicts (a) that the actual variation is in the coefficient alone, which depends upon coverage as well as particle size, but (b) on a ‘spherical particle’ FHH plot, this variation will manifest itself as a particle size dependence of both coefficient and exponent. However, the model predicts that the exponent should decrease with particle size; experimental results show it to increase. The model also predicts that ‘flat surface’ FHH plots should be less linear than the ‘spherical particle’ plots, and should deviate downwards at high coverage, when in fact the ‘flat surface’ plots are more linear. Predictions obtained by recalculating the model in the absence of the surface energy term are in much better agreement with the experimental results, indicating that the surface energy correction is possibly excessive, e.g. if the particles were actually polyhedral instead of spherical.",

Samples were subsequently challenged with 2 mg/l HCN in an identical diluent gas stream. Increasing SO 2 exposure resulted in accelerated HCN and (CN) 2 bed penetration. The basic shapes of the breakthrough profiles were however essentially unchanged. This observation is in accordance with numerical analysis of these results using Hinshelwood's adsorption model, which suggested that the adsorption rate constant was not significantly affected by SO 2 but rather the pollutant exposure resulted in the number of active centres on the carbon surface being reduced and the effective bed depth of the sample being shortened. This loss in active centres was thought most likely to result from the reduction of Cr 6+ to Cr 3+ .",

The polymerization is preceded by an induction period. The length of this period depends on the concentration of inhibiting sites (n) on the surface of ZnO. The adsorbed polymer blocks such inhibiting sites and the induction period decreases. This model was used to estimate n. A peak was observed in the experimental relationship connecting n with the amount adsorbed. This peak was interpreted as the critical concentration for conformation transition brought about by the interaction of the polymer chains at the surface. Below this concentration adsorbed macromolecules are considered as isolated chains at the surface. This state is characterized by the poor mobility of segments.",

    "abstract": "When a metal oxide is brought into contact with an electrolyte, the outermost surface oxygens adsorb one or two protons, a cation or an aggregate composed of two protons and an anion. In this way, various surface complexes are formed. The actual surfaces are, as a rule, geometrically distorted. This causes a variation of the binding-to-surface energy from one surface oxygen to another for each of these complexes. This energetic heterogeneity of the actual oxide surfaces strongly affects the adsorption of ions within the electrical double layer formed at the oxide/electrolyte interface. The way in which the surface heterogeneity affects the adsorption of ions depends on the correlations between the binding-to-surface energies of the various surface complexes. To date, two extreme models have been considered by us; one assuming the existence of very high correlations, and the other one assuming a total lack of correlation between binding-to-surface energies in going from one surface oxygen to another. This paper presents a theoretical study of ion adsorption based on the assumption of a partial correlation between the binding-to-surface energies.",

HFPPs are carbochain polymers which have statistically located peroxidic (–OO–) and high-polar functional (carboxylic) groups along the main chain. Sharp differences in the polarity of these groups endowes HFPP macromolecules with the capability of interfacial adsorption in various polymeric colloidal systems. The reactions of the functional groups provide chemical bonding of the macromolecules to the interfacial surface. As a consequence of such physical adsorption or chemisorption of HFPP, peroxidation of filler surfaces and the localization of active –OO– groups on the interface may be effected. In addition, such –OO– groups can facilitate the grafting of matrix polymer macromolecules to the surface of the dispersed phase. Such grafting reactions can be carried out during polymer filling, the curing processes of composites or the vulcanization of a rubber mixture. It has been shown that an improvement in the physical and mechanical properties of polymers and an increase in the electroconductivity and heat conductivity of filled compositions is achieved on modification by HFPP.",

    "abstract": "Samples of hydrotalcite-like compounds with the general formula [M 2+ 1-x M 3+ x (OH) 2 ] x+ •A x– •nH 2 O were prepared via coprecipitation through the addition of NaOH to mixed chloride salt solutions. On maintaining the M 2+ /M 3+ ratio equal to three, it was possible to effect isomorphous substitution. This led to the preparation of different compounds which could be compared to the parent material in which M 2+ = Ni and M 3+ = Al. Other divalent cations used were Mg 2+ and Zn 2+ with Cr 3+ and Fe 3+ being employed as trivalent cations. The ratio between cations of the same charge was unity in all the isomorphously substituted samples and substitution was conducted for one oxidation state only at a time. Hence, all samples contained a maximum of three different cations. The charge compensating anion in the interlayers, A, was identified as mainly CO 3 2– with the co-existence of Cl − anions to different extents. The structural and textural properties developed as a result of the substitutions effected were studied by XRD, IR, DTA, acid–base titration and mercury porosimetry measurements. Various samples were used for the adsorption of 4-chlorophenol to examine the effects on the adsorption properties arising from isomorphous substitution. The major effect having a marked influence on the adsorption properties arose from the nature of the compensating anion in the interlayers. Different tendencies of different cations to be accommodated in the layer structure resulted in different interlayer spaces and variable conformations of the charge compensating anion. In all cases, at low equilibrium concentrations, the adsorption of 4-chlorophenol (pH = 11) occurred at the edges of the layer structure accompanied by Cl − /OH − exchange. The increasing order in the amount of 4-chlorophenol adsorbed was matched by an increasing order in the interlayer space due to substitution. At higher values of the equilibrium concentration, the adsorption of both phenolate and OH − anions decreased. This was because such adsorption into the interlayer space to replace the CO 2– anion was diffusion-controlled, making the process improbable at high pH values.",

The results showed that APA, the polymer obtained after amination, exhibited a higher adsorption capacity than NPA towards XBR from the single-solute solution. However, in binary-solute solution adsorption, the presence of ABSA reduced the adsorption capacity towards XBR due to direct competition between XBR and ABSA for the same adsorption sites.

The pure and doped samples were precalcined at 600°C and 800°C, respectively. The dopant concentrations employed were 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mol% CeO 2 or V 2 O 5 . The resulting materials were studied by XRD and EDX methods, N 2 adsorption at −196°C and CO oxidation by O 2 at 130–220°C. The results obtained revealed that the surface concentrations of cobalt species in pure and variously doped Co 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 solids precalcined at 600°C were more than twice those present in the bulk of these solids. Heating the doped solid at 600°C and 800°C increased the degree of dispersion of Co 3 O 4 by decreasing the crystallite size. This effect was more pronounced in the case of V 2 O 5 doping, with the surface concentration of cobalt species being increased to a greater extent than with CeO 2 doping. Similarly, heating the doped solid at 600°C resulted in a progressive but measurable increase in the lattice parameter of Co 3 O 4 due to the formation of solid solutions. On heating the V 2 O 5 -doped solid at 800°C, a portion of the added V 2 O 5 inter-acted with Co 3 O 4 to yield cobalt vanadate while the other portion contributed to the formation of a solid solution. Doping followed by heating at 600°C increased the catalytic activity of the doped solids in CO oxidation by O 2 . In contrast, solids precalcined at 800°C exhibited the opposite effect. The doping process changed the concentration of active sites involved in the catalytic reaction rather than changing the mechanism of the catalytic reaction.",

    "abstract": "The effect of the solvent extraction of peat on the sorption behaviour of three divalent metal ions [iron(II), lead and barium] was examined. Solvent extraction of peat resulted in particles of a smaller size with a significantly increased surface area. The extracted peat also demonstrated an increase in cation-exchange capacity from 127.2 to 149.5 mequiv/100 g, apparently due to an increase in available phenolic groups. Adsorption experiments carried out at pH 4.5 on peat and on the solvent-extracted peat using the three metal ions showed that the sorption behaviour of Fe(II) and Pb(II) ions correlated strongly with the Langmuir isotherm whereas the behaviour of Ba(II) ions was better described by the Freundlich expression. When the two peat substrates were compared, the monolayer saturation capacity observed for the Fe(II) ion on peat was 0.357 mmol/g while a value of 0.420 mmol/g was recorded for the solvent-extracted peat, with solvent extraction of the peat leading to a more modest increase in Pb(II) ion adsorption. The increase in molar monolayer saturation capacity for the Fe(II) ion suggests that these smaller ions were bound preferentially to the strong phenolic sites, with Pb(II) ion adsorption occurring on the carboxylic sites. In the case of Ba(II) ions, interactions other than ion exchange contributed to the sorption behaviour.",

The adsorption of benzene, C 1 –C 4 alkyl-substituted benzenes, C 6 –C 9 straight-chain alkenes and isomeric hexenes was studied using a McBain–Bakr gravimetric balance. Interesting observations were made with respect to the adsorption uptake of the different probe molecules for exploring the pore architecture. Beta zeolite is a large pore zeolite (7.5 Å) which allows three-dimensional access to molecules, whereas PCH is known to have large pores allowing two-dimensional access for molecular entry. Irrespective of the number of attached –CH 2 side-chain groups attached, the rate of diffusion of the molecules inside the beta zeolite pore channels was less constrained. However, in the case of Mont-2, where the pores were blocked by the surfactant molecules, adsorption was apparently due to the diffusion of molecules through the interlayer packed with a bilayer of surfactant molecules. The packing density of the adsorbate molecules in the channels of the adsorbent was determined by the space-filling characteristics of the molecules which, in turn, depended on various factors such as the effective molecular volume, steric factors, the positioning of the double bonds, and the attractive and repulsive forces.",

    "abstract": "For the design of a fixed-bed reactor, intraparticle diffusivity of adsorbents is one of the most important parameters. However, determining this diffusivity is difficult as measuring the effects of fluid film resistance of adsorbents. Shallow-bed (differential reactor) technique is commonly used to determine intraparticle diffusivity. The conventional shallow-bed technique is based on the assumption that fluid film resistance is negligible because of high fluid velocity; hence, the fluid film mass transfer is not calculated. For an activated carbon–phenolic compound system, both intraparticle diffusivity and fluid film mass transfer coefficient were determined using a shallow-bed reactor. However, no one has confirmed the accuracy of the conventional assumption for a synthetic resin adsorbent–phenolic compound system. In general, synthetic resin adsorbents have a larger fluid film resistance than activated carbon. Therefore, this study focused on the effect of fluid film resistance based on the conventional assumption. The conventional analysis method (intraparticle diffusion controlling model) and the new analysis method (both intraparticle diffusion and fluid film mass transfer controlling model) were compared, and the results indicated that the conventional assumption, which neglects the elimination of fluid film resistance, had no effect on intraparticle diffusivity. Therefore, the conventional analysis method is useful for determining intraparticle diffusivity for a resin adsorbent–phenolic compound system.",

The second set of carbosils was obtained from the same precursors and under quite similar conditions, i.e. with the exception of mechanochemical deposition of potato starch replaced by the gelation step. The prepared adsorbents were applied in solid phase extraction of explosive nitrate esters, and nitroaromatics from aqueous solutions. The adsorption and desorption steps were evaluated separately. It was found that textural properties, influenced by carbon deposit and nickel content, have a large impact on the solid phase extraction results. The recovery rates obtained onto carbosils prepared by mechanochemical method are approximately thrice as high as those observed for carbosils prepared by gelation method. It was shown that the composites with moderate nickel content can be used as effective materials for extraction both of aliphatic and aromatic explosives.",

For metatungstate, the spectra of the impregnant solution placed in contact with alumina and of the solutions corresponding to the dissolution pH and pH- were measured as a function of time. In all the cases, the intensity of the band corresponding to metatungstate decreased with time. The spectra of paratungstate B solutions placed in contact with alumina as a function of time were very different from those of paratungstate solutions maintained at the dissolution pH and at pH = 8.5. However, these latter spectra were similar to those obtained for metatungstate solution placed in contact with alumina. The decrease was more rapid for the solution which had been in contact with alumina relative to that to which ammonia had been added (pH = 9). In both cases, the variation in intensity with time was greater than that recorded for the metatungstate solution maintained at the dissolution pH. The observed fraction of metatungstate transformed depended not only on the solution pH but also on the presence of an additional effect due to the interaction of metatungstate ions and alumina. Only the monomeric species WO 2- 4 was present in a solution which had been placed in contact with alumina for 24 h. During impregnation of an alumina support with paratungstate B and ammonium metatungstate solution, the species adsorbed is the monomer while the metatungstate fraction which does not interact with alumina is slowly transformed to the WO 2- 4 species.",

    "abstract": "The behaviour of H 2 and O 2 flows over a porous p-Cr 2 O 3 pellet have been studied by means of an in situ electrical conductivity technique. Changes in the electrical conductivity associated with such gas flows were attributed to changes in the concentration of positively charged holes in the material studied. In the presence of an H 2 flow, the electrical conductivity of the p-Cr 2 O 3 surface first increased and then decreased sharply. The initial increase was attributed to the chemisorption of H 2 leading to surface hydroxylation. The formation of O–H bonds during this process resulted in a decrease in the electron density at the surface and thereby increased the contribution of positively charged holes towards the total conductivity. In contrast, the subsequent sharp decrease in conductivity was explained by the elimination of chemisorbed oxygen which had originally been adsorbed dissociatively at the surface. During this process, elimination of chemisorbed oxygen atoms led to the presence of electrons in the chromia lattice which generated a sharp decrease in the hole concentration via an electron–hole recombination process. In an O 2 atmosphere, the conductivity of the deoxygenated chromia increased exponentially to a maximum value and then decreased until it reached a value similar to that for stoichiometric chromia. The increase in conductivity observed in this case was assigned to the adsorption of oxygen on the chromia surface while the subsequent decrease was attributed to hydrogen desorption. The kinetics of the four processes observed, i.e. hydrogen adsorption, oxygen desorption, oxygen adsorption and hydrogen desorption, have been analyzed.",

The solids thus obtained were dried at 120°C and then calcined in air at temperatures varying between 400°C and 1000°C. The doped samples were prepared by treating Al(OH) 3 with LiNO 3 solutions prior to impregnation with ammonium molybdate. The dopant concentrations employed were 1.5 and 6.0 mol% Li 2 O, respectively. The surface characteristics, viz. the specific surface area (S BET ), the total pore volume (VP) and the mean pore radius (r) of the various pure and doped solids were measured from nitrogen adsorption isotherms conducted at -196°C. The S BET data measured for different adsorbents calcined at various temperatures enabled the apparent activation energy for sintering (ΔE 3 ) to be determined for all the adsorbents investigated. The results obtained reveal that the S BET value of the pure and doped solids decreased on increasing the calcination temperature in the range 400–1000°C. The decrease was, however, more pronounced when the calcination temperature increased from 500°C to 700°C due to the formation of Al 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 . Lithium oxide doping decreased the S BET value of the solid samples investigated and also decreased the activation energy for sintering to an extent proportional to the amount of dopant present. The sintering process for the pure and doped solids proceeds, mainly, via a particle adhesion mechanism.",

As a result, a considerable number of micropores (accessible to nitrogen) were generated together with a small number of mesopores. The next stage (principal activation stage) involved burning at a constant rate accompanied by an uniform increase in the micropore volume. In the third stage, an increased rate of oxidation was observed. This was accompanied by the development of transitional pores linked with the simultaneous limitation of micropore evolution.

    "abstract": "The utilization of activated carbons as catalyst supports for the treatment of gaseous effluents contaminated with volatile organic compounds allows advantage to be taken both of the adsorption of the pollutant on the well-developed porous texture of activated carbons and the possibility of an efficient catalytic conversion. The step of catalyst impregnation should be optimized to obtain a catalyst dispersion compatible with good conversions at sufficiently low temperatures. Textural evolution when impregnation is performed either on the raw material or after activation of the latter has already been well studied. The work described in this paper was directed towards an analysis of the textural evolution of impregnated active carbons when the impregnation step was performed between carbonization and activation. To date, such knowledge is quite scarce. To allow comparison, impregnation with CoO, Co 3 O 4 or CrO 3 was carried out both after activation and after carbonization of nutshells and pinewood sawdust. For both raw materials, impregnation after activation involved deposition of the impregnated oxides on the internal surface of the materials thereby blocking part of the initial micro- and meso-porous textures. When impregnation was conducted after carbonization, metal species acted as catalysts during the subsequent activation step (Co 3 O 4 being the most efficient and CrO 3 the least efficient) and allowed the better development of the porous texture. In nutshell carbons, the metal species remained dispersed in micropores with a smaller volume but a larger size and in the mesoporous texture with a larger volume. Sawdust carbons retained a microporous texture with narrow pores in which the deposition of catalysts did not occur.",

With increasing coverage to 0.5 ML, the enhanced steric repulsion leads to the slope of CO. For 1/6 and 1/2 monolayer coverage, CO is mainly bonded at short bridge site and atop site simultaneously at a certain ratio. When CO coverage is 1 monolayer, CO absorbs at short bridge site and forms p2mg configuration. As the coverage of CO is increased to finally form the p2mg structure, there is a continuous frequency shift up to the value 1962.27 cm -1 .

Meanwhile, the ecorestoration process helps slow down the increase of the concentrations of some heavy metals in the substrate material; however, the changing trends of these metals were not uniform. The root and leaf were the main parts of heavy metal distribution, respectively, corresponding to Pb, Cr, As, Sb, and Ni in root and Cu, Mn, and V in leaf. It confirmed that Indigofera amblyantha Craib had an advantage ability to enrich and transfer Cd, Cu, and Mn obtained from their biological concentration factor (BCF) and biological transfer factor (BTF).

These fine characters of Indigofera amblyantha Craib help explain it well adapted to the ecorestoration of stone coal mines.

Furthermore, excellent removal effectiveness of Cr(VI) and Cd(ІІ) (85.94% and 83.45%, respectively) was still achieved in simulated PRB test at a flow rate of 5.45 mL/min with the heavy metal solution concentration of [Formula: see text] mg/L (Cr(VI) and Cd(II) concentration were, respectively, [Formula: see text]5 mg/L); and the adsorbent had not completely failed by the end of the trial. Yoon-Nelson model was successfully applied to predict the breakthrough curves for the assessment of composite material heavy metal removal performance and was in good agreement with the experimental data of the heavy metal removal efficiency. The strong removal ability of the adsorbent could be attributed to the fact that maifanite with a large diameter can provide support and increase the permeability coefficient and porosity and that zero-valent iron (ZVI) can convert Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and improve the adsorption capacity of maifanite. The obtained results suggested that the novel PRB fillers have great significance for preventing and controlling Cr(VI)/Cd(ІІ)-contaminated groundwater.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the ability of pectin (Pec) to remove direct red 80 (DR80), Congo red (CR), methyl orange (MO), and methyl red (MR) was studied. The removal percentages under adequate pH and ionic strength conditions were as follows: DR80 (99.5%), CR (99.8%), MO (88.6%), and MR (68%), showing that this methodology is efficient to remove azo dyes. The proposed method included the addition of native Pec to the dye aqueous solution and the formation of a gel that occurred when a calcium salt solution was added. This gel retains the molecules adsorbed onto the molecular surface of Pec through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. To our knowledge, it is the first time that the Zimm-Bragg model is used to describe the removal of azo dyes with native Pec. This model includes two parameters: [Formula: see text] (nucleation constant), which is related to the tendency exerted by a dye molecule attached to the Pec to bind to other molecules present in the aqueous phase, and [Formula: see text] (cooperativity parameter), which determines the aggregation capacity of the dye molecules already attached to the Pec. This model fits the experimental isotherms very well, suggesting that Pec binds single molecules and dye aggregates. The obtained results in the values of [Formula: see text] ranged from 922 mol/kg (MR) to 1,157,462 mol/kg (CR), and [Formula: see text] varied from 2.51 (MR) to 169.19 (MO). These results suggest that the use of Pec is a viable option to remove azo dyes from aqueous effluents and that the Zimm-Bragg model fits adequately the isotherms of dyes that have a high tendency to form aggregates.",

Experimental results indicated an aniline adsorption level of ca. 37–42 mg/g for each of the unmodified H-ZSM-5, the 0.5 w/w% Cu–ZSM-5 or the 1.4 w/w% Cu–ZSM-5 zeolites. The Langmuir adsorption model was applicable to all aniline-on-zeolite adsorption processes, with the level of aniline adsorbed being largely unaffected by a change in temperature. The kinetics of the adsorption processes, indicated that the maximum uptake of aniline occurred within 50 min of contact. Assessment of the aqueous stability of the exchanged copper on the ZSM-5 zeolites indicated minimum copper leaching within the pH range 5–11, thus providing a stable working pH range for both the 0.5 w/w% and 1.4 w/w% Cu–ZSM-5 adsorbent materials.Catalytic oxidation studies on the adsorbed aniline indicated that the presence of copper in the zeolites significantly enhanced the degradation of aniline to predominantly carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen, with the production of significantly smaller levels of nitrogen oxide, benzene and nitrogen dioxide.",

Amine groups were found to be responsible for accommodating negatively charged Reactive Red 4 (RR4) molecules via electrostatic interaction. Thus, increasing the number of amine groups on C. glutamicum, via amination, resulted in an enhanced RR4 biosorption capacity. The pH-edge experiments revealed that acidic conditions (pH = 2) favoured the biosorption of RR4 molecules. Isotherm experiments indicated that the aminated C. glutamicum exhibited the highest RR4 uptake, i.e. 133.8 mg/g at pH 2, compared to 96.8 mg/g for raw C. glutamicum. Of the two isotherm models considered, the Toth model provided a better description of the experimental isotherms, with high correlation coefficients and low percentage error values. Kinetic experiments revealed the importance of the initial dye concentration, with equilibrium being rapidly attained after ca. 1 h for all the concentrations examined. The non-linear form of the pseudo-second-order model described the biosorption kinetic data, with high correlation coefficients and low percentage error values compared to the pseudo-first-order model. Desorption was successful achieved at pH 10, with &gt; 90.2% elution efficiencies for both the raw and aminated biomasses.",

The prepared activated carbons exhibited improved adsorption capacities towards benzene due to their non-polar surface chemical groups and narrower micropore distributions; however, their adsorption capacities towards ammonia were diminished. The adsorption extent of iron ion was determined by the surface chemical properties of the activated carbons and showed a smaller relationship to the pore volume.

The distribution coefficients for Cs + ion sorption onto powdered rectorite (as determined via the batch technique) were much higher than those of Cs + ions onto compacted rectorite (as determined by capillary test), thereby suggesting that the sorption of Cs + ions onto rectorite was strongly dependent on the density of rectorite, i.e. the interlaminary space of the compacted rectorite contributes significantly on Cs + ion sorption. The distribution coefficients calculated from theoretical calculations, experimental measurements and the diffusion coefficients of Cs + ions were compared and discussed in detail.

Collectors in the form of circles and rectangles were considered, including the limiting cases of squares. Numerical simulation of the Monte Carlo type enabled the particle configurations to be determined, together with their density distribution (coverage) and the saturation coverage for various collectors to particle size ratio L̅ = L/2a and collector width to particle size ratio b̅ = b/2a. An unexpected feature found in these calculations was that the local coverage distribution of adsorbed particles was highly non-uniform, exhibiting a maximum at the centre and at the periphery of these collectors. The main finding of these calculations was the averaged number of particles &lt;N p &gt; adsorbed at the saturation state on collectors as a function of the L̅ and b̅ parameters. It was revealed that &lt;N p &gt; was highest for the square collector (for a fixed value of L̅). For L̅ &gt; 5, our numerical results could be well approximated by the analytical expression &lt;N p &gt; = Θ ∞ L̅ 2 for circles, &lt;N p &gt; = 4Θ ∞ L̅ 2 π for squares and &lt;N p &gt; = Θ ∞ b̅L̅ 2 /π for rectangles.

    "abstract": "Heated cigarettes are becoming trendy due to their advantage of not burning the tobacco material and thus reducing the amount of harmful ingredients released, while being able to leave the nicotine and tar content of the smoke untouched. However, the high temperature of the smoke as it enters the human mouth can affect the user experience. Therefore, the development of adsorption cooling materials for use in heated cigarettes is gradually becoming a hot topic. In this work, an adsorption cooling material based on embossed rod powder was prepared. It was found that compared with the commercial Yoga cooling material, the embossed rod powder based adsorption cooling material was able to reduce the maximum smoke temperature to 45.16 °C. In addition, it reduced the adsorption of nicotine by the cooling material, and increased the glycerol and nicotine content in the cooled smoke, which effectively promoted the taste of the smoke. Furthermore, the molecular simulation results found that the higher specific surface area and rich microscopic pore structure could increase the heat conduction area of the high-temperature flue gas, which enhanced the heat transfer effect of the flue gas. Finally, the periodic characteristic velocity pulsation destroyed the boundary layer formed by the fluid in the wall region, which increased the convective heat transfer effect between the fluid and the particles. The optimum sample 03 had the largest specific surface area and the lowest crystallinity, and thus had the best cooling effect. This work could provide some reference significance for the development of cooling materials for heating cigarettes.",

It is shown that the activated carbon deteriorated gradually upon regeneration. Successive regenerations became necessary after ever-decreasing time intervals, and the amount of trichloroethene adsorbed from the ground water decreased gradually. It appears that the efficiency in the separation of trichloroethene from ground water of the regenerated activated carbons is proportional to their adsorption capacity for trichloroethene at equilibrium.

In both models it is assumed that equilibrium between adsorbed molybdenum and that in the solution, as a consequence of reversible adsorption, occurs simultaneously with molybdenum diffusion.

In mixed surfactant systems, the cationic surfactant was found to induce significant co-adsorption of non-ionic surfactants. The increased adsorption of non-ionic surfactants has been attributed to the formation of non-ideal mixed hemimicelles due to intercomponent lateral interactions. However, non-ionic surfactants with longer hydrophilic chains did not form mixed hemimicelles with CTAB. In general, zeta potential measurements support the adsorption results.",

Such data allowed a reaction pathway to be proposed. In the present work, the variations in the surface oxidation number have been calculated via balances in the C and H atoms in the reaction atmosphere and models of the (010) plane of V 2 O 5 and of CH 3 OH have also been utilized to find energetically favourable sites for the adsorption of CH 3 OH and its subsequent oxidation to H 2 CO. For this purpose, the variation in the total energy of the system was computed by Extended Hückel-type calculations (ASED, Atom Superposition and Electron Delocalization). From such experimental results, it was deduced that the H atoms are removed by the network oxygens and that methanol is adsorbed as the methoxy group. Such removal of H atoms has two consequences: high surface hydroxylation and surface reduction [V(5+) → V(4+)]. In support of these suggestions, the theoretical results have confirmed both the removal of H atoms and methoxy group formation, and have also revealed two possible adsorption sites for CH 3 OH on V 2 O 5 : the terminal oxygens (V=O) and the network bridging oxygens (V-O-V).",

For these materials with cylindrical pores, the Broekhoff-deBoer model for the calculation of pore size distributions produced closer agreement to the mercury penetration pore size distribution. This is in contrast to materials composed of nonporous spheres where the Broekhoff-deBoer model provided poorer agreement to mercury penetration results than either the Cohan or a packed sphere model. The results show that, within a factor of two the pore size distributions calculated from nitrogen adsorption and mercury penetration data are comparable.",

The catalytic activities, expressed as reaction rate constant (k) and reaction rate constant per unit area (k), were found to decrease on increasing the precalcination temperature in the range 400–1000°C.

The introduction of the principle of hydro-dynamical and mechanical equilibria reveals that MVF mechanisms can be characterized and classified according to the values of the pressures pfal corresponding to the beginning of MVF. The values of these pressures are calculated on the basis of experimental measurements of the length changes of the adsorbent rods during vapour adsorption. It is concluded, that the validity of the potential theory for MVF is based on the equality of the pfal and the standard liquid state pol pressures (mechanism MVF 1). The existence of negative pressures pal is typical for the MVF 2 mechanism. The positive values of pfal are characteristic for the intrusion of liquids into the micropores of solids, not wetted by the liquid (mechanism MVF 3).",

The heats of adsorption depend only to a small extent on the manganese content of the catalyst and are independent of the temperature of reduction. The former fact points to a more structural than electronic effect of the manganese oxide addition. The heats of adsorption are, however, strongly dependent on measurement temperature, increasing from about 60 kJ mol-1 at 263 K to about 200 kJ mol-1 at 493 K and then decreasing again to about 180 kJ mol-1 at 543 K. This temperature dependence can be explained by consecutive reactions following CO adsorption, i.e. the Boudouard reaction, dissociation of CO and diffusion of carbon into the bulk of iron. The amount of CO adsorbed is correlated to the metallic iron content in the surfaces of the catalysts.",

The ratios of adsorption face areas and molecular volumes were estimated as 3.4:1 and 7.7:1, respectively. Early in the sample challenge molar ratios up to about 3.4:1 were observed; it is proposed that these result from the adsorption of chloropicrin onto vacant sites or onto water monolayers with readsorption of water occurring elsewhere on the surface.

    "abstract": "An analysis of the experimental potentiometric titration curves for various classes of weakly basic anionites has been made from the basis of the exchange equilibrium theory. When the NaCl concentration in the external solution differed by more than two orders of magnitude, two curves were obtained for each ionite. Reference to the activities of the chloride ions allowed these two curves to be combined satisfactorily. The acrylic anionite, Amberlite IRA 67, fulfilled the model of ideal exchange in the gel phase. Systematic deviations from such ideal behaviour were observed for the polystyrene–divinylbenzene anionite, Lewatit MP 62, while the experimental data for Lewatit AP 49 exhibited an essential deviation from a linear dependence when plotted in terms of the extended Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. Comparative analyses of the titration curves for weakly basic Amberlite IRA 67, strongly basic AB 17-8 and Lewatit AP 49 anion exchangers led to the suggestion that Lewatit AP 49 contained weak and strong basic groups whose behaviour may be described by the extended Henderson–Hasselbalch equation using various effective equilibrium constants but the same value of n (= 1). An equation for calculating the quantity of strong and weak basic groups in an acrylic anionite has been obtained. An explanation of ideality in terms of weakly dissociating (basic) and strongly dissociating (salt) resinates of weakly basic acrylic anion-exchange resins has been proposed.",

Calcination products were obtained from these gels by thermal treatment at 300–1000°C. Vanadia/titania catalysts were obtained by impregnating Ta and Tb with ammonium vanadate to give products containing 4–12 wt% V2O5. These products were calcined at 400°C or 600°C, respectively. The adsorption of nitrogen at −196°C was followed and the isotherms thus obtained analyzed to enable the determination of the textural characteristics of the catalysts through the use of conventional methods of textural analysis. The specific surface area and total pore volume of titania decreased and its mean pore radius increased on increasing the calcination temperature from 400°C to 1000°C. Titania precipitated at pH 3.0 and calcined at 1000°C exhibited non-porous characteristics as indicated by the absence of hysteresis in the corresponding adsorption isotherm. The textural changes were attributed to the anatase → rutile transformation and also to the sintering of rutile. The specific surface area and porosity of vanadia/titania catalysts changed with increasing calcination temperature and with increasing vanadia content. However, the effect of calcination temperature was more pronounced.",

For vanadia/titania samples containing 6 wt% and 12 wt% V 2 O 5 calcined at 400°C or 600°C, the band at 1630 cm −1 still existed in the corresponding spectra whereas that at 2920 cm −1 disappeared, thereby indicating an interaction between the vanadia and the hydrogen-bonded OH groups. The FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on to titania or titania/vanadia samples exhibited bands at 1420 cm −1 and 1540 cm −1 , respectively, the former being ascribed to Lewis acidity and exhibiting a shift to lower wavenumbers with increasing vanadia content, while the latter was ascribed to the presence of Brönsted acid sites. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of pyridine from titania exhibited three desorption peaks extending over the temperature ranges 267–288°C, 335–370°C and 480–510°C, respectively. Impregnation of the initial titania samples with vanadia led to an increase in both the amount of acid sites present on the surfaces of the samples and in the acid strength.

In this paper, the pore size distribution of mesoporous structures is calculated from the adsorption branch of the hysteresis loop, whereby only loops of type H1 are considered. The modeling is done only for cylindrical capillaries and the calculation of the pore size distribution is done by a combination of the percolation theory and the theory of capillary condensation. By applying percolation theory to the adsorption process, the pressure dependence of pore filling during capillary condensation is described. Because of a lack of strictly theoretically based equations for the adsorption process by capillary condensation, a mathematical adaptation to measured data is done by the Bernoulli equation. This is proposed by the authors for the first time for a description of adsorption–desorption processes. Thus a new, strictly thermodynamic method to calculate the mesopore size distribution is gained. As an example, the pore size distribution is calculated. The results coincide well with other evaluation methods.",

An L 16 orthogonal array was obtained according to Taguchi design by determining five factors effective on the process (pH, time, concentration, amount, and temperature) and four levels of these factors. Taguchi method determined concentration as the most effective factor. It suggested pH 3, 60 min, 5 mg.L −1 , 2 g.L −1 and 50°C as optimum conditions. Equilibrium studies were carried out with Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm models, and the process was found to be compatible with the Langmuir ( R 2 = 0.9103) and Dubinin–Radushkevich ( R 2 = 0.9344) model.

The chemical composition was determined, and phase analysis was performed. By Branuer–Teller–Emmet analysis, it was determined that vermiculite exhibited a higher surface area (8.00 m 2 /g) by modifying it. It was seen as a result of Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy analysis that the active functional groups were similar for vermiculite and modified vermiculite.

The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for the treatment of experimental data, fitted by a second-order polynomial equation and multiple regression analysis. The ideal conditions optimized according to the response surfaces are initial concentration (C Oyt = 60 mg L –1 , pH YT = 1.5, D YT = 0.7 g L –1 and T YT = 40 °C for YT and (C o MB = 60 mL –1 , pH MB = 8.5, D MB = 0.7 g L –1 and T MB = 40 °C for MB). Experimental confirmation allowed to accurately determine the maximum eliminations (76.15) for YT and (76.81%) for MB under optimal conditions. Several error analysis equations were used to measure the goodness of fit. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption kinetic data are well modeled by a pseudo-second-order model. Among the different models used to fit the experimental isotherms, the Langmuir model gave the best correlation with capacities q max of 55.55 and 50.00 mg/g, for YT and MB respectively at 40 o C.

In this study, we have fabricated a novel composite material, consisting of rectorite and sludge-derived biochar (REC/SDBC), and characterized its effectiveness in removing lead from water. Our SEM images show that the REC is evenly dispersed on the surface of the SDBC. The composites have a mesoporous structure, and its BET surface is (16.5 m 2 /g) comparable with that of SDBC but larger than that of REC. We found that the maximum adsorption capacity for Pb(II) was 26.89 mg g −1 for REC/SDBC composites with a REC:SDBC ratio of 3:1, which was achieved within 120 min. This is higher than the adsorption capacities of REC (19.81 mg g −1 ) and SDBC (23.15 mg g −1 ) alone. Furthermore, we observed that the adsorption capacity was greater at pH 5.0 compared to other pH values. Our results also indicate that the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir isotherm model provide good fits for the rates and isotherms of Pb(II) adsorption onto REC/SDBC composites. The adsorption kinetic constant and the Langmuir adsorption constant were calculated to be 0.0065 g mg −1 min −1 and 0.319 L mg −1 , respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the reaction mechanism is mainly dominated by chemisorption, involving cationic exchange, surface complexation, and surface precipitation. The high adsorption capacity, combined with the cost-effectiveness and environmental-friendly nature of REC/SDBC composites, make them promising candidates for removing heavy metallic elements from wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Thorium is a promising nuclear fuel; however, even a small amount in nuclear wastewater can cause significant radioactive pollution. Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective adsorbents for the efficient removal of thorium to solve this problem. Herein, the phytic acid modification of carboxylated Zirconium-based metal-organic framework materials (UiO-66-COOH-PA) has been obtained by rapid high-temperature carbonization, which exhibits excellent performance in removing thorium (IV) in acidic aqueous solutions. The maximum adsorption capacity of UiO-66-COOH-PA-2 (with 40% mass ratio of phytic acid) in solution reaches 315.5 mg/g at a pH of 4, which is more than twice that of the unmodified Zr-based metal organic framework (MOF) material. The adsorption kinetics of UiO-66-COOH-PA on thorium has been analyzed using two different isothermal adsorption models, the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm adsorption models. It turns out that the Freundlich model is more suitable for the data. The thorium adsorption process reaches dynamic equilibrium very quickly, while the adsorption dynamics of UiO-66-COOH-PA on thorium follows the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic model. The excellent adsorption performance of UiO-66-COOH-PA-2 at low pH values indicates that adsorption material containing phosphorus is suitable for the removal of thorium especially in acidic systems. It also exhibits excellent selectivity (up to 90.2%) for Th(IV) adsorption in the presence of several coexisting rare-earth ions. Overall, the integration of phosphorus-modified in Zr-MOFs represents a significant advancement in thorium adsorption technology, offering a pathway toward more effective management of radioactive acidic waste liquid.",

Among various natural biosorbents, Avicennia marina (true mangrove) emerges as a promising candidate due to its robust growth in coastal ecosystems and its potential for dye adsorption. This research delves into the feasibility of employing A. marina as a green biosorbent for the decolorization of methyl red (MR), a prevalent textile dye. Through comprehensive experimentation, we examined the effects of various parameters, including the contact time (20–120 min), pH (1–10), temperature, dose (25–150 g/L), and initial dye concentration (20–600 mg/L), on the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent. Characterization of the prepared biosorbent was done using atomic force microscopy(AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The FTIR results show phenobarbitone containing OH, –CH, –NH 2 , COOH, –CO, C=C=N, NO, and C=C groups. SEM image indicated long-fiber-bundle and honeycomb-structure parenchyma cell structure found between 1 µm and 2 µm, and XRD peaks exhibited hemicellulose at 2Ɵ=15.01 and cellulose at 2Ɵ=22.03. A. marina exhibits excellent adsorption capacity for MR (73% decolorization at a concentration of 500 ppm occurred in highly acidic conditions (pH = 1) after 75 min of contact time), making it a promising candidate for industrial wastewater treatment. The study emphasizes pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Freundlich adsorption isotherm as the best-fitted model for MR adsorption. Furthermore, the adsorbent demonstrated a commendable removal efficiency for MR dye in actual water samples. The removal efficiency of dye in industrial wastewater, CETP, and Sabarmati river discharge is 67.18%, 82.07%, and 77.55% respectively, with a time duration of 20–120 min. The findings underscore the potential of harnessing natural resources like A. marina for sustainable water management, contributing to the broader goal of achieving zero-waste economies.",

In several situations that reflect practical usage the effluent airstream is not able to remove water from the filter bed as fast as it is displaced (because it quickly reaches saturation). In such cases there is a fine balance as to whether water accumulation in the transport pore structure of the carbon results in pore blockage and thereby prevents the system reaching thermodynamic equilibrium, or whether build-up occurs in the intergranular spaces where it has only a limited effect.",

The adsorption of several other metal ions has also been measured under specific conditions to determine the selectivity of manganese dioxide.

    "abstract": "The structure of pore spaces in typical catalyst particles could often be described as being “not so much fabricated as thrown together”. Thus whilst for certain materials, such as zeolites, the microstructures are well defined and have a precise geometry, most materials when used in typical particulate form are at least partly composed of chaotically configured pore spaces. These random pore structures can be important in determining an adsorbent's performance, so it is necessary to define them quantitatively. A heirarchy of approaches based upon developments from simple stochastic pore networks is described. A stochastic pore network is one in which simple pore segments form interconnecting networks within which pores can be either randomly or partly randomly distributed. Such stochastic networks can be characterised by mercury porosimetry and low-temperature gas adsorption. Interconnectivity and randomness affect the degree of hysteresis for both these techniques. For 3-D random pattern stochastic networks, it is possible to interpret sectioned SEM images using ‘random’ slices of particles subject to low melting point alloy visual porosimetry in order to arrive at measures of random pore structure. This ‘image analysis’ approach is being extended to 3-D image reconstruction of SEM sections using fractal surfaces in conjunction with randomly tortuous pores.",

Furthermore, AlV 2 O 4 which formed at temperatures below 750°C resulted in a tremendous change in the textural properties. Three types of sintering were detected, i.e. particle-particle adhesion, pore widening and phase change. Doping with Na 2 O retards sintering and at low calcination temperatures gave solids with higher surface areas compared to undoped samples.

    "abstract": "The equilibrium adsorption of H 2 S is substantially stronger than that of CH 4 on carbons, including carbon molecular sieve (CMS). A carbon molecular sieve with a proper pore structure can provide a kinetic selectivity for H 2 S over CH 4 , thus further enhancing the overall selectivity (equilibrium plus kinetic) for H 2 S and providing the basis of natural gas desulfurization by adsorption. Kinetic selectivity requires a unique pore structure due to the small difference in the molecular dimensions of H 2 S and CH 4 (~0.2 Å). Equilibrium and diffusion rate data for CH 4 and H 2 S at 25°C have been measured in three commercial carbon molecular sieves: Bergbau Forschung CMS, Takeda CMS 3A and Takeda CMS 5A. The pores are either too small (in the two former carbons) or too large (in CMS 5A) for H 2 S/CH 4 separation. Alterations to the pore structure either by controlled oxidation or carbon deposition by pyrolysis have been studied. Optimal results were obtained by pyrolysis of propylene on CMS 5A under the following conditions: 0.05 atm, 700°C, 5 min, weight gain of 0.67%. The resulting carbon molecular sieve retained the high equilibrium adsorption capacities while yielding a diffusion time constant ratio for H 2 S/CH 4 of 8.2. This carbon is suitable for natural gas desulfurization by adsorption processes such as pressure swing adsorption. Temperature was the most important variable in pore structure alteration by carbon deposition. Under the optimal pyrolysis conditions, carbon was only deposited near the pore entrances.",

These changes are more pronounced for catalysts containing more than 5% metal. Chemisorption of benzene proceeds via the formation of π-bonds with nickel. The chemisorption of hydrogen indicated that the percentage dispersion decreases and the crystallite size increases with an increase in metal loading.

Some magnetic measurements have also been performed on the titanium and palladium samples. The consistency of the measurements is supported by the fact that the initial differential heat of adsorption of all the gases and the irreversibly adsorbed fraction may be correlated. However, the chemisorption energy does not follow any general order of bond energy for the interaction of the series of gases with the three transition metals.

An alternate sequence of impregnation followed by calcination or vice versa was conducted and the samples obtained studied using XRD, FT-IR, pyridine titration and low-temperature (–196°C) nitrogen adsorption methods. XRD indicated that the presence of titanium stabilized the tetragonal modification of zirconia and almost completely prevented the usual tetragonal → monoclinic transformation upon calcination at 650°C. Both S 2 O 8 2– and ClO 4 − anions at their lowest concentration level (0.05 M) partially retarded the crystallization which occurred upon calcination at 650°C in their absence. However, the two anions showed different effects. Whereas the perchlorate anion prevented the formation of a crystalline titania phase (anatase) to a greater extent than that of crystalline zirconia, the persulphate anion showed the opposite effect. Complete inhibition was observed with both anions at a concentration of 0.4 M. This effect was attributed to adsorption of the anions on the hydroxy species of zirconium and titanium formed initially, as demonstrated by IR spectroscopy which showed that the anions were of lower symmetry, viz. C 2v , due to their bonding to the hydroxy species. Calcination at 650°C caused the material formed initially to lose virtually all its initial high surface area because of crystallization. The prevention of crystallization by added anions was reflected in the retention of a relatively high surface area even after calcination at 650°C. The recorded difference in the interactions of the anions with the hydroxy species formed initially was also reflected in the texture of the anion-modified solids. The protecting influence of the ClO 4 − anion increased with its increasing concentration in the system, whereas the corresponding effect with the S 2 O 8 2– anion increased up to 0.10 M concentration and then decreased at higher concentrations.",

The results obtained indicate that a form of equilibration appears to be attained after ca. 30 min although further very slow changes may occur over a much longer period. The adsorption process is controlled by the diffusion of neodymium ions into the pores of the activated charcoal. Adsorption follows first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 13.09 kJ/mol. Values of the equilibrium constant for the adsorption of neodymium ions onto activated charcoal increase with increasing temperature, thereby indicate the endothermic nature of the process.",

    "abstract": "Light cuts from fluid catalyst cracking (FCC) units are commonly used as feedstocks for etherification units in oil refineries. These feedstocks contain nitriles and diolefins that poison the etherification catalyst. PDVSA Intevep has developed several methods for removing these nitriles. An adsorption-based option is discussed in this paper; two other options reported recently were based on catalytic conversions (Ramírez-Corredores et al. 2002, 2003). The oligomerization tendencies of the diolefins dictated the use of a rather inert adsorbent. Some of the critical features of this adsorbent and the adsorption process are discussed. The adsorbent design was based on a geometrical premise and on active non-acid sites to achieve a highly selective adsorbent with a high adsorption capacity for nitriles. Chemical shift was selected for the desorption stage of the removal process to preserve the active lifetime of the adsorbent in the treatment of reactive feedstocks. This was demonstrated to be both effective and beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) is widely used for the removal and recovery of toxic pollutants including metals because of its low cost and high affinity towards the scavenging of metal ions. Activated carbon derived from bituminous coal is preferred for wastewater treatment due to its considerable hardness, a characteristic needed to keep down handling losses during re-activation. Commercial grade carbon, viz. Filtrasorb (F-400), was used in the present work. The scavenging of precious metals such as nickel onto GAC was studied and a possible attempt made to recover the adsorbed Ni 2+ ions through the use of some suitable leaching processes. As part of the study, the role of complexing agents on the surface of the carbon was also investigated. The use of organic complexing agents such as oxine and 2-methyloxine in the recovery process was found to be promising. In addition, the surface of the carbon was modified with suitable oxidising agents that proved to be more effective than chelating agents. Several attempts were made to optimise the recovery of metal ions by carrying out experiments with oxidising agents in order to obtain maximum recovery from the minimum quantity of carbon. Experiments with nitric acid indicated that not only was the carbon surface modified but such modification also helped in carbon regeneration.",

Although similar in chemical structure, the samples obtained showed different textures corresponding to the calcination temperature employed up to 900°C. Loading these samples with different amounts of Mo followed by calcination at 900°C led to the formation of MnMoO 4 samples displaying variable modes of dispersion on their surfaces. The variable distribution of surface hydroxy groups on the samples due to their different textures caused changes in the manner in which the Mo species and the manganese oxide surface interacted, and consequently the final state of the samples obtained after calcination at 900°C differed. Stabilization of the initially formed hausmannite was only detected for Mo-loaded samples prepared from a 0.025 N solution and calcined at 900°C. This behaviour was not observed in the case of the other three samples studied. This stabilization is attributed to localized growth of MnMoO 4 that caused the under-layer regions to be subjected to different environmental conditions during the calcination/cooling processes.",

On the basis of an analysis of the metal cohesive energy and the electron binding energy in ionic cores, a new parameter was proposed called the polarising ability of surface atoms as defined by the equation: [Formula: see text] where E EBE denotes the electron binding energy at the outermost shell of the ionic core, the product (αδG 0 sub ) determines the surface Gibbs energy that is proportional (the quantity α denoting the proportionality factor) to the standard Gibbs energy of sublimation of the metal (δG 0 subM ), r is the metallic radius (half the length of the metallic bond), a o is the radius of the first Bohr orbit and R is the Rydberg constant. It was shown that the above parameter is proportional to the work function and that, in a similar fashion to the ionisation energy of ions, this can indicate the polarising ability of the surface atoms. The correlation between the polarising ability parameter and the initial heat of adsorption of H 2 , O 2 , CO and N 2 , and between the limiting exchange current (log i o ) of the hydrogen evolution on metals, was demonstrated.",

TPD profiles revealed the existence of at least three distinct states of benzene adsorption, characterized by desorption peak maxima at ca. 120°C, 170°C and 220°C, respectively. Based on the growth behaviour of these bands, it is suggested that the benzene molecules occupy sinusoidal channels, straight channels and external surfaces, in that order. A reverse trend was observed during the subsequent flushing of the sample at varying temperatures. A virtually fixed amount of benzene was occluded at these three locations, depending upon the loading. The FT-IR studies revealed that the benzene molecule exists in a compressed state in the zeolitic channels, with the molecular clusters formed in the process dispersing only at temperatures above 150°C. For initial benzene loadings of up to ca. 1.5 molecules/unit cell, the spectrum obtained showed that in the O—H stretch region the bridge-bonded OH groups and hydroxyl groups associated with the internal zeolitic channels were perturbed simultaneously. The results show that even for a loading lower than necessary for saturation, a considerable amount of benzene remains condensed at the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite.",

If chronic, it manifests in various symptomatic forms in humans, such as changes in psychomotor function or organ damage, highlighting the need to investigate and evaluate their toxicity depending on the degree of aversion and repercussions experienced by those exposed to this type of solvent.

Finally, a survey was carried out to obtain information on the level of knowledge of the toxicity of the chemical substances that use the degree of protection; once the results of the quantitative analyses were obtained and supplemented with the data made by the personal interview, it allowed us to obtain the necessary information to carry out the statistical evaluation and thus to interpret the real substance of the occupational exposure of contamination to which these workers are exposed.

Many approaches have been proposed to prevent the growth of bacteria on membrane. The addition of some materials such as natural products was one of those approaches.

    "abstract": "The engineering quality of rock mass is a key factor to evaluate the long-term stability and safety of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) geological disposal engineering and is also the important basis for disposal site selection. Traditional rock mass quality classification methods, such as RMR and [Formula: see text], can meet underground engineering but still should be studied further for the site evaluation in the HLW disposal engineering. In this study, rock mass structure rating (RMSG) was proposed based on the quantitative control index of rock mass structure which was from the rock mass quality classification methods. Based on the statistical results of rock mass structure, the relationship between the number of RMSG and the modified RMR ([Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) was established, China, as a case study. Results from this study show that RMSG is linearly related to [Formula: see text] and negatively exponential to [Formula: see text]. The research results can solve the evaluation of rock mass quality for HLW geological disposal engineering, and the addition of more engineering examples over time will enable further verification.",

    "abstract": "Material hardness of natural fiber composites depends upon the orientation of fibers, ratio of fiber to matrix, and their mechanical and physical properties. Experimentally finding the material hardness of composites is an involved task. The present work attempts to explore the deformation mechanism of natural fiber composites subjected to post-yield indentation by a spherical indenter through a two-dimensional finite element analysis. In the present work, jute-polypropylene, sisal-polypropylene, and banana-polypropylene composites are considered. The analysis is attempted by varying the properties of Young’s modulus of fiber and matrix, diameter of fiber, and horizontal and vertical center distance between the fibers. The analyses results showed that as the distance between the fiber’s center increases, the bearing load capacity of all composite increases nonlinearly. The jute fiber composite shows predominate load-carrying capacity compared to other composites at all [Formula: see text] ratios and interference ratios. The influence of subsurface stress in lateral direction is minimal and gets reduced as the distance between the fiber centers increases. The variation in diameter of fiber influences significantly, i.e., beyond the [Formula: see text] ratio of 1.0; for the same contact load ratio, the bearing area support is double for jute-polypropylene composite compared to sisal-polypropylene composite. Compared to the sisal-polypropylene composite, for the same interference ratio, the load-carrying capacity is two times high for banana-polypropylene composite, whereas four times high for jute-polypropylene composite, but this effect decreases as the [Formula: see text] ratio decreases. In all the composites, the subsurface stress gets distributed as the [Formula: see text] ratio increases. The ratio of fibers center distance to diameter of fiber influences marginally on the contact load and contact area and significantly on the contact stress for all the fiber-reinforced composites.",

Methods. 136 children with HIE and myocardial damage admitted to our hospital from October 2019 to October 2021 were included in the study and were divided into study group and control group of 68 cases each according to the random number table method. The control group was given conventional treatment, and the study group was treated with subhypothermia therapy on top of the control group. Comparing the effects of treatment between the two groups. The serum levels of S-100 β protein, Tau protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase ( ɑ-HBDH), myoglobin (Myo), cardiac trophic factor-1 (CT-1), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), interleukin-1 β (IL-1 β), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor- ɑ (TNF- ɑ) were measured in both groups before and after treatment, respectively. Results. The total effective rate was higher in the study group (88.24%) than in the control group (72.06%) ([Formula: see text]).

    "abstract": "The North Qilian orogenic belt is a typical area of “cold” subduction of the early Paleozoic oceanic plate, forming a series of high pressure and low temperature metamorphic rock assemblages. Among them, eclogite is a kind of protolith, which is basaltic or gabbro high pressure metamorphic rock, mainly composed of garnet and chlorite which are two kinds of minerals. Eclogites record the entire history of subduction zone metamorphism and later exhumation. Due to the crystal habit and the developed joints, the strength of the pyroxene in the matrix is weak, so it is subjected to the main strain during deformation, whereas garnet tends to show only passive rotational deformation. This paper presents some new results in petrology and tectonic geophysics of eclogite block-like and planar eclogite. The massive and facial eclogite rocks contain eclogite facies mineral assemblages, and the peak temperature and pressure conditions are [Formula: see text]°C and [Formula: see text] GPa, which are consistent with the adjacent eclogite. Combined with the characteristics of in situ Lu-Hf isotopes, Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ ratios of zircons, relative oxygen fugacity, and absolute oxygen fugacity, it is shown that the oxygen fugacity of the granodiorite porphyry (BL023, BLO31, DB048) of the folio chemical and massive eclogite deposits are all located in MH (magnetite-hematite) buffer zone. Through the calculation results of absolute oxygen fugacity of rock mass, it can be seen that the absolute oxygen fugacity of ore-bearing rock mass is significantly higher than that of non-ore-bearing rock mass. This paper systematically summarizes the research progress of the microscopic and ultrastructural deformation of eclogite minerals in high-pressure metamorphic zones, and discusses the changes of mineral composition, oxygen fugidity, and fabric of eclogite deformation characteristics during the recovery of subduction and reentry.",

The effects of these substances on human health and the environment are frequently debatable because they typically have poorly understood mechanisms of toxic action. For this reason, we set out to evaluate a binary mixture consisting of butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and propylparaben (PPB), two approved additives that have been found in the environment and have a range of health-related effects. Based on our prior research, we chose an experimental model called Vero cells, kidney fibroblasts from the African green monkey ( Chlorocebus aethiops), with high sensitivity in toxicology studies and ideal characteristics for the analysis of chemical compounds’ mechanisms of action. The experimental design includes a battery of tests using many complimentary biochemical and morphological biomarkers, the usefulness of which we have previously established. The outcomes demonstrated that the mixtures of BHA and PPB cause significant functional alterations brought on by osmotic imbalance, which are connected to irregularities in cell cycle progression, increases in ploidy, which included cell cycle imbalances as well as increases in proliferation. On the other hand, we have been able to show that the quantitative estimate of the anticipated cellular responses generally does not adjust precisely to the observed effect through the analysis of the prediction of the combined effect using mathematical models. However, once the individual compounds’ respective mechanisms of action have been established, the toxicity caused by the mixtures can be qualitatively predicted.",

In this study, the effectiveness of the adsorbent prepared from oak tree fruit waste (activated carbon (AC)) has been investigated in order to remove crystal violet (CV) industrial dye from aqueous solution. The prepared adsorbent was characterized using the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET surface area measurement, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis and applied as an effective adsorbent for removal of CV dye as an organic dye from an aqueous solution. Optimum conditions were obtained using 1.4 g adsorbent, 10 mg L −1 CV dye, 38 min contact time and pH 7.5 with 98% dye removal. Equilibrium data were evaluated using Langmuir, Freundlich and Tempkin isotherm. The Langmuir model best described the absorption of CV dye, indicating that it is monolayer and homogeneous (R 2 = 0.996). The maximum absorption capacity under optimal conditions was 23.86 mg/g. Kinetic data were analyzed using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and elovich equations, and the pseudo-second-order model showed the best fit for kinetic studies (R 2 = 0.993).",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the efficacy of environmentally friendly silica-based nanocomposites, SiO 2 -Fe 3 O 4 and SiO 2 -ZnO, for removing Ibuprofen (IBU) from aqueous solutions. The synthesized nanocomposites were characterized using various techniques, such as SEM, TEM, EDS, and FTIR. The adsorption capabilities of IBU onto these nanocomposites were explored through comparative analysis, focusing on factors such as pH, initial pollutant concentration, contact time, and temperature. Results reveal that the adsorption process is pH-dependent, and the lower pH levels enhance the adsorption process. The IBU removal process is faster with SiO 2 -Fe 3 O 4 compared to SiO 2 -ZnO. Kinetic modeling suggests a pseudo-second-order mechanism [Formula: see text] for IBU adsorption onto the surfaces of both adsorbents. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were employed and demonstrated to analyze the equilibrium data. The Langmuir model revealed a higher maximum adsorption capacity for SiO 2 -Fe 3 O 4 [Formula: see text] than SiO 2 -ZnO [Formula: see text]. Thermodynamic analysis indicates a chemisorption mechanism for SiO 2 -ZnO and a physisorption mechanism for IBU molecules on the surface of SiO 2 -Fe 3 O 4 . In addition, the standard thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption process indicate that IBU adsorption via both nanocomposites is exothermic, resulting in reduced entropy, and occurs spontaneously. This research introduces silica-based nanocomposites with Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles for efficient Ibuprofen removal from aqueous solution. The magnetic properties allow easy separation and reusability, enhancing treatment effectiveness. The study offers valuable insights for improving water treatment strategies with potential industrial applications.",

At very low coverage and at 25°C, the values of the differential heats of adsorption of the different alcohols were very high (250–200 kJ/mol) and were apparently independent of the chain length. However, at average coverage, the chain length of the alcohol began to influence both the values and the trends in the differential heats of adsorption of the various alcohols on α-Al 2 O 3 . Finally, at high coverage, it was found that the incorporation of each additional –CH 2 –group in the homologous series led to a decrease in both the integral heat of adsorption and the amount of alcohol adsorbed according to the series MeOH &gt; EtOH &gt; 1-PrOH &gt; 1-BuOH &gt; 1-PeOH. Increasing the temperature led to an increasing dependence of the differential heat on the chain length of the alcohol. In addition, from measurements of the thermokinetic parameters for the heat emission peaks for the adsorbed alcohols, it has been deduced that all five aliphatic alcohols studied adsorb on to an α-Al 2 O 3 surface in an open-chain perpendicular fashion.",

    "abstract": "During adsorption from the gaseous phase on to solid sorbents, it is known that heat transfer generally induces a mass transfer process. The present investigation was concerned with the solution of some questions relating to the heat transfer phenomenon during adsorption from the aqueous phase. In so doing, the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the adsorption of benzene derivatives from aqueous solution by polymeric sorbents, i.e. Polysorb 60/100 and sample G-5, have been studied using the method of statistical moments for calculating the heat diffusion contribution to the general mass diffusion process. This method consists of the mathematical analysis of the temperature dependence of the kinetic diffusion curves on the basis of a linear adsorption isotherm. The contribution of the kinetics of heat transfer to the first sum of the moment of the kinetic curve may be defined as: where Mlq is that part of the first moment which represents heat diffusion and MID is the diffusion part of the first moment. The results obtained for the different systems investigated show the existence of a heat transfer effect on the kinetic adsorption process. This effect which retards the heat transfer process may be expressed in terms of the final rate of heat dispersion. The external contribution of heat transfer to the general mass transfer has been evaluated as 3–11% for various research systems. It has been shown that the evaluated contribution of the heat transfer is larger during adsorption by hydrophilic polymeric sorbents than when hydrophobic ones are employed. This fact may be connected with the different chemical composition and density of the sorbents.",

The conversion of 2-propanol at 523 K and the cracking of cumene at 693 K were investigated using the pulse microcatalytic technique. The surface area decreased and the mean pore volume increased with increasing alumina content. The amount of acid present and its surface density increased while the relative acid strength decreased with an increase in the alumina content. The extent of dehydration of 2-propanol increased with increasing surface acid density and proved to be insensitive to the acid strength. The cracking of cumene appears to depend on the surface area, the amount of acid present and the acid strength of the catalyst, although its dependence on these parameters is of a relative complex nature.",

The adsorption isotherms were characterized by three distinct regions: region I which occurred at lower equilibrium concentration (&lt; 100 mg/l) where the adsorption density increased at elevated temperature as the number of double bonds increased in the fatty acid; region II where the adsorption density increased sharply due to the surface precipitation of calcium carboxylate; and region III where a decrease in adsorption density was exhibited as the equilibrium concentration reached the CMC of the soaps. The oxidative effect of temperature on the double bond appeared to be the reason for the polymerization of the soap species on the mineral surface which led to the increase in adsorption in region I. The effect of temperature on adsorption in region II could be related to the relative solubility of the precipitated calcium salt of each soap and micelle formation in region III was also affected by temperature which caused a decrease in CMC formation at elevated temperatures.",

In this way, complete elimination of lithium impurities introduced during precursor synthesis has been achieved by the use of titanium or zirconium phosphate sorbents (usually used as acidic ion exchangers in aqueous media).

Higher adsorption and a reduced movement of cypermethrin was observed on silt clay loam soil followed by loam and sandy loam soils and was anticipated by the Freundlich adsorption constants K m and R f values. The K m and R f values also confirmed that the adsorption of cypermethrin decreased while its movement increased with increasing f s values. The values of the Freundlich constant K m were used to evaluate the cosolvent theory for describing the adsorption of cypermethrin in acetone–water mixtures. For each soil, the values of the adsorption coefficient K m decreased in a linear logarithmic fashion as f s increased, the slopes of the log K m versus f s plots being essentially the same for all soils. Thus, the cosolvent effects on adsorption could be expressed by a single parameter (σ s ) which combines the characteristics of the solvent (acetone) and the adsorbate (cypermethrin). For adsorbates with a low solubility in aqueous solutions, the adsorption data from mixed solvents was extrapolated to f s = 0 to estimate the values of the adsorption constant K w in the aqueous phase.",

The catalytic activities exhibited in CO oxidation by O 2 on the various solids were investigated at temperatures varying between 150°C and 400°C. The effect of heating the NiO and Fe 2 O 3 solids in CO and O 2 atmospheres at 175–275°C on their catalytic activities was also studied. The results showed that increasing the calcination temperature in the range 300–800°C resulted in a progressive decrease in the S BET value of NiO and Fe 2 O 3 . The computed values of the apparent activation energy for the sintering of the oxides were 71 and 92 kJ/mol, respectively. The sintering of NiO and Fe 2 O 3 took place mainly via a particle adhesion mechanism. The catalytic activity of NiO decreased progressively on increasing its calcination temperature from 300°C to 800°C, due to a decrease in its S BET value and the progressive removal of excess O 2 which was present as non-stoichiometric NiO. This treatment also decreased the catalytic activity of Fe 2 O 3 . The decrease was, however, more pronounced when the temperature increased from 300°C to 400°C which was a result of the crystallization of the ferric oxide into the α-Fe 2 O 3 phase. An increase in the calcination temperature for both oxides from 300°C to 800°C did not modify the mechanism of oxidation of CO by O 2 over the various solids but rather changed the concentration of catalytically active sites. Heating NiO and Fe 2 O 3 in CO and O 2 atmospheres at 175–275°C modified their catalytic activities, with Fe 2 O 3 being influenced to a greater extent than NiO.",

Thus, a loss of microporosity occurred, for example, when contact between the H 2 O 2 solution and the AC was effected at 0°C, whereas no loss of microporosity occurred when the temperature was 70°C.

Analysis of the results for all three carbons shows that the principal effects of SO 2 and NO 2 are in reducing the fraction of Cr as Cr VI and in blocking the micropore adsorption sites for HCN and (CN) 2 . There is little obvious correlation between SO 2 or NO 2 loading and the N 2 adsorption rate constants and N 2 adsorption energies. There is an overall reduction in microporous area and volume on exposure of ASC/T to both SO 2 and, to a lesser but still marked degree, to NO 2 . The biggest reduction is in the fraction of pores &lt;5 Å radius. It is thought that the reduction in breakthrough time and the related adsorption capacity for HCN and (CN) 2 is due to chemical reduction of the Cr VI by SO 2 on the carbons giving sulphate or sul-phuric acid species, both blocking the microporous structure and reducing the ability of Cr VI to oxidise the copper cyanide complexes to oxamide. Analogous mechanisms are proposed to explain the lesser but nonetheless marked effect of NO 2 exposure. These findings are consistent with earlier work in the authors' laboratory and that reported elsewhere.",

The textural properties were determined from nitrogen adsorption at 77 K and the acidities of the thermal product were measured by pyridine chemisorption at 423 K.

Calcination of CuO/Fe 2 O 3 at 600°C resulted in partial transformation to CuFe 2 O 4 , this transformation predominating at 700°C and being complete at 800°C. Two mechanisms of electrical conduction are involved for catalysts calcined at 600–800°C depending on the temperature at which σ is measured. The surface area decreases and the average pore radius increases with increasing calcination temperature due to sintering and spinel formation. A mechanism is suggested for H 2 O 2 decomposition and the activity and selectivity of the catalysts towards the conversion of 2-propanol are discussed.",

Differential and integral molar values of adsorption Δ a X̄ and Δ a X in the two-phase approach are not identical with the corresponding excess values Δ a X̄ s and Δ a X s in the one-phase approach. Especially at high temperatures and high pressures they may be entirely different. It is shown that the experimental methods most usually in adsorption thermodynamics (as adsorption volumetry and gravimetry) give excess data which are to be used in the one-phase approach but which can be transformed to the two-phase approach. Using statistical thermodynamic calculations the difference between these basic concepts is shown over a wide temperature range for the first virial coefficient, the internal energy and the heat capacity of adsorption.",

Thermal treatment above this temperature leads to the generation of mesoporous materials exhibiting little or no micropore volume. It is suggested that the ready removal of loosely-bound or absorbed water from the gel at lowertemperatures, to generate an essentially microporous structure, is catalysed by the presence of NH 3 ligands. Decreasing ammonia concentration (as in the sequence NH 4 HCO 3 , NaHCO 3 , NaOH). coupled with increasing precipitant basicity leads to a higher proportion of strongly bound water (hydroxo ligands) in the gel.

    "abstract": "The textural properties of sulphated ZrO 2 –SiO 2 catalytic supports of different compositions were investigated through N 2 sorption and X-ray diffraction (conventional and SAXS) methods. The materials were synthesised by the sol–gel procedure from a mixture of zirconium(IV) tert-butoxide and tetraethyl orthosilicate. The final products were obtained after drying at 125°C followed by calcination at 400°C. The porous structures of the substrates were found to depend on their composition: at low zirconia contents these were formed by slit cavities while at high ZrO 2 concentrations the void structure became open; both cavities and necks were of similar size. In the first case, the pore size distribution function could be obtained from an analysis of the ascending boundary curve of the N 2 isotherm since adsorption occurred on a flat surface. In the second case, a unique pore-size distribution was obtained either from the ascending or descending boundary curves of the N 2 isotherm. A tubular geometry seemed appropriate for the description of the sorption characteristics of these substrates. Primary descending scanning curves traced within the hysteresis loops of samples having high ZrO 2 contents offered further textural information. X-Ray diffraction methods provided compound identification, evidence of phase segregation between ZrO 2 and SiO 2 , and particle and pore-size distributions.",

The results revealed that doping the investigated system followed by calcination at 500–900°C brought about a progressive increase in the specific surface area to an extent proportional to the amount of dopants added. This led to an increase in the catalytic activities of the doped solids towards H 2 O 2 decomposition, especially for solids calcined at 700°C and 900°C. However, this increase was more pronounced with MoO 3 doping. On the other hand, the catalytic activity of the investigated system in CO oxidation by O 2 expressed as the reaction rate constant per unit surface area (k̅) was found to decrease on increasing the amount of Ag 2 O and MoO 3 added. Calcination of the investigated system at 900°C led to the effective dissolution of most of the cobalt oxide added into the MgO lattice to yield a CoO-MgO solid solution.

Activated oak shells adsorbed more phenol than natural oak shells under the same conditions. A decrease in sorbent concentration or an increase in phenol concentration or solution pH resulted in an increase in phenol uptake by the oak shells. The uptake of Methylene Blue increased with decreasing sorbent concentration and with an increase in the dye concentration, but decreased significantly with solution pH. According to the fractional factorial design technique, the sorbent type employed (natural or activated) had the most significant influence on phenol or Methylene Blue uptake followed by sorbent concentration and then sorbate concentration.

For all Langmuir films, surface pressure–area per molecule (π–A) isotherms were used to monitor the surface thermodynamics (i.e. the excess area and excess free enthalpy of mixing). This allowed to evaluate the kind and magnitude of interactions that have an influence on the phase behaviour and structural properties of the monolayers. Then, assuming that the molecular properties of Langmuir films are preserved upon transfer to a solid support, further characterizations were accomplished with advancing and receding contact angle measurements on the Langmuir–Blodgett films deposited at 35 mN/m on mica. These enabled the possibility to track changes in the wettability of the tightly packed or phase-separated phospholipid films and their surface free energy as a function of the monolayer composition. It is believed that these results throw a light on better understanding of the organizational structure of lipid films and their interactions with the surrounding environment. Moreover, the obtained results can be also helpful to identify the optimal lipid composition in the production of more effective therapeutic surfactants.",

Static adsorption data indicate that the adsorption capacity of indole–MIPs was 55.8 mg g −1 , and the adsorption equilibrium is achieved in 120 minutes. According to the results of thermodynamic analysis, the adsorption process is spontaneous. In addition, results of kinetics analysis indicated that the adsorption performances of indole–MIPs obey pseudo-second-order model. The Sips and Langmuir equations better fitted with the experimental isothermal data than the Freundlich equation. The selectivity of indole–MIPs was significant and the adsorbent could be reused even after five regeneration cycles.",

Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of a suitable atomistic lattice-gas model describing the adsorption and 1D submonolayer growth of Al and In on Si(100): 2 × 1 was performed to investigate the resulting nanowire morphology in the presence of various C-defect densities at various deposition temperatures. Average island density (N av ) in Al/Si (100) generally obeys the classically predicted Arrhenius behaviour as temperature increases. By contrast, In adatoms exclusively nucleate on C defect, where N av is equivalent to defect density. In Al/Si (100) and In/Si (100), N av showed linear and ‘power law’ dependence on coverage, respectively, whereas the average island size (S av ) for both systems showed linear dependence on coverage. The nanowires morphology in the Al/Si (100) system showed considerable dependence on flux variation. Because of the low-diffusion barrier of In adatom and high-detachment barrier on C defect, In/Si (100) is insensitive to flux. Morphology of In chains is dictated by the defect density: an increase in defect density caused higher island density and smaller island sizes irrespective of coverage and flux rates.",

YNS not only has slightly larger pore size and IEP value than those of YPS but also possesses higher thermal stability. Precisely because of these factors, the pore of YNS-550 is characteristic of unique curvature, having stronger action with the lacease molecule than that between lacease molecule and YPS-550 with smaller pore curvature.

    "abstract": "A novel method to quickly prepare molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) monolithic fibres is developed using microwave irradiation. The well-known water-compatibility problem of MIP is overcome by liquid-liquid-solid microextraction (LLSME). The atrazine (ATR) MIP fibre was obtained after silica was etched away with a controlled length of 1 cm, and subsequently characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Main factors affecting the selective extraction, including extraction time, desorption time, extraction and desorption solvents, were investigated for LLSME procedures in detail. The selectivity was also evaluated using the ATR template molecule and its structurally related compounds, including 2-amino-4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine, terbuthylazine, ametryn and metribuzin pesticides. The extraction ratio of target pesticides in ATR-imprinted polymeric monolithic fibre was increased to more than 10 times than that in non-imprinted polymeric monolithic fibre. The resultant fibres coupled by HPLC were successfully applied to detect ATR and its analogue pesticides with recoveries in the range of 68.3–92.6%. In addition, the LLSME technique was proved to be effective in extracting spiked TRI, ATR, AME and TER in lake water. This method provided a satisfactory solution for the simple, rapid, selective and sensitive pre-treatment of trace herbicides in various aqueous samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique could solve the water compatibility problem when the MIP monolithic fibre was exposed directly to a non-polar solvent above the aqueous solution.",

The nickel content was varied between 7.9–34.3 wt.% NiO and the reaction temperatures were changed between 240–450°C. The liquids and gases produced were analyzed chromatographically. The results obtained reveal that the cyclohexane underwent both dehydrogenation and cracking reactions producing benzene and light aliphatic hydrocarbons, respectively. The nickel metal acts as the actual active constituent of Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The selectivity towards the cracking reaction was increased by increasing the amount of nickel, the solids possessing 7.9 wt.% Ni showing no detectable cracking activity at temperatures below 350°C. On the other hand, the selectivity towards benzene formation decreased on increasing the extent of nickel in the various solid catalysts. Although catalysts containing 7.9 wt.% nickel showed the smallest catalytic activity, they exhibited the highest selectivity towards benzene formation.",

Both methods are based on external mass transfer and internal diffusion as the controlling mass-transfer resistances. The first method is a rapid analytical solution enabling external mass-transfer coefficients and effective diffusivities to be determined, but is restricted to the assumption that a pseudo-analytical isotherm is applicable. The second method, based on a pseudo-analytical solution, is applicable to operating lines and tie lines terminating at any point on the isotherm, but requires longer computational time.

The analysis was performed on the basis of data from IR spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis, and the porous structure characteristics of the modified aerosilogel. The following types of substances were used as modifiers of the silica surface: (a) substances which did not interact chemically with the silica surface; (b) substances capable of polymerization or polycondensation; and (c) substances capable of chemical reaction with the surface. From an analysis of data obtained for 26 adsorbents, it results that depending on the nature of the substance used for modification such substances can promote the process of silica mass transfer. During this process, the possibility occurs of the occlusion of the substances inside silica globules, changes in the parameters of the porous structure, physical or chemical bonding of the modifier molecules with the aerosilogel surface, destruction of the reaction products, etc. The mechanism of the reaction was discussed.",

The silica gel was thermally stable and suffered about 15% loss in area at 800°C. The impregnated silicas showed considerable decrease in surface area as a function of their heteropoly acid content. Two processes are suggested as taking part in the modification of pore structure: (1) diffusion of the aqueous heteropoly acid solution and its subsequent deposition; and (2) dissolution of silica gel in the acidic aqueous solution followed by interaction with HPMo to form either molybdosilicate or P–Si exchange products. Correlation with the previously studied catalytic conversion of isopropanol indicated that the activity was independent of the surface area. Catalytic dehydration on the 600°C and 800°C products seems to be associated with silicate, molybdate or MoO 3 surface species rather than being due to surface acidity or the extent of the surface area.",

The chemisorption of N 2 at ambient temperature increased steadily with pressure on all the catalysts studied so that the resulting isotherms were straight lines. When the adsorption temperature was raised, N 2 chemisorption decreased and the corresponding isotherms developed three adsorption steps. These three adsorption steps are attributed to structure-sensitive nitrogen chemisorption on the three low Miller index planes of ruthenium, i.e. (101), (100) and (001). When the nitrogen uptakes at 740 Torr as taken from the adsorption isotherms were plotted against the Ru loadings, a maximum was obtained at an Ru loading of 2.5 wt.% which corresponds to an Ru crystallite size of 4 nm, suggesting that N 2 chemisorption is a highly structure-sensitive phenomenon on these catalysts.",

Oxidation with 6 M nitric acid increased the penetration times for methanol vapour in dry air, not by just raising the dynamic capacity at low concentrations but also by improving the kinetics of adsorption. Reduction caused the opposite effect. The improvement in the adsorption kinetics is thought to be due to surface diffusion on to the oxidised surface of the transport pores.",

The base sample was also treated with bromine water and then hydrogenated. The surface areas and pore volumes available to water vapour were unchanged by these treatments, although the polar surface area was considerably reduced in each case. The sample with the lowest surface polarity had the worst performance (shortest penetration time) when pre-humidified at 80% RH and tested with hexane. Examination of the humidity leaving the bed during the adsorption of hexane vapour suggested that the rate-determining step was the surface transport of displaced water and that removing the ash content hindered this transport considerably. Bromination followed by hydrogenation, although reducing the polarity, did not remove the ash content and may even have improved its ability to transport displaced water.",

Methane adsorption capacity varies significantly from 12.03 to 28.40 cm 3 /g. In univariate analysis, methane adsorption capacity has a strong positive correlation with pore specific surface area, weak positive correlations with pore volume and ash content, and weak negative correlations with moisture content and inertinite content. No correlation is observed between methane adsorption capacity and coal rank. In multivariate analysis, the mathematical model of methane adsorption capacity affected by the combined individual variables is established based on quantification theory I. There are similarities and differences between the two analyses. The similarities are that pore specific surface area has the greatest contribution to methane adsorption capacity, while coal rank has the least contribution. The differences are reflected in two aspects. Firstly, the other influencing factors contribute differently to methane adsorption capacity. Secondly, the positive or negative correlations of some influencing factors present the opposite. The mathematic model synthetically covers the combined effects of the influencing factors, which is more representative in evaluating methane adsorption capacity.",

    "abstract": "Coals are employed as fiery substance, and every day, millions of ton coal are consumed by coal users around the world. It is investigated that the millions of coal’s transportation/logistic till the coal user plants via road route and also inside the coal user plants (known as twice factors) not only enhance the air pollution but also cause the global warming. It is earlier known that coals emit the toxic pollutants and offensive gases such as sulfur dioxide, SO 2 ; nitrogen oxides, NOX; hydrogen chloride arsenic; carbon monoxide, CO; methane; CH 4 ; and CO 2 on reacting with environmental O 2 due to said twice factors, i.e., during the transportation from coal refinery spot to entry gate of coal user plants (another spot) and in process logistic/movement inside the coal user plants (loading to conveyor to coal fire tubes “attached with coal crushers”). Therefore, the coal refinery technique/process is found as the best practice to control air pollution under concerns of twice factors. The reliable and trustworthy coal refining technology improves the quality of coal by eradicating or eliminating the coating or layers of toxic particles from coal’s surface, which speedily crumble or decompose in reacting with environmental O 2 under twice factors. As results, coal refining technology adds the green supply chain value into proposed twice factors and also save the world from breeding of ills and viruses. It is understood that the best coal refinery technique/process helps to overcome and reduce air pollution by responding discussed twice factors (accepted as research challenge and motivation of research). In the presented research work, the authors developed and proposed a dynamic multidimension Coal Refinery Process Absorbability Index (CRPAI) structure (consisted of coal refinery core dimension and subdimensions correspond to CRPA alternative techniques/processes) appended with Robust Optimization Algorithm (ROA) to be explored for opting the best CRP from available options. But due to inherent ambiguity, vagueness, and inconsistency involve in both dimensions of proposed structure, the assessment of expert’s panel is gathered in the terms of linguistic variable “appropriateness ratings” against the subdimensions of CRPAI structure corresponding to preferred CRP options. Next, assigned appropriateness ratings against the subdimensions are substituted by GIVFN. To arrive to core dimensions from subdimensions of CRPAI structure, a GITFN-OWGO (Ordered Weighted Geometric Operator) is investigated and modified as a Ordered Weighted Geometric Average Operator (OWGAO) to be applied for estimating the weights of subdimensions (core novelty of work). Finally, a ROA (consisted of MULTI-MOORA with dominance theory) is applied on the output of OWGAO for opting the viable and best CRP option. The positive effect of the dynamic multidimension CRPAI structure is that it helps the coal refinery companies to assess measure and evaluate the best and feasible coal refinery process under concern of twice factors using expert information. The research can be used to control the air pollution by responding aforesaid twice factors by single practice (the best coal refinery process/technique assessment and evaluation).",

To address both research challenges, preliminary, the authors developed and proposed FWWB’s parameter model, consisted of physical, chemical, and biological parameters corresponding to [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in nature via auditing a real case of FWWB alternative points such as Narendr Rice Mill-[Formula: see text], Liese Mahamaya Rice Mill-[Formula: see text], Vijay Rice Mill-[Formula: see text], Mahim Rice Mill-[Formula: see text], and Dhansingh Rice Mill-[Formula: see text] and their characteristics vs. parameters.

The main criterion was the time period for which each enriched limestone was able to keep its desulphurisation ability, i.e., time for which the SO 2 concentration in the heated model flue gas was kept below 200 mg/m 3 (current legal limit for the technology in our scope). The analysis showed that the limestone desulphurisation ability increased when 20% of Sorbacal SP was added to the calcined limestone. The overall desulphurisation capacity of this enriched mass was even higher than what would be proportional to the isolated capacity of the additive itself. On the other hand, the enrichment of raw limestone with Sorbacal H 90 proved to be unpromising for the technology of brown-coal fluidised-bed boilers as the fine particles of the additive were carried away, and fluidised bed was inhomogeneous with ducts forming in it.",

It was found that the chemistry of 1,1-difluoroethylene on Pd(111) surfaces is similar to that of ethylene with bonding occurring in both the π- and di-σ-forms. However, due to the presence of C–F bonds in the molecule, the infrared absorbances for 1,1-difluoroethylene were much larger than those for ethylene.

    "abstract": "Studies on the diffusion of methane in a zeolite structure type LTA (as per IZA nomenclature) have indicated that different types of methane–zeolite potentials exist in the literature in which methane is treated within the united-atom model. One set of potentials, referred to as model A, has a methane oxygen diameter of 3.14 Å, while another set of potential parameters, model B, employs a larger value of 3.46 Å. Fritzsche and co-workers (1993) have shown that these two potentials lead to two distinctly different energetic barriers for the passage of methane through the eight-ring window in the cation-free form of zeolite A. Here, we compute the variation of the self-diffusivity (D) with loading (c) for these two types of potentials and show that this slight variation in the diameter changes the concentration dependence qualitatively: thus, D decreases monotonically with c for model A, while D increases and goes through a maximum before finally decreasing for model B. This effect and the surprising congruence of the diffusion coefficients for both models at high loadings is examined in detail at the molecular level. Simulations for different temperatures reveal the Arrhenius behaviour of the self-diffusion coefficient. The apparent activation energy is found to vary with the loading. We conclude that beside the cage-to-cage jumps, which are essential for the migration of the guest molecules, at high concentrations migration within the cage and guest–guest interactions with other molecules become increasingly dominant influences on the diffusion coefficient and make the guest–zeolite interaction less important for both model A and model B.",

    "abstract": "In this contribution, we have studied the influence of a periodic distribution of active sites on a model heterogeneous surface on the ability of that surface to preferentially adsorb molecules with a pre-defined shape. For this purpose, we used a simple analytical model in which a mixture of linear and bent rigid molecules composed of three identical segments was adsorbed onto a square lattice with different patterns of active sites. For each pattern and each type of molecule, the corresponding adsorption energy distributions (AEDs) were determined and used further for the calculation of the associated selectivities. It was demonstrated, that depending on the pattern formed by the active sites, the selectivity towards the bent molecule can vary quite considerably and that a suitable choice of surface pattern can maximize the selectivity. Apart from the adsorptive separation, we also considered the thermal desorption of the mixture and model one-component and binary desorption spectra from the nano-patterned surfaces. The results of the temperature-programmed desorption modelling were compared with those obtained for equilibrium adsorption. It was shown that the pattern which provides the highest selectivity in equilibrium adsorption does not have to be optimal when used in the separation of molecules by temperature-programmed desorption.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a simple method, based on the Dual Site–Bond Model, for constructing disordered cylindrical porous substrata. Heterogeneity is accounted for by allowing the presence of variable cross-sectional areas along the length of the pore tubes forming the solid. The degree of heterogeneity is easily controlled with overlapping between the pore-size distributions of pore cavities and pore necks. Some simulated materials with different textural properties are presented. An analysis of the texture of the generated structures, together with their nitrogen adsorption characteristics, has been carried out and is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption equilibria between chondroitin sulphate A (CSA), a polyanionic biopolymer, and zirconium(IV) dioxide (zirconia) nanoparticles were investigated to characterize the extraction of CSA using the metal oxide. Adsorption isotherms were prepared using sample solutions adjusted to pH values in the range 1.5–7.8, employing various buffer systems, NaCl concentrations and temperatures. The maximum amounts of CSA adsorbed, n a m , and the adsorption constants, K L , were calculated from non-linear curve fits to the Langmuir adsorption model. The buffer components suppressed CSA adsorption to varying degrees; however, the reversibility of the adsorption equilibria improved in the presence of the buffers, as indicated by the large values of K L and the small standard deviations. The temperature-dependent adsorption properties showed that a large n a m value was obtained at 318 K. The extraction of glycosaminoglycans with zirconia was optimal in the presence of acetate ions and at high temperatures, and subsequent desorption was achieved using a NaH 2 PO 4 eluent solution.",

    "abstract": "Calcination at 650°C of a physical mixture of zirconium and titanium hydroxides led to the formation of the corresponding oxides, monoclinic zirconia and anatase. The adsorption of perchlorate or persulphate anions (as 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 M aqueous solutions) before calcination did not inhibit crystallization; however, perchlorate anions activated the formation of rutile in addition to the predominant anatase phase. Indeed, the adsorption of perchlorated anions prior to calcination allowed the thermodynamically less stable tetragonal phase of zirconia to be detected in addition to monoclinic zirconia at ambient temperature. In contrast, the adsorption of persulphate anions before calcination stabilized the tetragonal phase with no rutile phase being detected in this case. Infrared spectroscopy showed that adsorbed S 2 O 8 2– anions were held more strongly by the solid than ClO 4 − anions which tended to decompose when the solid was calcined. The acidities of the solid acids produced because of S 2 O 8 2– or ClO 4 − anion adsorption were studied via the adsorption of pyridine (pK a = 5.3) from cyclohexane solution. The amounts and strengths of the acid sites formed during persulphate treatment were higher than those resulting from perchlorate adsorption. The strength of the acid sites formed on samples calcined before loading with S 2 O 8 2– or ClO 4 − anions showed no significant differences. Variations detected in the structural aspects arising from S 2 O 8 2– or ClO 4 − anion adsorption were reflected in the texture as assessed by nitrogen adsorption at −196°C.",

    "abstract": "In general, it was found that loading hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) with transition metal ions led to a decrease in both the internal surface and external surface area. The micropore volume in the microporous samples (obtained by heating the oxide at 50°C and 200°C) and the total pore volume in both samples and in the mesoporous sample (obtained by heating the oxide at 400°C) also decreased. The mean pore radius, however, appeared to be little altered in all the samples. The observed effects cannot be interpreted on the basis of the adsorption of unhydrated transition metal ions, nor by assuming precipitation of these ions as hydroxides inside the pores. The only other possibility was the assumption that the adsorption of these ions was accompanied by the adsorption of relatively more strongly adsorbed water (not removed during evacuation of the samples) and/or the transformation of water already present in the oxide to strongly adsorbed water. This conclusion was confirmed by comparing the water loss at 100°C and 200°C in the original and metal-loaded HFO samples.",

In the present work, the interaction of two furanic resins obtained by acid catalysis from furfuraldehyde and furfuraldehyde–dimethylketone was studied at 0 °C and 30 °C. Both resins adsorbed ca. 10 −3 mol of ammonia at these temperatures and the adsorption process was characterized by a long period before equilibrium was attained, with the corresponding data being fitted by the Freundlich adsorption model. The structures of the resins were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the use of temperature-programmed desorption coupled with mass spectrometry (TPD–MS), it was possible to infer that ammonia adsorption modified the original chemical structure of the resins to yield imine structures as a result of the reaction of ammonia with the existing more reactive carbonyl groups.",

CaB taken from the northern coast of Egypt consisting of calcium montmorillonite (85%) and kaolinite, in addition to traces of quartz, was used in this study. CaB and its sodium and lithium forms, NaB and LiB, were calcined at 600 °C for times ranging from 2 h to 20 h, while selected calcined samples were leached with H 2 SO 4 for 1 h. Upon heating, the decrease in the layer charge caused by the fixation of Ca 2+ , Na + and Li + ions in the structure, as revealed by the CEC values, led to an upward shift of the Si–O stretching band in the IR spectrum to the frequency at which the Si–O groups of pyrophyllite absorb. The CEC values showed that the layer charge of the homo-ionic montmorillonite decreased with increasing thermal treatment time and that the amounts of fixed cations were in the order: Li + &gt; Na + &gt; Ca 2+ . The dispersability of the thermally-treated CaB was higher than that of NaB and LiB, both before and after mechanical dispersion. The high dispersability of CaB arises from the inability of the large Ca 2+ cation to penetrate further into the lattice. The textural parameters of heated samples showed that the zig-zag alignment of the silicate chains varied as a function of the heat-treatment time, irrespective of the nature of the exchangeable cations. A significant increase in the amount of pores with diameters in the range 13–38 Å was detected in the case of LiB. Heating LiB further for up to 20 h led to a slight increase in the specific surface area and pore volume, but with a considerable reduction in microporosity. On the other hand, thermal treatment after leaching led to a considerable increase in the specific surface areas, pore volumes and microporosities for those samples subjected to heating for a short time, but decreased progressively with increasing heating time, with no difference being observed to the exchangeable cations. This increase in surface area was mainly due to the presence of micropores whose formation was attributed to the leaching of octahedral cations. On the other hand, following calcination for a long time, the magnitude of the textural parameters diminished due to the gradual collapse of the microporous structure.",

The annealed TiO 2 microglobules enclosed a nanopore network consisting of alternating bulges and throats. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of the TiO 2 xerogels treated at 100 °C and 500 °C possessed very narrow hysteresis loops, whereas the corresponding adsorption isotherms of the TiO 2 microglobular samples annealed at 200–400 °C showed well-defined hysteresis cycles. The UV catalytic photoreduction of Methyl Orange solutions in the presence of porous TiO 2 microspheres occurred to a significant extent regardless of the annealing temperature employed; anatase was present between 200 °C and 500 °C while the appearance of rutile started from 350 °C onwards. Electron release took place from the external area of the microglobules rather than from the surface of the internal pores of the microspheres; as a consequence, significant photocatalytic activity was displayed by all the samples. Two concomitant effects influenced the properties of a given TiO 2 sample: (i) an increase in the annealing temperature led to a higher crystallinity; and (ii) the surface area and porosity decreased with temperature due to increased sintering.",

The pressure relaxation was found to consist of two exponential decay components: a fast one and a slow one. For CH 4 , the 2D Gas–Liquid phase transition is involved in the fast decay component with a time constant of 2–3 s, while the slow decay component with a time constant of 7–40 s is minor and has been attributed to ripening or coalescence processes in the adsorbed phase. In contrast, the 2D Fluid–Solid phase transition of N 2 involves both the fast decay component with a time constant of 2–3 s and the slow decay component with a time constant of 14–16 s, both having nearly equal magnitudes. The difference in the pressure response between the two phase transitions is discussed.",

Additionally, UV spectroscopy was used to study the thermal stability of these compounds in different acid concentrations. An empirical kinetic relationship has been presumed correlating the molecular structure of the inhibitors to their inhibition efficiency. The shape of the adsorption isotherms of the compounds shows that some exhibit one S-shaped curve whilst others are characterized by two-consecutive steps. This behaviour was correlated to the proposed skeletal representation of the adsorption mode of the inhibitors on the metal surface. Electrochemical results indicated that all the compounds investigated acted as cathodic-type inhibitors. The data obtained provide a good fit to both the Temkin adsorption isotherm and the kinetic–thermodynamic model recently proposed. Estimated values of the binding constant, lateral interaction, number of active sites and the change in free energy of adsorption are presented.",

However, as far as the texture was concerned, the addition of both phosphate and sulphate salts resulted in a ca. 15% reduction in the SBET value for γ-alumina due to changes in the porosity. Modified alumina gel exhibited a higher surface area than either pure or modified γ-alumina. Thus, for the purposes of obtaining catalytically important acidified aluminas with higher surface areas, it is recommended that phosphates or sulphates be added to the parent alumina gel prior to calcination.",

Sorption uptake kinetics using different probe molecules such as water, n-hexane, cyclohexane, o-, m- and p-isomers of xylenes, n-butylamine and tributylamine were also studied. The catalytic performance of different MFI isomorphs was studied in the o-xylene isomerization reaction. The probable correlation between the sorptive and catalytic properties has been discussed as a function of framework composition, acidity, o-xylene feed rate calculated in terms of mol/min g of catalyst and reaction temperature. The trend in the para selectivity was found to be proportional to the relative sorption of xylenes. In comparison to H/Al-ZSM-5, H/Ga-ZSM-5 with an almost identical framework composition exhibited lower para-selectivity. Even though all these zeolite catalysts possess identical frameworks consisting of 10-MR openings and intersecting channels, differences in the nature and concentration of the trivalent framework cations, the crystallite size and total acidity lead to changes in their sorptive properties and catalytic performance.",

Structural changes were followed by combining diffraction and infrared (IR) spectroscopic measurements while textural variations were monitored via low-temperature nitrogen adsorption studies. In addition, the effect of soaking the original sample of ZnO in water for 5 d has been monitored together with the effect of heat treatment on the resulting products. Bands corresponding to a carbonate complex were observed in the IR spectrum of all samples subjected to thermal treatment below 275°C. This complex gave rise to new bands in the XRD patterns of such samples situated at d-distances of 2.339, 2.023 and 1.431 Å, respectively, which disappeared when the samples were subjected to heat treatment above 275°C. The intensities of such bands decreased when increasing surfactant concentrations were employed in the initial treatment of the ZnO solid. Acid OH groups on the surface of the solid appear to provide sites for the formation of the carbonate complex. Such sites are attacked either by the aqua complex [Zn(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ formed from dissolved ZnO in the presence of water alone or by the cationic surfactant when the latter is present in the system. Attack of the surfactant on the surface probably occurs through exchange with an H + ion. The cationic surfactant was also adsorbed on to basic sites present on the surface of the solid since the concentration of such sites diminished as the surfactant concentration was increased. Measurements of the specific surface areas and pore structural analyses for all the samples studied indicated the presence of micro- and meso-pores in most cases, the former being absent from the parent ZnO employed. A comparison between the application of the V l versus t plot and the α s -plot for such pore structural analyses is presented together with a discussion of the criteria necessary for the application of the α s -method.",

Thus, while the adsorption density of CTAB increased to a plateau value, that of AOT increased to a maximum before decreasing to very low values at high equilibrium concentrations of the surfactant. Analysis of the behaviour of the surfactants was made using a modified version of the Frumkin adsorption isotherm, taking into account the cross-sectional area of the adsorbed surfactant species and the lateral interaction between their long hydrocarbon chains. The values of the free energy change indicated that both CTAB and AOT underwent adsorption via a physical process, while the lateral interaction coefficient was found to be twice as large in the case of AOT as for CTAB for small or moderate coverage. This latter behaviour was attributed to the fact that while CTAB possesses only one hydrocarbon chain per molecule, AOT has two such chains.",

The potential applicability of the suggested method was tested using known experimental data for methane and the calculated values of the two-dimensional critical pressures of ethane, propane and n-butane. For small alkanes, the two-dimensional critical pressure values can be readily estimated on the basis of their two-dimensional van der Waals constants and the distribution function of molecules vertically and horizontally oriented to the adsorption surface.",

Measurements were performed in adsorbers with a bed height equal to the diameter of the activated carbon particles, using air as the carrier gas. Based on the assumption that the porous medium was quasi-homogeneous, effective diffusion coefficients were calculated from the experimental data for two adsorption stages and one desorption stage. Although the effective diffusion coefficient, as calculated from the desorption data, agreed to within an order of magnitude with the values obtained from the adsorption data, its absolute value was significantly lower. Comparison of the values for the effective diffusion coefficients measured experimentally with those calculated by means of a model showed that molecular diffusion rather than Knudsen diffusion occurred during the transport of 1, 2-dichloropropane in activated carbon particles",

Using the experimental values of the ion-exchange constants (free energies) and heats (enthalpies), reliable estimates of the entropy were obtained for the direct (Mg 2+ -Ca 2+ -Cli) and inverse ion-exchange reactions. It was shown that the sign (negative or positive) of the ion-exchange free energy in the case under study was determined essentially by the entropy constituent of the ion-exchange process. The selectivity of clinoptilolite towards Ca 2+ cations rather than to Mg 2+ cations was demonstrated. The ab initio calculations undertaken confirmed the experimental results and provided structural information concerning the localisation of ions in the crystalline environment. In particular, it was shown that the 10-membered structural clinoptilolite rings provide favourable positions for hydrated Ca 2+ cations. The energy gain of the system arising from the Ca 2+ -Mg-Cli exchange was -E = 8.0–3.4 kJ/mol depending on the localisation sites for the Ca 2+ cations; these values are in acceptable quantitative agreement with experimental data for the exchange enthalpy variation –ΔH = (7.3-8.4) kJ/(g equiv).

    "abstract": "The adsorption of gases onto heterogeneous surfaces has been reviewed, highlighting models capable of taking energetic topography effects into account. The basic ideas are contained in the fundamental Generalized Gaussian Model (GGM) developed to represent mobile adsorption onto heterogeneous surfaces at low coverage, where the energetic topography is considered through an adsorptive energy distribution with a spatial correlation function. Adsorbate molecules interact amongst them via Lennard-Jones interactions. Model predictions have been compared to Monte Carlo simulations of adsorption onto heterogeneous solids obtained by doping a pure crystalline solid with different concentrations of impurities. Energetic topography effects were shown to be important, being predicted correctly by the model at low coverage. In addition, a simplified patchwise model was also considered. The adsorption of particles with nearest-neighbour attractive and repulsive interactions was studied using Monte Carlo simulation on bivariant surfaces characterized by patches of weak and strong adsorbing sites of size “i”. Patches were considered to have either a square or a strip geometry, arranged either in a deterministic ordered structure or in a random way. Quantities have been identified which scale obeying power laws as a function of the scale length “l”. The consequences of this finding for the determination of the energetic topography of a surface from adsorption measurements were discussed.",

The porosity seemed to stem from the loss of volatile components from the inner coordination sphere of the titanium ions. After impregnation with sulphate groups, a general decrease in surface area was observed. This decrease was more drastic at higher temperatures when the sulphate ions are in a bidentate state of ligation. A high sulphate concentration led to a distinctive decrease in the total pore volume and to the loss of the microporous texture. Micropore blocking appeared to be due to the presence of the bidentate sulphate groups. The latter are responsible for the higher surface acidities displayed by the sulphated oxides.",

The axial dispersion and overall mass-transfer coefficients were evaluated by van Deemter plot. A decrease in the linear equilibrium adsorption constants with increasing temperature was observed for both enantiomers. This chiral column showed good separation performance with a high order of magnitude for the overall mass-transfer coefficient. These values increased with increasing temperature. However, it was not possible to differentiate between these values at different temperatures due to poor standard deviations. Because of the high order of magnitude of the overall mass-transfer coefficient associated with a good resolution of bupivacaine enantiomers, it was concluded that convection effects dominated chiral separation in this column.",

The LGM equations were derived for molecules of the mixture having a spherical shape and similar size. A new equation for the velocity of the thermal molecule was used. The theory takes the change in the mechanism of particle migration in different phases into account, viz. from pair collisions for the gas to the overcoming of the activation barrier by thermofluctuation for dense phases. At low mixture densities corresponding to an ideal gas phase, the LGM expression for the mutual diffusion coefficient agrees with the expression of the rigorous kinetic theory of gases. The theory allows the calculation of the kinetic coefficients for the components of binary mixtures in full gas-liquid density areas. The supramolecular structure of the sphero-cylindrical system was modelled by sections with a simple regular geometry (cylindrical and spherical) with the additional inclusion of junctions between different pore sections. The contributions of the near-wall regions caused by the molecule-wall potential to the general appearance of the phase diagrams and the effect of the pore size on the capillary condensation conditions were discussed.",

A few cases involving different relationships between the AEDs associated with the adsorbing components were discussed. Additionally, the results of the proposed theory were compared with exact numerical solutions obtained using the Integral Equation method. From both simulations and numerical calculations, it follows that, in general, the CA is not appropriate for the prediction of binary adsorption equilibria when the individual AEDs are of an entirely different shape. On the other hand, when the AEDs were microscopically correlated, i.e. when the adsorption energy of one component on every site was shifted by a constant value compared to that of the other, the phase diagrams obtained were found to be in a very good agreement with their simulated counterparts.",

The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory naproxen was used as a model drug and Amberlite XAD7HP was used as a drug carrier. Tetraethoxysilane was introduced into the loaded polymer up to the total pore filling. The transformation of tetraethoxysilane in aqueous solution at different pH produces condensed silica and ethanol which is a good solvent of naproxen. Appearance of ethanol in the sample facilitates naproxen release into an external solution at differentiated pH. The rate of release strongly depends on the pH of release solution due to differences in the hydrolysis and gelation rates of tetraethoxysilane.

    "abstract": "Thirteen carbon materials were tested as sorbent layers in bar adsorbent microextraction (BA μE) to monitor hint amounts of 10 common pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) in surface and groundwater matrices such as surface and groundwater, saltwater, spring water, and sewage. The persistence of trace amounts of three organophosphate insect repellent and cis and trans permethrin (PERM) in water quality matrices is suggested using bar adsorptive microextraction in conjunction with microliquid dissolution accompanied by significant volume injection-gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic analysis able to operate in the particular ion monitoring acquisition mode. Using BA μE to compare several sorbent coatings (five porous carbon and six polymers), it was discovered that activated carbon (AC2) was the optimum compromise among specificity and effectiveness. 17-estradiol, estrone, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, triclosan, gemfibrozil, 17-ethinylestradiol, mefenamic acid, and clofibric acid were chosen as system drugs to represent different treatment groups. Despite their lower porosity, statistics revealed that low-T-activated hydrochars, made from carbohydrates and a eutectic salt mixture at constant temperature (e.g., 180°C) and autogenerated pressures, could compete at the top level commercially carbonaceous materials in this purpose. These L-T-activated hydrochars had the best overall recovery (between 21.8 and 83.5 percent) for the simultaneous analysis of ten targeted PhCs with very different physical and chemical possessions, utilizing higher-efficiency liquid chromatography diode array identification.",

    "abstract": "Due to the insufficient accurate evaluation model of gas resources in abandoned mines, the development and utilization of abandoned mine gas resources in China are still in the preliminary exploration stage. To this end, in response to the problem of imprecise assessment of gas resource reserves in the adsorbed state of residual coal, the No. 3 coal seam in Jincheng mine was used as the research object, by analyzing the evolution of the ambient gas pressure and temperature of the residual coal in the abandoned mine, and simulating the pressure and temperature environment in which the residual coal is located, the gas adsorption experiment of the residual coal was carried out in this environment, and a gas storage model of the residual coal was constructed with the combination of the adsorption theory. The results show that pressure has a positive effect on gas adsorption by residual coal, while temperature has a negative effect on it. The adsorption potential gradually decreases with increasing pressure and increases with increasing temperature, while the adsorption space increases with increasing pressure and decreases with increasing temperature. The adsorption characteristic curves obtained by the two methods are temperature independent and polynomial in shape, and the fitted correlation coefficient of method 1 is generally higher than that of method 2. The adsorption characteristic curves of two methods are best fitted at [Formula: see text], so the value of [Formula: see text] is most appropriately taken as 2.5 when calculating the virtual saturation vapour pressure. The average relative errors between the predicted and measured values of method 1 and 2 were 2.98% and 7.13%, respectively. The prediction effect of method 1 was significantly better than that of method 2 and met the requirements of engineering applications; therefore, method 1 was used to establish a model for the adsorbed gas storage capacity of residual coal in abandoned mines.",

Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) have previously been identified for possible application in the drying of crops. Applying the gravimetric technique to measure the sorption isotherms and the effectiveness of the desiccant in crop drying was determined at temperatures 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55°C. Using R statistical software, eleven sorption isotherm models were fitted to the experimental data using the nonlinear regression functions. The coefficients of each model were obtained. The modified Freundlich, modified Henderson, and modified Oswin models best predicted the experimental data for the study temperature range. Using symbolic regression and nonlinear regression in R software, four mathematical models were obtained. R software codes were assembled for the analysis of sorption isotherm models. Compared to the existing models, the developed models were found to give a more statistically accurate association between the temperature, moisture content of SAP fabric, and relative humidity.",

At small times, the release of alcohol obeys the advective mechanism. In contrast, no deviations from Fick’s law were justified at large times. This situation holds for either individual MWCNTs or MWCNT bundles. The utilized MWCNTs are mainly closed from both ends. Therefore, the alcohol release is controlled by surface diffusion.

    "abstract": "Biosorptive treatment of industrial wastewater contaminated with heavy metals has been recognized as one of the most effective green tools, competing with traditional physical/chemical treatment processes. This study delves into the detailed investigation of the biosorbent prepared from fermentation biowaste, particularly focusing on the mechanism behind permanganate (Mn(VII)) removal. Various parameters including pH, biosorbent dosage, initial concentration, and temperature were examined. Among these factors, solution pH emerged as the most crucial in removing Mn(VII) using the biosorbent. The significant removal of Mn(VII) was attributed to both reduction and adsorption, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Depending on the experimental conditions, the removal of Mn(VII) was influenced not only by simple adsorption but also by oxidation-reduction and precipitation processes. This study not only advances our understanding of biosorptive treatment but also highlights the promising potential of fermentation biowaste-based biosorbents for effective Mn(VII) removal.",

    "abstract": "Fe ions, as one of the unavoidable metal ions, are present in flotation pulp as ferric and ferrous species, and the effect of ferric species on the flotation behavior of sulfide minerals has been widely discussed in the above literatures. However, the effect of ferrous species has rarely been noticed. In this paper, the effect of ferrous species on the flotation behavior and surface characteristics of galena was investigated by using microflotation, zeta potential measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Microflotation tests indicated that the flotation recovery of galena with potassium butyl xanthate (KBX) as collector was significantly decreased with the addition of Fe 2+ in the pulp, and the recovery was further decreased with increasing dosage of Fe 2+ . In addition, the finer the galena particles, the greater the decrease in flotation recovery. Zeta potential analysis illustrated that the isoelectric point (IEP) was shifted from 4.4 to 5.8 due to the adsorption of ferrous hydroxyl complexes on the galena surface and the zeta potential. XPS surface analysis suggested that the surface oxidation of galena was alleviated by the consumption of O 2 in the pulp, which reduced the adsorption of the collector KBX on and the oxidation of xanthates to dixanthogens. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the ferrous hydroxyl complex FeOH + could be adsorbed on the galena surface by interactions between Fe and S atoms.",

Samples of the α-series were prepared from synthetic crystalline α-ferric hydroxide by thermal decomposition at a fixed temperature between 25 °C and 350 °C. Samples of the γ-series were prepared from synthetic crystalline γ-ferric hydroxide in the same way. It has been found that water vapour sorption isotherms on α-series samples exhibit a reproducible closed hysteresis loop located at p/p0 = 0.3–0.8. Both the shape and the location of the hysteresis loop change as the decomposition temperature of the samples increases. Initially, the hysteresis loop seems somewhat parallel to the pressure axis but later it becomes perpendicular. To explain this phenomenon, a pore structure model is proposed whereby a system with slit-shaped pores changes into one with pores open at both ends.",

The uptake of oxygen was found to increase with oxidation temperature. However, levelling off of the O/Rh s stoichiometry at a value of 1.0 was found between 232 K and 300 K, indicating monolayer chemisorption of oxygen on the rhodium surface. At higher temperatures, the stoichiometry increased above unity because of sublayer and bulk oxidations. Dioxygen chemisorption at 300 K was subsequently used to estimate the dispersion of rhodium catalysts assuming O/Rh s = 1.0, the value obtained agreeing well with that evaluated from measurements of the broadening of the X-ray diffraction line for a 10 wt.% Rh/Al 2 O 3 catalyst and for the modified deuterium uptake of a 1.5 wt.% Rh/Al 2 O 3 sample. Such agreements suggest that dioxygen chemisorption provides a direct and dependable method for estimating the particle size of supported rhodium catalysts over a wide dispersion range.",

An examination of the satellite intensities associated with the Co(2p) levels yields no evidence for the formation of the higher oxide, and valence band UP spectra point to the same conclusion. However, the LEED results indicate that poorly ordered domains of the (100) plane of the Co3O4 spinel lattice are formed after extensive oxidation.

The adsorption was measured by the gas chromatographic method. The dependence of the Henry constant, K 1 , of the component 1 on the degree of coverage, θ 2 , of the adsorbent surface by the adsorbed component 2 was determined.

For the last model the exact solution was obtained by the matrix method. The numerical calculations with the suitably chosen parameters were carried out using the limiting forms of the isotherm equations for the dependence of K 1 on θ 2 .

Structure–protection correlations for seven organophosphorus compounds have been studied over the temperature range 25–50°C using potentiodynamic polarization and gasometry techniques. Ultraviolet absorption spectra show that the inhibitors are stable in 1 M and 5 M H 2 SO 4 solutions at 50°C. The activation parameters have been determined using the Arrhenius and Eyring equations and it has been shown that E a and ΔS are increased by a factor of 1.5 in the presence of the inhibitors over the situation in the acid solution, indicating a decrease in the corrosion rate. The adsorption isotherms of vinyl triphenylphosphonium bromide demonstrate the presence of two progressive steps for all temperatures examined due to the formation of multilayers of the adsorbed inhibitor on the steel surface. Additionally, the use of a 0.001 M concentration terminates the effect of temperature on the protection efficiency of vinyl triphenylphosphonium bromide as a result of the strong inhibitor film chemisorbed on the surface. The process of adsorption leads to an increase in the enthalpy of the corrosion process, i.e., it diminishes the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the metal. The values of the thermodynamic parameters, ΔG° ads. , ΔH° ads. and ΔS° ads. , have also been computed and are discussed.",

The Ca II ions were introduced into the carbonaceous materials by ionic exchange as well as by the classical impregnation method. Irrespective of the method of introduction, calcium ions are an effective catalyst for the process, decreasing the activation energy from 185 kJ/mol to 169–164 kJ/mol. Iron(III) ions are not an effective catalyst for gasification by means of water vapour. During the course of this reaction at high water vapour pressure, the Fe III ions change into a non-active form of the stable oxide and do not take part in the process.",

The excess adsorption isotherms have been measured for hydrocarbon solutions of methanol, ethanol, butanol and pentanol. Interpretation of the experimental data was performed in terms of material balance relationships between bulk and surface phase. In the case of n-heptane solutions the multilayer surface structure is formed and the surface phase contains the alcohol molecules only. For benzene and ternary (alcohol + benzene + n-heptane) solutions the mixed character of the surface phase is observed. The composition of this phase is determined by competition of liquid components for the silica surface as well as its complexing tendency. Moreover, the extent of adsorption in methanol systems is connected with miscibility of liquid components.",

Aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate were used to impregnate both γ-Al 2 O 3 and γ-Al 2 O 3 samples containing 2.1 g Co per 100 g Al 2 O 3 . The molybdenum concentration profiles were similar in both supports. Thus both exhibited a plateau region over which an equilibrium existed between the concentration of adsorbed molybdenum and that in the solution within the pores, followed by a sharp decrease in which a shoulder was observed. This behaviour may be related directly to the shape of the molybdenum adsorption isotherms on both supports. Such profiles were analyzed using a theoretical model to estimate the kinetic parameters of adsorption. These parameters are useful for predicting concentration profiles of active species in pellets of any geometry.",

The amount adsorbed at the 250°C maximum depends on the sample composition in the following decreasing adsorption order: VT80, VT50, VT10, VT20 and VT0.

    "abstract": "Isotherms corresponding to the adsorption of ammonium heptamolybdate solutions on nickel–alumina supports have been studied. Such isotherms exhibit two distinct adsorption regions, with both the support and the adsorbed species contributing to their formation. Two types of site are available for adsorption on the support and, depending on the molybdenum concentration present in solution, either monomeric (at low concentrations) or polymeric molybdenum species (at high concentrations) are formed and adsorbed. Monomer adsorption occurs at low concentrations, whereas polyanion adsorption predominates at high concentrations; the latter is reflected in an abrupt increase in molybdenum concentration adsorbed on the support. The adsorption isotherms measured at 20°C and 50°C, and TPR and XPS studies indicate that the samples prepared at 50°C contain a lower quantity of octahedral molybdenum, although dispersion of the molybdenum on the surface is higher. In addition, a direct relationship exists between the dispersion of the active component and the hydrodesulphurization activity of the sample. The presence of nickel on the support does not affect the total number of sites occupied by molybdenum. However, when the nickel content on the solid is increased, the molybdenum species occupy a higher proportion of octahedral sites. XPS studies have shown that samples with a higher nickel content possess a better dispersion of molybdenum species and exhibit a higher intrinsic activity. Enhanced molybdenum dispersion and thiophene conversion was associated with samples in which molybdenum adsorption occurred before nickel impregnation. For all the series studies, the maximum value in the intrinsic acitivity occurred at the same value of the Ni/Mo atomic ratio. This provides convincing evidence that the precursor ratio is important in this catalyst system.",

The results (K d values derived from the first slice and theoretical calculations, apparent and effective diffusion coefficients, i.e. D a and D e ) derived from the capillary method were in good agreement with data obtained under similar conditions quoted in the literature and indicated that the diffusion and sorption of Eu(III) ions in compacted bentonite was dependent on the pH value.

Hence, the presence of FA led to a reduction in the diffusion of Eu(III) ions in compacted bentonite. It may be concluded that humic substances act as a significant sink for Eu(III) ions in compacted bentonite. The value of D a derived experimentally was used to simulate the diffusion of Eu(III) ions in compacted bentonite, the results indicating that several metres of compacted bentonite would be sufficient to prevent the diffusion of Eu(III) ions from a repository to the natural environment.",

    "abstract": "Four kinds of resins were investigated for the recovery of 4,4‘-dinitrostilbene-2,2’-disulphonic acid (DNDS), which is present as a pollutant in wastewater, and their adsorption behaviour and mechanisms assessed. One of the resins, YWB-38, exhibited much better adsorption properties towards DNDS than the other two commercial acrylic ester resins XAD-7 and HP2MG. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were fitted to the experimental equilibrium data when the Langmuir model was found to provide a better fit for all resins over the temperature range studied. The investigation indicates that hydrophobic interaction provides the main mechanism in the adsorption of DNDS onto XAD-4 resin and that such interaction decreases significantly when additional methanol (10%) is added to the DNDS solutions. While the main interaction between the acrylic ester resin and adsorbate is hydrogen bonding, this can be enhanced to some extent by increasing acid concentration. Adsorption dynamics, column adsorption and desorption processes were also investigated to explore the differences in adsorption behaviour and mechanism on the polystyrene resin XAD-4 and acrylic ester resins.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between the surfaces of alkaline earth fluorides (CaF 2 , SrF 2 and BaF 2 ) and water molecules were investigated by calorimetric and spectroscopic methods. The exposed surfaces of the alkaline earth fluoride samples, with which the (100) crystalline plane is mainly associated, were found to be fully covered with strongly adsorbed water molecules, resulting in characteristic IR bands at 3684, 2561, 1947 and 1000 cm −1 , respectively. This surface was homogeneous towards further water adsorption. The strongly adsorbed water molecules were almost completely desorbed from the surface on evacuating the sample up to 473 K. The heat of immersion in water also increased with increasing pretreatment temperature; this may be attributed to surface rehydration of the alkaline earth fluorides. The state of the surface changed drastically as the pretreatment temperature was increased and stabilized towards incoming water molecules. Thus, the surface formed after evacuation at temperatures greater than 473 K was resistant to hydration even after immersion in water at room temperature. This surface was relatively heterogeneous towards water adsorption, although it behaved homogeneously towards argon adsorption. These facts indicate that strongly adsorbed water molecules appear to be somewhat specific towards the adsorption of further incoming water molecules. The adsorption properties of the (100) plane of alkaline earth fluorides towards water and argon molecules depend strongly on both the electrostatic field strength and the extent of rehydration of the alkaline earth fluoride surface.",

The adsorption of 60 Co ions onto the peat was studied as a function of contact time, ratio of solution volume (V) to solid mass (m), pH, ionic strength and the initial concentration of Co ions. It was found that the relative adsorption rate was quite rapid, that adsorption gradually decreased with increasing values of V/m and that ionic strength had a moderate effect on the process. In addition, the pH value strongly influenced the extent of adsorption. Over the high concentration range, the adsorption equilibrium could be described by the Freundlich equation, with this equation being reduced to the Henry equation, i.e. a linear adsorption isotherm, over the low concentration range.

Equilibrium isotherms were generated at three temperature values (30°C, 40°C and 55°C). As expected for exothermic physical adsorption, the adsorption of p-DHB from the single-component system and from the binary system containing ANSA decreased with increasing temperature.

The adsorption of p-DHB varied from one system to another. Both salts reduced the adsorption of p-DHB from the single and binary systems. The reduction in adsorption capacity (relative to the adsorption capacity in a salt-free system) attained only ca. 35% in the case of single-solute adsorption and ca. 20% and 33% from the binary systems containing p-DHB and phenol or ANSA, respectively.

The thinnest tubular particles, containing pores with an inner diameter of 8–10 nm, an outer diameter of ca. 15 nm and length ca. 150 nm, were formed in the Mg-rich systems. As the NaOH content in the system was increased, the wall thickness increased while the outer diameter was unchanged, i.e. the inner pore size decreased. Newly formed chrysotile decomposed at ca. 500°C, i.e. between the corresponding temperatures for Mg(OH) 2 (350°C) and natural chrysotile (600°C). The mesoporosity of the nanotubes was confirmed by the appearance of hysteresis loops in both nitrogen adsorption and water vapour adsorption measurements. Heat treatment led to a narrowing of the pore edges and brought about the sealing of the tube ends. Nitrogen and water adsorption measurements were also performed to analyze the effect of heat treatment on the porous structure and the condensed phases in the pores.",

The adsorption capacity of β-glucan was a little bit higher for quercetin-3-glucoside, and the lowest for quercetin-3-galactoside.

Given the experimental data for the amounts adsorbed versus time, one can determine g, h and τ, together with the amounts adsorbed at equilibrium by extrapolating the above equation to t → ∞. It is also possible to calculate the error trends in these parameters as a function of time by comparing the values at time t with those obtained for the longest experimental time. The error trends of the equation with time arise from the comparison of the experimental values with those predicted by the exponential equation. We have discovered that although different lengths of time are necessary for different pressures, generally a time between 1.5τ and 2τ is sufficient to obtain reliable results with errors less than 5%.

Adsorption/desorption isotherms of nitrogen on the activated carbon samples were measured using a sorptiomatic method.

Cobalt oxide, copper oxide or silver oxide (all at 10 wt% concentration) were incorporated into the S 1 and S 2 silicalites by impregnation methods. The structural and textural properties of the prepared samples were studied using a variety of techniques together with their ability to catalyze the oxidation of CO. The results obtained indicated that S 1 and S 2 existed as pure phases with structures analogous to those of ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 zeolites, respectively. Electron microscopic analysis showed that the crystalline morphology of S 1 and S 2 consisted of intergrown discs and shelf-like shapes with diameters in the range 10–15 μm and 29–33 μm, respectively.

    "abstract": "It is investigated that the Global Warming and Air Pollution (GWAP) issues are highly prioritized around the world. There is a high magnitude of contaminated hot heat (CHH) from hot fluids such as contaminated water, oils, and mixed oils; toxic oils increase the GWAP ON emission. Such GWAP can be controlled by applying the methods-techniques for optimizing the energy processes, evaluating the high energy absorption material among available materials and technological advancement in energy flow devices, optimizing design of energy systems and low heat emission strategy, etc. It is observed that nowadays, Thermal Energy Heat Exchanger Systems (TEHESs) are utilized in many industries for transferring the energy between two mineral or contaminated liquids, separated by walls. It is found that TEHESs are constructed by tube materials, might be contributed to control the GWAP if TEHESs are fabricated with composite material, and have a high absorbability index. The evaluation of the Energy Absorbability Index (EAI) of TEHES composite tube materials provides the two innovative solutions to TEHES designers such as choose the economic/cost TEHESs and initiate to green management (reducing minimizing the GWAP). On literature survey, a few research documents are found by authors, which focused on mathematical modelling of either O- (objective-) or S- (subjective-) dimensions of composite TEHES tube material evaluation models for computing EAI. It is also probed that those models are simulated by single or nondynamic material evaluation methods. Therefore, it is summarized that there are no still research document pertaining to integrated/mixed mathematical modelling of O-S- (objective-subjective-) dimensions of composite TEHES tube materials with dominance theory for computing EAI of composite TEHES tube materials. Said research gaps are respected as major research defies (help to minimize the GWAP or green management). To fulfil the said research defies, the authors developed and proposed the TEHES-O-S-composite tube material evaluation model by conducting literature and real industrial survey, consisting of seven TEHES-O and four TEHES-S tube material dimensions. The O-dimensions are framed by available O-rating/data, while S-dimension is framed S-rating. The TFNs (triangular fuzzy numbers) are used by a team of experts for assigning the appropriateness ratings vs. four TEHES-S composite tube material dimension, and priority weights are assigned vs. entire TEHES-O-S tube material dimensions. After data modelling of the TEHES-O-S-composite tube material evaluation model, defuzzification is carried out to normalize O-S-data. Later, the authors’ implemented integrated optimization technique “crisp VIKOR combined FMF technique” to evaluate the EAI of composite TEHES tube materials. As the reliability of results is an enormous concern, dominance theory is applied by conducting the comparative analysis among evaluated results and delivering the accurate and reliable results. The evaluated beast composite TEHES tube materials based on EAI linked to green management and economic concern of material. The research can be used by TEHES designers to minimize the GWAP across the universe.",

Thus, the BET surface areas and pore structures of hardened cement pastes containing different amounts of silica fume and/or various superplasticizers were determined via nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at −196°C. Three types of superplasticizers were used in this study, viz. naphthalene formaldehyde sulphonate (NFS), sodium gluconate (SG) and their mixtures (NFS + SG). The various phase compositions and microstructures were assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies. The results revealed that the specific surface area (S BET ) of the hardened cement pastes decreased as the amount of silica fume increased and also on addition of superplasticizer. The decrease in surface area was more pronounced in the presence of 30 wt% silica fume as well as with superplasticizers. Thus, the maximum decrease in the S BET value due to the addition of 4% NFS superplasticizer attained values in the range 46–68%. In addition, increasing the curing time from 3 d up to 180 d decreased the surface area of the pure and superplasticized cement pastes. The decrease in S BET for the various cement pastes could be attributed to the pozzolanic activity of the silica fume with a subsequent increase in the amount of hydration products within the pore system.",

    "abstract": "Three alumina samples were prepared from different sources including aluminium isopropoxide, aluminium chloride and aluminium nitrate, and were then used to prepare supported ZnSO 4 catalysts via the impregnation method. The alumina and ZnSO 4 -supported samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR spectroscopy and nitrogen physisorption methods. Dehydration of 1-butanol and the cracking of cumene were undertaken over the prepared samples using a pulse microcatalytic technique. For a given alumina sample, the surface area and total pore volume decreased continuously with increasing ZnSO 4 content. Loading alumina samples with ZnSO 4 improved their dehydration and cracking activities. The source of alumina played a role in determining the surface acidity and catalyst activity of alumina and alumina-supported ZnSO 4 catalysts. Impregnation of ZnSO 4 on alumina samples resulted in an increase in the concentration of Lewis sites and the creation of Brönsted acid sites on their surfaces. The catalytic activity of the investigated catalysts was found to depend strongly on both the chemical composition and the type of acid site present on the catalyst surface.",

After drying, these fibres resembled wool or down, with some being in the form of dense strands which laminated into single fibres with time. The minimal thickness of these single fibres was ca. 0.5 mm and, since a dense parallel cluster contained ca. 34 000 micellar strands, the thickness of each fibre plus associated silicate surface layer amounted to ca. 27 Å. It was suggested that the key feature of the self-assembly mechanism is the weak interaction between a surfactant molecule and a silicate leading to the continuous formation of microscopic sized fibres.",

Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH 3 was carried out at 257°C over the prepared catalysts. NO conversion as a function of time was followed and the stationary conversion versus the amount of catalyst employed was also investigated. It was found that the vanadia/titania catalysts calcined at 400°C were more active in the SCR of NO with NH 3 relative to those calcined at 600°C. This was attributed to such catalysts possessing complete monolayer coverage of vanadia on the titania substrate. It was established that V 5+ was not the active vanadia species but V 4+ and V 3+ may act as such for the SCR of NO with NH 3 .",

His aim was to shorten the time necessary for a given measurement. The method was applied to gas/solid systems in which simple adsorption processes occurred and where the number of adsorption sites was infinite. The present paper discusses the case where no adsorption is possible on an already occupied site (Langmuir isotherm) while the number of positions available for adsorption is considered limited. The advantages of using a gas pressure that increases linearly with time are evident for studies with this limitation. It is shown that such measurements can also be speeded up using Jäntti's method.",

    "abstract": "Titania samples were prepared by precipitation at pH 3.0 (to provide ‘T a ’ samples) or at pH 9.0 (to provide ‘T b ’ samples). These materials were then impregnated with NH 4 VO 3 to obtain vanadia/titania catalysts of different V 2 O 5 content. These V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 samples were subsequently calcined at 400°C or 600°C to obtain two series. The oxidation of o-xylene was undertaken at 250°C, 300°C or 350°C using a conventional flow apparatus at atmospheric pressure. The reaction products were detected and separated via a gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization detector. The chemical composition of the catalyst, the calcination temperature, the reaction mixture employed and the reaction temperature were among the variables considered. Catalysts calcined at 400°C were more active than those calcined at 600°C, thereby indicating that anatase was the proper titania phase for supporting oxidation catalysts. Titania samples precipitated at pH 3.0 were more effective as a support for vanadia than those precipitated at pH 9.0 despite the fact that they possessed lower surface areas. This demonstrated that surface area was not a determining factor in catalyst performance. The conversion of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride increased with increasing vanadia content in the catalysts employed and with increasing reaction temperature. Surface acidity was one factor amongst others contributing to the catalytic activity. It is thought that acid sites enhance the reduction of V 5+ to lower oxidation states to provide the active oxidation sites. Mechanisms for the partial oxidation of o-xylene were advanced and explained.",

    "abstract": "Electrical conductivity measurements have been used to detect extremely small changes in the oxygen content of oxide semiconductors in contact with reducing or oxidizing gases. In continuation of previous studies, the oxygen loss of chromium oxide in H 2 and SO 2 flows, as well as the oxygen gain in an oxygen atmosphere, were studied. In SO 2 , the conductivity dropped instantaneously to minimum values due to its adsorption on adsorbed oxygen sites. The treatment of Cr 2 O 3 in SO 2 led to the elimination of chemisorbed oxygen and the covering of the surface with polymeric SO 2 . In contrast, in an H 2 flow, the conductivity of Cr 2 O 3 initially exhibited an induction period during which the value was constant. At the end of the induction period, the conductivity increased rapidly to a maximum value and then dropped sharply to a minimum. The induction period may be regarded as the time necessary to create an oxygen vacancy, the activation energy for such a process being 21.1 kJ/mol. A hydrogen molecule is then adsorbed on to the oxygen vacancy possibly as a hydride ion, and leading to the initial increase in the conductivity. The hydride ion then migrated to a chemisorbed oxygen site, where it formed a surface hydroxy group and caused a consequent decrease in the electrical conductivity. The surface then dehydroxylated due to the interaction of surface hydroxy groups with gaseous hydrogen, leaving coordinatively unsaturated surface chromium ions behind. In an oxygen flow at 400°C and above, either SO 2 or H 2 treatments led to a sharp increase in conductivity due to oxygen adsorption. In contrast, at temperatures less than 350°C, oxygen adsorption was retarded after an SO 2 flow, possibly due to the strong adsorption of a polymeric film of SO 2 . Correspondingly, after H 2 treatments, oxygen was adsorbed instantaneously at temperatures as low as 200°C, presumably because of the weak sorption of H 2 on the surface chromium ions. After discontinuing the hydrogen flow, further oxygenation caused a subsequent decrease in the conductivity, possibly due to surface hydroxylation. Hydrogen trapped in the bulk of the Cr 2 O 3 could spill over the surface and cause such a hydroxylation process.",

    "abstract": "The residual lifetime of an activated carbon filter bed challenged by hydrogen cyanide, a chemisorbing gas, has been successfully predicted on one occasion using transducers embedded within the filter bed. No thermostatting nor relative humidity control of the bed or influent challenge was imposed. Four thermocouples and a fibre optic pH probe, sensitised to HCN by the addition of cobalt(II) chloride, were used to measure the progress along the filter bed of the adsorption front resulting from intermittent HCN challenges of 0.9 mg/dm 3 . Twenty randomised neural networks for cyanogen breakthrough prediction were created. These were based on a simple system, with the occurrences of maximum temperatures around two thermocouples at the front of the filter bed providing the input variables and the cyanogen breakthrough time (BT) being the response variable. Temperature maxima were thought to be due to cyanogen hydrolysis. Each network was trained with the data from four completed challenges and then interrogated with the input variables from a fifth. The mean response variable produced was 36.5 d (± 2.1 d standard deviation). This represented 94% of the actual observed time to breakthrough which occurred on challenge day 39. Averaging of network responses was required because four training examples only loosely map the possible variable space such that the potential error in any one network prediction is large. This preliminary set of experiments is most encouraging, having successfully predicted the lifetime of the bed whilst it was only half exhausted. The fact that, with no climatic control, simple sensors still permitted this achievement under realistic conditions of intermittent, long-term exposure illustrates the potential of this approach to residual lifetime monitoring. Further studies to repeat this success and extend the work to other challenge gases are now required.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption of lead(II) by a range of ‘boutique’ electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) samples which differ in a range of physical properties has been followed at pH 5, 20°C and an ionic strength of 0.5, employing a wide range of initial lead ion concentrations from 5 × 10 −5 mol/dm 3 to 5 × 10 −2 mol/dm 3 . Adsorption isotherms all fitted quite well to a simple Langmuir adsorption equation. The Langmuir parameters vary significantly for the different samples and good correlations between them and some physical properties (% water content, open circuit voltage and average crystallite size) are apparent. Further, Principal Component Regression (PCR) reveals excellent correlations between the lead(II) adsorption isotherms and some of the physical properties (water content, average crystallite size, density, total pore volume, electric conductivity, porosity, etc). A qualitative understanding of the relationship between the isotherms and the physical properties can be achieved. Adsorption of lead on partially chemically reduced EMD samples falls as the degree of reduction increases, associated with a drop in available hydrolysable surface groups with increasing degree of reduction.",

With Al(OH) 3 , compaction gave no significant changes up to 1.24 t/cm 2 , but above 1.55 t/cm 2 a considerable decrease in S BET and an increase in pore radius occurred with small changes in pore volume. This could be ascribed to the presence of free water between the structural layers in the material which normally prevents their contact and a consequent destruction of the pore structure. With Mg(OH) 2 , compaction at low pressures decreased S BET and increased the pore dimensions as a result of adhesion between neighbouring particles, leading to a blocking of that fraction of the micropore structure originally accessible to nitrogen molecules. Increasing compaction led to a marked increase in the adsorption capacity as a consequence of plastic deformation associated with the breakage of fragile primary particles and the creation of new surfaces. Compaction of the mixed hydroxide led at first to an increase in both the S BET and V p values (due to fragmentation of the particles), followed by a loss of S BET due to the presence of a mixture of particles in the system which increase the compression ability of the latter. Complete pore structure analysis showed that samples of Al(OH) 3 powder when compacted at 0.31 and 1.55 t/cm 2 were microporous. All other samples contained mainly mesopores.",

The adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K and of benzene and water vapour at 308 K was determined. The chemisorption of pyridine at 400 K was measured and the surface acidities calculated. The conversion of 2-propanol and cracking of cumene were investigated using the pulse microcatalytic technique. Coating alumina with chromia causes considerable changes in the textural and adsorption properties, impregnation of alumina with chromia leads to smaller variations while coprecipitation gives intermediate changes in textural and adsorption properties. The same was found true for the surface acidities as determined by the chemisorption of pyridine. The dehydration of 2-propanol and cracking of cumene follow first-order kinetics. The dehydration of propanol on alumina and chromia–alumina catalysts is a structure-insensitive reaction independent of the surface area but related to the surface acid density. The cracking of cumene is a structure-sensitive reaction depending on both the extent of the surface and the number of acid sites.",

    "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 , rutile) subjected to fluoride (1 M and 2 M NH 4 F) and iodide (1 M KI) treatment has been investigated by combining several approaches: structural and textural characterization as well as surface acidity and basicity. Fluorination reduces the crystallinity at both concentrations studied, the higher concentration being more effective. Iodination has the same effect. Fluoride ions replace all basic OH groups whereas iodination does not lead to full replacement due to competition with the Ti 4+ substrate. A distinct exotherm is observed at 228°C and 235°C, respectively, for the F − and I − treated samples, resulting from energetic changes leading to the activated dissociation of water and restoration of the basic OH groups. A surface compound is apparently formed on fluorination and iodination, and this decomposes endothermally at 270–275°C. In addition, impregnation with I − appears to increase the photosensitivity of the TiO 2 leading to the formation of a carbonate with atmospheric CO 2 which generates an endotherm at 285°C and whose existence has been confirmed by IR spectral analysis. Specific surface areas and pore structure analyses demonstrate differences not only upon increasing the F − concentration but also between the F − and I − treated samples, where the addition of the latter markedly reduced the surface parameters. Two groups of pore sizes could be recognized with most samples. Increasing the F − concentration increased the sintering temperature to 550°C, the value for the low F − sample being 400°C.",

Sulfidation created an increase in the adsorbing area and in the adsorption capacity. It also caused a strengthening of the adsorption bond involving the heteroatom and inhibition of bonds involving the benzene ring. The kinetics were in agreement with a model based on activated surface diffusion in the pores. The energy of activation for diffusion was related to the strength of the adsorption bond when the adsorbate was taken up from the gaseous phase. The adsorption of dibenzothiophene from the liquid phase was too slow to be measurable when the catalyst was in an oxidic state but proceeded at a measurable rate on the sulfided catalyst.",

It was shown that the high temperature region is much more sensitive to the kind of model potential function representing the potential hypersurface of the absorbed phase than it is in the low temperature region. At low temperatures [Formula: see text] the adsorption data can be calculated from using a harmonic potential function with good realistic background. For the description of a heterogeneous solid surface a potential function Φ(x,y,z) was proposed by Φ(x,y,z) = Φ(z) + Φ(x,y) or Φ(x,y,z) = Φ(z)-φ(x,y). At low temperatures and small heterogenities [Formula: see text] the adsorption data can be approximated by adding one part related to a Φ(z) potential and another one related to Φ(x,y). If an anharmonic potential function Φ(z) is used a maximum in Δ a C (T) appears caused by the anharmonicity of this function. This high temperature maximum is overlayed by the heterogenity maximum in Δ a C and gives additional peaks if Δε is not in the same order of magnitude than ε 0 .",

The oily collector is present as the dispersed phase of a dilute oil-in-water dispersion. Solid particles are added to this dispersion and agitated to give a system analagous to that found in flotation cells prior to aeration, i.e. during conditioning. The technique enables study of the overall or apparent kinetics involved in the collision and effective adsorption of collector droplets onto coal or mineral particles. Results obtained show that adsorption is very rapid and tenacious, even under turbulent conditions. The hydrocarbon collectors are selective. Adsorption onto gangue (undesirable minerals) is limited and decreasing adsorption is evident as coal fractions become increasingly dense, i.e. as their gangue (ash) content increases. Commercial kerosene (Shellsol K) behaved in a similar way to the pure alkane collector with similar boiling point (dodecane).",

    "abstract": "In irreversible chemisorption by large surface area catalysts, the partially covered surface takes up additional amounts of adsorbate only if a given threshold pressure is attained. A model is suggested in which micropore filling acts as a precursor state for other gas-solid interactions. The model is applied to the adsorption of oxygen by CuZnO catalysts with various copper contents, and containing particles and interparticle voids of various sizes.",

    "abstract": "The desorption of linear alkenes with carbon numbers in the range from C6 to C14 from the molecular sieve adsorbent zeolite 5A has been studied by thermogravimetry. Such desorption exhibits three well-defined phases as observed for linear alkanes of a similar carbon number. The appearance of these desorption phases has been explained in terms of the interaction of alkene molecules with the zeolite cavities and the dependence of such interaction on the geometrical compatibility between the alkenes and the zeolite cavity.",

    "abstract": "A simple model of open-shell adsorbates on narrow-band transition metals has been applied to the special case of NO adsorbed on Ni. Properties of both the ground state and some excited states relevant to ultraviolet photoemission (UPS) are considered in some detail. Assuming the surface bond to be dominated by the NO-2π* orbitals, it is found that: (a) the ground state configuration corresponds to a spin-paired solution, (b) no multiplet structure is predicted for UPS from inner levels (4σ, 1π, 5σ) and (c) UPS from 2π electron states should give a peak at about 2 eV below the Fermi level. These conclusions which are somewhat unexpected from the properties of the NO molecule in the gas phase (i.e. paramagnetic) agree with experimental observations.",

These dynamic conditions are very similar to those in actual sorption and catalytic processes. It was found that, under the experimental conditions described, nitrogen is desorbed from narrow-pore zeolites with a kinetic parameter comparable with the diameter of the nitrogen molecule in two separate steps that can be both qualitatively and quantitatively assigned to the amorphous and microporous fractions of the test zeolite.",

Adsorption equilibrium data for oxygen and nitrogen determined at 273.15, 293.15 and 313.15 K at pressures up to 60 atm have been compared with the values calculated from these models using regression parameters obtained from adsorption isotherms for the pure components. Of these various models, the vacancy solution theory with the Wilson equation and the ideal adsorbed solution theory provided the closest prediction to the experimental data.",
