    "abstract": "Motility is one of the most important characteristics associated with the fertilising ability of spermatozoa indicating their viability and structural integrity. Therefore, the examination of motility constitutes an integral part of semen analysis. Computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) allows an accurate and objective assessment of different sperm motion characteristics with high repeatability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the different kinematic (velocity) parameters of frozen/thawed bull semen and determine if any of them could be correlated with their fertilising capability after insemination based on the achieved pregnancy rate. Ejaculates from 10 bulls were collected and frozen. The kinematic/velocity parameters of spermatozoa were measured by CASA and compared to the pregnancy results of almost 9,000 females artificially inseminated (AI) with frozen semen of any of the 10 tested bulls. The data of the experiments are summarised mainly with a focus on the effects of individual velocities (curvilinear velocity: VCL, straight-line velocity: VSL, average path velocity: VAP) on fertility rather than on the influence of progressive motility as a whole. We conclude that VAP is the most useful semen motility characteristic which has clinical relevance in the prediction of fertility.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a state related to increased cellular damage caused by oxygen and oxygen-derived free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is a serious condition, as ROS and their metabolites attack DNA, lipids and proteins, alter enzymatic systems and cell signalling pathways, producing irreparable alterations, cell death and necrosis. While small amounts of ROS have been shown to be required for several functions of spermatozoa, their excessive levels can negatively impact the quality of spermatozoa and impair their overall fertilising capacity. These questions have recently attracted the attention of the scientific community; however, research aimed at exploring the role of oxidative stress and antioxidants associated with male fertility is still at its initial stages. This review summarises the current facts available in this field and intends to stimulate interest in basic and clinical research, especially in the development of effective methods for the diagnosis and therapy of semen damage caused by oxidative stress.",

The three cornerstones of its application are that it is simple, economical and successful. Artificial insemination offers many well-known benefits for producers. Fresh, fresh + diluted + chilled and frozen semen can be used for AI in small ruminants. To ensure its successful use, the AI technique must be selected on the basis of the type of semen planned to be used. This review paper gives a detailed overview of semen processing and its effects on semen quality, as well as of the AI techniques applied in small ruminants and their success rates.",

Semen of different ejaculates collected from breeding rams was mixed andsamples of 10 9 sperm cells per ml and Tris-egg yolk extender were completed with the following antioxidants: a-tocopherol acetate (E), glutathione peroxidase (GP), Aromex® (AR), resveratrol (R), resveratrol + vitamin E (RE), resveratrol + Aromex® (RAR), resveratrol + GP (RGP). Peroxidation was evaluated by the analysis of malondialdehyde (MDA) during incubation for 30, 60 and 120 min at 37°C as well as during a 24-h incubation at 5°C. The success of preservation was checked in a 9-day-long period by observing the acrosomal defects and the motility of spermatozoa. Concentration of MDA was 4.06 nmol/10 9 spermatozoa in samples treated with 15 µg R while the control sample contained 69.79 nmol MDA per 10 9 spermatozoa after 24-h incubation. Following 30-, 60- and 120-min storage the concentration of MDA in control and R-treated samples was 25.89, 36.91, 49.57 and 3.69, 3.74, 3.74 nmol/10 9 spermatozoa, respectively. Moreover, a significantly higher proportion of motile sperm cells was observed in the treated than in the control samples. The frequency of acrosomal defects was lower in the treated groups than in the control. These results indicate that RAR treatment can improve the effects of ram semen preservation.",

The pathological changes include those of degenerative skeletal muscle myopathy and myocarditis, hepatitis, sciatic neuritis and polioencephalomyelitis. In the study presented here, day-old and 3-week-old goslings and Muscovy ducks were infected experimentally with three different parvovirus strains (isolates of D-216/4 from the classical form of Derzsy's disease, D-190/3 from the enteric form of Derzsy's disease, and strain FM from the parvovirus disease of Muscovy ducks). All three parvovirus strains caused severe disease in both day-old and 3-week-old Muscovy ducks but in the goslings only the two strains of goose origin (D-216/4 and D-190/3) caused disease with high (90-100%) mortality when infection was performed at day old. Strain FM (of Muscovy duck origin) did not cause any clinical signs or pathological lesions in the goslings. In the day-old goslings and Muscovy ducks the principal pathological lesions were severe enteritis with necrosis of the epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the mucous membrane and the crypts of Lieberkühn, and the formation of intranuclear inclusion bodies. Other prominent lesions included hepatitis and atrophy (lymphocyte depletion) of the lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius, thymus, spleen). In goslings infected with the strain originating from the classical form of Derzsy's disease mild myocarditis was also detected. After infection at three weeks of age, growth retardation, feathering disorders, myocardial lesions (degeneration of cardiac muscle cells, lympho-histiocytic infiltration) and hepatitis were the most prominent lesions in both geese and Muscovy ducks. In addition to the lesions observed in the geese, muscle fibre degeneration, mild sciatic neuritis and polioencephalomyelitis were also observed in the Muscovy ducks infected with any of the three parvovirus strains.",

The initial concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Hg in serum were significantly increased by the treatment. Exposure to Pb significantly decreased the red blood cell (RBC) count, haemoglobin (Hgb) concentration and the haematocrit (Hct) value. The Zn-protoporphyrin concentration did not change as a result of Pb exposure. Pb and Hg loading significantly increased the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was also increased by both Hg and Cd exposure. Comparing the treated and the control rabbits, all the trace elements studied significantly reduced the activity of enzymes in the pancreatic tissues. The haematological results indicate that hyperchromic macrocytic anaemia developed in rabbits treated with Pb. The increased activities of both AST and ALT indicate pathophysiological changes of the liver parenchyma, which was verified by focal fatty infiltration seen histopathologically. Cd exposure could exert a toxic effect on the kidneys, although the slight tubulonephrosis developed would not possibly affect the renal function. The reduced activities of amylase, trypsin, protease and lipase induced by Cd, Pb and Hg suggest toxicity to the pancreas.",

    "abstract": "Clinical observations of Babesia canis infection in 63 dogs during a 1-year period are summarised, demonstrating the pathogenicity of the Babesia strain endemic in Hungary. Most patients had babesiosis in the spring and autumn, correlating with the seasonal activity of ticks. Male animals appeared in higher numbers, probably due to an overrepresentation of outdoor dogs. Uncomplicated babesiosis was diagnosed in 32 cases. The disease affected dogs of any age in this study. Symptoms were similar to those published from other parts of the world: lethargy, fever, splenomegaly, pallor, icterus, haemoglobinuria and presence of ticks were the most common observations. Thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and neutropenia were frequent haemogram changes. Imidocarb appeared to be highly effective in eliminating the Babesia infection. Thirty-one animals demonstrated babesiosis with complications. Most Rottweilers (7/9) developed complicated disease. Old age was a risk factor for multiple complications. Multiple organ manifestations had poor prognosis. Hepatopathy (44%), pancreatitis (33%), acute renal failure (ARF; 31%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC; 24%) were frequent complications, while immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA; 10%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; 6%) and cerebral babesiosis (3%) were rarely observed. There was a significant difference between the mean age of dogs having uncomplicated disease, babesiosis with a single complication and babesiosis with multiple complications (3.4, 4.8 and 8.6 years, respectively, p < 0.001). The recovery rate (78, 68 and 25%, respectively, p = 0.005) and mortality rate (3, 21 and 67%, respectively, p < 0.001) also tended to differ significantly in these groups. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and DIC are two possible pathways leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in babesiosis. DIC was found to predict MODS more sensitively in this study than SIRS: there were 6 animals developing MODS out of 11 identified with DIC, while only 5 dogs developed MODS out of 22 having SIRS.",

    "abstract": "Bracken fern ( Pteridium aquilinum ) is the fifth most distributed common weed species of the world. Its ecological distribution is very wide, and the plant can grow and spread successfully on many types of soil. The cover of P. aquilinum is — in some cases — remarkable (e.g. in the United Kingdom). Bracken fern contains different poisonous agents: some cyanogen glycosides, factors (agents) of antithiamine character (thermolabile thiaminase and thermostable other compounds) and factors of carcinogenic activity (first of all ptaquiloside). This paper summarises and reviews different toxicological problems and poisonings caused by bracken fern in ruminants (cattle, sheep) and in non-ruminant animals (horses, pigs, rats, mice, etc.). The carcinogenic properties of the norsesquiterpene-type ptaquiloside make bracken fern a potent, living hazard. Recent investigations have shown that ptaquiloside pollution of different soil layers is a distinct possibility. Ptaquiloside may leach from the soil into the drinking water base. This ecotoxicological aspect seems to be the most hazardous phenomenon in relation to P. aquilinum and ptaquiloside. The carcinogenic effect of ptaquiloside is based on its hydrolysis, which leads to the formation of a dienon intermediate. It can produce DNA adducts, which are responsible for inducing carcinoma.",

Until recently, Nosema apis had been regarded as the causative agent of the disease, which may have many negative effects on the colony and cause heavy economic losses in apicultures. Another microsporidium species, Nosema ceranae , was reported to infest the Asian honeybee ( Apis ceranae ), but both honeybee species are susceptible to both microsporidia. In the European honeybee N. ceranae was first detected in Spain in the year 2006. As it is difficult to distinguish N. ceranae and N. apis morphologically, a rapid and accurate assay has been developed to differentiate N. apis and N. ceranae based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the partial large subunit ribosomal RNA. The assay was tested on 38 Nosema -infested bee samples, which were collected from geographically distant Hungarian bee colonies representing all regions of the country. Only one sample contained N. apis , and in the other 37 samples N. ceranae was detected, which indicates the dominance of N. ceranae in Hungarian apiaries. This is the first report on the presence of N. ceranae in Hungary.",

In the present study, observations on vertebral osteomyelitis and spondylolisthesis ('kinky back syndrome') showing high incidence in 8 broiler parent flocks in different parts of Hungary are summarised. Clinical signs were seen only in roosters between 5 and 13 weeks of age. Diseased birds were alert and remained sitting on their hocks with their feet slightly raised off the ground. Incidence of the disease among male birds ranged from 8% to 30% depending on flocks. Enlargement and distortion of the body of the 6th vertebra were seen as the main pathological lesions. The cavity of the spinal canal was constricted by the distorted vertebral bodies. Resorption of bone tissue and sequestrum formation, signs of increased osteoclast activity, proliferation of fibrotic tissues, infiltration with heterophils and formation of sclerotic layers were detected in the vertebral bodies. From all 24 samples collected from the vertebral lesions, Enterococcus cecorum was isolated and identified using metabolic fingerprinting as well as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Demonstration of E. cecorum from the vertebral lesions in all examined broiler breeder roosters showing the same clinical and pathological findings in different flocks suggested the pathogenic role of this microorganism for the first time in Hungary.",

    "abstract": "The genetic relatedness of two kidney-parasitic Sphaerospora species was studied. Although S. renicola , the causative agent of swimbladder inflammation of common carp fingerlings (Cyprinus carpio) , and Sphaerospora sp. originating from goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) were indistinguishable on the basis of spore morphology, they were found to be genetically different as their 18S rDNA sequences shared only 71.9% identical nucleotides. In the phylogenetic trees, Sphaerospora sp. from goldfish grouped with Myxidium truttae (AJ582061) within the clade of the coelozoic freshwater species. Sphaerospora renicola clustered with S. molnari (AF378345) within the group of myxosporeans histozoic in gills. The topology of the six Sphaerospora species on the phylogenetic trees implied that myxospore morphology does not correlate with the genetic relationships, and the genus seems to be polyphyletic.",

Like in other studies, neutered dogs had an increased risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Although breed predilection was consistent with earlier reports, some notable differences were also observed. Apart from Dachshunds, Poodles, Cocker Spaniels and Fox Terriers, the sled dogs (Laikas, Alaskan Malamutes) also demonstrated a higher risk for pancreatitis according to our results. Concurrent diseases occurred in 56 dogs (70%), diabetes mellitus (n = 29, 36%) being the most common. Clinical signs of acute pancreatitis were similar to those observed in other studies. The study group represented a dog population with severe acute pancreatitis, having a relatively high mortality rate (40%) compared to data of the literature. Breed, age, gender, neutering and body condition had no significant association with the outcome. Hypothermia (p = 0.0413) and metabolic acidosis (p = 0.0063) correlated significantly with poor prognosis and may serve as valuable markers for severity assessment in canine acute pancreatitis.",

Close to 350 samples originating from 28 bat species (17 from Germany, 27 from Hungary) were screened for the presence of adenoviruses (AdVs) using a nested PCR that targets the DNA polymerase gene of AdVs. An additional PCR was designed and applied to amplify a fragment from the gene encoding the IVa2 protein of mastadenoviruses. All German samples originated from organs of bats found moribund or dead. The Hungarian samples were excrements collected from colonies of known bat species, throat or rectal swab samples, taken from live individuals that had been captured for faunistic surveys and migration studies, as well as internal organs of dead specimens. Overall, 51 samples (14.73%) were found positive. We detected 28 seemingly novel and six previously described bat AdVs by sequencing the PCR products. The positivity rate was the highest among the guano samples of bat colonies. In phylogeny reconstructions, the AdVs detected in bats clustered roughly, but not perfectly, according to the hosts’ families (Vespertilionidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Phyllostomidae and Pteropodidae). In a few cases, identical sequences were derived from animals of closely related species. On the other hand, some bat species proved to harbour more than one type of AdV. The high prevalence of infection and the large number of chiropteran species worldwide make us hypothesise that hundreds of different yet unknown AdV types might circulate in bats.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The study aimed to evaluate the effect of curcumin (CURC) supplementation on broiler chickens exposed to ochratoxin A (OTA), by examining biochemical parameters and the expression of glutathione redox system genes and their regulation. OTA reduced glutathione content in the liver while increasing glutathione peroxidase activity. CURC showed no significant effects. Kidney parameters remained mostly unaffected. Gene expression analysis revealed OTA-induced upregulation of KEAP1 , NRF2 , AHR , GPx4 and GSR genes in the liver. CURC supplementation led to the upregulation of GPx4 and AHR genes with OTA+CURC treatment, resulting in the downregulation of GPx4 , KEAP1 , NRF2 and AHR genes compared to OTA treatment alone. In the kidney, GPx4 was downregulated, and NRF2 and AHR were upregulated as an effect of OTA, while CURC upregulated the NRF2 gene only. OTA+CURC treatment led to the downregulation of GPx4 , GSS and AHR genes compared to the control and downregulation of NRF2 and AHR genes compared to OTA. The results suggested that CURC is partly effective against OTA-induced oxidative stress and that the effect of OTA and CURC on the antioxidant response is regulated through the KEAP1-NRF2-ARE and AHR pathways.",

Caught and anaesthetised carp were clinically examined and blood samples were taken at regular intervals during the three years. In the first year of examinations, the haemoglobin and haematocrit values of carp fry significantly increased (P < 0.01) from June to September. The intensive growth of carp in the summer period in the second year was accompanied by adequate erythropoiesis. During hibernation haematocrit and haemoglobin significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) increased (P < 0.01) in both scaly and mirror carp. MCHC increased also with the age and increasing body weight of the fish. Mirror carp had lower haematocrit and haemoglobin values than scaly carp (P < 0.01). Comparative haematological analyses between carp of normal and poor body condition showed that moderate anaemia appeared in those with poor body condition. The results indicate that there is marked seasonal and age-dependent variation in the values of haematocrit and haemoglobin. Pond water quality investigations indicated good environmental conditions. A 50% increase (P < 0.05) of glucose concentration was found from June to September in the blood plasma of carp in the third year, accompanied by an even more increased (80%; P < 0.01) concentration of total lipids. At the same time, considerable changes of cholesterol and total protein concentrations were not observed. The results suggest that the investigated haematological and biochemical variables could be successfully utilised in monitoring the metabolic balance and health status of fish in intensive culture.",

We defined the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of 56 P. multocida strains isolated from poultry (20) and swine [16 P. multocida toxin (PMT) positive and 20 PMT negative] to 16 widely applied antibiotics (apramycin, cefquinome, chloramphenicol, colistin, doxycycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, flumequine, neomycin, oxolinic acid, penicillin, trimethoprim potentiated sulphamethoxazole, sulphonamide compounds, tetracycline, tulathromycin) by the disk diffusion method. The majority of the strains was susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents tested. However, the resistance to sulphonamides, tetracyclines, first-generation quinolones and aminoglycosides was remarkable, and thus the use of these compounds for the treatment of infection caused by P. multocida is not recommended. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activity of the classical penicillin, the newer macrolide (tulathromycin), the third-generation fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin) and the fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefquinome) proved to be satisfactory against this bacterium.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the causative pathogens of bovine mastitis. Most P. aeruginosa strains possess the type III secretion system (TTSS), which may increase somatic cell counts (SCCs) in milk from mastitis-affected cows. Moreover, most of P. aeruginosa cells can form biofilms, thereby reducing antibiotic efficacy. In this study, the presence and effect of TTSS-related genotypes on increase of SCCs among 122 P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from raw milk samples from mastitis-affected cows and their antibiotic susceptibility at planktonic and biofilm status were investigated. Based on the presence of TTSS-related genes a total of 82.7% of the isolates were found to harbour exoU and/or exoS genes, including the invasive ( exoU -/ exoS +, 69.4%), cytotoxic ( exoU +/ exoS -, 8.3%) and cytotoxic/invasive strains ( exoU +/ exoS +, 5.0%). Milk containing exoS -positive isolates had higher SCCs than those containing exoS -negative isolates. The majority of isolates showed gentamicin, amikacin, meropenem and ciprofloxacin susceptibility at planktonic status. However, the susceptibility was decreased at the biofilm status. Based on minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratios, the range of change in antibiotic susceptibility varied widely depending on the antibiotics (from ≥ 3.1-fold to ≥ 475.0-fold). In conclusion, most P. aeruginosa isolates studied here had a genotype related to increase in SCCs. The efficiency of antibiotic therapy against P. aeruginosa -related bovine mastitis could be improved by analysing both the MBEC and the MIC of isolates.",

However, the milk and meat production potential of this species is not well understood and documented. A large-scale camel dairy farm was established in 2006 in the United Arab Emirates. This study summarises the most important data on milk production, raw milk quality and reproductive efficiency collected on this farm during the first three years of operation. The average daily milk production, the mean length of lactation and the mean total milk production per lactation of 174 dromedaries were 6.0 ± 0.12 kg (± SEM), 586 ± 11.0 days (± SEM) and 3314 ± 98.5 kg (± SEM), respectively. The lactation curve reached its peak during the 4th month after parturition (mean ± SEM, 8.9 ± 0.04 kg), then it declined gradually, falling to 50% of the maximum by the 16th month postpartum (mean ± SEM, 4.3 ± 0.06 kg). Milking three times a day did not increase daily milk production compared to two times milking. Mean total viable bacterial count (TVC) and mean somatic cell count (SCC, ± SEM) of bulk raw camel milk were 4,403 ± 94 CFU/cm3 and 392,602 ± 5,999 cells/cm3 for a one-year period, respectively. There was a significant difference among months (P < 0.001). Coliform count was < 10 CFU/cm3 in most cases (96.5%).

Lactation period, average daily milk production and morning vs. evening milking significantly influenced milk chemical composition. For the 470 camels in the breeding programme, end-of-season pregnancy rate and birth rate were 87.0% and 82.6%, respectively, after natural mating.

    "abstract": "To monitor the emergence of thermophilic, Mediterranean ixodid tick species and tick-borne pathogens in southern Hungary, 348 ticks were collected from shepherd dogs, red foxes and golden jackals during the summer of 2011. Golden jackals shared tick species with both the dog and the red fox in the region. Dermacentor nymphs were collected exclusively from dogs, and the sequence identification of these ticks indicated that dogs are preferred hosts of both D. reticulatus and D. marginatus nymphs, unlike previously reported. Subadults of three ixodid species were selected for reverse line blot hybridisation (RLB) analysis to screen their vector potential for 40 pathogens/groups. Results were negative for Anaplasma, Babesia and Theileria spp. Investigation of D. marginatus nymphs revealed the presence of Ehrlichia canis, Rickettsia massiliae and Borrelia afzelii for the first time in this tick species. These findings broaden the range of those tick-borne agents, which are typically transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus, but may also have Dermacentor spp. as potential or alternative vectors. Ehrlichiacanis was also newly detected in Ixodes canisuga larvae from red foxes. In absence of transovarial transmission in ticks this implies that Eurasian red foxes may play a reservoir role in the epidemiology of canine ehrlichiosis.",

From the 7th day of life, 80 male broiler chickens (Ross 308) were randomly divided into four groups of 20 birds each. The three experimental groups (E1-3) were treated with OTA for 28 days (E1: 50 μg/kg body weight [bw]/day; E2: 20 μg/kg bw/day; E3: 1 μg/kg bw/day) and the fourth group served as control. Histological examination of the intestinal mucosa and immunohistochemical staining for identification of CD4+, CD8+, TCR1 and TCR2 lymphocytes in the duodenum, jejunum and ileocaecal junction were performed, and CD4+/CD8+ and TCR1/TCR2 ratios were calculated. OTA toxicity resulted in decreased body weight gain, poorer feed conversion ratio, lower leukocyte and lymphocyte count, and altered intestinal mucosa architecture. After 14 days of exposure to OTA, immunohistochemistry showed a significant reduction of the lymphocyte population in the intestinal epithelium and the lamina propria. After 28 days of exposure, an increase in the CD4+ and CD8+ values in both the duodenum and jejunum of chickens in Groups E1 and E2 was observed, but the TCR1 and TCR2 lymphocyte counts showed a significant reduction. No significant changes were observed in Group E3. The results indicate that OTA induced a decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts and was cytotoxic to the intestinal epithelium and the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, altering the intestinal barrier and increasing susceptibility to various associated diseases.",

The high suitability of Ovaprim for ovulation induction in (cultured and wild) barbel was confirmed. The highest synchronisation of ovulation was obtained after the application of Ovopel (18 ± 3 h), but the best results of controlled reproduction (expressed as the percentage of ovulations and survival of embryos) were obtained by applying Ovaprim (83.2 ± 4.1).

Twenty-four rabbits were divided into two groups and were fed a commercial granulated diet for growing rabbits (CD) with access to water ad libitum. The first group was fed the CD, while to the CD of the second group thyme oil was added. Intestinal integrity was tested by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Thyme oil significantly increased the value of total antioxidant status (TAS) in the blood plasma and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the liver, and it decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in the duodenal tissue. Thyme oil resulted in strengthened intestinal integrity, as the essential oil supplementation significantly increased TEER values in the experiment. The faecal microbiota of rabbits was almost completely balanced in both groups, and only a slight decrease was found in the microbial population at day 42 of the trial. In both groups, the bacterial counts were generally lower in the caecum than in the faecal samples. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 0.5 g/kg DM thyme oil may improve intestinal integrity, and it may have an antioxidant effect. A tendency was also found for thyme oil to stimulate the abundance of some microbes beneficial in the rabbit gut.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rodents (Mammalia: Rodentia) are among the ubiquitous hosts of Giardia duodenalis , as they can harbour at least six assemblages of this species, including the zoonotic assemblages A and B. However, studies targeting a broad spectrum of rodents and rabbits sampled in the same region are scarce, even in Europe. During this study, 164 samples were collected from five rodent species and rabbits in five locations in Hungary, to examine the presence of G. duodenalis with traditional parasitological and molecular methods. Parasitological analysis revealed the presence of cysts in 58.3% of asymptomatic Norway rats and 27.6% of chinchillas. Three degus were also found Giardia -infected (prevalence: 16.7%) using flotation technique. With PCR targeting three genetic markers, 3.2% of the samples showed positivity, whereas a rate of 21.9% prevalence was detected with flotation. The PCR products of five samples could be DNA sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial sequences of the beta-giardin gene revealed the presence of assemblages B and G in rats. In addition, assemblage E was detected in a beaver, while assemblage B was present in a chinchilla. The results show that synanthropic rodent species have different epidemiological roles in the study region, depending on the prevalence of shedding Giardia cysts or harbouring zoonotic variants of G. duodenalis . Moreover, our findings confirm that pet rodents may pose a risk for zoonotic Giardia -transmission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this pilot study, the genetic diversity of protozoan parasites was analysed according to their different transmission routes (life cycle strategies), focusing on those species which were recently discovered or molecularly analysed for the first time in Hungary or its geographical region. The results showed that among four apicomplexan parasites ( Babesia gibsoni , Cytauxzoon europaeus , Sarcocystis morae and Hepatozoon felis ) the latter had the highest genetic diversity as reflected by its 18S rRNA gene sequences showing high (1.75%) maximum intraspecific pairwise distance, and also, based on its phylogenetic clustering. This is probably related to the long evolutionary history of H. felis , the absence of its intravascular division and other life cycle characteristics precluding direct transmission between hosts. On the other hand, among non-apicomplexan protozoa ( Trichomonas gallinae , Pentatrichomonas hominis , Tritrichomonas foetus and Acanthamoeba castellanii ), the latter proved to have the highest genetic diversity (7.73%), most likely due to its long evolutionary history, lateral gene transfer, homologous recombination and the absence of direct host-to-host dispersal. Transmission mode had a significant impact on the genetic diversity among protozoan parasites, depending on life cycle strategies and consequent frequency/chance of sexual reproduction vs binary fission. In particular, the absence of direct transmission between hosts is a common trait of H. felis and A. castellanii , contributing to their high genetic diversity.",

The sex ratio was about 50-50%. Animals were mainly housed indoors (64.1%) and only nine GPs had less space than 0.72 m 2 . The incidence of stereotypic or negative behaviours was low. Nearly all GPs (93.3%) had ad libitum access to hay. Complete extruded or pelleted feeds were most commonly fed (80.6%). Almost 60% of the participants reported that their GP is fed fresh vegetables daily which may explain why 63.7% of the respondents never fed vitamin C supplements. Ectoparasites (21.1%) were the most prevalent health problems, followed by coughing and/or sneezing (19.7%), abscesses (12.7%), and overgrown nails (11.6%). The only significant associations were that GPs over 3 years had more than two simultaneous health problems ( P &lt; 0.005). Ovarian cysts were also more frequent among these animals ( P &lt; 0.005).

It is formed during the storage of cereal grains and other plant-derived products. OTA ingested by humans and animals with the food or feed may exert deleterious effects on health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ochratoxin contamination of the most important potential sources of OTA. The OTA content of cereal samples for human consumption (36 baking wheat, 16 wheat flour and 6 maize coarse meal samples) and feed grain samples (30 feeding wheat, 32 feeding maize and 20 feeding barley samples) collected in the mid-phase or at the end of the storage period and of 50 commercial coffee samples was determined. The analyses were performed by immunoaffinity column--high-performance liquid chromatography (IAC-HPLC). The limit of detection of the method was 0.1 ng/g. Of the wheat samples intended for human consumption, 8.3% contained OTA at 0.29 ng/g on the average (OTA ranges: 0.12-0.5 ng/g; Table 2). The OTA contamination of wheat flour and maize meal samples for human consumption was similar to that of the baking wheat samples. OTA contamination was found in 26.7% of the feeding wheat, 15.6% of the feeding maize and 35% of the feeding barley samples. The average values and the ranges of OTA levels found in the above samples were 12.2 and 0.3-62.8 ng/g, 4.9 and 1.9-8.3 ng/g, and 72 and 0.14-212 ng/g, respectively (Table 3). Sixty-six percent of the coffee samples were contaminated with OA (average level: 0.57 ng/g, ranges: 0.17-1.3 ng/g; Table 4). OTA contamination of baking wheat samples was found to be relatively low, presumably as a result of the favourable weather at harvest and the optimal storage conditions. Calculations made on the basis of the obtained results show that the daily OTA intake of an adult human from edible cereals is only 6.7 ng, while the amount taken up with coffee is 4.1 ng daily. The high prevalence and high levels of OTA contamination in feed grains can be explained by the unfavourable storage conditions, and this finding suggests that OA-related health problems may arise in animals, and that foods of animal origin may be contaminated with this mycotoxin.",

Seven animals were treated with imidocarb dipropionate on average 4.5 days prior to death. Severe anaemia was present only in 2 cases. Degenerative histological changes observed mostly in the proximal convoluted tubules included vacuolar-hydropic degeneration, necrosis and detachment of renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells from the basement membrane. Necrotic debris occasionally formed acidophilic casts within the tubules. In some cases, necrosis of the whole tubule was observed. Haemoglobin casts in the tubules and haemoglobin droplets in RTE cells seldom appeared. No significant histological changes were seen in the glomeruli. Ultrastructural lesions in RTE cells included nuclear membrane hyperchromatosis, karyopyknosis, karyolysis, swelling or collapse of mitochondria with fragmentation of cristae and vacuolar-hydropic degeneration in the endoplasmic reticulum and microvilli. Nuclear oedema was also observed. Many RTE cells exhibiting necrosis collapsed. Vacuolar-hydropic degeneration and necrosis were also observed in the glomerular and interstitial capillary endothelium. The severe acute tubular necrosis described in this study is probably the result of hypoxic renal injury. Systemic hypotension leading to vasoconstriction in the kidneys might be the most important cause of renal hypoxia in B. canis infections, but anaemia may also contribute to inadequate oxygenation. Imidocarb should be applied with caution in patients with possible renal involvement until further data become available on its potential nephrotoxicity in dogs.",

The diagnosis of symptomatic epilepsy was based on confirmed pathological changes in haematology, serum biochemistry, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and morphological changes of the brain by CT/MRI or histopathological examination. Seizure aetiologies were classified as idiopathic epilepsy (IE, n = 115) and symptomatic epilepsy (SE, n = 125).

The following variables showed significant difference between the IE and SE group: age, body weight, presence of partial seizures, cluster seizures, status epilepticus, ictal vocalisation and neurological deficits. In 48% of the cases, seizures were found to be due to IE, while 16% were due to intracranial neoplasia and 10% to encephalitis. Status epilepticus, cluster seizures, partial seizures, vocalisation during seizure and impaired neurological status were more readily seen with symptomatic epilepsy.

    "abstract": "Blood samples were collected from 330 cats in Hungary in order to evaluate their seroconversion to Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The overall prevalence of toxoplasmosis was 47.6%, the prevalence being 22.4% among urban, 50% among suburban and 61.3% among rural animals. Significantly more cats had high IFAT titres (1:640 to 1:5120) in the countryside. Female cats were more frequently infected with T. gondii than males (53.3% vs. 39.3%), and seropositivity increased with the age of animals. The prevalence (0.6%) and titre (1:40) of antibodies to N. caninum was low. Sixty-two cats were also screened for seroconversion to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus. Higher titres to T. gondii were more frequently detected among FIP-positive cats, but this difference was non-significant due to the small number of cats with concurrent infection.",

    "abstract": "Adenoviruses are frequent infectious agents in different poultry species. The traditional, serological typing of new isolates by virus neutralisation tests is now in transition to be replaced by PCR and sequencing. The first PCRs, recommended for the detection of adenoviruses, had been designed to target the gene of the major capsid protein, the hexon. In birds, members of three different genera of the family Adenoviridae may occur. Accordingly, three specific hexon PCRs had to be elaborated for the detection of adenoviruses in poultry. A significantly more sensitive PCR, targeting the viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene, has been described recently. This method proved to be an efficient alternative for the general detection of adenoviruses irrespective of their genus affiliation. Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs), isolated from chicken to date, comprise twelve serotypes classified into five virus species (FAdV-A to E). The polymerase gene sequence has been determined yet only from three FAdV types representing three species. In the present work, the panel of polymerase gene sequences was completed with those of the rest of FAdVs. The newly determined sequences will facilitate the identification of new FAdV isolates as an existing species or as a putative new FAdV. Once the polymerase sequence is known, more specific PCRs for the amplification of the hexon and other genes can be designed and performed according to the preliminary species classification.",

    "abstract": "Infection of host cells with the influenza virus is mediated by specific interactions between the viral haemagglutinin (HA) and cell oligosaccharides containing sialic acid (SA) residues. Avian and human influenza viruses bind to alpha-2, 3 and alpha-2, 6 sialic acid-linked receptors, respectively. To date, there have been no detailed tissue distribution data on alpha-2, 3 and alpha-2, 6 sialic acid-linked receptors in the domestic cat, a relatively new mammalian host for influenza virus infections. In this study, the tissue distribution of human and avian type sialic acid influenza receptors was determined in various organs (respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, brain, cerebellum, spleen, kidney, heart and pancreas) of domestic cat by binding with the lectins Maackia amurensis agglutinin II (MAA II) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), respectively. The results revealed that both alpha-2, 3 and alpha-2, 6 sialic acid-linked receptors were extensively detected in the trachea, bronchus, lung, kidney, spleen, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. Endothelial cells of gastrointestinal tract organs were negative for alpha-2, 3 sialic acid-linked receptors in cats. The presence of alpha-2, 3 and alpha-2, 6 sialic acid-linked receptors in the major organs examined in the present study suggests that each major organ may be affected by influenza virus infection. Because of receptor distribution in the gastrointestinal tract, the experimental infection of cats with human influenza virus may be relatively easy while their infection with avian influenza virus may be difficult. These data can explain the involvement of multiple organs in influenza virus infection and should help investigators interpret the results obtained when cats are infected with influenza virus and estimate the risk of infection between cats and humans.",

During the period 2009-2013, a total of 145 regularly shot canids were examined for the presence of D. repens adults. In order to investigate their role as hosts and potential wild reservoirs of this zoonosis, 71 wolves (Canis lupus), 48 foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and 26 jackals (Canis aureus) were examined. Under the skin of two wolves (one from Serbia and one from Macedonia) and of a red fox from Serbia D. repens adults were found. In all three cases only one parasite was present. Further research on wild canids is needed, particularly on species widening their range (such as jackals) and those living near human settlements (foxes and jackals), which facilitates the transmission of the parasites to dogs and humans.",

The animals received a food containing extruded immunomodulators: β-1,3/1,6-D-glucan, β-hydroxy-β-methyl-butyrate (HMB) and levamisole for 42 days. Whole blood samples were analysed before and after therapy assessing changes in phagocyte activity (respiratory burst activity, RBA and potential killing activity, PKA), evaluation of proliferation response of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes and serum gamma globulin levels, lysozyme activity, ceruloplasmin levels and interleukin activity (IL-6 and IL-10). In this experiment, β-1,3/1,6-D-glucan delivered the highest level of treatment efficacy by producing the quickest therapeutic effect, lowering Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) values to below 3, improving histopathological parameters, decreasing IL-6 levels, increasing IL-10 concentrations, and producing remission periods longer than six months. HMB and levamisole were also effective in lowering CIBDAI scores, but the abatement of clinical symptoms was slower and less pronounced in comparison with β-1,3/1,6-D-glucan. The results indicate that β-1,3/1,6-D-glucan can be useful in the treatment of canine IBD.",

In this work, the properties, pathogenesis and phenotypic diversity of T. pyogenes isolates from bovine mastitis were studied. Both pyolysin (plo) and collagen-binding protein (cbp) virulence factor genes were detected by PCR in all T. pyogenes isolates (n = 50). Using the tissue culture plate method, 90% of T. pyogenes isolates were able to form biofilms. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 13 antimicrobials against T. pyogenes isolates were determined. High susceptibility was observed to rifampin (96%), ampicillin (94%), ciprofloxacin (94%), and penicillin (92%), while low susceptibility was found to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (10%) and bacitracin (2%). The intracellular assay revealed that T. pyogenes isolates had different cytopathogenic effects on cells. The high percentage (28.6%) of T. pyogenes isolates suggests that this bacterium is an important contributor to mastitis. Moreover, the high occurrence of multidrug resistance, biofilm production, intracellular survival, and the temporal dynamics of T. pyogenes interactions are key factors for a better understanding of how immunity acts on infections with these bacteria and how they evade immune surveillance, thus highlighting the need for the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine.",

Progressively motile spermatozoa were diluted and deep-frozen in tris-yolk extender by a procedure routinely used for bovine semen. The pre-freezing motility of spermatozoa from 6 stags was higher than 80%, while the sperm of 5 animals was found to be unsuitable for dilution. In the post-thawed sperm of six stags 40-50% of the spermatozoa showed progressive motility and the number of viable spermatozoa ranged from 8.6 to 26.7 x 10(6) per 0.25 ml straw. Two years later, three hinds were superovulated by the use of a progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (CIDR type G, Carter, Holt Harvey Plastic Products Group Ltd., Hamilton, New Zealand) for a period of 14 days and with follicle stimulating hormone (Folicotropin inj., Spofa, Prague). Each hind was inseminated artificially 60 h after the withdrawal of CIDR with thawed sperm injected into the uterus via the vagina. Seven days later the uteri were flushed out, as a result of which 3 early blastocysts + 1 ovum, 3 morulae + 4 ova, and 1 morula + 7 ova, respectively, were recovered from the three hinds. Deer embryos were frozen according to a glycerol-based freezing protocol. A further two years later two hinds were oestrus-synchronised with CIDR type G and 300 IU PMSG (Folligon inj., Intervet, NL), and two of the thawed embryos were transplanted into two recipient hinds 7 days after heat. One of these gave birth to a normal stag fawn in June 1996. This was the first deer born in Hungary from embryo transfer. The results obtained indicate that sperm from top stags shot in the course of hunting can prove useful for the preservation of genetic material or in the development of the farmed deer system.",

Serum, faecal and nasal swab samples were collected from a total of 96 cattle with clinical signs in 29 barns of 23 villages in Northwestern Turkey. The cattle were subdivided into 3 distinct age groups (0-30 days old, 4-12 months old and 2-7 years old). An indirect antigen-capture ELISA and an antibody-detection ELISA as well as geometric mean BCoV antibody titres were used to detect BoCV shed in the faeces and in the nasal secretions, respectively. Relationships between BCoV shedding and age group, seroconversion and clinical signs in cattle were also analysed. The rate of faecal shedding of BoCV was 37.1% (13/35) in 0-30 days old calves, 25.6% (10/39) in 4-12 months old feedlot cattle and 18.2% (4/22) in 2-7 years old cows. The overall rate of BCoV faecal shedding was 28.1% (27/96) in the cattle examined. Only one animal in the 4-12 months old age group was found to shed BoCV nasally. The analysis showed that there was a significant difference (P &lt; 0.0001) with respect to faecal shedding between the clinical signs and the age groups. BCoV antibody titre in 50% of all cattle was ≤ 100 as detected by ELISA while 27.1% of the cattle had high titres ranging between 1,600 and 25,600. The seroconversion rate was 7.3% (7/96) in animals shedding BoCV in the faeces and 42.7% (41/96) in cattle negative for faecal shedding as detected by ELISA, and 20.8% of cattle with no seroconversion shed BCoV in the faeces. There was no statistically significant association between seroconversion and nasal or faecal BCoV shedding. These findings confirm the presence of BCoV infections in Turkey. Further studies are needed to isolate BCoV strains in Turkey and to investigate their antigenic and genetic properties.",

The lungs and air sacs were the main sites affected by the disease, and were generally characterised by diffuse yellowish-white granulomas. In 7 cases with pulmonary and air-sac involvement the granulomas were scattered to the serosal linings of the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tracts, to the liver, spleen and kidneys, and in two cases also to the bursa of Fabricius, musculus (m.) longus colli and adventitia of aorta. The granulomas were often characterised by a necrotic centre surrounded by heterophils, macrophages, lymphocyte and plasma cells, and in late granulomas by multinucleated foreign-body giant cells, and again by an outer thin fibrous capsule. Numerous fungal hyphae were found within the necrotic debris of the granulomas by Gridley and PAS staining techniques. Immunohistochemistry reliably confirmed aspergillosis in all of the cases. Fungal elements in the lungs of goslings severely affected by the disease stained heavily within the centre of the granulomas, whereas few antigens reacted in the chronic cases. Fungal fragments, which were not discernible using routine fungal stains, reacted clearly in the cytoplasm of macrophages and giant cells. Thus, although fungal elements within the granulomas were histologically indicative of aspergillosis, immunohistochemistry also had to be applied to obtain a definitive diagnosis of the disease and to differentiate it from many of the filamentous fungi.",

    "abstract": "Day-old male chicks were used to test the effects of a combination of formic and propionic acids (CFP) added to wheat- and barley-based diets on the performance and gut histomorphology of broilers. The CFP, containing formic and propionic acids based on an inorganic phyllo-silicate carrier, was added to starter and grower broiler diets of standard (NRC, 1994) or lower nutrient density (LND) using different levels of wheat and barley. Body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of broiler chicks were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) improved by CFP supplementation at 21 days of age regardless of nutrient density (ND). However, at 35 days of age CFP addition significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased BWG and FCR. Proventriculus weight was also significantly affected by the dietary treatments. Ileal viscosity was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) affected by ND which was associated with wheat and barley contents, whereas feed viscosity was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) affected by CFP supplementation. Villus height was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased by the CFP supplementation. In the case of villus width, an interaction effect was observed: there was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in the group fed the standard ND diet, but only a numerical decrease in the group fed the LND diet compared to control group. No significant effect of dietary treatment on the thickness of the lamina muscularis mucosae could be detected.",

The high dietary Mo contents failed to reduce the growth performance of rabbits. Moreover, supplemental Mo given in a dose of 40 mg/kg non-significantly decreased the apparent digestibility of crude protein (CP) and crude fibre (CF) compared to the control (73.63 +/- 2.49 and 18.56 +/- 5.10 vs. 74.31 +/- 3.03 and 21.38 +/- 6.48, respectively). Molybdenum ingested with feeds was mainly excreted (57%) via the urine. The highest Mo levels were found in kidney and liver samples (3.464 +/- 0.872; 5.27 +/- 0.95 mg/kg DM [Experiment 1] and 1.878 +/- 0.283; 1.62 +/- 0.16 mg/kg DM [Experiment 2], respectively), and Mo could also be detected in limb meat (0.336 +/- 0.205 mg/kg DM). It was stated that the testes were more sensitive to Mo exposure than the female reproductive organs because the number of germ cells was reduced. Due to the high dietary Mo intake free radicals could be generated, resulting in a marked increase of creatine kinase (CK) activity.",

    "abstract": "Agrochemicals and veterinary products must undergo numerous toxicological tests before registration. The use of animals in these studies is a controversial issue. The Draize eye irritation test is one of the most criticised methods because of the injuries inflicted on the test animals. Several in vitro methods have been used to investigate the toxicity of potential eye irritants with a view to replacing in vivo eye irritation testing. One of these alternative methods is the Hen's Egg Test--Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM) test. In the present studies comparative screening was performed with a set of agrochemicals to establish parallel data on in vitro (HET-CAM) and in vivo (Draize) results. The examined materials were: Totril (ioxynil), Omite 57 E (propargit), Actellic 50 EC (pyrimiphos-methyl), Stomp 330 EC (pendimethalin), Mospilan 3 EC (acetamiprid), Alirox 80 EC (EPTC), Match 050 EC (lufenuron), Nonit (dioctyl sulphosuccinate sodium), Perenal (haloxyfop-R methyl ester), Pyrinex 48 EC (chlorpyrifos). These experiments showed good correlation between results obtained by the HET-CAM test and those of the Draize rabbit eye test in most cases. The present form of the HET-CAM test can be proposed as a pre-screening method for the determination of eye irritative potential, therefore the number of test animals can be reduced and/or experimental animals can be replaced.",

In the swine industry, the combination is administered via the drinking water, where both substances are quickly decomposed depending on several environmental factors. The degradation rate of the substances was determined in solutions of different water hardness levels (German hardness of 2, 6 and 10) and pH values (3.0, 7.0 and 10.0), and in troughs made of different materials (metal or plastic). Increasing the water hardness decreased the stability of both substances, amoxicillin being more stable at each hardness value than clavulanate. Amoxicillin trihydrate proved to be most stable at an acidic pH, while increasing the pH decreased its stability (P < 0.05). Maximum stability of potassium clavulanate was experienced at neutral pH, while its decomposition rate was significantly higher at acidic and alkaline pH values (P < 0.01). The stability of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination depends mainly on the less stable clavulanate, although the effect of metallic ions significantly increased the decomposition rate of amoxicillin, rendering it less stable in metal troughs than clavulanate (P < 0.05). Therefore, the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination should be administered to the animals in soft water, at neutral pH and in plastic troughs.",

M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed on 95 clinically healthy dogs including 45 Hungarian Vizslas, 28 Mudis and 22 Hungarian Greyhounds. Linear intracardiac measurements included interventricular septal thickness (IVS), left ventricular internal diameter (LVID), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) both in systole and diastole, as well as left atrial internal diameter (LAD), and aortic diameter (AOD) in early diastole. Fractional shortening (FS), end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes (EDV and ESV), as well as LAD:AOD ratio were calculated from the linear parameters. Mean, range and standard deviation of measurements were calculated for each breed. Body weight positively correlated in all three breeds with all left ventricular dimensions, such as IVS d , IVS s , LVID d , LVIDD s , LVPW d and LVPW s parameters. LA values showed positive correlations to body weight in all three breeds. AOD and LA demonstrated a positive correlation with body weight in Hungarian Vizslas and Mudis, whilst the LAD:AOD ratio was related to body weight only in Mudis. Gender did not correlate with any of the measured echocardiographic parameters in any breeds. In Mudis, a positive correlation was found between the LAD: AOD ratio and age, as well as between the LAD: AOD ratio and E point to septal separation (EPSS).",

The EF 55 strain (isolated and characterised by the authors earlier) was applied daily (1.10 9 CFU/0.2 ml PBS) for 7 days. Oral inoculation of the SE PT4 strain was performed on day 8 in a single dose of 5.10 8 CFU/0.2 ml PBS. The experiment lasted for 21 days. Samples were collected on day 1 of the experiment to verify the absence of Salmonella , on day 8 to check colonisation of EF 55 and immunological status in experimental birds, and on days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 14 after SE PT4 infection of chicks. Strain EF 55 sufficiently colonised the digestive tract of chicks after 7 days of application. The highest numbers of EF 55 in the faeces of chicks were observed before SE infection and persisted to day 6 post infection (p.i.) in both the EF and EF+SE groups. PCR confirmed the identity of the EF 55 strain. The counts of SE PT4 strain in faeces of the EF+SE group were significantly reduced in comparison to those in the SE group on days 2 and 14 p.i. (P &lt; 0.01). The significant reduction of salmonellae in the caecum was recorded at the end of the experiment (day 14 p.i.) in the EF+SE group in comparison to the SE group (P &lt; 0.01). At day 4 p.i., colonies of S . Enteritidis PT4 were found in the liver of chicks of the SE group in a higher concentration than in chicks of the EF+SE group (P &lt; 0.001). Salmonellae were isolated from the liver until days 8 and 6 p.i. in the SE and EF+SE groups, respectively. The mean values of actual lymphocyte subpopulations in the blood and the relative percentage of caecal intraepithelial lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4, CD8, CD44, TCR, MHC II and IgM) were not influenced at a statistically significant level by the application of the EF 55 and/or the SE PT4 strain.

In phylogeny reconstruction, the putative bream circovirus clustered together with circoviruses discovered in other cyprinid fishes recently. Three other piscine circoviral sequences appeared closest to sequences derived from different environmental samples. Surprisingly, the nucleotide sequence derived from two fish samples (a bream and a monkey goby) proved to be from porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), almost identical to a sequence detected in Sweden previously.

Live attenuated intermediate and intermediate plus vaccines were used in four flocks. Birds were vaccinated orally at the estimated vaccination time. Three broiler flocks were vaccinated subcutaneously with a turkey herpesvirus (HVT)-IBD vector vaccine at one day old. Evaluation of the efficacy of different vaccines was focused on humoral immune response, bursa/body weight (B/Bw) ratio, molecular detection of IBDV in ileocaecal tonsils and bursa of Fabricius, and production parameters. The serological results showed that although the uptake of all three vaccine strains was confirmed in the lymphoid organs, no significant antibody response to vaccination was detected in flocks vaccinated with intermediate and intermediate plus vaccines. A significant increase in antibody titres detected in flocks vaccinated with the vector vaccine indicated its ability to induce an immune response in birds with a high level of maternally derived antibodies. Observations obtained in this field trial did not confirm the expected reduction of the B/Bw ratio in flocks vaccinated with less attenuated vaccines. No significant differences were observed between birds vaccinated with the vector vaccine and those immunised with the intermediate plus vaccine. Very virulent IBDV was confirmed in the flock vaccinated with the intermediate vaccine. The infection induced reduced B/Bw and moderate mortality but did not affect the production parameters. Field infection was not detected in broilers vaccinated with the intermediate plus vaccine and the vector vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Water pollution is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of plastron, carapace and skin diseases of turtles. In this study, a total of 150 European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) of different age and both sexes, originating from natural habitats in Serbia, were examined for morphological changes of the skin, plastron, carapace and skeletal system. The turtles were taken out from their natural habitats in Lake Ludas, Lake Palic and Lake Tresetiste. After artificial hibernation, they were subjected to detailed examination, sampled and treated, and finally returned into their natural habitat. Biopsies from the skin and shell were subjected to histopathological examination and microbiological analysis. X-ray scanning was also performed to detect changes in the skeletal system. Macroscopic changes of the skin, most frequently degenerative, inflammatory or neoplastic diseases, were diagnosed in 49.33% of the turtles examined. Dermatitis of different origin and form was the most prominent histopathological finding (28.00%). In the plastron, inflammatory and degenerative processes were frequently found. Osteopathy and mechanical injuries were the dominant findings. Macroscopic changes of the plastron, carapace and skeletal system were diagnosed in 67.33% of the turtles examined. Using X-ray scanning, generalised osteopathy, anomalies and malformations of different aetiology were also diagnosed on the tail and legs. Microbiological examinations showed the presence of a variety of bacterial and fungal agents, either primary pathogens or potential polluters, which invaded the skin and shell, or were present in cloacal swab samples. Bacterial infection was diagnosed in 76.66% of the turtles, first of all in those with skin and shell necrosis. Mycoses were diagnosed in 33.33% of the animals.",

The main goal of this study was to monitor the daily rumination activity (RA) and its connection with actual liveweight (LW), milk yield (MY) and with two diseases (subclinical hyperketonaemia — SHK, uterine disease — UD) in 96 cows on the basis of a total of 1638 observations in Israel. The studied sample gave a highly significant response, showing that the selected diseases had a diminishing impact on RA and LW and no influence on MY. It can be concluded that the change of RA as determined by electronic monitoring, complemented by the change of LW, is a useful general indicator of health status and subclinical disease before the appearance of clinical signs.",

Ten healthy calves, aged 5 days, were used as control. Cardiac troponin I and T were analysed using ELISA and ELFA, respectively. Serum CK-MB and LDH were also analysed in an automatic analyser. The calves had low venous pH, pO2, O2 saturation and high pCO2 values consistent with dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, and inadequate oxygen delivery. Mean serum troponin I, troponin T, CK-MB and LDH levels were increased in the premature calves compared to the control group.

The study material consisted of 13 neonatal calves with septicaemia (septicaemic calves, SC) and ten healthy neonatal calves (control calves, CC). Blood samples were collected for biochemical, haematological and microbiological analyses. In addition, faecal samples were collected for microbiological and virological analyses. Three of neonatal calves with septicaemia were positive for E. coli (E. coli O157 serotype) by microbiological examination, but all neonatal calves with septicaemia were negative for rota- and coronaviruses. By haematological examination, there were no significant differences between SC and CC for white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil (NEU) counts (P > 0.05). NEU counts were higher on day 0 than on day 15 in SC (P < 0.05). Red blood cell (RBC) counts and packed cell volume (PCV) values were higher on day 0 in the SC than in the CC (P < 0.05). By biochemical analyses, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), haptoglobin (Hp), and fibrinogen (Fb) concentrations were higher on day 0 in the SC than in the CC (P < 0.05). After treatment (on day 15), the serum IL-6, PCT, Hp, and Fb concentrations were significantly decreased in the SC compared to the CC (P < 0.05). The serum iron (Fe) concentrations were lower on day 0 in the SC than in the CC (P < 0.05), and were higher on day 15 than on day 0 in the SC (P < 0.05).

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of sericin supplementation in a maturation medium on the meiotic competence and fertilisability of sheep oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in TCM199 supplemented with sericin at various concentrations of 0 (control), 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5%, either with or without bovine serum albumin (BSA). When the COCs were matured without BSA, the supplementation of 0.1% sericin significantly increased the rates of maturation to metaphase II and the total fertilisation of oocytes compared with the other concentrations of sericin. When the COCs were matured with BSA, the beneficial effects of 0.1% sericin supplementation on the maturation and fertilisation of oocytes were not observed. Our findings indicate that supplementation with 0.1% sericin during maturation culture may improve the nuclear maturation and fertilisability of sheep oocytes. Moreover, it may be possible to replace BSA with sericin in chemically defined media without the risk of disease transmission.",

Seventy-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 9 experimental groups. The control diet (AIN-93G formula) and diets supplemented with 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.8% HA or FA were fed for 26 days. Fe and Mn concentrations of the large intestinal content, liver, kidney, femur and hair were determined. No significant differences were observed in the production parameters. The effects of FA and HA on iron homeostasis were significantly different. FA proved to be a good iron source, and slightly increased the iron content of liver and kidney, but - up to a dietary iron level of 52.7 mg/kg - it did not influence the efficiency of iron absorption. Above a dietary iron level of 52.7 mg/kg down-regulation of Fe absorption can be assumed. HA significantly stimulated the iron uptake and there was no down-regulation of Fe absorption up to 0.8% dietary HA supplementation level (61.5 mg Fe/kg diet). In the HA groups the iron content of the liver and kidney decreased significantly, suggesting that in spite of the better Fe absorption, the HA-Fe complex does not provide iron to the investigated organs. Neither FA nor HA supplementation influenced the Fe content of the femur and hair and slightly decreased the Mn concentration in the large intestinal content. This effect was significant (with a 22.7% Mn concentration decrease) only at the HA supplementation rate of 0.8%. Neither FA nor HA influenced significantly the Mn concentrations of the liver, kidney and femur. The Mn concentration of the hair in rats receiving FA- or HA-supplemented diets was higher than in the control rats; however, this result needs further confirmation.",

Six mares performing a standardised warm-up and jumping course were monitored using a HR/GPS device. Venous blood lactate (BL), assessed before and after exercise, showed a significant increase (P = 0.0004) following the physical effort. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant changes in HR throughout the experimental period. The analysis of HR data recorded during the warm-up jumping stage showed significantly higher HR (P = 0.001) in the recovery period compared to the related jumping phase. Shifting the fence height from 100 cm to 125 cm during the warm-up jumps was also found to cause a significant increase (P = 0.016) in HR. According to these preliminary results, the simultaneous logging of heart rate and speed has the potential to be a reliable and powerful technique for field testing that can help in the monitoring of the horse's response to jumping effort during training and competition.",

A total of 120 one-day-old Cobb broilers were divided into two groups and fed a Metdeficient diet and a control diet, respectively, for six weeks. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), the ability to inhibit hydroxyl radicals, and glutathione (GSH) content were significantly decreased in the Met-deficient group compared to the control. In contrast, malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly higher in the Met-deficient group. As measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2’-deoxyuridine 5’- triphosphate dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) and flow cytometry (FCM), the percentages of apoptotic cells were significantly increased. In conclusion, dietary Met deficiency can cause oxidative stress and then induce increased apoptosis in the intestine. Oxidative stress contributes to intestinal apoptosis. This results in the impairment of local intestinal mucosal immunity due to oxidative stress and apoptosis in the small intestine. The results of this study provide new experimental evidence for understanding the negative effects of Met deficiency on mucosal immunity or the functions of other immune tissues.",

In comparison with the control (without EGT), EGT supplementation at 100 µM significantly increased the percentage of total motility of spermatozoa that were preserved as a liquid both for one and three weeks ( P &lt; 0.05). EGT supplementation did not affect the quality of preserved spermatozoa, irrespective of the EGT concentration.

Both operators followed an identical protocol and utilized the same equipment for PRP preparation from the pooled blood samples. The resulting PRP underwent characterization, classification and coding based on minimum reporting standards. The consistency and internal reliability of different parameters were also assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and Cronbach's alpha values. Variables such as white blood cell (WBC) concentration, relative WBC composition and mean platelet volume (MPV) showed poor reliability, and WBC concentration and MPV also had unacceptable internal consistency. Significant differences were observed in several qualitative and quantitative parameters of the prepared PRP, highlighting the influence of the operator even when the same protocol and equipment were used. Our study has direct implications to regenerative medicine, reinforcing the urgency to set minimum requirements for reporting PRP in research studies.",

This result suggests that the plasma antioxidant defence system is interrelated with that of the red blood cells and that the erythrocytes can be a good model for studies of oxidative stress. The simple haemolysis test reflecting the free radical defence can be useful for evaluating the antioxidant properties of various compounds.",

Blood samples were taken on Days 1-3 after calving for assaying some metabolites and hormones related to the negative energy balance (NEB). If mastitis was diagnosed later, aseptic milk samples were taken to identify the pathogens. Considering pathogen types [contagious pathogens: Staphylococcus ( S. ) aureus , Gram-positive (GP) environmental pathogens , and Gram-negative (GN) environmental pathogens + mastitis with no detectable pathogens (NDP)] separately, stepwise logistic regression was used to analyse the relation between the potential prognostic value of hormones and metabolites and mastitis outbreak. Only the elevated (= 1.00 mmol/l) serum ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels predisposed the cows to mastitis in the subsequent 4 weeks. This prognostic value of BHB was significant only in GN + NDP mastitis and in cases caused by GP environmental pathogens, but not in S. aureus mastitis (odds ratio: 5.333, 3.600 and 1.333, respectively).",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring antimutagenic factors, especially those of plant origin, have recently become a subject of intensive research. Antimutagenic properties of terpenoid fractions of sage ( Salvia officinalis ) were tested in mammalian system in vivo through examining the ability of sage to decrease the frequency of aberrant cells induced by a potent mutagen. First, groups of mice were treated with three concentrations of sage alone and it was established that the frequency of aberrant cells after treatment with a concentration of 25 µL/kg was not significantly different from the negative control (olive oil), while that found after treatment with the 50 µL/kg concentration differed significantly (X 2 (1) = 4.05, p &lt; 0.05). Sage used at a concentration of 100 µL/kg was cytotoxic. Mitomycin C (MMC), known as a potent mutagen, was used for induction of chromosome aberrations. Post-treatment with sage suppressed the effects of MMC significantly. Both concentrations (25 µL/kg and 50 µL/kg) produced a significant decrease in the frequency of aberrations relative to MMC (X 2 (1) = 5.42, p &lt; 0.02, X 2 (1) = 14.93, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The percent of aberrations decreased with increasing concentrations of sage. Only nontoxic concentrations of sage without mutagenic effects can be recommended for use as inhibitors of mutagenesis or carcinogenesis.",

For this purpose, activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and glutathione reductase (GSSG-Rx) were investigated. Enzyme activities were measured at 0 (control), 1, 3 and 5 h after alpha-tocopherol injection. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) as a lipid peroxidation marker were determined in the erythrocytes. The results showed that alpha-tocopherol significantly activated the CAT, POD and GSSG-Rx enzymes as compared with the enzyme activities found in the controls (p < 0.05). However, MDA levels were significantly decreased by alpha-tocopherol treatment (p < 0.05). The results suggest that alpha-tocopherol may have a pro-oxidant tendency at a high dose and cause mild oxidative stress which could modulate signal transduction cascades, redirect gene expression, and influence many cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and reproduction. For this reason, alpha-tocopherol should be used carefully in all applications in relation to fish.",

Of all examined dogs, 75.5% (114/151) were found to harbour at least one parasite species. Of these, mixed infections with up to four species per dog occurred in 44.7% (51/114). Infections with all detected species were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in military working (100%) and stray dogs (93.3%) versus household pets (50.8%). Among all parasites, agents with zoonotic potential including Giardia , Ancylostomatidae and Toxocara were detected in 58.3% (88/151) of all examined dogs with a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) among the subgroups (100%, 62.7% and 46.2% for military working dogs, stray dogs and household pets, respectively). The high prevalence of zoonotic parasites registered in the dog population from a highly urban area in south-eastern Europe indicates a potential risk to human health. Thus, veterinarians should play an important role in helping to prevent or minimise zoonotic transmission.",

Relative heart and lung weights, volumes of the heart, lung and thoracic cavity, incidence of right ventricular hypertrophy and ascites, and related physiological parameters were followed in the day-old chickens hatched from the above eggs. Lung and heart weights as a percentage of body weight, lung and heart volumes relative to the volume of the thoracic cavity after removing the heart and lungs were higher in chickens hatched at high altitude. Additionally, embryonic triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels relative to cardiopulmonary parameters were higher in day-old chickens that hatched at high altitude as compared with chickens hatched at low altitude. This was associated with a lower incidence of right ventricular hypertrophy and ascites in chickens hatched at high altitude. Our data indicate that chronic hypoxia interacting with the endogenous functions of embryos during embryonic development at high altitude, as adaptation mechanisms, changed the developmental trajectories of cardiopulmonary parameters in postnatal chickens. This important development facilitates an increase in the gas exchange area in broiler chickens, thus lowering their susceptibility to pulmonary hypertension and ascites.",

To date, there have not been any studies examining the dynamics of thrombin-antithrombin complex formation in cases of canine babesiosis. Coagulation parameters evaluated before (day 0) and on days 1, 2, and 3 after treatment with imidocarb (6 mg/kg inj. s.c.) included the determination of platelet counts, the formation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and antithrombin III (AT III) activity. TAT complexes were significantly elevated in animals with babesiosis on days 0 and 2 (mean 49.7 and 87.7 microg/L vs. control, 7.2 microg/L). AT III activity was significantly decreased at all time-points examined. There were no differences in PT. On days 2 and 3 the APTT was significantly shortened in the infected dogs when compared to control animals (means of 21.3 and 19.2 s vs. control, 30.0 s). Our analysis demonstrated that infected dogs had significant thrombocytopenia during the course of the study (mean day 0 - 29 x 10(9) /L, day 1 - 48 x 10(9) /L, day 2 - 47 x 10(9) /L and day 3 - 87 x 10(9) /L, vs. control -259 x 10(9) /L).

On day 4 of incubation, 50 μl of saline solution, containing Cd ions at a concentration from 0 (control group) to 24 μg, was injected in ovo into the egg albumen. The results indicate that the administration of cadmium at doses exceeding 1 μg/egg caused a gradual decrease in hatchability, with an LD50 of 3.9 μg/egg. The greatest differences between the groups in the enzymatic activities studied were found for N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), β-D-mannosidase (β-MAN) and arylsulphatase (ARYL). Compared to the control group, in the blood serum of chicks from the groups receiving 3, 6 and 12 μg Cd/egg the NAG activity increased by 79, 108 and 54% and β-MAN activity by 33, 119 and 108%, respectively. Exposure to cadmium at a dose of 1 to 6 μg per egg caused an about 60% increase in ARYL activity while a dose of 12 μg decreased the activity by about 35% below the level observed in the control group. These findings show that cadmium has a similar toxicity mechanism in mammals and birds, which opens the possibility of using NAG activity as a biomarker of the cytotoxic effect of cadmium in birds.",

    "abstract": "The TGFB superfamily genes are involved in several important cell functions, including proliferation and differentiation, and the role of the expression of these genes in growth and development of theca and granulosa cells is well recognised. However, the dependence between the stage of oocyte maturation or follicular size and the expression of these genes in pigs is still not entirely known. This study was aimed at investigating the expression pattern of GDF9, TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 in porcine oocytes before and after in vitro maturation (IVM) as well as in oocytes collected from follicles of different sizes. RQ-PCR was performed to analyse the expression of GDF9, TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 in oocytes before and after IVM (oocytes cultured for 44 h in TCM-199), isolated from large (> 5 mm), medium (3-5 mm) and small (< 3 mm) follicles collected from ovaries of 28 puberal crossbred Landrace gilts after slaughter. We found an increased expression of both TGFB1 and TGFB2 in oocytes before IVM collected from large as compared to medium and small follicles (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). In these groups of oocytes we did not observe differences in GDF9 and TGFB3 mRNA levels. However, after IVM, GDF9 protein distribution in oocytes was significantly higher in large and medium follicles as compared to small ones (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, an increased TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 proteins pattern was observed in oocytes of large compared to small follicles. The highest GDF9 and TGFB1 mRNA levels were found in oocytes after IVM compared to those before IVM. Based on our study we can suppose that the distribution pattern of TGFB superfamily genes is associated with the stage of maturation of porcine oocytes and the follicle size. Furthermore, GDF9 and TGFB1 may serve as molecular markers of the develop-mental potential of porcine oocytes. The confocal microscopic observation revealed that TGFB1 and TGFB3 were translocated between the zona and the cytoplasm of oocytes, depending on the stage of maturation and follicle size.",

    "abstract": "Rumen-protected choline (RPC) was evaluated for effects on the lipid and glycogen content of the liver and metabolic variables in the blood plasma of dairy cows. Thirty-two Holstein cows were allocated into two groups (RPC group with RPC supplementation and control group without RPC supplementation) 28 days before the expected calving. Cows were fed the experimental diet from 21 days before calving until day 60 of lactation. The diet of the RPC group was supplemented with 100 g/day of RPC from 21 days prepartum until calving and 200 g/day of RPC for 60 days postpartum, providing 25 and 50 g of choline, respectively. Liver samples were taken by percutaneous needle biopsy, then analysed for total lipid (TLl), triglyceride (TGl) and glycogen (GLYl) contents on days -21, +7, +35 and +60 relative to calving. Blood was collected on the same sampling days and 21 days after calving. Glucose, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), triglyceride (TGp), total cholesterol (TCh), urea, ammonia and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined from blood samples. The TLl and TGl contents were 25.0 ± 4.3 g and 25.3 ± 3.8 g per kg wet weight (mean ± SEM), respectively, lower in the RPC group than in the control animals. No significant differences were observed in the GLYl concentrations between the two groups. However, a lower TGl: GLYl ratio was shown in the liver of cows fed the RPC diet as compared to the controls. RPC supplementation decreased BHBA while increasing TGp concentrations were shown in the blood of cows fed the RPC diet, possibly as a consequence of improved lipoprotein synthesis in, and triglyceride excretion from, the liver, together with a reduced rate of ketogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The vertical transmission of Mycoplasma ( M. ) wenyonii was investigated in beef cattle raised on a farm in Japan by analysing the ribonuclease P RNA ( rnpB ) gene sequence using PCR. Peripheral blood samples from 17 dams infected with M. wenyonii and from their neonatal calves were collected and colostrum samples were taken from cows immediately after parturition, and subsequently the blood samples of calves were monitored continuously for three months. At birth on day 0, although no rnpB gene was detected in the colostrum of any of the dams, four (23.5%) of the 17 calves born were positive. At three months after delivery, the number of positive calves decreased to three. Although horizontal transmission by blood-feeding arthropod vectors has been basically accepted as the most common route of haemoplasma infection, these findings suggest that vertical transmission is, at least in part, another most likely route of M. wenyonii infection in cattle.",

    "abstract": "Prion protein is encoded by the prion protein gene ( PRNP ). Polymorphisms of several members of the prion gene family have shown association with prion diseases in several species. Recent studies on a novel member of the prion gene family in rams have shown that prion-related protein gene ( PRNT ) has a linkage with codon 26 of prion-like protein ( PRND ). In a previous study, codon 26 polymorphism of PRND has shown connection with PRNP haplotype which is strongly associated with scrapie vulnerability. In addition, the genotype of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 26 of PRND is related to fertilisation capacity. These findings necessitate studies on the SNP of PRNT gene which is connected with PRND . In goat, several polymorphism studies have been performed for PRNP , PRND , and shadow of prion protein gene ( SPRN ). However, polymorphism on PRNT has not been reported. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the genotype and allelic distribution of SNPs of PRNT in 238 Korean native goats and compare PRNT DNA sequences between Korean native goats and several ruminant species. A total of five SNPs, including PRNT c.-114G &gt; T, PRNT c.-58A &gt; G in the upstream of PRNT gene, PRNT c.71C &gt; T (p.Ala24Val) and PRNT c.102G &gt; A in the open reading frame (ORF) and c.321C &gt; T in the downstream of PRNT gene, were found in this study. All five SNPs of caprine PRNT gene in Korean native goat are in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a D’ value of 1.0. Interestingly, comparative sequence analysis of the PRNT gene revealed five mismatches between DNA sequences of Korean native goats and those of goats deposited in the GenBank. Korean native black goats also showed 5 mismatches in PRNT ORF with cattle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genetic research of the PRNT gene in goat.",

Five ejaculates for each bull were used in the study. Each ejaculate, split into three equal aliquots and diluted at 37 °C with base extenders containing 2 mM arginine, 25 mM trehalose and no antioxidant (control) was cooled to 5 °C and then frozen. Frozen straws were thawed in a water bath for evaluation. Supplementation of the semen extender with arginine decreased the percentages of post-thawed subjective motility (29 ± 8.21%), CASA motility (12.2 ± 5.69%) and progressive motility (3.52 ± 2.13%), compared with the controls (43 ± 2.73%, 55.4 ± 6.78% and 33.48 ± 4.14%, respectively, P < 0.05). Supplementation of the semen extender with trehalose produced a higher mitochondrial activity and sperm viability (36.3 ± 3.99% and 44.1 ± 2.18%) compared with the control (13 ± 8.15 and 31.7 ± 3.94%, respectively, P < 0.05). It was established that trehalose (95.1%) and arginine (92.8%) protect DNA integrity compared to the control (90.4%) (P < 0.05). Trehalose supplementation in semen extenders provided great benefit in terms of viability, mitochondrial activity, and intact sperm DNA on frozen-thawed bull sperm.",

Higher mRNA expression of adiponectin receptor 1 was detected in porcine granulosa cells than in corpora lutea and theca cells (P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, higher gene expression of adiponectin receptor 2 occurred in newly developed and mature corpora lutea (P &lt; 0.01). The adiponectin receptor 1 protein content was the highest in corpora lutea isolated on days 2 to 3 of the cycle and was the lowest in theca interna cells (P &lt; 0.01). The profile of adiponectin receptor 2 protein was similar to that of adiponectin receptor 1. Adiponectin plasma concentrations were significantly higher throughout the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, the presence of adiponectin receptor 1 and adiponectin receptor 2 mRNAs and proteins in the porcine ovary suggests that adiponectin may directly affect ovarian functions through its own specific receptors. The expression of both receptors and adiponectin plasma concentration were dependent on hormonal status related to the stage of the cycle.",

Functional outcomes for all analysed characteristics improved significantly at the end of this evaluation compared with the baseline. In addition, for 5 of these 10 patients, an extended follow-up study was performed from 1 to 4 years after the initial evaluation period. We detected long-lasting positive effects on two out of five analysed characteristics. The results demonstrate that the use of autologous AT-MSCs is a successful approach to canine OA therapy.",

    "abstract": "The blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) located in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (CP) forms the interface between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and pathogen components circulating in the blood. The CP is also implicated in the passage of peripheral immune signals and circulation of immune cells into the central nervous system. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are patternrecognition receptors that play a crucial role in the recognition of pathogens and triggering of the innate immune response. In sheep, ten members of the TLR family have been identified and cloned. We used real-time PCR analyses to examine the profiles of TLR mRNA expression in the CP of cerebral ventricles in healthy adult ewes. The transcripts for all ten TLRs except TLR8 were present; however, we observed a high variation in the degree of expression of the TLR5 and TLR1 genes (coefficient of variation: 61% and 46%, respectively) as well as a moderate variation in the expression of the TLR4 (34%), TLR2 (27%) and TLR6 (26%) genes. The TLR9, TLR7, TLR3 and TLR10 genes were the four receptors with relatively invariable expression levels (coefficient of variation: 7%, 8%, 16% and 17%, respectively) across the six adult ewes. The concentration of cortisol in blood collected prior to sacrificing the ewes ranged from 0.18 to 78.9 ng/ml. There was no correlation between cortisol concentration and mRNA expression of any of the examined TLRs. These data suggest that the CP has the potential to sense the presence of many bacterial and viral components and mediate responses for the elimination of invading microorganisms, thereby protecting the brain.",

Caribou characterise the north of the boreal forest and the tundra, whereas moose dominate in coniferous and mixed forests growing further south. White-tailed deer are typical of the deciduous forests of the east while mule deer replace them in the mountainous terrain of the west. Wapiti possess the smallest range, mostly adjacent to the prairies to the west. The two large obligate carnivores preying on deer show a reduced distribution: wolves are almost restricted to Canada, and cougar to the mule deer range. We determined the current status of each species with the help of a questionnaire mailed to all jurisdictions harbouring deer. Most reports of threatened populations concerned caribou whereas many jurisdictions declared overabundance of white-tailed deer and wapiti. Hunting was allowed for all species when they abounded in a jurisdiction. Hunters harvested annually 7.0 × 106deer on the continent, 87% being white-tailed deer. The two species that caused most conflicts with humans had the highest harvest rate: 16-17%. In terms of biomass, white-tailed deer and wapiti yielded the highest harvests, with 55 and 39 kg × km-2of range, respectively. The average standing biomass of deer in winter ranged between 28 kg × km-2in Nevada to 901 kg × km-2in Indiana. The lowest standing biomasses occurred in the boreal forest (predators), in the prairies (agriculture) and in the south-west (aridity), and the highest ones in the south-east, where only white-tailed deer is present. The current abundance of deer in North America parallels, in general, the primary production of the landscape (r2= 0.38; P &lt; 0.0001), but predators and human activity modify this pattern.",

Penicillin resistance, mediated by penicillinase production, was the most frequent among Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from humans (96%), from bovine mastitis (55%), from foods (45%) and from dogs. In staphylococci isolated from animals low resistance percentages to aminoglycosides (0-2%), fluoroquinolones (0.5-3%) and sulphonamides (0.5-4%) were found but in strains isolated humans these figures were higher (1-14%, 5-18% and 3-31%, respectively). The most frequent antibiotic resistance profiles of strains isolated from animals and food were penicillin/tetracycline, penicillin/lincomycin and penicillin/lincomycin/tetracycline. Penicillin/tetracycline resistance was exhibited by strains from mastitis (3), samples from the meat industry (31), poultry flocks (1), poultry industry (1), noodle (1) and horses (2). Penicillin/lincomycin resistance was found in 10 Staphylococcus strains from mastitis, 1 from the dairy industry, 1 from the meat industry and 6 from dogs. Isolates from mastitis (2), from the dairy industry (2), from pigs (1), from the meat industry (1) and from poultry (1) harboured penicillin/lincomycin/tetracycline resistance pattern. Multiresistant strains were usually isolated only from one and sometimes from two animal species; therefore, the spread of defined resistant strains (clones) among different animal species could not be demonstrated.

    "abstract": "The pharmacokinetics and the influence of food on the kinetic profile and bioavailability of doxycycline was studied after a single intravenous (i.v.) and oral dose of 10.0 mg/kg body weight in 7-week-old broiler chickens. Following i.v. administration the drug was rapidly distributed in the body with a distribution half-life of 0.21 +/- 0.01 h. The elimination half-life of 6.78 +/- 0.06 h was relatively long and resulted from both a low total body clearance of 0.139 +/- 0.007 L/h.kg and a large volume of distribution of 1.36 +/- 0.06 L/kg. After oral administration to fasted chickens, the absorption of doxycycline was quite fast and substantial as shown by the absorption half-life of 0.39 +/- 0.03 h, the maximal plasma concentration of 4.47 +/- 0.16 micrograms/mL and the time to reach the Cmax of 1.73 +/- 0.06 h. The distribution and the final elimination of the drug were slower than after i.v. administration. The absolute bioavailability was 73.4 +/- 2.5%. The presence of food in the intestinal tract reduced and extended the absorption (t1/2a = 1.23 +/- 0.21 h; Cmax = 3.07 +/- 0.23 micrograms/mL; tmax = 3.34 +/- 0.21 h). The absolute bioavailability was reduced to 61.1% +/- 4.4%.",

The diet of three groups of chicks was supplemented with corn germ oil, beef tallow and fish oil at the levels of 30 g/kg and 50 g/kg of feed, respectively. The diet of further three groups was supplemented with methionine (5 g/kg of feed) in addition to the different fat sources. Control chicks were fed with a compound feed without methionine and fat supplementation. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulphide (GSSG) content as well as glutathione peroxidase activity in the liver were determined and GSH/GSSG ratio was calculated at day old and then at one and three weeks of age. Our results indicate that supplementary methionine stimulates both the synthesis of the glutathione redox system and glutathione peroxidase activity in growing chickens in the first period of postnatal life, when the risk of lipid peroxidation is high due to feeding unsaturated fats in the diet.",

A total of 100 (31 young and 69 adult) domestic pigeons were necropsied and examined. The results of necropsies revealed that 74 pigeons harboured helminth infections. Three helminth species were identified: Baruscapillaria obsignata (63%), Ascaridia columbae (42%) and Raillietina echinobothrida (1%). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of B. obsignata and A. columbae by host age and sex. Significantly the highest prevalence rate of A. columbae was observed in the autumn months, but there was no significant difference in the seasonal prevalence of B. obsignata. The mean intensity of B. obsignata and A. columbae was higher in adults than in young pigeons but it did not differ significantly between the two sexes. The highest mean intensity rate of B. obsignata was observed in the autumn, while there was no significant difference for A. columbae with regard to season. From the data obtained in this study it can be concluded that in regions with similar climatic conditions as those in the present study area, pigeon breeders should be cautioned especially of B. obsignata and A. columbae infections of adult pigeons in the autumn months.",

    "abstract": "In a survey of about 3000 dairy cows producing low somatic cell count (SCC) milk and kept on a large-scale dairy farm, California Mastitis Test (CMT) positivity was found in 2714 udder quarters of 1491 cows. Pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from 57.6% of these 2714 udder quarters during bacteriological examination. The commonest pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS, 41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (32.5%); however, udder infections caused by environmental streptococci (12.8%) and coliform bacteria (6.8%) were also common. All pathogens resulted in a significant increase of the SCC in individual bulk milk (IBM) samples. In the case of CNS, this SCC elevation in IBM was significantly lower than in the case of infection by the other pathogens. In spite of this, because of the high number of udder infections caused by CNS, the adverse effect exerted by CNS on dairy herds is considered to be substantial. It was found that 54.6% of all CMT-positive cows produced IBM of an SCC below 400 thousand per ml. The milk produced by 41% of the 315 cows excreting S. aureus also had an SCC below 400 thousand per ml. This poses a serious risk of infection to the healthy herdmates. At the same time, 11% of the infected cows produced IBM with an SCC below 100 thousand per ml. On the basis of these findings, only the regular analysis of SCC of IBM can be a reliable indicator of chronic intramammary infection. As the SCC of milk produced by CMT-positive cows (and especially of those excreting pathogens) tended to increase with advancing lactation, the authors suggest that an efficient drying-off therapy should be used to restore udder health and, whenever justified, culling of cows cannot be avoided either.",

Excess amount of selenium generates oxygen free radicals and reacts with thiol compounds such as reduced glutathione, composing seleno-diglutathione. These reactions impair the amount and/or activity of the biological antioxidant defence system. In the present experiment the effects of two inorganic selenium sources (Na2SeO3, Na2SeO4) on lipid peroxidation and on the content and activity of some components of the antioxidant defence mechanism were studied in Ross 308 hybrid cockerels. In the tissues examined, the glutathione redox system was altered in different ways as an effect of excess selenium. The amount of glutathione and, consequently, glutathione peroxidase activity declined in the blood plasma and in the red blood cell haemolysate, while in the liver malondialdehyde concentration increased only at the end of the experimental period as a result of the boosted enzyme activity. The authors suppose that the cause of increased lipid peroxidation was the potential toxic effect of selenium accumulation above the actual demand.",

Forty-five animals were studied, 20 with and 25 without otitis externa (OE). Cerumen or secretion from external ear canal samples was cultured on modified Mycosel agar and sterile olive oil was added to the surface of the medium before specimen seeding. The isolates were analysed for macro- and micromorphology and identified by catalase tests and on the basis of growth on Tween 20, 40, 60 and 80. Malassezia spp. were isolated from 15 out of 20 (75%) animals with otitis and from 7 out of 25 (28%) cats without OE; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05). Malassezia pachydermatis and M. sympodialis were isolated from 60% (12/20) and 40% (8/20) of cats with otitis, respectively, with no significant difference in the frequency of isolation between the two species. In the microflora of the healthy ear canal M. pachydermatis was significantly more common (6/25, 24%) than M. sympodialis (1/25, 4%). The present investigation confirms that M. sympodialis can also act as an aetiological agent of feline OE, and if commercial veterinary laboratories do not use media with added lipids for the isolation of Malassezia spp., this might lead to false-negative results.",

Vascular lesions, e.g. degeneration of endothelial cells, perivascular and intramural oedema, fibrinoid necrosis, vasculitis, perivasculitis, and vascular thrombi were observed in all cases, associated with the presence of PCV2 antigen. The viral antigen was present in the intravascular mononuclear cells, endothelial cells, myocytes and infiltrating inflammatory cells in lymph and blood vessels. In one case, obliterating thrombi in the lymph and blood vessels were directly connected to areas of tissue necrosis and were associated with abundant PCV2 antigen. The results further suggest the causative role of PCV2 infection in PNP, and the importance of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of PCV2-associated diseases of swine.",

The heritability and breeding values were estimated using the linear Animal Model. The DI, using as reference the worst joint of each animal, ranged from 0.15 to 1.12 (0.55 ± 0.19). The PHL was equal in right and left sides, and was higher in females than in males (P &gt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01 in the t -test, respectively). The estimated heritability was 0.83 ± 0.11. The mean breeding values for PHL were stable in EMD born between 1991 and 2003, and showed an improvement in 2004 and 2005. The data confirm high PHL in breeds with high prevalence and severity of canine hip dysplasia. The high heritability indicates that the DI could be reduced in the breed if PHL were used as a selection criterion. The early favourable evolution of DI breeding values could be related with the increase of voluntary radiographic hip screening in the last years, and the subsequent introduction of hip quality as a breeding criterion.",

    "abstract": "Follicular growth after antrum formation is determined by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Only two ways are possible for recruited follicles, continuing development or atresia. In gilts, intensive ovarian follicular growth begins between 60 and 100 days of age, and fluctuations of the ovarian morphological status last about 20 days; however, at that time there are no really large follicles. Final follicular development is under luteinising hormone (LH) control; this is why the attainment of puberty is related to an increase in serum oestradiol to a level that causes a preovulatory surge of this gonadotropin. The pool of follicles at the beginning of the oestrous cycle is about 30–40, most of which are small (&lt; 3 mm) and growing. Then, the pool of follicles increases to about 80 in the mid-luteal phase but about 50 of them are small and 30 are medium sized (3–6.9 mm). Some of these follicles are in the growing phase, but some are atretic. Between days 7 and 15 of the oestrous cycle the percentage of atretic follicles fluctuates between 12 and 73%. At that time there are no large (&gt; 7 mm) follicles because of the suppressing effect of progesterone. The number of small follicles declines after luteolysis. From the pool of medium follicles, large follicles are selected under the influence of LH, but about 70% of the medium-sized follicles become atretic. Because of the long-lasting selection process there is a significant heterogeneity in the diameter of large follicles in oestrus. However, the number of follicles correlates with the number of corpora lutea after ovulation. Individual follicular development and the relationship between follicles are still poorly known. The use of ultrasonography may give a closer insight into these phenomena.",

The rescued animal showed signs of icterus and anorexia and died within a day, in spite of immediate supportive therapy. Autopsy confirmed the clinical picture by the major lesions observed in the liver. Histopathology revealed vacuolar degeneration in the hepatocytes and leukocytosis in the sinusoidal lumina. By electron microscopy, hydropic degeneration and apoptotic cells with a pycnotic nucleus were found in the liver. Bacteriological examinations gave negative results. As part of a routine screening project, detection of adeno- and herpesviruses from homogenised samples of the liver, lungs and small intestines was attempted by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The adenovirus PCR ended with negative results. The herpesvirus PCR resulted in an amplification product of specific size. The nucleotide sequence of the amplicon was determined and analysed by homology search and phylogenetic analysis. A novel herpesvirus was identified, which seemed to be most closely related to members of the genus Rhadinovirus within the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. The causative role of the detected rhadinovirus in the fatal condition of the Serotine bat could not be proven, but it is most likely that reactivation from a latent infection allowed the detection of the virus by PCR.",

Blood was collected before and after 48-h fasting and 24 h after refeeding. In cockerels, fasting resulted in a significant decrease of TAS and uric acid concentration. After refeeding, the concentration of TAS remained significantly lower as compared to the control level. At the same time, blood plasma level of total lipids increased in comparison to the control and post-fasting values. In pullets, fasting resulted in a significant decrease of whole blood haemolysate GSH-Px activity and blood plasma concentrations of albumin and uric acid. Simultaneously, a significant increase in total lipids and cholesterol was obtained. In pullets, refeeding resulted in a further decrease of TAS to undetectable values, a significant decrease of blood plasma cholesterol, and a significant increase of GSH-Px in the whole blood haemolysate and in blood plasma uric acid content. The results indicate that fasting has a negative impact on the antioxidant defence system of the blood, which leads to a reduced resistance to oxidative stress in both cockerels and pullets. However, pullets seem to be more susceptible to fasting-provoked oxidative stress than cockerels.",

    "abstract": "Gastroduodenal ulceration is a prevalent disease in foals and adult horses. Decreased performance as well as fatal complications relate to this syndrome. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of gastric ulceration in a mixed population of horses by postmortem examination and to evaluate a possible association between equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) and sex or age of the examined horses, to evaluate the localisation of lesions in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract and to determine the occurrence of gastric parasites. Postmortem examinations were performed on 71 horses over a period of 24 months. Gastric ulcers were found in 52 horses (73.2%). There was no significant association between age or sex and occurrence of gastric ulcers. In all horses the squamous mucosa lesions were localised near the margo plicatus (100% of the cases), whereas in 23 horses the lesions were near the margo plicatus and lesser curvature and in 7 horses at the greater curvature. In 18 horses the mucosa was affected in the whole extent of the margo plicatus and in 1 horse diffuse lesions of the squamous mucosa were noted. Lesions of the glandular mucosa were localised in 11 horses at the fundic area, in 1 horse they occurred in the pylorus, and in 10 horses diffuse lesions of the glandular mucosa were recorded. A low prevalence of Gasterophilus intestinalis infection was detected (1 horse, 1.4%). We have confirmed that gastric ulcers are a common problem in horses and duodenal or oesophageal ulceration is rare (not a single case of the latter was found in this study). Lesions in the glandular mucosa of the stomach are more frequent in suckling foals than in older animals. Lesions of the glandular mucosa are also common in adult horses, and a complete gastroscopic examination including examination of the pylorus is advisable to evaluate this syndrome.",

Therefore, the aims of the present study were to evaluate the prevalence of the disease among spayed dogs, to detect differences in risk related to the type of surgery, to describe the characteristics of incontinent bitches, to assess the influence of age at surgery on the onset of incontinence occurrence, and to assess the effectiveness and long-term side effects of oestrogen therapy in affected bitches. Among 750 bitches submitted to ovariectomy or ovariohysterectomy, those showing spaying-related urinary incontinence were evaluated. Oestrogen replacement therapy consisted of administering an effective dose followed by an individual maintenance dose. The results showed that the disease occurred in 5% of neutered bitches, the type of surgery did not affect the disease occurrence, affected bitches frequently represented large or giant breeds or large-size mongrels, the body weight of the affected bitches at surgery was often ≥ 20 kg, the disease seems to be associated with tail docking, the age at surgery influences the onset of incontinence, with earlier occurrence in older bitches, and that a strong co-operation between owners and veterinarians is necessary to achieve successful response to oestrogen replacement therapy. Long-term administration seems to be unrelated to oestrogenic side effects.",

The semen was stored in a Safe Cell Plus commercial extender at 17 degrees C for nine days. The aim of our research was focused on changes in sperm plasma membrane integrity. The integrity of the sperm plasma membrane and acrosome as well as sperm motility decreased after dilution and during storage of the semen. The highest percentage of live sperm was identified by the eosin-nigrosin method, a lower percentage by the SYBR-14/PI test, and the lowest percentage of live cells was discovered by the hypoosmotic swelling (HOS) test (P < 0.01). There were significant differences between the results of staining methods and sperm motility (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found between the HOS test results and sperm motility. The plasma membrane integrity parameters positively correlated (P < 0.001) with each other and with sperm motility but negatively with aspartate aminotransferase activity. Our findings confirmed that the boar sperm aging changes, which increased during liquid semen preservation, were connected with the loss of function and integrity of the sperm plasma membrane. The employed complementary tests are comprehensive indicators of sperm membrane integrity during long-term semen preservation, and they can help establish the actual number of 'healthy' cells. The assays may be used in AI laboratories and should be incorporated into the routine of semen analysis.",

Propofol was used for chemical restraint in all dogs. We found electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that could be considered epileptiform discharges (EDs) in 5 out of 40 dogs (12.5%). The EEG changes identified were spikes in four cases and periodic epileptiform discharges in one case. All EDs were seen in the SE group. We conclude that the interictal electroencephalographic examinations of propofolanaesthetised dogs suffering from IE and SE rarely show epileptic discharges and that the diagnostic value of such EEGs in the work-up for epilepsy seems to be low as epileptic discharges were unlikely to be detected. However, positive findings are more likely to be connected with SE. We found frequent, transient EEG phenomena (spindles, K-complexes, vertex waves, positive occipital sharp transients of sleep, cyclic alternating patterns), which are non-epileptic but their differentiation from epileptic phenomena is challenging.",

The effect exerted on the efficacy of vaccination, especially against canine parvovirus and rabies infection, was studied. The application of vaccine and glucan leads to significant increases in the nonspecific immunological parameters (phagocytic ability of leukocytes, blastogenic response of lymphocytes, metabolic and chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear cells). The level of antibodies against canine parvovirus (Ab CPV) and rabies infection reached the most statistically significant values on the 28th day after the application of vaccine and a syrup containing β-(1,3/1,6)-D-glucan (Group GV) as compared to the control group (Group V, puppies receiving only vaccine). Dogs without glucan supplementation did not produce such significant levels of antibodies. We can conclude that glucan has relevant immunostimulatory effects in dogs with altered immunity.

Heart sounds of 20 dogs were auscultated in vivo (on-line) and recorded with dPCGs by two authors using a Welch Allyn Meditron Stethoscope System. Sound recordings were auscultated off-line and blindly by four different observers having various auscultatory experiences, then listened to while viewing dPCGs. The results were compared to echocardiographic diagnoses. There was a significant agreement (p &lt; 0.001) between on-line and off-line auscultatory findings regarding the four observers, ranging from 45% to 75% (weighted kappa values: 0.72 to 0.87). The best agreement was achieved by Observer 1 having the highest experience. Significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) were found between Observer 1 and Observer 4 (with the lowest experience) in judging the quality of the murmurs during the off-line and blind auscultation. However, there were only minimal differences (95% to 100% agreements) in dPCG analyses among the four observers regarding intensity and quality of the murmurs while simultaneously listening to and viewing the dPCGs. Significant correlations were found between the traditional ‘0 to 6 scale’ and a new ‘0 to 3 scale’ murmur intensity gradings by all observers (correlation coefficients 0.640 to 0.908; p &lt; 0.01 to p &lt; 0.001).

In three cases, leishmaniosis was associated with ehrlichiosis. On examination of peripheral blood smears, Leishmania sp. amastigotes were observed both in various circulating leukocytes (neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage) and free. In conclusion, parasites can rarely be detected in blood smears (in 0.28% of the animals examined); thus, the time-consuming microscopic search for amastigotes can make only a weak contribution to the conventional diagnosis of canine leishmaniosis.",

    "abstract": "Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is essential for the induction of an antiviral response. Previous studies have shown that virus replication causes the activation or expression of Type I interferon (IFN) in cells, which further activates IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to retard virus growth. In this study, after infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) with the lentogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain LaSota or the velogenic NDV strain GM, the mRNA and protein levels of IRF7 showed a significant increase, and part of the IRF7 protein was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In order to further explore the effect of IRF7-mediated innate immune response on the replication of NDV in CEFs, the mRNA levels of IFN-α, IFN-β and STAT1 were measured and the replication kinetics of NDV determined. The results showed that specific siRNA could inhibit the expression of IRF7 and limit the mRNA level of IFN-α, IFN-β and STAT1 and, accordingly, the replication kinetics of both NDVs were enhanced after the inhibition of IRF7. In conclusion, IRF7 is an important nuclear transcription factor for the induction of Type I IFNs during the antiviral response, which can affect the replication of NDV and spread to CEFs in the early phase of viral infection.",

Cells taken from bovine myometrium on days 1-5, 6-10, 11-16 and 17-20 of the oestrous cycle and in weeks 3-5, 6-8 and 9-12 of pregnancy were used. Reverse transcribed RNA was amplified in real-time PCR using designed primers. Reaction efficiency was determined with the Linreg programme. The geNorm and NormFinder programmes were used to select the best housekeeping genes. They calculate the expression stability factor for each used housekeeping gene with the smallest value for most stably expressed genes. According to geNorm, the most stable housekeeping genes in the myometrium were C2orf29, TPB and TUBB2B, while the least stably expressed genes were 18S RNA, HPRT1 and GAPDH. NormFinder identified the best genes in the myometrium as C2orf29, MRPL12 and TBP, while the worst genes were 18S RNA, B2M and SF3A1. Differences in stability factors between the two programmes may also indicate that the physiological status of the female, e.g. pregnancy, affects the stability of expression of housekeeping genes. The different expression stability of housekeeping genes did not affect progesterone receptor expression but it could be important if small differences in gene expression were measured between studies.",

TH receptors (TRs) mediate these hormone effects and are regulated by both hormone families. We reported earlier that THs and oestradiol (E 2 ) determine TR levels in cerebellar cell culture. Here we demonstrate the effects of low concentrations (10 –10 M) of the endocrine disruptor (ED) bisphenol A (BPA) on the hormonal (THs, E 2 ) regulation of TRα,β in rat cerebellar cell culture. Primary cerebellar cell cultures, glia-containing and glia-destroyed, were treated with BPA or a combination of BPA and E 2 and/or THs. Oestrogen receptor and TH receptor mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time qPCR and Western blot techniques. The results show that BPA alone decreases, while BPA in combination with THs and/or E 2 increases TR mRNA expression. In contrast, BPA alone increased receptor protein expressions, but did not further increase them in combination with THs and/or E 2 . The modulatory effects of BPA were mediated by the glia; however, the degree of changes also depended on the specific hormone ligand used. The results signify the importance of the regulatory mechanisms interposed between transcription and translation and raise the possibility that BPA could act to influence nuclear hormone receptor levels independently of ligand–receptor interaction.",

    "abstract": "Pasteurella multocida is responsible for economically important diseases in sheep and pigs. Antimicrobial susceptibility studies are essential for initiating rational and effective empirical therapy of P. multocida infections. In this study we investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility to 18 antimicrobial agents of 156 clinical isolates of P. multocida from sheep (n = 87) and pigs (n = 69) using the microdilution method. Both sheep and pig isolates exhibited low levels of resistance (≤ 15%) to ceftiofur, gentamicin, neomycin, spectinomycin, chlortetracycline, tulathromycin, florfenicol, danofloxacin, and enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, high resistance rates (&gt; 15% up to 50%) to oxytetracycline, tilmicosin, and tiamulin, and very high resistance rates (&gt; 50%) to tylosin tartrate, clindamycin, and sulphadimethoxine. However, sheep isolates exhibited significantly lower percentages of resistance and lower MIC 90 values (P &lt; 0.05) than pig isolates for most of the antimicrobials tested. In addition, sheep isolates exhibited also significantly lower phenotypic antimicrobial resistance diversity (8 resistotypes vs. 30 resistotypes). LAC-LIN-SUL-MAC was the resistotype most frequently detected in sheep (39.1%) and LIN-SUL-MAC in pig isolates (26.1%). The differences in susceptibility patterns could be influenced by the lower use of antimicrobials in the small ruminant industry compared with the pig farming industry.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the reproductive traits of heifers and the development characteristics of their calves following artificial insemination (AI) with sexed and non-sexed semen. The analysed characteristics included conception rate, gestation length, calf birth weight, calf vigour, stillbirth rate, and twinning rate. Data of 530 calves produced with sexed and 1,163 calves produced with non-sexed semen were analysed. The General Linear Model (GLM) was applied to assess the influence of semen type, farm, season of insemination, the calf’s sex and the inseminating sire on gestation length and calf birth weight. With the exception of gestation length (P &gt; 0.05), all other traits studied were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) influenced by the type of semen. The conception rate was 55% for conventional and 44% for sexed semen, and the average gestation length was 274.6 and 274.9 days, respectively. The mean calf birth weight was 37.47 kg for non-sexed and 36.75 kg for sexed semen. The stillbirth rate was 6.19% for conventional and 7.54% for sexed semen, while the twinning rate was 3.78% for conventional and 1.13% for sexed semen. The calves produced with non-sexed and sexed semen differed significantly in viability (P &lt; 0.001), the latter having a lower calf vigour score. The use of conventional semen did not affect the ratio of female and male calves (52.7:47.3%; P &gt; 0.05); however, artificial insemination with X-sorted sexed semen significantly altered the sex ratio of calves (85.1:14.9%, P &lt; 0.01). The results obtained in this investigation are in agreement with the majority of studies which compared the fertility traits, sex ratio and calf characteristics depending on the application of artificial insemination with sexed or conventional semen.",

    "abstract": "The present studies were conducted: (1) to determine which β-adrenoceptor subtypes are involved in progesterone and oxytocin (OT) secretion, (2) to examine whether noradrenaline (NA) acts directly on the cytochrome P-450scc and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), and (3) to study the effect of prostaglandin F 2α , (PGF 2α ) on NA-stimulated steroidogenesis in luteal cells. The effect of NA on progesterone secretion from luteal slices of heifers on days 8–12 of the oestrous cycle was blocked by both atenolol (β 1 -antagonist) and ICI 118.551 hydrochloride (β2-antagonist). OT secretion was blocked only after treatment with ICI 118.551 hydrochloride (P &lt; 0.05). Dobutamine (10 −4 −10 −6 ), a selective β 1 agonist and salbutamol (10 −4 −10 −6 ), a selective β 2 agonist, both increased progesterone production (P &lt; 0.01) with an efficiency comparable to that produced by NA (P &lt; 0.01). The increase of OT content in luteal slices was observed only after treatment with salbutamol at the dose of 10 −5 M (P &lt; 0.01). Dobutamine had no effect on OT production at any dose. A stimulatory effect of NA on cytochrome P-450scc activity (P &lt; 0.05) was demonstrated using 25-hydroxycholesterol as substrate. 3β-HSD activity also increased following NA (P &lt; 0.01) or pregnenolone (P &lt; 0.05) and in tissue treated with pregnenolone together with NA (P &lt; 0.01). PGF decreased progesterone synthesis (P &lt; 0.05) and 3β-HSD activity (P &lt; 0.01) in tissue treated with NA. We conclude that NA stimulates progesterone secretion by luteal β 1 - and β 2 -adrenoceptors, while OT secretion is probably mediated only via the β 2 -receptor. NA also increases cytochrome P-450scc and 3β-HSD activity. PGF inhibits the luteotropic effect of NA on the luteal tissue.",

At 3 days of age, chicks were randomly divided over three rooms in a high-altitude farm, 2000 m above sea level. During days 14 to 28 ambient temperature decreased during the night but the minimum temperature did not descend below 15°C. In the first room the continuous lighting schedule (CL, 23L:1D) was maintained and in the second room an intermittent lighting schedule (IL, 1L:3D), repeated six times daily, was imposed from 3 days of age. In the third room, an increasing photoperiod schedule (IP, 4 to 14 days, 6L:18D; 15 to 21 days, 10L:14D; 22 to 28 days, 14L:10D; 29 to 35 days, 18L:6D; 36 to 42 days, 23L:1D) was provided. Mortality associated with right ventricular failure and ascites was numerically lower in birds reared under the IL and IP schedules compared to birds reared under the CL schedule, which can be attributed to the temporary reduction in relative growth and feed intake in IL and IP birds. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of lighting schedules could be due to a reduced metabolic rate as a consequence of the altered growth trajectory, as also reflected in the lower haematocrit and plasma T 3 levels of IL and IP birds compared to CL birds.",

In addition to M. bovis and P. multocida, the herd was also infected with different viruses (including bovine viral diarrhoea virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine adenoviruses, parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus) as a large proportion of the sera of newborn calves contained colostral antibodies against these viruses. In most of the newborn calves severe clinical signs (fever, depression, inappetence, hyperventilation, dyspnoea, nasal discharge and coughing) due to M. bovis infection developed. The clinical signs appeared already on the fifth day of life, and their incidence was the highest at the age of 10 to 15 days. Three calves (8.6%) died as a result of severe serofibrinous pneumonia.

Among the 39 strains there were only two that were susceptible to penicillin by disk diffusion method; however, further examination by the penicillinase test showed that they produced beta-lactamase. While 19 (15 S. aureus, 4 CNS) strains were resistant and 7 strains were intermediate to oxacillin in disk diffusion test, the E-test gave 8 resistant and 5 intermediate results. Six out of the 8 oxacillin-resistant strains examined by disk diffusion and E-test harboured the mecA gene. Thus only 6 out of the examined 1921 strains proved to be mecA positive. These methicillin-resistant, mecA-positive strains (5 of the S. aureus strains and 1 of the S. epidermidis) originated from two dairy herds. The results prove that methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains in animals are really rare in Hungary. Eighteen strains were chosen and screened for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxacillin with or without clavulanic acid or sulbactam, and three of them produced methicillinase enzyme.",

ROSS cockerels and New Zealand White female rabbits were fed a diet containing Ni in concentrations of 0, 50 and 500 mg/kg in dry matter (DM). Dietary supplementation of 50 mg Ni/kg slightly improved the body weight gain (BWG) and had a beneficial effect on the feed conversion efficiency (FCE) in broiler chickens. However, Ni added at a level of 500 mg/kg significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced the BWG by 10% and resulted in significantly (P &lt; 0.05) worse (2.3 ± 0.2 kg/kg) FCE. The relative weight of the liver in cockerels was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased by Ni as compared to the control group (1.7 and 2.1% vs. 2.6%). The activity of AST and CHE enzymes was increased insignificantly by dietary supplementation of 500 mg Ni/kg, indicating damage of the liver parenchyma. The results of serum biochemistry were confirmed by a mild or moderate form of pathological focal fatty infiltration of the liver in broilers. Supplemental Ni of 50 mg/kg concentration resulted in non-significantly increased BWG in rabbits. Ni added to the diet at a level of 500 mg/kg reduced the digestibility of crude protein by 3-4% and that of crude fibre by 20-25% in rabbits. Approx. 98% of the ingested Ni was lost from the body via the faeces, 0.5-1.5% via the urine and approx. 1% was incorporated into the organs of rabbits. As a result of dietary supplementation of 50 and 500 mg Ni/kg, Ni accumulated in the kidneys (4.9 ± 0.5 and 17.1 ± 3.1 vs. 1.9 ± 0.3 mg/kg DM), ribs (10.3 ± 0.4 and 10.4 ± 0.6 vs. 9.1 ± 0.6 mg/kg DM), heart (1.4 ± 0.2 and 2.5 ± 0.4 vs. 1.0 ± 0.1 mg/kg DM) and liver (1.3 ± 0.1 and 2.2 ± 0.2 vs. 0.9 ± 0.05 mg/kg DM), as compared to the control animals. It can be stated that supplementation of the diet with 50 mg Ni/kg had slight but non-significant beneficial effects on the growth performance of broiler chickens and rabbits.",

Stomachs of 89 finishing pigs from 27 randomly selected herds were sampled at the slaughterhouse. Forty cases (Group A) were selected based upon the presence of gross pathological lesions in the pars oesophagea, and further 49 cases were obtained at random (Group B). Three samples of gastric tissue (junction of pars oesophagea and pars cardiaca, fundic area, and pyloric area) were collected from each stomach for histological and immunohistochemical examination. Helicobacter antigen was detected in 76 cases (85.4%). No association was found between the presence of Helicobacter in the stomach and the occurrence of gross pathological lesions in the pars oesophagea or gastritis detected on histological examination. However, a significant association was found between the occurrence of Helicobacter in the pyloric area and the presence of erosions/ulcers in the pars oesophagea (OR: 7.01, p = 0.022) in Group B. A significant association was also evident between the presence of Helicobacter and glandular lesions (dilatation of the glands + glandular abscess + degeneration of glandular epithelial cells). In conclusion, Helicobacter infection seems to be a contributing factor to pathological changes in the stomach of finishing pigs.",

Additionally, 13 wild free-roaming brown rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) were captured from the Tallinn Dog Home territory, necropsied and studied for the presence of Toxocara larvae. Toxocara canis adults were found in 14.6% of the dogs and Toxocara cati (syn. mystax ) adults in the small intestines of 48.2% of the cats examined. Larval infection was detected in the kidney and liver in 5 dogs (12.2%). Our study demonstrated only low-level larval Toxocara infections in adult dogs. Toxocara larvae were not found in cats and brown rats. According to the results of this study, cats more often carry Toxocara infection than dogs. Under our conditions, stray and free-roaming cats are the main contaminators of the environment with Toxocara eggs. Children playing in sandpits are the main risk group for larval toxocarosis.",

As the application of chemicals has several disadvantages, alternative control measures of traumatic myiasis of livestock must be developed. In this study, the use of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) as potential biocontrol agents against second instar larvae of Lucilia sericata was considered. The following nematode species were tested: Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (IS 5, HHU 1, Hmo1, HNC 1, HAZ 36, Hbrecon, HHU 2, HAZ 29, HHP 88, HHU 3, HHU 4 and HGua), Steinernema intermedia , NC513 strain of S. glaserii , S. anomali , S. riobrave , Steinernema sp. and 5 strains of S. feltiae (22, Vija Norway, HU 1, scp, and IS 6). None of the examined EPN species or strains showed larvicidal efficacy at 37°C (no killing effect was observed in the case of the two heat-tolerant strains - H. bacteriophora and S. feltiae ) against L. sericata larvae. At lower temperatures (20°C and 25°C) only strainsof S. feltiae were found to be active. The overall odds ratios calculated for L. sericata maggots to contract S. feltiae nematode infection show significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect only in the case of strains HU 1, 22 and IS 6. In the case of strains HU 1 and 22 parasitic forms of S. feltiae could be detected in the dead larvae of L. sericata . Strain IS 6 (and also Vija Norway at 20°C) penetrated and killed fly larvae, but only adult forms of the nematode occurred in the cadavers.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide occurrence and re-occurrence of transboundary diseases like foot-and-mouth disease or classical swine fever indicates that there is a high need for the development of powerful, robust and high-capacity new diagnostic methods, which are able to detect the causative agents before they could spread to large populations and cause tremendous losses. This article reports the experiences of a research group on the development of molecular methods for the improved diagnosis of a range of porcine viral diseases, including diseases on List A of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). Nucleic acid hybridisation and various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been applied for routine diagnosis of a large range of viral diseases. During the last one-and-a-half decade more than 40 nested PCR assays have been developed to detect a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. False positive and negative results are avoided by the use of special tools, practices and internal controls of amplification (mimics). Recently, real-time PCR methods (TaqMan, molecular beacons, Primer-Probe Energy Transfer system) have been developed for the diagnosis of a wide range of diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis. Multiplex PCR packages have been developed for the simultaneous detection of eight important viruses of swine. By introducing nucleic acid extraction and pipetting robotics, together with the multi-channel real-time PCR machines, the diagnostic procedures have become rapid, robust and automated. In order to standardise the real-time PCR assays, the rules of OIE are considered. By following the five steps of OIE standardisation and validation, the new diagnostic procedures are nationally and internationally standardised and harmonised. The rapid, powerful and internationally standardised molecular diagnosis contributes to the reduction of losses caused by the transboundary viral diseases in swine populations.",

A total of 280 Japanese quails aged 10 weeks, divided into one control group and three treatment groups, were used. The diets of the first, second and third treatment groups were supplemented with 100 mg L-carnitine/kg, 1.5 g humate (Farmagülatör Dry Plus)/kg and 100 mg L-camitine + 1.5 g humate/kg, respectively. The experimental period lasted 16 weeks. The addition of L-carnitine and sodium humate alone or in combination did not significantly affect body weight, feed consumption, egg production, feed conversion ratio, mortality, egg-shell thickness, egg yolk index and the percentages of egg-shell, albumen and yolk. Egg weight increased (P < 0.001) with L-carnitine supplementation. The values of egg albumen height (P < 0.05), egg albumen index (P < 0.01) and egg Haugh unit (P < 0.05) were increased with humate supplementation. Egg cholesterol content and blood serum parameters were not affected by the supplementation of L-carnitine with or without humate. The results in this study demonstrated that L-carnitine supplementation increased egg weight while humate addition increased egg albumen index and egg Haugh unit of laying quails. However, the combined administration of L-carnitine and humate did not have any significant effects on the parameters measured.",

    "abstract": "Ketosis was diagnosed in a flock of Merino ewes that conceived from synchronised oestrus in the early autumn period. On day 140 of pregnancy the ewes were sampled for determination of βOH-butyrate (BHB), AST, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), total cholesterol (TCH), insulin, T4, T3, cortisol, IGF-1 and leptin. The results were evaluated according to the number of fetuses born some days later and the presence of hyperketonaemia (BHB: ≥ 1.60 mmol/l). In May, about 3 months after lambing, cyclic ovarian function was induced (Cronolone + eCG), and the ewes were inseminated artificially (AI) 48 h after the removal of gestagen-containing sponge. At the time of AI and 10 days later blood samples were collected again to check the plasma levels of the same constituents as previously (in samples taken at AI), and to monitor the ovarian response by assaying progesterone (in both samples). On day 140 of gestation significantly lower BHB levels were detected in dams with single (n = 41) than in those with twin (n = 57) pregnancies. Hyperketonaemia was found only in ewes bearing twins (n = 27). These animals had higher NEFA and cortisol, and lower TCH, insulin, IGF-1, leptin and T3 levels than their normoketonaemic twin-bearing flock-mates, and those with single pregnancy. The blood glucose concentrations varied within a wide range, and the means of groups did not exhibit any significant differences. The formerly hyperketonaemic individuals were characterised by lower leptin level 3 months after lambing, and they showed a poorer response to the cycle-induction procedure than the others. The non-responders had lower IGF-1 and leptin levels than those ovulated after this treatment. It was concluded that the subclinical form of ovine ketosis is characterised by complex endocrine alterations, reflecting an obvious form of negative energy balance. If attempts to induce cyclic ovarian function outside the breeding season are made soon after lambing, the ovarian response and fertility of these ewes may also be depressed.",

    "abstract": "Maternal plasma leptin is elevated in ewes during pregnancy. The authors studied whether there was any relation between maternal plasma leptin and insulin concentrations, the number of fetuses and the circulating and faecal levels of gestagens. At the end of the breeding season in January the ovarian activity of Prolific Merino ewes was induced/synchronised with gestagen + eCG treatment. Ewes were inseminated artificially (AI) by laparoscopy. Blood and faecal samples were collected before AI (day 0) and again 41, 81 and 101 days later. The plasma levels of leptin (pL), insulin and progesterone (pP4), and the faecal P4 metabolite (P4-met) content were determined. The day 0 level of pL was significantly higher in pregnant (n = 24) than in non-pregnant ewes (n = 32). By day 41 the pL of pregnant animals had doubled, it showed a further moderate increase on day 81, and decreased slightly thereafter. During pregnancy pP4 and faecal P4-met rose continuously and were positively correlated at all stages. The mean levels of pL and pP4 and the faecal content of P4-met were lower in ewes bearing single (n = 12) than in those with 2 (n = 6) or 3-5 fetuses (n = 6). Analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences according to the number of fetuses in the pL and pP4, but not in P4-met (p = 0.042, 0.044, and 0.051, respectively). Leptin showed positive correlation with insulin before the AI but not during pregnancy. On days 41 and 81 pL showed a slight positive correlation with P4 and P4-met, which decreased slightly by day 101. This study shows that although leptinaemia is affected by the number of fetuses and the level of P4, pregnancy stage is a more important regulator than these additional factors.",

During the winter season of 2004, eight wild young piglets (of approximately 2 to 5 months of age) were found dead in a fenced hunting area. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out on mesenteric lymph nodes and all animals yielded positive results. In one of these animals diagnosis of PMWS was established based on the three key diagnostic criteria including the clinical manifestation, moderate lymphoid lesions consisting of lymphocyte depletion and granulomatous inflammation, and detection of the presence of PCV2 genome within the lymphoid lesions by in situ hybridisation (ISH). Three additional wild piglets had also mild PMWS-like lesions and a low amount of PCV2 was also found. No PMWS-like lesions or PCV2 genome were detected in the rest of the wild piglets studied. Three PCR-positive isolates were partially sequenced, which confirmed the diagnosis of PCV2 and demonstrated that the three sequences were genetically identical. The phylogenetic analysis of a representative PCV2 isolate indicated that its sequence (DQ875444) is grouped in a separate branch with Hungarian isolate (AY256460) and differs from any of the annotated sequences.",

The latter was used to determine the antibody response against both methylated and nonmethylated Heparin-Binding Haemagglutinin (HBHA) protein. Nine mycobacterial strains were isolated: three M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis (Map), three M. avium, one M. interjectum and two M. scrofulaceum strains. By PCR, only one animal was positive for M. bovis, whereas 10 animals were positive for Map. Out of the 48 sera tested, 19 showed a good humoral response to methylated HBHA and 17 to nonmethylated HBHA.

Furthermore, the results of MVD were correlated with histological grade, higher grades being accompanied by higher MVD. In simple adenomas and grade I tubular-tubulopapillary simple carcinomas the intratumoural microvessels were wide and regular in shape with evident erythrocytes in their lumen. In grade III solid carcinomas the microvessels were smaller, less regular and had irregular shape, often without a distinct lumen, and isolated endothelial cells were frequently present. In the complex carcinomas MVD was low and the intratumoural microvessels were mostly irregular in shape without a distinct lumen.

    "abstract": "To clarify the effect of orally administered citric acid on the electrocardiographic parameters of pulmonary hypertensive broilers, chicks were reared at high altitude and treated with citric acid for 45 days. Increase of cardiac indices such as right ventricle/total ventricles (RV/TV), RV/body weight and TV/body weight ratio was not observed in the treated groups as compared to the control groups. Decrease of S amplitude in the treated groups (leads II, III, aVF) was only significant (P &lt; 0.05) at 45 days of age (leads II, aVF; 1.5 g/l of citric acid). There were significant reductions of T amplitude at 28 (lead aVR) and 36 days (lead aVL) and significant reductions of R wave at 28 (lead aVL, all doses of citric acid) and 45 days of age (lead aVR, 1 and 1.5 g/l citric acid) in the treated groups. The QRS interval was significantly higher at 28 (leads III and aVF), 36 (leads II, III and aVF, 1 g/l citric acid) and 45 days of age (leads II and aVF) in the treated groups. The QT interval was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased at 28 and 45 days of age (lead aVL) and the RR interval also showed an increase at 28 (leads aVR and aVL) and 45 (lead aVL) days of age as compared to the controls. Our data indicate that citric acid modulates the induction of pulmonary hypertension at high altitude and this effect is detectable in the electrocardiographic parameters.",

    "abstract": "A total of 684 Hisex Brown day-old chicks were studied. The chicks were randomly assigned into three groups as follows: (1) chicks with immediate feed access; (2) chicks with 48 h delay in feed access, and (3) chicks with 72 h delay in feed access. For each group, chicks were assigned into 4 replications of 57 birds each. Prior to feed access, the chicks were weighed. Samples of chicks were used to weigh yolk sac at 1, 3 and 7 days and to collect blood at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 56 days. Also, reared chicks were weighed weekly. The results indicated that chick weights decreased during the holding period. Yolk sac utilisation was similar between groups, while morbidity and mortality increased linearly with the duration of delay in feed access. At 56 days, chicks having delayed access to feed were lighter than those without delay in feed access. Serum concentration of glucose up to 14 days and of total protein and triglycerides until 56 days decreased with the increasing duration of delay in feed access. It can be concluded that delayed feed access is detrimental to the juvenile performance of layer-type chicks and has a negative age-related effect on the serum concentrations of glucose, triglycerides and total protein.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of tamoxifen (TAM), an oestrogen receptor antagonist, on the concentrations of sex hormones in chicken ovarian follicles. The experiment was carried out on Hy-line hens which were randomly divided into two groups (control and experimental). TAM was given at a dose of 4 mg/hen (per os) at first once a day for 7 consecutive days, and subsequently four times a day for the next 6 days. Control hens received placebo. Birds were killed on the day after the last TAM treatment. From the dissected ovaries the following compartments were isolated: stroma with follicles < 1 mm, white non-hierarchical (1-4 mm and 4-8 mm) and yellow hierarchical follicles (F6-F1; 18-35 mm). The concentrations of the sex steroids progesterone (P4), testosterone (T) and oestradiol (E2) in the ovarian follicles were determined by radioimmunoassay. In the TAM-treated group, a gradual decrease in egg-laying rate was observed from the 4th day of the experiment. Eventually, egg laying stopped entirely on the 12th day of the experiment. TAM significantly decreased the weight of the ovary and affected the sex hormone concentrations in the ovarian follicles. Following TAM treatment (1) a significant increase in E2 and T concentrations in the stroma, white follicles and the F4 and F1 follicles, (2) a significant decrease in E2 and T concentrations in the F2 follicle, and (3) a significant decline of P4 in the F4 to F1 follicles were observed. The results indicate that the blockade of oestrogen receptors by TAM significantly modulates the process of chicken ovarian steroidogenesis.",

    "abstract": "An outbreak of simultaneously occurring haemangiomas, leiomyosarcoma and myeloma was observed in a commercial layer flock in China. The sick chickens were extremely thin and dehydrated. Scattered haemangiomas were found on the claws, breast and wings. At necropsy, haemangiomas and some other nodular tumours were also found in the internal organs. In addition, diffuse enlargement of the liver and spleen appeared in some birds. Histopathologically, haemangiomas were typically cavernous haemangiomas and haemangioendothelioma. In the diffusely swollen liver and spleen, multifocal or widespread marrow tumour cells filled with ball-like acidophilic particles in cytosol were observed, which are the characteristic pathological changes of avian myelocytomatosis. The nodular tumour cells formed by muscle bundles were of variable size, irregular shape, poorly differentiated and malaligned. Immunohistochemistry for vimentin, cytokeratin, actin (smooth muscle) and actin (sarcomeric) and Masson's staining confirmed the different cell lineage of the nodular tumour, thus leading to the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. The seroprevalence of avian leukosis subgroup J (ALV-J) antibodies was 13.46% (7/52), while ALV-A/B and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) antibodies were not detectable. The DF-1 cells inoculated by virus extracted from liver samples from 24 infected chickens were cultured and the group-specific antigen (GSA) was identified by ELISA. All samples were positive for ALV, which was further identified as ALV-J by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). PCR analysis revealed that three isolates of ALV-J proviral sequence were close to the HPRS-103 prototype strain and other Chinese field strains isolated in recent years, while one isolate (DP01) had a lower homology with them. This is the first report that ALV-J infection caused the simultaneous occurrence of haemangiomas, leiomyosarcoma and myeloma in a commercial layer flock.",

The use of the FISH technique with probes for each horse chromosome pair enabled the diagnosis of many different chromosome aberrations in this population. Among the horses analysed, 21 animals had normal karyotype - 64,XX (19 mares) and 64,XY (2 stallions). Fourteen animals, constituting 40% of the population studied, showed the following chromosome abnormalities: 63,X (1 mare); 63,X/64,XX (6 mares); 63,X/64,XX/65,XXX (3 mares); 63,X/65,XXX (1 mare); 64,XX/65,XX+Xp (1 mare); 63,X/64,XX/65,XX+Xq (1 mare), and 63,X/64,XX/65,XX+delY (1 intersex). When only the mares studied because of complete infertility were taken into consideration, this proportion exceeded 56%. Due to the increased frequency of the above-mentioned aberrations in the mosaic form of two or more lines, it was necessary to analyse a large number (100-300) of metaphase spreads. The use of specific molecular probes obtained by chromosome microdissection made these diagnoses much easier.",

The virus (SbSHV) has been shown to be the causative agent of an acute disease with high mortality in farmed juvenile sturgeons in Russia. Two fragments (of 7000 and 300 base pairs in length) encompassing 3 complete and 3 partial ORFs were amplified by PCR. Sturgeon herpesvirus strains, classified into species Acipenserid herpesvirus 2 (AciHV-2), have been isolated and partially sequenced from several regions (California, Idaho, Oregon and Canada) of North America from white (A. transmontanus) and shortnose sturgeons (A. brevirostrum). The sequence of the SbSHV strain shared highest identity with that of the Canadian strain originating from shortnose sturgeon. The phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that SbSHV is closely related to AciHV-2 and could also be classified into this virus species. This is the first report on the occurrence of AciHV-2 in Europe. Previously, only another virus species, AciHV-1 has been detected in farmed white sturgeons in Italy. The size and position of ORFs in the examined gene block confirmed that this genomic region is highly conserved in members of the genus Ictalurivirus.",

From the day of hatching to 2 weeks of age, four groups of chickens were fed the same uncontaminated control diet. After 14 days, Group 1 (control) continued to receive the uncontaminated diet, while Group 2 was fed an identical diet enriched with 0.5% chemically modified lignin. Simultaneously, chickens of Group 3 were switched to a diet contaminated with 7.9 mg/kg ZEA and those of Group 4 to an identical contaminated diet supplemented with 0.5% lignin. At 6 weeks of age blood and tissue samples were collected. Feeding of a diet contaminated with a high level of ZEA resulted in elevated glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the duodenal mucosa and kidney tissues, and an increased γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity in the plasma, indicative of oxidative stress. In the liver tissue, no mycotoxin-induced response in GPx and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activities occurred, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) level was even reduced. Neither the plasma levels of retinol and α-tocopherol nor the activities of superoxide dismutase in erythrocytes and GPx in blood were affected in birds fed the contaminated diet. The only effect of lignin supplemented to the contaminated feed was that it prevented the increase of GPx activity in the duodenal mucosa as an indicator of oxidative stress.",

Twenty-four Ross 308 hybrid broiler chickens of both sexes were fed diets containing maize contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins. The diets included a control diet (DON 0.60 mg/kg feed; ZEA 0.07 mg/kg feed), an experimental 1 diet (DON 3.4 mg kg⁻¹ feed; ZEA 3.4 mg kg⁻¹ feed), and an experimental 2 diet (DON 8.2 mg kg⁻¹ feed; ZEA 8.3 mg kg⁻¹ feed). Contaminated diets were fed from 14 days of age for 14 days. Blood samples were collected from 4-week-old birds. Chicks fed a diet containing a low level of contaminated maize (experimental 1) had decreased plasma potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, triglycerides, free glycerol concentrations and increased cholesterol and calcium levels as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzyme activities as compared to the control. Feeding a diet contaminated with high levels of mycotoxins (experimental 2) resulted in decreased plasma potassium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, triglycerides, free glycerol concentrations and increased plasma ALP, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST enzyme activities. The effect of mycotoxin-contaminated diets on ALP activity was dose dependent. Chloride concentration was not affected by the diets. It can be concluded that feeding diets contaminated with both levels of Fusarium mycotoxins significantly affected protein, lipid and mineral metabolism as well as AST and ALP enzyme activities in broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "One of the main obstacles in freshwater aquaculture is the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich), the causative agent of white spot disease. The use of immunostimulants as feed additives may be a promising approach to control Ich infection. In the present study, we tested the prophylactic effect of orally administered β-1,3/1,6-glucan and propolis extract E50 against Ich infection in common carp. In total, 122 fish were separated into three experimental groups fed with a control, 3% β-glucan and 1% propolis diet for 40 consecutive days, respectively. On day 40, 16 fish per group were individually exposed to Ich theronts and the number of trophonts was counted 5 days post exposure. Relative gene expression of interleukin 1-β (IL-1-β) in common carp liver was examined by qPCR. Compared to control, the mean infection intensity was lower in the β-glucan- and propolis-fed groups; however, the difference was not statistically significant. The relative expression of IL-1-β significantly decreased in the propolis-fed group at day 10. In the β-glucan-fed group, a significant IL-1-β decrease was detected at day 15 compared to control. Although the Ich infection intensity was slightly decreased in both treated groups, and IL-1-β was moderately down-regulated in the liver of common carp, our results suggest that the applied feeding regime is insufficient to prevent Ich outbreaks in common carp.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis plays an essential role in the development of a neoplastic tumour by conditioning both its growth and the formation of metastases. The induction of blood vessel growth occurs under the influence of proangiogenic factors, among which Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) seems to be the most important. The aim of this research was to study the level of VEGF measured by ELISA in the serum of dogs with neoplasms of the oral cavity. The study material comprised samples of neoplastic tissue from 17 operated dogs and the serum of the examined animals as well as of dogs from the control group. The tissue samples were taken from dogs of different breeds, aged 6–14 years. The tumour type was determined in accordance with the applicable WHO classification. Blood samples taken from sick dogs and from animals of the control group were centrifuged, and immunoenzymatic labelling of VEGF was performed in the obtained serum using ELISA and R&amp;D system reagents (Quantikine Canine VEGF). All stages of VEGF labelling were performed according to the recommendation of the test manufacturer. The median of VEGF in the serum of the dogs with neoplasms of the oral cavity was 40.64 pg/mL. The lowest value of 14.26 pg/mL was observed in the case of fibrosarcoma, and the highest value of 99.19 pg/mL in the case of squamous cell carcinoma. The VEGF median in the control group amounted to 11.14 pg/mL whereas the VEGF value in the groups of animals diagnosed with benign tumours ranged between 2.30 and 19.74 pg/mL. Elevated VEGF in the blood serum, in comparison with the benign tumour group and the control group, was observed in all examined neoplasms of the oral cavity. It was suggested that overexpression of VEGF can have a prognostic value and is useful in the early detection of neoplasms.",

A total of 136 venous blood samples were collected from 20 pregnant and 10 nonpregnant (control) asymptomatic Lipizzaner broodmares for biochemical analyses. Twelve parameters (albumin, total protein, urea, triglycerides, glucose, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, gammaglutamyltransferase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) were measured. For the statistical analyses, correlation, analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis H-test were used to evaluate the possible associations between parameters. Serum triglyceride levels proved to be significantly different in pregnant mares compared to the control group. Total protein and urea levels significantly decreased, while glucose, triglyceride and glutamate dehydrogenase values increased from approx. the fifth month of gestation until parturition. Four biochemical parameters (albumin, aspartate transaminase, total protein and urea) were lower and three other variables (glucose, alkaline phosphatase and creatinine) were significantly higher in late-term pregnant mares than in mares in early or mid-gestation. It is concluded that reference values not only reflect the species, breed and sex but also the reproductive status of animals.",

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the rate of DNA damage caused by T-2 toxin in porcine mononuclear cells in increasing concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μmol) and after two different incubation periods (24 and 42 h). The lowest concentration caused DNA damage and about 50% of the treated cells could be categorised as having 1 to 4 scores in comet assay. In parallel with the increase of T-2 toxin concentration, the frequency of intact lymphocytes decreased from 50.2% (0.1 μM) to 36.3% (1.0 μM) in the first 24 h. In case of score 3, the highest concentration of T-2 toxin resulted in a 5-fold change, as compared to the lowest dose. Cells with score 4 were found only after exposure to 1.0 μM T-2 toxin. The exposure time did not have a significant effect on the results, while concentration did (P < 0.0001). However, a significant interaction between concentration and time as fixed factors (P < 0.0001) was found. When these were combined as a single factor, the results showed a significant toxin treatment effect on the results. It was concluded that a time- and dose-dependent DNA damaging effect of T-2 toxin could be demonstrated using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy pigs by comet assay.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of caffeine on turkey spermatozoa during in vitro incubation. Experimental samples were prepared by diluting the raw semen with nine different concentrations of caffeine - from 0.078125 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL. The individual motility parameters were evaluated by the Computer Assisted Semen Analyser (CASA) system, and the viability of spermatozoa was evaluated using eosin-nigrosin staining. Selected parameters were recorded at six time periods: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h at 5 °C and 41 °C. A significantly higher motility and progressive motility of spermatozoa (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) was detected in the samples containing caffeine ranging from 0.15625 to 7.5 mg/mL as compared to the control sample at 5 °C. At an incubation temperature of 41 °C the positive effect of caffeine on motility parameters was observed only at the beginning of incubation (at times 0 and 1). The tested caffeine concentrations showed no significant effect on the viability of turkey spermatozoa at any time period of incubation. A higher percentage of dead spermatozoa was observed for incubation at 41 °C (from 5.96% to 11.1%) in comparison to 5 °C (from 1.62% to 5.79%). The results suggest that caffeine can be used as a suitable component of turkey semen extenders and has the potential to improve fertility.",

Most O. rhinotracheale strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim and gentamicin, and were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin and tilmicosin. All B. avium strains were resistant to ceftiofur and lincomycin and susceptible to doxycycline, gentamicin, polymyxin B, spectinomycin and sulphonamides. The MICs ranged widely for all three antibiotics tested against O. rhinotracheale strains, from 0.12 μg/ml to 32 μg/ml for amoxicillin and erythromycin, and from 0.6 μg/ml to 32 μg/ml for doxycycline. For B. avium isolates, the MIC values ranged from ≤ 0.03 μg/ml to 1 μg/ml for amoxicillin, from ≤ 0.03 μg/ml to 0.12 μg/ml for doxycycline and from 8 μg/ml to 16 μg/ml for erythromycin. These findings support the idea that the use of antibiotics in a region or a farm may affect antimicrobial resistance and underline the need for prudent application of antibiotic therapy based on proper antimicrobial susceptibility testing.",

The proportions of C17:0, C18:3 n3, C22:5 n3 and C22:6 n3 fatty acids decreased in the hepatic phospholipid fraction. All proportional decreases modified the hepatocellular membrane lipids into a more rigid state. The fatty acid profile modifications were partly compensated for by endogenous glutathione (preventing the formation of conjugated dienes and trienes as initial phase lipid peroxidation indicators), while the enzymatic antioxidant defence system (glutathione peroxidase) was unaltered. In contrast, hepatic malondialdehyde, the cytotoxic product of end-phase lipid peroxidation showed a concentration increase even after 5 days of feeding. The results indicate a rather strong and rapid hepatic effect of FB 1 , immediately impairing membrane phospholipids, even before the enzymatic antioxidant defence is activated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper describes the first documented outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) caused by Pasteurella multocida type B in cattle in Spain. This acute, highly fatal septicaemia causes major economic losses in cattle and buffaloes in many areas of Asia and Africa. In other species and in European countries it is an infrequently reported disease. Acute septicaemic pasteurellosis occurred in a free-range farm of 150 cattle and 70 beef calves in Southern Spain. Twenty-one calves and one cow were affected, of which three calves and the adult cow died. Postmortem examination revealed characteristic oedema in the ventral area of the neck and the brisket region, and widespread haemorrhages in all organs. Pure cultures of P. multocida were obtained from all tissues and organs studied. The aetiological agent was further confirmed by molecular and biochemical analysis as P. multocida capsular type B, biovar 3. Although the source of infection could not be determined, wildlife may play an important role. The use of tulathromycin in the initial stage of the disease might be related to the low morbidity and mortality of this outbreak. After using an autogenous vaccine no more cases of HS were observed.",

The aim of this study was to establish normal heart rate reference values for the ongoing equine pregnancy and to perform a heart rate variability (HRV) time-domain analysis in Lipizzaner mares. Seventeen middle- and late-term (days 121–333) pregnant Lipizzaner mares were examined using fetomaternal electrocardiography (ECG). The mean FHR (P = 0.004) and the standard deviation of FHR (P = 0.012) significantly decreased during the pregnancy. FHR ± SD values decreased from 115 ± 35 to 79 ± 9 bpm between months 5 and 11. Our data showed that HRV in the foal decreased as the pregnancy progressed, which is in contrast with the findings of earlier equine studies. The standard deviation of normal-normal intervals (SDNN) was higher (70 ± 25 to 166 ± 108 msec) than described previously. The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) decreased from 105 ± 69 to 77 ± 37 msec between the 5th and 11th month of gestation. Using telemetric ECG equipment, we could detect equine fetal heartbeat on day 121 for the first time. In addition, the large differences observed in the HR values of four mare-fetus pairs in four consecutive months support the assumption that there might be ‘high-HR’ and ‘low-HR’ fetuses in horses. It can be concluded that the analysis of FHR and FHRV is a promising tool for the assessment of fetal well-being but the applicability of these parameters in the clinical setting and in studs requires further investigation.",

The PRRS eradication programme in Hungary is based on the territorial principle, and it is obligatory for each swine farm irrespective of the number of animals kept there. Hungary has an exceptionally large herd size in large-scale pig farms. Large fattening farms operate as all-in/all-out or continuous flow systems. The large-scale breeding herds are predominantly farrow-to-finish types. In large-scale breeding farms, PRRS eradication was carried out by the depopulation-repopulation method in 33 farms, of which 23 received state compensation, 18 farm units either finished production or changed to producing fatteners only. Two farms used the test and removal method for eradication. One farm was classified as 'vaccinated free'. At this farm the breeding animals are vaccinated continuously but there is no vaccination of the progeny at any age, and the PRRS-free status of the farm is strictly controlled and monitored. By 31 December 2019, all pigs in five euroregions of Hungary had become free from PRRS virus, while the PRRS eradication process is still ongoing in the remaining two regions.",

Curcumin supplementation was performed at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 µM. At concentrations of 5-20 µM, curcumin had significant positive effects (P < 0.05) on maturation and fertilisation rates compared to the non-treated group. Of the groups cultured with 5-20 µM curcumin, the number of oocytes with DNA-fragmented nuclei after IVM was significantly lower than in groups matured without curcumin. Moreover, curcumin supplementation at 10 µM also gave a significantly higher rate of blastocyst formation compared with oocytes matured without curcumin. Increasing the curcumin concentration to 40 µM yielded negative effects on fertilisation and embryonic development compared with the groups treated with lower concentrations of curcumin. Supplementation with 10 µM curcumin had beneficial effects on the oocyte maturation rate and DNA fragmentation index compared to the non-treated group both in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that curcumin supplementation at a suitable concentration (10 µM) is potentially useful for porcine oocyte culture systems, in terms of protecting oocytes from various forms of oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "The role of oxytocin (OT) in the regulation of prostaglandin F 2α (PGF 2α ) secretion during luteolysis in gilts was studied using a highly specific OT antagonist (CAP-581). In Experiment 1 gilts on Days 14 to 19 of the oestrous cycle in Latin square design were used, to determine the dose and time of application of OT and CAP. In Group I (n = 6) gilts were treated intravenously with saline or with 10, 20 and 30 IU of OT. Concentrations of the main PGF 2α metabolite i.e. 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prosta-glandin F 2α (PGFM) were measured in blood samples as uterine response to the treatment. Twenty IU of OT was the most effective to stimulate PGFM release and this dose was used after CAP treatment in gilts of Groups II, III and IV. Gilts of Group II (n = 3) were injected into the uterine horns (UH) with saline (5 ml/horn) or CAP (2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg; half dose/horn) and OT was injected (i.v.) 30 min thereafter. Any of the CAP doses given into the UH affected PGFM plasma concentrations stimulated by OT. In Group III (n = 4) gilts were infused (i.v.) for 30 min with CAP (9 mg, 14 mg and 18 mg/gilt) followed by 20 IU of OT. All doses of CAP effectively inhibited OT-stimulated PGF 2α release, therefore 9 mg was selected for the further studies. Gilts of Group IV (n = 4) received OT 4, 6 and 8 h after CAP to define how long CAP blocks the OT receptors. Concentrations of PGFM increased after any of this period of time. Thus, we concluded that 9 mg of CAP infused every 4 h will effectively block OT receptors. In Experiment 2, gilts (n = 4) received CAP as a 30-min infusion every 4 h on Days 12-20 of the oestrous cycle. Control gilts (n = 3) were infused with saline. CAP infusions diminished the height of PGFM peaks (P &lt; 0.05). Frequency of the PGFM (P &lt; 0.057) and OT (P &lt; 0.082) peaks only tended to be lower in the CAP-treated gilts. Peripheral plasma concentrations of progesterone (P 4 ) and oestradiol-17β (E2) and the time of luteolysis initiation as measured by the decrease of P 4 concentration were the same in CAP-and saline-treated gilts. The macroscopic studies of the ovaries in gilts revealed lack of differences between groups. We conclude that OT is involved in the secretion of luteolytic PGF 2α peaks but its role is limited to controlling their height and frequency. Blocking of OT receptors did not prevent luteolysis in sows.",

Six PCV-2 genomes from Hungarian isolates were completely sequenced. Phylogenetic comparison with all the available PCV-2 sequences showed that porcine circoviruses circulating in Hungary are more variable than in several other European countries. Two Hungarian strains clustered together with the Spanish strains forming a distinct group; two others fell in a common group with the French, UK, and Dutch strains, whereas another two strains showed the closest relationship to two of the three known German PCV-2 sequences.",

The nonabsorbable form of chromium ( 51 Cr 2 O 3 ) and water-soluble and more absorbable Na 2 51 CrO 4 (the hexavalent form of Cr) were compared. Total retention of chromium given orally ranged around 15 percent of the dose, regardless of the chromium compounds applied. The absorption rate of chromic oxide, which is considered a nonabsorbable compound, was 14.4 as a percentage of chromium intake. This result indicates that some loss of chromium has to be taken into account in metabolic trials made by the indicator method. In isolated rat intestine, from the injected Cr 2.5% of chromic oxide and 43.2% of sodium chromate were absorbed during an hour (experiment II). The absorbed chromium was transferred to the liver where the liver tissue retained 10.9% of chromic oxide and 51.1% of sodium chromate. Radioactivity of v. cava caudalis following intestinal injection of Na 2 CrO 4 was thirtyfold greater than after Na 2 CrO 4 dosing. This phenomenon can be explained by the lower blood clearance of chromate. Different absorption rate of chromate depending on the route of administration could be due to the fact that the hexavalent form given orally was reduced to Cr 3+ in the acidic environment of the stomach. When Na 2 CrO 4 was infused directly in the intestine of rats, such reduction could not occur. This means that the acidic gastric juice might play a role in inhibiting the intestinal absorption of Na 2 CrO 4 when this compound is given orally.",

    "abstract": "Animal experiments were carried out with osteoconductive bone substitute beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), with the aim of assessing the effects of the growth factors synthesised by thrombocytes on the speed of beta-TCP incorporation and on the quality of newly formed bone. The question to be answered was the extent to which platelet-rich plasma (PRP) accelerated the resorption of beta-TCP and the formation of new bone. Two teeth were removed symmetrically from each side of the mandible of 12 Beagle dogs; the resulting cavities were filled on one side with beta-TCP alone, and on the other side with a mixture of beta-TCP + PRP (obtained from autologous blood). The quality of the newly formed bone and the effects of this PRP were studied by histological and histomorphometric methods. In week 6, bone formation was already more effective when PRP was applied in comparison with beta-TCP alone, and in week 12 the growth was significantly greater. The results demonstrate that the use of PRP accelerates the remodelling of new bone created by beta-TCP.",

The PennHIP distraction views sent to the PennHIP Analysis Center (PAC) were duplicated, digitalised, and identified with a code, and an adequate computer software was used for DI measurements. One examiner performed two DI measurement sessions, evaluating individually 200 hip joints. The scoring repeatability and reproducibility were estimated calculating the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between the two DI measurement sessions and between the second DI measurement session and the DI in PAC reports, respectively. The ICC for repeatability was 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96 to 0.98], and the ICC for reproducibility was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93 to 0.96). The results suggest that the DI measurement method described is repeatable and can reproduce the PAC reports with confidence. Distraction indices measured in different PennHIP studies, using this DI measurement method and performed by trained researchers, can be considered interchangeable.",

    "abstract": "Leptin (L) is recognised as an important regulator of puberty and a factor which controls reproduction. Whole pig ovarian follicles were incubated with different doses of leptin (2, 20 and 200 ng/ml) added alone or in combination with 100 ng/ml of GH or 50 ng/ml of IGF-I. The expression of the functional long form leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) mRNA was examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in follicular cells cultured with GH or IGF-I. Both GH and IGF-I increased leptin receptor expression in prepubertal pig ovaries. In separate experiments, the action of leptin on ovarian follicular steroidogenesis and cell apoptosis was examined. After 24 h of incubation with leptin alone or in combination with GH or IGF-I, oestradiol (E2) levels were determined in the culture medium while follicular tissue was used for the estimation of caspase-3 activity. Leptin increased E2 secretion and significantly diminished caspase-3 activity at all doses used. Both GH and IGF-I stimulated oestradiol secretion and decreased caspase-3 activity. No differences were demonstrable in oestradiol secretion and caspase-3 activity between cells treated with GH plus leptin and GH alone or cells treated with IGF-I plus leptin as compared to cultures treated with GH or IGF-I alone. However, GH diminished leptin-stimulated oestradiol secretion while IGF-I was without effect on it. Both GH and IGF-I reversed the anti-apoptotic action of leptin. In conclusion, we infer that (1) leptin directly affects ovarian function in prepubertal animals by its action on oestradiol secretion and cell apoptosis, (2) GH and IGF-I modulate the action of leptin, and (3) at least in part, the direct effect of GH/IGF-I on leptin production is due to an action on leptin receptor expression.",

The presence of antibodies to B. caballi was screened with a competitive ELISA. All 29 positive samples came from one region (the Hortobágy). The prevalence of infection did not show correlation with sexes, and reached 100% in the age group of 2–5 years. Babesia canis -specific antibodies were demonstrated by IFAT in 6.74% of animals kept in 7 regions. The titres were low or medium level (1:40 to 1:160), indicating that the horses had previously been exposed to this piroplasm, but their infection must have been limited. The highest seropositivity rate was observed in the age group of 3–4 years, and males (stallions and geldings) were significantly more frequently infected than females. However, neither B. caballi nor B. canis could be identified in the peripheral blood samples of infected horses by PCR. Since most of the B. caballi -positive horses remained negative in the B. canis IFAT, whereas seroconversion solely to B. canis was detected in several regions of the country, serological cross-reaction between the two species can be discounted. This is the first serological evidence of horses being naturally infected with B. canis , supporting the view that piroplasms are less host specific than previously thought.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activities of an ethyl acetate leaf extract of Harungana madagascariensis against the organisms cited, to carry out the phytochemical investigation of this extract and to determine its bioactive chemical class using dilution techniques, the bioautography method and the standard phytochemical method described by Harborne (1973). Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of saponins, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids and anthracenic derivatives. The bioassay showed that the antimicrobial properties may be attributed to astilbin, a flavanone derivative identified on the basis of its spectroscopic data. The results suggest that the extract could be used in an antimicrobial preparation effective against the whole range of organisms incriminated in otitis externa in dogs and cats, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 250 microg/ml.",

Total RNA was purified from non-incubated cells and from cells incubated for 48 h in the absence or presence of luteinising hormone (LH). The semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique, involving coamplification of the target and control cDNA (β-actin or 18S rRNA), was used to examine gene expression. It was found that the genes coding for opioid precursors are expressed in both non-incubated and incubated porcine luteal cells representing the early, mid- and late luteal phase. In non-incubated cells, only POMC mRNA content changed during CL development, whereas the expression of PENK and PDYN genes remained relatively constant. Additionally, the treatment of cells with LH markedly affected the expression of POMC and PENK, but no influence on PDYN expression was observed. The present study indicates that porcine luteal cells may produce opioid peptides and that gene expression of their precursors (except for PDYN) may be modulated in these cells by LH. Moreover, the present results support the involvement of opioid peptides in local regulation within the CL of the pig.",

The strains were recovered from various avian species (goose, duck, Muscovy duck, turkey, chicken and pheasant) and represented different geographic locations in Hungary. Forty-two strains (69%) were identified as P. multocida subsp. multocida and 19 strains (31%) as P. multocida subsp. septica. The strains were grouped into 7 different biovars (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). The most prevalent biovars were 1 (25%), 3 (21%) and 6 (21%). Most of the duck isolates (90%) belonged to biovar 1 or 6. The most frequent capsular type was A (93.5%). Type F represented only a small number (6.5%) of the strains. Other capsular types were not identified. From the 61 isolates 24 different fingerprint patterns were generated by ERIC-PCR assay. Based on cluster analysis the strains could be grouped into four larger and four mini-clusters that showed considerable correlation with the geographical origin and the host species. The results indicate that ERIC-PCR may be a suitable technique for studying the host adaptation of P. multocida and the epidemiology of fowl cholera.",

Intense membranous immunolabelling was found for claudin-1,-3 and-7, intense membranous with non-granular cytoplasmic immunolabelling for claudin-2, moderate membranous immunolabelling for claudin-4 and-5, and weak membranous immunolabelling for claudin-10. The occurrence of tight junctions was confirmed by ultrathin section electron microscopy. The available data suggested that claudins might be proteins preserved throughout the evolution of mammals.

One week before delivery TL (2.32 ± 0.12 g/l, P ≤ 0.05), TG (0.32 ± 0.16 mmol/l, P ≤ 0.001) and TCH concentrations (1.65 ± 0.42 mmol/l, P ≤ 0.05) were significantly increased as compared to non-pregnant goats (2.08 ± 0.28 g/l, 0.15 ± 0.05 mmol/l, 1.38 ± 0.19 mmol/l, respectively). After delivery, the concentrations of TL, TG, TCH and HDL decreased significantly. The lowest TG concentration was observed 2 days after delivery (0.18 ± 0.02 mmol/l), while TL (1.73 ± 0.21 g/l), TCH (0.95 ± 0.21 mmol/l) and HDL (0.74 ± 0.16 mmol/l) reached the lowest level 10 days after delivery. Two days after delivery a significant increase of LDL concentration was observed (0.38 ± 0.04 mmol/l); however, ten days after delivery a threefold decrease was shown in the LDL concentration (0.12 ± 0.04 mmol/l). A month after delivery all the variables studied reached levels similar to those measured in non-pregnant goats.",

    "abstract": "Daidzein, a phytoestrogen present in soybean products used in swine feed, has been demonstrated to affect both reproductive and endocrine functions. The aims of this study were to examine the in vitro effects of daidzein on (1) progesterone (P4) and oestradiol (E2) secretion by porcine luteinised granulosa cells harvested from medium follicles, and (2) the mRNA and protein expression of oestrogen receptors α and β (ERα and ERβ) in these cells. The influence of E2 on P4 secretion and ERα and ERβ expression in the granulosa cells of pigs was also investigated. It was found that daidzein inhibited progesterone secretion by luteinised granulosa cells isolated from medium follicles. In contrast, E2 did not affect progesterone production by these cells. Moreover, daidzein did not alter the granulosal secretion of E2. Both daidzein and E2 decreased mRNA expression of ERα in the cells examined. The expression of ERβ mRNA was not affected by daidzein but was inhibited by E2. ERα protein was not detected while ERβ protein was found in the nuclei of the cells. Daidzein and E2 upregulated the expression of ERβ protein in the cells. In summary, the phytoestrogen daidzein directly affected the porcine ovary by inhibiting progesterone production and increasing ERβ protein expression. Daidzein-induced changes in follicular steroidogenesis and granulosal sensitivity to oestrogens may disturb reproductive processes in pigs.",

Herd-level seroprevalence proved to be 10.2% and bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) was responsible for the seroconversion in seven out of eight cases. In the remaining serum sample the causative virus could not be identified due to a pronounced cross-neutralising activity possibly derived from multiple infections.

    "abstract": "Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) can be classified into distinct groups by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in their genomes. Only a few of these can be associated with a special attribute of the virus. Differences in the ORF30 region can determine the neuropathogenic potential, while by substitutions in the ORF68 region several strain groups can be made. In previous studies no connection was found between the neuropathogenic potential and the SNPs in ORF68, but the occurrence of members of distinct groups in different outbreaks can facilitate epidemiological investigations because the geographical distribution of a particular group is very often specific. The present study aimed at the molecular examination and grouping of 35 EHV-1 strains isolated from aborted equine fetuses in Hungary between 1977 and 2008. Genotyping was based on the comparison of nucleotide sequences of a polymorphic segment located in the ORF68 region, which had previously been found to be a useful tool for classification. After sequencing this region, the Hungarian EHV-1 isolates could be classified into seven groups. Only 23 of the 35 isolates belonged to the formerly described groups, while the SNPs of 12 isolates diverged, and four new groups could be set up. In addition, phylogenetic analysis was performed to compare the ORF68 sequences of the Hungarian strains with the sequences of isolates from Europe, America and Australia. The number of newly formed groups suggests that the further analysis of unknown EHV-1 isolates would involve the emergence of extended numbers of new groups, which can impair the usability of this grouping method.",

Porcine granulosa cells were cultured (48 h) with or without TCDD (100 pM, 100 nM). Steroid hormone concentrations in the medium were determined by radioimmunoassay. The viability of granulosa cells was tested spectrophotometrically (alamarBlue™ assay). Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry using Annexin V and by TUNEL assay. The higher dose of TCDD (100 nM) significantly inhibited P4 and stimulated E2 production by luteinised granulosa cells isolated from medium follicles. The lower dose of TCDD (100 pM) significantly stimulated P4 and inhibited E2 secretion by the cells isolated from preovulatory follicles. None of the two TCDD doses affected cell viability or induced apoptosis in granulosa cells. In conclusion, TCDD directly affected steroid production by granulosa cells obtained from mature pigs, but the effect of TCDD was not due to its cytotoxicity.",

The multiple tumours consisted of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma as well as in situ adenocarcinoma and two adenomas of the gallbladder. The biliary epithelial cells and the cholangiocarcinoma showed membranous cross-immunoreactivity for claudin-7. The gallbladder epithelial cells, its adenoma and adenocarcinoma showed basolateral cross-reactivity for claudin-7. We think that the humanised anti-claudin-7 antibody is a good marker for the detection of different primary cholangiocellular and gallbladder tumours in Bearded dragons. The cholangiocytes, the cholangiocarcinoma, the endothelial cells of the liver and the epithelial cells and gallbladder tumours all showed claudin-5 cross-reactivity. The humanised anti-cytokeratin AE1–AE3 antibody showed cross-reactivity in the biliary epithelial cells, cholangiocarcinoma cells, epithelial cells and tumour cells of the gallbladder. It seems that this humanised antibody is a useful epithelial marker for the different neoplastic lesions of epithelial cells in reptiles. The humanised anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody showed intense cross-reactivity in the smooth muscle cells of the hepatic vessels and in the muscle layer of the gallbladder. The portal myofibroblasts, the endothelial cells of the sinusoids and the stromal cells of the cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder tumours were positive for α-SMA. The antibovine anti-vimentin and humanised anti-Ki-67 antibodies did not show crossreactivity in the different samples from the Bearded dragon.",

At the early stage of infection darkstaining inclusion bodies densely stuffed with some pathogenic agents were located at the centre of the cell, while in a progressive stage of the process inclusion bodies within the host cells were disseminated in the cytoplasm and stained pale. Molecular studies demonstrated three different agents related to Neochlamydia , Protochlamydia and Piscichlamydia based on sequence analysis of short regions of the 16S rRNA gene.

    "abstract": "Eradication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from the pig population of Hungary started in 2014 on the basis of the territorial principle. In order to reach this goal it was crucial to render each fattening unit free of this disease, since fattening units play a significant role in spreading the virus all over the country. In 2015, 188 out of 307 large-scale fattening farms (61.2%) kept PRRS-positive animals. The main source of infection of these farms was the import of PRRS-infected fattening pigs. The following methods were used during the eradication from 2017: (1) Only pigs coming from PRRS-free farms were allowed to be used for fattening in Hungary; (2) Quarantine of all herds for 60 days; (3) PCR test for PRRS 48 hours after the arrival of the prefattening animals; (4) Serological test for PRRS at the end of the quarantine period. If any diagnostic test gave even one positive result and the result was confirmed by another test, the stock had to be sold for slaughter within 15 days or placed outside Hungary, so that the infected stock would not compromise the PRRS status of that area. PRRSV eradication on large-scale fattening units applying all-in/all-out operation was relatively simple, using the depopulation-repopulation method. On permanently operating farms, the infected herd was sold from time to time, without having to be repopulated until the last delivery. After cleaning, disinfection and restocking, the repopulation was done with PRRS-free animals. As the eradication progressed over the years, a ban on the import of infected fattening pigs was imposed. As a consequence of these measures, by the end of 2018, Hungarian large-scale fattening farms became free of PRRS. Maintaining the national-level PRRS-free status of large-scale pig fattening units contributes to eliminating a significant cost factor from the Hungarian pork production industry, and opens the way for a significant reduction in antibiotic consumption as well.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, 223 foxes were collected from various localities in the northern part of the Republic of Serbia (Vojvodina province) and examined for intestinal helminths. Among the examined foxes 178 (79.8%) were infected. The most frequently identified parasites were Mesocestoides spp. (49.3%) and Toxascaris leonina (36.3%). The parasite with the lowest prevalence was Pterygodermatites affinis (0.9%), and this is the first confirmed finding in Serbia. The other recovered species were Alaria alata (25.6%), Taenia spp. (6.3%), Echinococcus multilocularis (13%), Toxocara canis (16.6%) and Uncinaria stenocephala (14.8%). The highest number of foxes infected with E. multilocularis were in the Srem area. The results of this study indicate the presence of helminth species in red foxes in Vojvodina which may also infect humans.",

    "abstract": "This is the first report of Pasteurella multocida type B in Hungarian pigs. This disease was observed in backyard-raised pigs in three households within a small area. Neither the source of the infection nor the epidemiological connection between any of the premises could be determined. The most consistent lesion was dark red discolouration of the skin of the ventral neck and brisket, with accompanying oedema and haemorrhages. The morbidity was low and lethality relatively high, with three dead (50%) and two euthanised (33%) out of six affected animals. A total of three isolates of P. multocida (P55, P56 and P57) were cultured from these cases and examined in detail. These were identified as P. multocida ssp. multocida biovar 3. All were toxA negative and belonged to serotype B:2. Multilocus sequence typing was used to assign these to a new sequence type (ST61) that is closely related to other haemorrhagic septicaemia causing strains of P. multocida regardless of the host. M13 polymerase chain reaction and virulence-associated gene typing also show that type B strains form a highly homogeneous, distinct phylogenic group within P. multocida.",

An endoscopic examination of the respiratory tract including cytology and culture of tracheobronchial secretion and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed, revealing secondary bacterial infection in one case. A suspected diagnosis of EMPF was made on the basis of a positive EHV-5 PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage and the findings of thoracic radiographs and ultrasound examination. In one case the diagnosis was confirmed by lung biopsy. All horses died or had to be euthanised despite treatment. Two horses (from Austria) were diagnosed with EMPF post mortem. They not only had EMPF but also concurrent other diseases which seemed to be associated with immunosuppression. Three horses showed the discrete form and two horses the diffuse form of EMPF. EHV-5 DNA was identified in lung tissue of all horses by PCR.",

Three of them were transplanted into the weight-bearing surface of the contralateral MFC using an arthrotomy approach. Three months later this transplantation procedure was repeated on the opposite stifle joints in the same animals, but at that time transplantation was performed arthroscopically. Follow-up arthroscopy was carried out 12 months after the first operations, and biopsies were taken from both the recipient and the donor sites for histological examination. During follow-up arthroscopy, the transplanted areas looked congruent and smooth. Microscopically, the characteristics of hyaline cartilage were present in 5 out of the 10 biopsies examined; however, in the other half of biopsies glycosaminoglycan (GAG) loss and change in the architecture of the transplanted cartilage was observed. In a 16-year-old horse, all grafts broke during harvesting, and thus transplantation was not performed. No radiological signs of osteoarthritic changes were detected 9 to 12 months after the operations in the donor and recipient joints. Clinically, no lameness or effusion was present three months after the transplantations.",

In G1, the mean serum concentration of cTnI in goat kids was 0.290 ± 0.37 ng/mL, with no statistically significant difference between male and female kids (P = 0.61). The mean cTnI concentration in the does was 0.017 ± 0.04, ng/mL. Serum values of cTnI in the goat kids and in their respective mothers differed significantly (P = 0.0001).

A high prevalence of European eel CV (EeCV) was found in the apparently healthy eel population (35.5%). The copy number of the viral DNA in different organs was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The results suggested that some eel specimens were in active viraemic status despite their asymptomatic condition. Furthermore, a novel, previously undescribed CV was also detected in eel and sichel samples. Full genome characterisation confirmed that the virus represents a novel EeCV species (EeCV-2). The genome contains an integrated eel chromosome-derived fragment, suggesting that the original host of the virus was the eel and it probably emerged subsequently in the sichel by host switching. In some samples, an additional, 1,111-nt-long circular ssDNA was also observed involving a CV-like stem-loop structure and an ORF showing homology to CV capsid protein genes, without any sign of a replication initiator protein sequence.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, the yellow-bellied slider ( Trachemys scripta sp.) is a non-native species in competition with native freshwater turtles. Research on contraception could be useful to control the captive population. Identifying a method of contraception in chelonians would potentially help to control aggression in other chelonian species. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of a single 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate implant on plasma testosterone concentrations in yellow-bellied sliders ( Trachemys scripta sp.). Eleven adult male yellow-bellied sliders were used for the study. Males from the treatment group (n = 6) received a 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate implant, whereas males from the control group (n = 5) did not receive any treatment. All individuals were housed under the same environmental conditions. Testosterone plasma concentrations of the control group and the treatment group were measured at six time points (T0–T6) between April and September. No difference between the control group and the deslorelin treatment group was observed at T0, T2, T3, T4, T5 or T6. However, mean plasma testosterone concentration was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group at T1. This suggests that treatment with a 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate implant has a transient stimulatory effect on the anterior pituitary in yellowbellied sliders without a negative feedback on testosterone production. Further studies with a higher dosage of deslorelin acetate are needed to draw conclusions on its contraceptive effect.",

The range of IC values depending on the period of exposure was 0.31-0.42 μg/ml and 16.6- 22.9 μg/ml for DON and ZEN, respectively, and 101.15 μg/ml for FB1 (50% viability was reached only after 72 h). The main interaction observed was antagonism regarding cytotoxicity. Lower and higher sets of concentrations were used for the genotoxicity (comet assay) experiments. When lower concentrations were used, antagonism was again the main interaction observed. However, at higher concentrations an antagonism was confirmed only for DFZ, whereas for DZ and FZ a synergism was observed. Interactions of DF were inconsistent in different exposure periods in both series of experiments. Further studies with additional endpoints should be performed (e.g. DNA fragmentation, protein synthesis) in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the interactions observed.",

Seventy-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into nine experimental groups. The control diet (AIN-93G formula) and the diets supplemented with 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.8% FA or HA were fed for 26 days. Cu and Zn concentrations of the large intestinal content (LIC), liver, kidney, femur and hair were determined. FA and HA did not influence significantly the Cu or Zn contents of the experimental diets, the rats’ feed intake, weight gain and the feed to gain ratio. Both FA and HA decreased the Cu concentrations of the LIC significantly and in a dose-related manner; however the absorption-stimulating effect of HA was more pronounced. FA increased the Cu content of the liver, but neither FA nor HA had a dose-dependent effect on it. FA or HA supplementations had no significant effect on the Cu concentration of the kidney. At the concentrations used, dietary FA or HA supplementations are not promising growth promoters. FA influences the Cu homeostasis unlike HA, because FA not only stimulates Cu absorption, but the extra quantity of absorbed Cu is retained in the organism. The stimulatory effect of HA on Zn absorption may not be manifested in Cu and Zn homeostasis, because of the tight connection of these microelements to FA and HA, which prevents the transmission of Zn from the ZnHA complex to the organs. As regards the effect of FA and HA on Cu and Zn homeostasis, both FA and HA stimulated the absorption of these microelements, but only FA increased the retention of Cu (in the liver) and Zn (in the kidney).",

Supplementation of ARG and GAA significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased serum nitric oxide (NO) concentration. ARG and GAA supplementation significantly reduced the haematocrit value and the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio in the blood. A significant (P &lt; 0.05) decline in S-wave amplitude of the lead-II electrocardiogram, right to total ventricular weight ratio (RV:TV) and ascites mortality was observed by supplementing ARG or 1.5 g/kg GAA. Addition of ARG and GAA supplements did not significantly change ET-1 and iNOS gene expression in the heart and lung relative to the control. In conclusion, GAA supplementation at 1.5 g/kg had a potential to improve growth performance and could prevent PHS.",

This study was extended with a variety of samples collected from three separate farms with newly identified PEDV in 2018. The recombinant PEDV from 2016 was isolated successfully along with three viruses from 2018, and one isolate from the new cases was used for whole genome determination. Whole genome sequence alignment revealed the highest identity with recombinant Hungarian and Slovenian PEDV within the low-pathogenic European viruses. This suggests that these recombinant PEDV are circulating in this area and may spread to other parts of the continent.",

Therefore, the Pig Strategy of the Government of Hungary prioritises eradication of PRRSV in Hungary. For the first time among the EU Member States, a National PRRS Eradication Programme was introduced in order to reach a more efficient, economical and competitive international market position. Although its significance has decreased in recent decades, 20% of the Hungarian pig population is still kept on small-scale (backyard) farms (< 100 animals). The prevalence of PRRSV in backyard farms was 3.9% at the beginning of the programme. The present paper details the measures applied during the different phases of the programme in backyard farms. During all the phases, serological testing of the breeding animals of the registered small-scale herds was performed, including the highest number of individual animals. Seropositive individuals were tested by PCR and were removed from the backyard farm within the framework of official measures. By sequencing the identified PRRS strains, the possible epidemic relationships between small-scale and large-scale farms were continuously monitored. As a result of the programme, PRRS-free status of the small-scale herds was achieved by the end of 2015, and this status was maintained in 2016-2018.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of uterine prolapse in cows and assess its effects on survival and subsequent fertility. Of 33,450 calving cows considered retrospectively, 216 (0.6%) developed uterine prolapse. A higher prevalence was found in beef cows (n = 57/5,700 cows, 1%) compared to dairy cows (n = 157/27,750 cows, 0.6%). Treatment consisted of cleaning and replacing the uterus with local administration of antibiotics, and applying a harness for uterine containment. The recovery rate was 81.9% (n = 177), similar in dairy (n = 129; 81.1%) and beef (n = 48; 84.2%) cows. Of the 216 cows with uterine prolapse, 18 (8.3%) died before or immediately after treatment; 21 cows (9.7%) were voluntarily culled for economic reasons (low milk yield, low fertility, insufficient weight gain). All recovered dairy cows were artificially inseminated with semen of proven fertility after a voluntary waiting period of 50 days; the beef cows were naturally mated. Among the 172 inseminated/mated cows, 84.7% (n = 150) became pregnant (83.7% dairy cows, 87.5% beef cows), while 15.2% (n = 27) did not conceive. Recurrence of uterine prolapse at subsequent calvings was recorded in one dairy cow. Based upon the data presented here, treated cows with uterine prolapse showed high chances of survival and conception, and a low risk of recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Malassezia pachydermatis is a commonly isolated yeast in veterinary dermatology that can produce biofilms in vitro and in vivo, lowering its susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the in vitro susceptibility of planktonic cells and biofilms of M. pachydermatis isolates to ketoconazole and itraconazole. The presence of biofilm formation was confirmed by crystal violet staining and absorbance measurement at 595 nm wavelength, and by a scanning electron microscopy method. Cell viability was determined by the Celltiter 96 Aqueous One solution assay containing a water-soluble tetrazolium compound (MTS) with absorbance measurement at 490 nm. Planktonic cell minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of ketoconazole and itraconazole were very low: MIC90 and MFC90 were 0.032 and 0.125 μg/ml for ketoconazole, while 0.063 and 0.25 μg/ml for itraconazole, respectively. Also, the half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of itraconazole were higher for planktonic cells and biofilms compared to ketoconazole. The EC50 values of ketoconazole were 18-169 times higher and those of itraconazole 13-124 times higher for biofilms than for planktonic cells. Biofilm EC50 levels exceeded MICs 103-2060 times for ketoconazole and 84-1400 times for itraconazole. No significant difference was found between these values of the two substances. In conclusion, biofilms of all examined M. pachydermatis strains were much less susceptible to ketoconazole and itraconazole than their planktonic forms.",

A total of 96 day-old male chicks (Cobb 500) were randomly assigned into two dietary treatments containing 0 (control group) and 200 mg/kg L-carnitine. The experimental diets were fed for a period of 42 days consisting of the starting (days 1 to 21) and growing periods (days 21 to 42). Nutrient requirements of chickens met the NRC (1994) recommendations. The results showed that dietary L-carnitine had no significant influence on body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. L-carnitine reduced plasma concentration of malondialdehyde, packed cell volume (PCV) and abdominal fat deposition compared to the control (P < 0.05). A significant (P < 0.05) decrease was observed in the right to total ventricular weight ratio (RV:TV) in birds receiving L-carnitine when compared to the control. Supplementation of L-carnitine increased plasma nitric oxide and immune responsiveness, which manifested in an increased toe-web thickness index measured at 24 h following the injection of phytohaemagglutinin P. In conclusion, supplementation of L-carnitine had beneficial effects on preventing lipid peroxidation and pulmonary hypertension in broiler chickens raised at high altitude.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the present study, 64 golden jackals were examined for intestinal helminths in three regions of Vojvodina, Serbia. Among the examined jackals 57.8% were infected with at least one parasite species. Using the intestinal scraping technique (SCT), eight species of intestinal helminths were found: Alaria alata (7.8%), Toxascaris leonina (9.4%), Toxocara canis (4.7%) , Uncinaria stenocephala (20.3%), Echinococcus multilocularis (14.1%), Mesocestoides sp. (42.2%), Taenia pisiformis, and Taenia hydatigena (the overall prevalence of Taenia infection was 6.3%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of T. leonina in jackals from Serbia. In comparison with the SCT results, coprological tests were less sensitive and specific for parasite identification, as only two nematode species ( T . leonina and T . canis ) as well as ancylostomatid and taeniid eggs were identified. The total prevalence of intestinal helminths was higher in males (71.9% males, 45% females), but the difference was not statistically significant ( χ 2 = 3.76; P = 0.052). Co-infection with two species of intestinal helminths was found in 35% of the examined golden jackal individuals, three-species co-infection was demonstrated in 21.6%, whereas four-species co-infection was detected in 2.7% of the golden jackals examined. Echinococcus multilocularis has previously been recorded in jackals and foxes in Serbia, but only in Vojvodina. Our results corroborate the findings of previous studies, and indicate that the Vojvodina Province, more specifically the Srem region, is probably a high-risk area for E. multilocularis transmission to humans.",

    "abstract": "Congenital malformations occur sporadically in cattle; however, congenital structural and functional disorders of the nervous system are rather common in ruminants. Among the numerous causes of congenital nervous system defects, infectious agents are highlighted in this paper. Virus-induced congenital malformations are well known, among which those caused by bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Akabane virus (AKAV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV), Bluetongue virus (BTV), and Aino virus (AV) are the most studied. In this study, we specify and categorise macroscopic and histopathological lesions in the brain of 42 newborn calves suffering from severe neurologic signs and diagnosed with BVDV and AKAV infection. Following a complete necropsy, specimens were collected from the brains to track the presence of BVDV, AKAV and SBV utilising reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Of the 42 examined calves, 21 were BVDV positive and 6 were AKAV positive, while 15 brains were negative for the studied agents. Regardless of the aetiology, cerebellar hypoplasia, hydranencephaly, hydrocephalus, porencephaly, and microencephaly were detected. Cerebellar hypoplasia was the most common lesion seen in both BVDV-positive and AKAV-positive cases. Virus-induced necrosis of the germinative cells of the external granular layer of cerebellum, as well as vascular damages, are believed to be the underlying causes of cerebellar hypoplasia. BVDV was the most important aetiological agent of such cases in this study.",

Infection prevalence, hatching rate, hatching dynamics of fish eggs were quantified, and the study was complemented with histopathology and phylogenetic analyses. We experimentally detected intraspecific differences in the pathogenicity of S. parasitica on rainbow trout eggs. The isolate from rainbow trout eggs was the most virulent to eggs of the same host, whereas isolates from carp skin and fry did not cause as much damage to the eggs. Comparing the outcome of two experimental settings, we confirmed that invasion of fish eggs is more effective by hyphae growth than by the actively moving zoospores. In addition, our findings highlighted that S. parasitica isolates with 100% identical ITS DNA sequences, could differ significantly in virulence. These isolates can be clearly distinguished based on a 650-bp DNA fragment of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit ( RPB2 ) gene.",

As it is recognized to be apathogenic, examinations regarding this species are scarce, compared to other swine mycoplasmas. However, in a few cases, M. hyopharyngis was detected in lesions of different organs. This report presents a case study in which M. hyopharyngis (along with other bacteria) was isolated from the joint of a pig showing lameness. Case presentation A Hungarian farm was repopulated with 250 gilts and 1,700 finishers after undergoing a complete depopulation and disinfection. Two days later, cases of diarrhoea and septicaemia caused by Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were seen in the finishers. At the same time, following the first farrowing, swollen joints were observed in 21–25 days old piglets. Joint samples were collected, and isolation of Mycoplasma sp. and other bacteria was attempted. Analysis of the joint samples revealed the presence of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Aerococcus viridans, Trueperella pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and M. hyopharyngis . Conclusions This is the second isolation of M. hyopharyngis from joints, which highlights the necessity of a better understanding the biology of this often-overlooked species, and its role in the progress of arthritis or other lesions.",

Seventeen bitches with metritis or pyometra were treated with PGF2α. Prostaglandin F2α(150 (g/kg body weight) was administered once or twice daily by infusing 0.3 ml per 10 kg body wt into the vaginal lumen. Bitches were also treated with amoxicillin (15 mg/kg body wt/48 h) and/or gentamicin (4 mg/kg body wt/day) administered as intramuscular (i.m.) injections. Fifteen bitches were treated successfully with intravaginally administered PGF2αfor 3 to 12 days and with intramuscularly administered antibiotics for 4 to 12 days. Success of treatment was judged by cessation of vaginal discharge, the absence of fluid in the uterus as determined by ultrasonography, and the overall health status of the animal. As two bitches with pyometra showed clinical deterioration in spite of medical treatment, ovariohysterectomy was performed after the first and the second treatment, respectively. No side effects (salivation, vomiting, diarrhoea, hyperpnoea, ataxia, urination, anxiety, pupillary dilatation followed by contraction) were observed after PGF2αtreatment. The disease did not recur during the subsequent oestrous cycles within 12 months after the initial treatment. The results demonstrate that intravaginal administration of PGF2αwas effective in 13 dogs (86.6%) with metritis or pyometra, and caused no side effects. Although the study was based on a relatively small number of cases, it is concluded that prostaglandin F2αcan be a useful means of treating bitches with metritis or pyometra. However, in severe cases of pyometra ovariohysterectomy is needed.",

For almost twenty years BoHV-4 has been considered a typical herpes ‘orphan’ virus, which infects several species but causes no illness. The latest experiments revealed the close relationship of this virus with the immune system and other tissues. The virus was even considered as a possible candidate for a vector vaccine. BoHV-4 as a strange herpesvirus has several features which are not characteristic of other herpesviruses, such as several latency sites, persistence in serum, dividing cells necessary for virus replication, and the wide host range. In addition to describing the main features of the virion, replication, clinical signs, nomenclature problems, this review intends to concentrate on the new and strange results coming out from several laboratories worldwide. It is also suggested that because the virus combines several properties of various herpesvirus subfamilies and because of its close relationship with the immune system, it may deserve further attention as a representative of a potentially new genus within the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily.",

The present study found that feed withdrawal and darkening, particularly darkening, at high temperatures during the summer months offer a good management practice to reduce heat stress related depression in feed intake and egg production in laying hens.",

    "abstract": "The influence of fish oil (highly unsaturated) and beef tallow (highly saturated) with vitamin E (100 IU/kg) supplementation on the antioxidant status of broiler chicken cockerels was investigated. Chicks were fed a control diet with no added fat, 40 g/kg each of fish oil and beef tallow diets, respectively, from 11 to 42 days of age. Tocopherol concentration and the rate of lipid peroxidation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) in liver, fatty acid composition of the liver lipids, blood serum total antioxidant status (TAS), and reduced glutathione (GSH) content were determined. Vitamin E supplementation of the diet increased liver alpha-tocopherol content in chicks regardless of the type of dietary fat. Fish oil diet resulted in higher liver TBARS value while beef tallow diet showed lower values compared to the control diet. Vitamin E supplementation reduced liver TBARS as well as serum GSH, and raised serum TAS for all diets. Serum GSH was the same for vitamin E supplemented diets regardless of the fat supplement. Fish oil diets resulted in a significant increase in hepatic lipid n-3 PUFA content. A significant positive correlation was found between liver TBARS and n-3 PUFA content. No relationships were established, however, between liver TBARS and n-6 PUFA or saturated fatty acids. The results suggest that feeding oils rich in n-3 PUFA increases tissue concentration of these fatty acids, consequently increasing tissue lipid peroxidation and reducing the antioxidative status of broiler chickens. Supplementing high levels of vitamin E with such oils may increase tissue oxidative stability. Serum TAS or GSH may be used as a measure of antioxidative status in chickens.",

The aim was to estimate the prevalence of different urogenital tract lesions, and to provide sensitivity and specificity estimates for macroscopic and bacteriological examinations in the diagnosis of urocystitis and endometritis. Furthermore, the association between endometritis and urocystitis was assessed. The prevalence of main lesions of the urogenital tract was similar to that reported in other studies. The 'sensitivity' of macroscopic and bacteriological methods was determined statistically by taking histopathology as the 'Gold Standard'. As a result, the 'sensitivity' of macroscopic methods for the diagnosis of endometritis and urocystitis was ≤ 18.1% and 47.9%, respectively, while the 'sensitivity' of bacteriology for the diagnosis of the same conditions was ≤ 31.8% and 63.0%, respectively. The presumed positive association between urocystitis and endometritis was confirmed; it was not confounded by parity. Animals affected by urocystitis had a 3.5 times higher odds to simultaneously have endometritis than animals without urocystitis.",

    "abstract": "Leptin and leptin receptor were studied in the mammary gland of non-pregnant dry and lactating cows. Using RT-PCR it was demonstrated that leptin and its short (Ob-Ra) and long (Ob-Rb) receptor isoforms are expressed both in the dry and the lactating mammary gland tissue. Tissue distribution of leptin and its receptor mRNA transcripts were examined by in situ hybridisation, while the leptin protein was localised by immunohistochemistry. Although in situ hybridisation is semiquantitative, our morphological data suggest that the epithelial leptin mRNA expression of the lactating gland is higher than that of the dry gland. To compare the leptin mRNA levels between dry and lactating udders competitive PCR was used, which showed no difference in leptin expression for the whole mammary tissues. The lack of difference in total leptin mRNA levels is explained by the high adipose tissue content of the dry mammary gland. Leptin and its receptor transcripts are expressed mainly in the epithelial cells of lactating cows, while in dry mammary tissue the signal is found in the stromal tissues as well. The results provide additional evidence that locally produced leptin takes part in the regulation and maintenance of mammary epithelial cell activity.",

    "abstract": "An outbreak of the atypical form of myxomatosis struck a rabbit farm in Hungary. The animals had previously been vaccinated with a vaccine containing Shope rabbit fibroma virus strain. The disease appeared in winter when the presence of mosquitoes and fleas is not common. The virus was isolated from an eyelid specimen of a naturally infected rabbit. The surviving animals were observed for four weeks, blood samples were collected and, after euthanasia, organ specimens were also examined by morphological methods including pathology and electron microscopy. Serum samples were examined by virus neutralisation for antibodies. Genetic analysis of the isolated virus was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The primers were designed on the basis of the major envelope gene (Env) of the Lausanne reference strain in the GenBank. The viral proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE. The isolated virus (ref. no.: BP04/2001) was able to infect the susceptible animals directly, by contact. The disease was characterised by respiratory symptoms of the upper tracheal tract, conjunctivitis and high mortality by the 11th-14th day. Aerogenic infection with strain BP04/2001 resulted in 100% morbidity among the susceptible animals. Sequencing of the amplified 400-bp-long DNA revealed 97% homology with the Env gene of the Lausanne strain, which proves that strain BP04/2001 is a variant of the Lausanne strain having been enzootic throughout Europe. The live vaccine strain used in Hungary against myxomatosis, which is also a Lausanne-derived strain, protected the animals. According to the protein analysis a protein of 200 kDa in size is not expressed in strain BP04/2001. This is the first report on atypical myxomatosis in Central Europe. The virus spreads by airborne transmission and may cause severe losses in the rabbit population.",

After a four-week training period 8-week-old rabbits were slaughtered and the total activity of plasma lactate dehydrogenase was measured, showing a significant difference between the exercised and control groups (429 ± 126 IU/l vs. 639 ± 203 IU/l). Furthermore the fatty acid composition of m. longissimus dorsi (MLD) and m. vastus lateralis (MVL) was determined by means of gas chromatography. Exercise increased the proportions of oleic acid (C18:1 n-9) in both MLD and MVL as compared to the control group. However, the level of stearic (C18:0) and arachidonic (C20:4 n-6) acids significantly decreased in the MVL after the exercise. Changes in the fatty acid profile resulting from the physically loaded condition were of the same tendency in both muscles, adding that the MVL might have been exposed to the exercise more intensively; alterations there occurred in a more pronounced manner. Based on the inference that the composition of membrane structure was also affected, these alterations may have important consequences on meat quality.",

Clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic examinations were done at 0 and 10 minutes, in the 2nd and 16th hour, and on the 7th day. They included a detailed physical examination of the mucous membranes, cardiorespiratory system and abdominal organs. Laboratory examinations of the blood consisted of a complete blood count, determination of packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb), total plasma protein (TPP), parameters of haemostasis including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and enzyme activities reflecting hepatobiliary function, i.e. aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Ultrasonographic findings of the gallbladder (size, shape, wall, content) and appearance of the biliary tract and the surrounding cranial intraabdominal organs were also evaluated. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was performed easily during the study, and dogs tolerated well the procedure performed without anaesthesia. All laboratory parameters of the blood remained within normal limits throughout the study. However, some follow-up values, i.e. PCV, TPP, APTT and ALT, demonstrated statistically significant differences when compared to baseline measurements, which might reflect the effect of 24-hour fasting before the experiment, as well as day-to-day metabolic fluctuations due to feeding and water supply during the study. There were no visible signs of bleeding from the liver, bile leakage from the gallbladder or accumulation of free peritoneal fluid during repeated ultrasonographic examinations. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis seems to be an important diagnostic procedure in canine gallbladder diseases and can be used safely and easily to gain gallbladder bile for diagnosis of bacterial cholecystitis or for investigating hepatobiliary function in the dog.",

All tested pigs (n = 138) were individually weighed at birth, at weaning, at moving to the growing/finishing unit, and at slaughtering. The extent (grade) of turbinate atrophy and lung consolidation attributable to pneumonia was determined in each pig at slaughter. A negative correlation was found between birth weight and the prevalence of nasal lesions at slaughter, suggesting that pigs born with smaller weight may be more susceptible to AR. The growth performance of the pigs also showed a negative correlation with the degree of turbinate atrophy. In the nursery period, the average daily gain (ADG) of pigs with moderate/severe turbinate atrophy was 13.3% lower than that of animals with healthy snouts. In the finishing period, pigs with mild AR lesions had an ADG reduction of 6.2%, while pigs with severe AR lesions had a significant, 9.4% reduction in ADG as compared to the AR-free pigs. The extent of weight gain reduction over the whole life cycle was very similar (approximately 6%) in the pigs having either AR or pneumonia alone. In those pigs where both respiratory diseases were present, their effects seemed to be added up (11.5%); however, nasal lesion scores and percentage of lung consolidation did not show statistically apparent interactive effects on growth performance.",

    "abstract": "The oesophageal tonsil of the chicken is a novel member of the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which is located around the entrance of the proventriculus. It consists of 6 to 8 single units, which are surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule. Each one is organised around the bottom of the longitudinal folds of the oesophagus, and serves as a 'tonsillar crypt'. Stratified squamous epithelium is infiltrated by lymphoid cells, i.e. T cells, plasma cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, but not B cells, to form lymphoepithelium (LE). In the LE vimentin-, MHC II- and ATPase-positive cells possibly represent Langerhans' cells, but the appearance of 74.3 positive cells in the LE is unusual, because the 74.3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognises chicken follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centre and medulla of the bursal follicles. The subepithelial lymphoid tissue is organised into T- and B-dependent regions, which are the interfollicular areas and the germinal centres, respectively. Existence of high-endothelial venules in the interfollicular region suggests an extensive cellular connection between the oesophageal tonsil and the other lymphoid organs. In the resting oesophagus the lumen is closed, but during swallowing a bolus the crypt opens and the lymphoepithelium can be exposed to undigested food, antigens, infectious agents and vaccines. The location of the oesophageal tonsil, cranial to the stomach, may provide this organ with a unique role as compared to the other parts of the MALT; namely, it may contribute to the replication of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and/or the pathogenesis of infectious bursal disease.",

Fever and parasitised red blood cells were detected for three days after imidocarb treatment in the splenectomised animals. Haematological abnormalities included regenerative anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (due to neutropenia and lymphopenia) in the acute phase, soon followed by leukocytosis, neutrophilia and left shift a few days later. Acute hepatopathy was detected in all dogs with elevated ALT activity, which was more seriously altered in the splenectomised dogs. Diffuse changes in liver structure and hepatomegaly were seen by ultrasonography. Liver biopsy and histology revealed acute, non-purulent hepatitis in the splenectomised dogs. Both splenectomised dogs were successfully cured after collection of 400 ml highly parasitised blood, proving that large-amount antigen production is possible with rescuing the experimental animals. Whole blood transfusion, imidocarb and supportive care with infusions, antipyretics, glucocorticoids and diuretics were applied. The spleen-intact dog clinically recovered after receiving supportive treatment, with no imidocarb therapy. Microbial infections developed in both splenectomised animals (BSE: haemobartonellosis, CSE: osteomyelitis caused by Escherichia coli), probably as a consequence of immunosuppression after splenectomy and glucocorticoid therapy.",

The pathogenesis of infection in experimentally infected turkeys and chickens, as well as the usefulness of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/sequencing method for epidemiological investigation and for the differentiation of vaccine and field strains of THEV was also studied. Since the first recognition of the disease in Hungary in the late 1970s, until recently the disease has been diagnosed sporadically in its mild form. In the last few years (2000–2005), however, the number of outbreaks and the severity of the disease increased (9–23 affected flocks/year). Most of the outbreaks occurred at the age of 6 to 8 weeks and was complicated with Escherichia coli infection. The antibody levels to THEV in turkey flocks gradually declined till 5–7 weeks of age, and then they increased sharply due to natural infection with THEV. The immune response to vaccination (at 5 weeks of age) showed no significant antibody level increase one week postvaccination, but four weeks later the antibody level reached high values and then remained at this high level. The agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test to detect turkey adenovirus A (TAdV-A) antigen and PCR methods for THEV-specific DNA gave similarly positive results if spleens with pathognomonic lesions were tested; however, PCR proved to be more sensitive in cases with less characteristic pathological lesions. Nucleotide sequence alignment of PCR products amplified from Hungarian field strains and the Domermuth vaccine strain and that of the published THEV hexon sequences in GenBank database revealed slight differences between the sequences.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) features of the ovine interdigital sinus. The lumen was filled with a dense secretory material and quite a number of hairs embedded in the luminal content. For SEM purposes, the sinus was divided into three parts: base, body and neck. At the cut surface, the wall exhibited significant folds which were almost absent in the base, the very short blind end of the sinus. The wall had three layers: epidermis, dermis and fibrous capsule. Stratified epithelium with a prominent keratin layer faced the lumen. The inner surface was similar to the skin surface; however, it was coarser due to folds. The fibrous capsule was composed mainly of dense connective tissue, constituting the outermost layer of the wall. The dermis contained common skin structures including sebaceous glands, hair follicles, arrector pili muscles and apocrine glands. Sebaceous glands appeared as groups of bubbles if they were not collapsed. Apocrine glands generally appeared as a group of coiled tubules. They frequently exhibited apocrine blebs, which is a feature of apocrine secretion. SEM was able to locate some secretory vesicles in the lumen of apocrine tubules which is frequently filled by secretory content. Thus, the apocrine tubules exhibited classical features of apocrine secretion.",

Male Bilgoraj geese were fed diets containing grass meal (with low phytoestrogen levels) and those containing alfalfa meal and soybean meal (with higher levels of phytoestrogens). Testes were obtained from ganders at the peak of mating and the ongoing laying period as well as at the beginning of photorefractoriness. The morphometric parameters were measured in frozen testicular sections. Blood was collected monthly from December to June, and plasma testosterone, androstenedione and corticosterone concentrations were determined. During the mating season, semen was collected and its quantity and quality were investigated. In the flocks (ganders with geese) reproductive output was noted. Seasonal changes were observed in the morphology of testes and in plasma testosterone, androstenedione and corticosterone concentrations in ganders. The feeding of ganders with dietary meals containing higher levels of phytoestrogens did not affect the plasma steroid contents or the majority of the morphometric parameters of testes, except for the height of the seminiferous epithelium, which was lowered. Moreover, diets with higher levels of phytoestrogens decreased the volume of ejaculates and the percentage of normal spermatozoa. However, these changes were not reflected in the fertilisation rates.",

In the present work, thyroid hormone serum concentrations, hepatic deiodinase enzyme activities and hepatic deiodinase mRNA expression were examined after feed restriction and fasting. We demonstrate that during energy restriction, T 3 concentration is lowered due to a decreased T 4 activation and increased T 3 inactivation. We show that hepatic type-I deiodinase (D1) is not affected by energy restriction, however, hepatic D2 is decreased on both transcriptional and enzyme activity levels. Furthermore, hepatic D3 is increased after feed restriction in the liver. We also show that the hypothalamic feedback is not involved in the changes in serum T 3 and T 4 concentrations. Our data indicate that D2 enzyme contributes to the special hormone-exporting role of the chicken liver and this enzyme can be modulated by feed restriction.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to give insight into the lesser known action of neutrophils in the course of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Neutrophils are principally involved in resistance to infection but under certain conditions these cells participate in lung injury. TNFalpha and IL-8, primary cytokines which play an essential role in neutrophil activation during the inflammatory process, may lead not only to host defence reaction but also to destructive responses. Neutrophil constituents, such as elastase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) and superoxide among others, contribute to tissue destruction. Also, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), the potent activator of neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation, can cause lung injury. This study revealed that neutrophils under the influence of TNFalpha exacerbated the release of elastase, MPO, ALKP and superoxide. IL-8, in turn, triggered those neutrophils which were isolated from heifers suffering from BRD, and released elastase, ALKP and 5-oxo-ETE, but not MPO or superoxide (O2(-)). The most pronounced degranulative response was observed in the acute form of BRD and a lesser response was seen in the chronic form. The secretory action of neutrophils varied not only depending on the form and phase of the disease but it also diminished successively during recovery.",

The advantages of oral vaccines of this new type are that they induce mucosal, humoral, cellular and protective immunity, they are cheaper, easier to store, distribute and administer, they do not require cold chain management, and some species can be stored for long periods of time without any spoilage and may be administered as purified proteins. Owing to these benefits, plant-produced vaccines represent a valuable option for animal health. The aim of this paper is to present a review of plant-produced vaccines against viruses affecting domestic animals. Some aspects of the feasibility of their use and the immune response elicited by such vaccines are also discussed, as the balance between tolerance and immunogenicity is a major concern for the use of plant-based vaccines.",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate the relationship between carbon dioxide tensions in the venous blood of young chickens and ascites susceptibility, one hundred dayold chickens from two pure broiler breeder lines differing in susceptibility to ascites syndrome were obtained and reared at low environmental temperature. Weekly, blood samples were taken for the determination of blood gas parameters and plasma thyroid hormone levels. Dead birds were examined for lesions of ascites daily and all survived birds were autopsied at the end of the trials. In cold conditioning, the cumulative incidence of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and ascites was 78% (39/50) in fast-growing (line A) and 50% (25/50) in slow-growing (line B) chickens, confirming that line A chickens had higher susceptibility to ascites than line B chickens. At 12 days of age, the mean pCO 2 tension was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in the venous blood of line A than line B chickens. During the experiment, the majority of line A and line B chickens showing RVH and ascites exhibited pCO 2 tensions equal to, or exceeding 50 mmHg at 12 days of age. Additionally, fast-growing chickens showed significantly lower plasma T3 and T4 concentrations than slow-growing chickens. In conclusion, our data indicate that carbon dioxide pressure in the venous blood of early postnatal broiler chickens could be used as a valuable predictor in the selection of birds susceptible to pulmonary hypertension and ascites. The function of thyroid hormones should also be taken into consideration in further selection procedures for meat-type chickens.",

This concept was based upon a previous report showing a marked decline in ELISA values in experimentally infected and antibiotic-treated ponies. Changes in Lyme serology following antibiotic treatment in naturally infected horses have not been reported. The objective of this study was to compare Borrelia ELISA antibody concentrations in naturally exposed horses both before and following antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. A retrospective study was performed comparing oxytetracycline- or doxycyclinetreated (n = 68) and untreated (n = 183) horses from a single equine practice and their change in Borrelia ELISA values over a similar time period. Antibiotictreated horses had a decline in ELISA values in comparison to control horses (P ≤ 0.05) and untreated horses were twice as likely to have their ELISA values increase (OR = 0.5; 95% C.I. = 0.3-0.9) compared to treated horses. The magnitude of the decline in ELISA units following treatments was small compared to that previously reported in experimentally infected and treated ponies. Field-exposed horses with high Borrelia burgdorferi ELISA values who are treated with either oxytetracycline or doxycycline can be expected to have only a small decline in ELISA values following treatment. Persistently high ELISA titres following appropriate treatments for Lyme disease may not, without appropriate clinical signs, be a reason for more prolonged treatment.",

TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2α (PGM) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed. Area under the curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values of inflammatory mediators were determined by a pharmacokinetic computer programme. When inflammatory mediator concentrations were compared between the LPS group and other groups for each sampling time, the three macrolides had no pronounced depressor effect on cytokine levels, but they depressed PGM and CRP levels. In addition, tylosin and tilmicosin decreased the AUC0-24 level of TNF, while tilmicosin decreased the AUC0-24 level of IL-10. Tylosin and tulathromycin decreased the AUC0-24 of PGM, and all three macrolides decreased the AUC0-24 of CRP. Especially tylosin and tulathromycin may have more expressed anti-inflammatory effects than tilmicosin, via depressing the production of inflammatory mediators in the lung. The AUC may be used for determining the effects of drugs on inflammation. In this study, the antiinflammatory effects of these antibiotics were evaluated with kinetic parameters as a new and different approach.",

Cows with high SCC (200,000 to 500,000) had a higher incidence of prolonged luteal phase (P &lt; 0.01) than cows with an SCC of 50,000 to 100,000.

In this study, a polymerase chain reaction- (PCR-) based approach for precise species identification was developed and also applied to faecal DNA diagnosis of the tapeworm infection. Since nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) appears to be a useful target for species and/or strain markers, the 18S regions of the rDNA of M. benedeni and M. expansa were amplified and sequenced. The lengths and GC contents of the regions sequenced were 2476–2487 bp and 51.9–52.1% for M. benedeni and 2473 bp and 51.9–52.0% for M. expansa , respectively. Alignment and comparison of the 18S sequences of the two species showed 92.5–93.3% homology. No matches for the 18S regions of M. benedeni and M. expansa were found with other species by BLAST search, which made the 18S sequences appropriate markers for the design of distinctive primers for the two Moniezia species. Our 18S-based PCR could detect as low levels as 0.5 pg genomic DNA or the DNA extracted from 0.2 g faecal sample collected from the rectum of an M. expansa -infected goat. The results indicate that this PCR approach is a reliable alternative for the differential diagnosis of Moniezia species in faecal samples.",

    "abstract": "Bovine prion diseases are composed of two types of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), classical BSE and atypical BSE. Recent studies have identified one case of atypical BSE with an E211K mutation. E211K is homologous to the human E200K mutation, which is related to familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), one of the familial forms of human prion diseases. To date, familial forms of prion diseases have not been reported in non-human animals. Because the familial forms of human prion diseases account for more than 10% of all human prion disease cases, the detection of the E211K mutation in healthy cattle is very important for verifying the role of this mutation as a familial form of BSE. To detect putative mutations related to familial BSE, specifically E211K in Korean native cattle (Hanwoo) and Korean dairy cattle (Holstein), we performed direct sequencing targeting codon 211 and the adjacent regions of the bovine prion protein (PRNP) gene in 384 Hanwoo and 152 Holstein cattle. We did not find the E211K mutation in any of the Korean cattle. Although we did not find the E211K mutation in Korean native cattle, E211K is a postulated mutation; therefore, further screening in other countries and larger samples is highly desirable.",

Seven animals were operated on and two survived. Gastric torsion has been noted in many mammalian species. Gastric volvulus has a high morbidity and high mortality rate with a guarded to poor prognosis in all of these species. How GDV develops is still not widely understood. Postmortem examinations, in both our cases and previously reported cases, have failed to reveal the exact causes of the gastric torsions. The aetiology of gastric torsion in guinea pigs is probably multifactorial. Feeding fewer meals per day, eating rapidly, decreased food particle size, exercise, stress after a meal, competition, age, and an aggressive or fearful temperament, are all likely and potential risk factors for GDV development in a similar fashion to dogs. Sex, breeding, dental diseases, anatomical abnormalities, pain and pregnancy may also be contributing factors.",

The aim of our study was to identify associated pathologic brain lesions possibly serving as aetiological triggers in this condition. Therefore, the formalin-fixed and paraffin waxembedded brain tissue of 35 cats diagnosed with hippocampal necrosis or sclerosis was examined retrospectively. In 26 cats inflammatory infiltrates could be found in the hippocampus or adjacent brain regions. Fifteen out of these animals demonstrated mild to moderate infiltrations by lymphocytes and complement deposition in the hippocampus similar to human limbic encephalitis, seven showed unspecific, predominantly non-suppurative inflammation, and two demonstrated suppurative inflammation of the hippocampus or adjacent brain regions. Additionally, one cat was diagnosed with central nervous manifestation of feline infectious peritonitis virus and another one with cerebral Toxoplasma gondii infection. Intracranial neoplasia was present in five cases altogether. Three of them comprised meningioma which was present additionally to lesions resembling limbic encephalitis in two cases, and a dentate gyrus alteration in one case. The other two tumour-associated cases comprised oligodendroglioma. Structural alterations of the dentate gyrus together with hippocampal sclerosis were encountered in three cases in total. Besides the case associated with a meningioma, one case demonstrated lesions resembling limbic encephalitis. A vascular infarct in the temporal lobe was encountered in one cat. In four cases no lesions other than hippocampal necrosis or sclerosis were found. The involvement of feline immunodeficiency virus infections, which may be able to produce hippocampal lesions, was not encountered in the cats examined.",

    "abstract": "Among the wild canids, the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) is recognised as an important reservoir species for a range of parasites, including cardiopulmonary nematodes of public health and veterinary importance. As cross-host transmission between the red fox and domestic carnivores can play an important role in the epizootiology of cardiopulmonary parasitic diseases, the aim of the present investigations was to obtain data on the geographical distribution of cardiopulmonary nematodes of the red fox. The material for examination consisted of 83 foxes which were legally hunted at different locations during a three-month period from December 2017 to February 2018. The presence of four emerging species in Europe ( Angiostrongylus vasorum, Crenosoma vulpis, Dirofilaria immitis and Eucoleus aerophilus ) was revealed in red foxes of Serbia. Crenosoma vulpis and E. aerophilus were detected in foxes in both the plain and the mountainous areas across the country. Dirofilaria immitis is distributed in red foxes near alluvial rivers in Vojvodina province (northern Serbia). Angiostrongylosis caused by A. vasorum was demonstrated to exist in two enzootic foci with a high percentage of infected foxes in a plain area of northern Serbia. To the best of our knowledge, C. vulpis and A. vasorum were discovered for the first time in red foxes in central Serbia. The results provide strong evidence for veterinarians to take into consideration the parasitic nematodes discovered in red foxes in the differential diagnosis of diseases of companion animals. In the context of the ‘One Health’ approach the results related to the distribution of the zoonotic species E. aerophilus and D. immitis can be useful for medical epidemiology.",

Escherichia coli and enterococcal isolates were recovered from faecal samples of 49 wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) on specific media and were characterised using biochemical and molecular tests. For all isolates, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed, and resistance genes were detected by PCR. Molecular typing of isolates was carried out by pulsed-field gel-electrophoresis, and E. coli strains were also tested for the presence of intimin (eae) gene characteristic of rabbit enteropathogenic E. coli. A total of 34 E. coli and 36 enterococci [E. hirae (52.8%) and E. faecalis (47.2%)] were obtained. For E. coli, resistance to tetracycline (94%), streptomycin (62%), ciprofloxacin (47%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (35%) and chloramphenicol (6%) was observed. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was detected in one E. coli strain that carried the blaCMY-2 and blaTEM-1 genes. Class 1 integrons were detected in eight isolates. For enterococci, resistance to tetracycline (63.9%), erythromycin (30.5%), streptomycin (18.2%), and chloramphenicol (5.5%) was detected. The tet(M)+tet(L), erm(B) and ant (6)-Ia genes were identified in thirteen, seven and three resistant Enterococcus strains, respectively. Molecular typing showed a high diversity among our strains. Wild rabbits could represent a reservoir of E. coli, and enterococci carrying antimicrobial resistance genes and E. coli additionally carrying the eae gene of enteropathogenic pathotypes could both contaminate the environment. our finding seems to represent the first report of eae-positive E. coli in wild rabbits.",

After 21 days, the chickens were euthanised and the kidneys removed for analysis by histopathology and immunohistochemistry to detect an anti-apoptotic marker (Bcl-2), and by transmission electron microscopy. Macroscopically the kidneys were enlarged, showing degeneration and gout deposits. Histologically, glomerulonephrosis and tubulonephrosis were common lesions in all chicks. In two of the five chicks exposed to OTA for 21 days, focal tubular cell proliferation, multiple adenoma-like structures and Bcl-2-positive epithelial cells were identified in layers of the renal papilla and in convoluted tubules. Transmission electron microscopy of the proximal convoluted tubules identified abnormal forms of mitochondria. The nephrotoxic effect of ochratoxicosis in chickens is probably due to carcinogenic changes induced in the epithelial tissues.",

Data of a total of 2,543 canine uroliths analysed in the laboratory of the Budapest Urolith Centre were evaluated retrospectively from 2001 to 2012. Logistic regression was used to assess odds ratios for the proportion of each affected breed compared to those of crossbreeds. The annual incidence of urolithiasis was evaluated by the number of submissions compared to the estimated number of dogs in the population from which the samples originated. Epidemiologic data revealed a relatively high and increasing proportion of struvite urolithiasis. Statistical analysis of breed predispositions resulted in the detection of breeds not having been reported at risk (e.g. Bernese Mountain dog - struvite, Bichon Frise, Bolognese, Tibetan Terrier - purine, French Bulldog - cystine). Conflicting results were revealed for some other breeds previously described as being affected by certain types of urolithiasis (Chihuahua, Pekingese, Shih Tzu, English Cocker Spaniel). Regardless of the type of urolithiasis, its average cumulative incidence in the dog population of Hungary was found to be 1.76/10,000/year.",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastids are flagellated protozoa, including principally free-living bodonids and exclusively parasitic trypanosomatids. In the most species-rich genus, Trypanosoma , more than thirty species were found to infect bats worldwide. Bat trypanosomes are also known to have played a significant role in the evolution of T. cruzi , a species with high veterinary medical significance. Although preliminary data attested the occurrence of bat trypanosomes in Hungary, these were never sought for with molecular methods. Therefore, amplification of an approx. 900-bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of kinetoplastids was attempted from 307 ixodid and 299 argasid ticks collected from bats, and from 207 cimicid bugs collected from or near bats in Hungary and Romania. Three samples, one per each bat ectoparasite group, were PCR positive. Sequencing revealed the presence of DNA from free-living bodonids ( Bodo saltans and neobodonids), but no trypanosomes were detected. The most likely source of bodonid DNA detected here in engorged bat ectoparasites is the blood of their bat hosts. However, how bodonids were acquired by bats, can only be speculated. Bats are known to drink from freshwater bodies, i.e. the natural habitats of B. saltans and related species, allowing bats to ingest bodonids. Consequently, these results suggest that at least the DNA of bodonids might pass through the alimentary mucosa of bats into their circulation. The above findings highlight the importance of studying bats and other mammals for the occurrence of bodonids in their blood and excreta, with potential relevance to the evolution of free-living kinetoplastids towards parasitism.",

Pregnancy was confirmed by transrectal palpation between days 57-70 after AI and at the time of drying-off as well. Twin pregnancy rate was 8.4% at the time of the early pregnancy examination. Pregnancy loss did not differ between singleton- and twin-carrying animals either between days 57-70 of gestation or at drying-off. More losses occurred in singletons between days 29-42 and 57-70 in cows with cavitary than in cows with noncavitary CL (12.1% vs. 3.6%; P < 0.05) and in cows with double CL than in cows with single CL (7.3% vs. 3.6% %; P < 0.05). Between days 57-70 of gestation and drying-off this difference was still significant (20.7% vs. 3.7%; P < 0.001), while it was non-significant between cows with one CL (5.7%) vs. double CL (3.7%). Cavity occurrence was not affected by hormone therapy prior to AI (either PGF2α or OvSynch; 4.4% vs. 5.4%, respectively); however, the number of CL was reduced by the treatments (11.6 vs. 19.6%; P < 0.0005).

Altogether eight different treatments were compared. sperm viability before freezing and after thawing was examined by in vitro tests and, in the case of the simplest effective method, also by in vivo fertility test. There were no significant differences in sperm survival either in the dynamic (48–50%) or in the static protocol (43–46%), except for the treatment where the lowest DMF concentration was used without any osmoprotectant in the dynamic protocol (42.6%). The addition of osmoprotectants did not improve thawed sperm viability in any case. Fertility with frozen/thawed sperm using the simplest method was 58.5%, while that obtained with fresh, diluted semen was 66.9%. The study proved that the simple freezing of gander semen in nitrogen vapour with 9% DMF in cryovials could produce acceptable fertility.

Virulence-related genes associated with attaching and effacing E. coli ( eae , Stx1 , Stx2 ) and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli – ExPEC – ( papC , hlyA and cnf1 ) were detected by PCR. At least one kind of AMR was observed in 73% of the isolates. The highest prevalences corresponded to penicillin (45%), aminoglycoside (40%) and non-extended spectrum cephalosporin (39%) classes. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 53.4% of the resistant isolates. No resistance to colistin was found. Production of ESBL/AmpC enzymes was detected in 5% of E. coli . Shiga toxin-producing E. coli were not observed, enteropathogenic E. coli were identified in only 12% of them, and ExPEC were found in 25%. Dog faeces can be a source of E. coli strains potentially presenting a threat to humans through their virulence factors or AMR. The non-hygienic keeping of animals may increase the risk of colonisation of such pathogens in humans.",

Here we report the partial sequence of a putative novel parvovirus obtained from a dead checkerboard worm lizard (Trogonophis wiegmanni) that had been wild-caught in its native habitat. An in-house-developed PCR with consensus primers targeting the gene of the parvoviral capsid protein was used. Other PCRs, intended to detect certain large DNA viruses, remained negative. The sequence of the PCR product indicated the presence of a hitherto unknown parvovirus in the internal organs of the checkerboard worm lizard. In phylogeny reconstruction, the novel sequence clustered with the members of the Dependovirus genus of the Parvoririnae subfamily, closest to the branch of snake adeno-associated virus. Since we could not demonstrate the presence of a potential helper virus, the putative amphisbaenian parvovirus supposedly can replicate autonomously. This is the first virus infection ever detected in any members of the suborder Amphisbaenia, and only the third parvoviral sequence obtained from any reptilian host.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of a single oral dose of T-2 and HT-2 toxin at 0.15, 0.33 and 1.82 mg kg −1 body weight, or deoxynivalenol (DON) and 15-acetyl-DON at 0.13, 0.31 and 1.75 mg kg −1 body weight in common carp. Conjugated dienes and trienes (the early markers of lipid peroxidation) were elevated in all DON-treated groups at the 16th hour, while thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS; termination marker) were increased at the highest dose of DON at the 16th and 24th hours. T-2 toxin did not cause changes in these parameters. Glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activity showed higher levels at the 16th hour as the effect of both mycotoxins. The expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPx4) genes ( gpx4a and gpx4b ) revealed a dual response. Downregulation was observed at the 8th hour, followed by an induction at the 16th hour, at the lowest dose of both mycotoxins. Higher doses revealed long-drawn emergence and an elevation was observed only at the 24th hour. However, at the lowest and highest doses of DON or T-2 toxin the changes in gene expression were delayed, which may be related to the low oxidative stress response, as suggested by the expression profiles of the nrf2 , keap1 , gpx4a and gpx4b genes.",

    "abstract": "The recommended use of doxycycline (DC) to broiler chicken is 100 mg/L via the drinking water and a 7-day withdrawal time (WDT). However, study of a higher dosage is desirable because of the possible increase of antimicrobial resistance and disease spectrum. Tissue DC residues exceeding the current maximum residue levels (MRL) was our major concern. Therefore, serum concentration and tissue depletion of DC hyclate after administration of 200 mg/L of DC in the drinking water for five consecutive days were studied. The steady-state DC concentration (8.3 ± 0.9 μg/mL) was reached on the third day of medication. The elimination constant (0.05 ± 0.01 1/h), half-life (14.9 ± 1.4 h), area under concentration versus time curve (81.0 ± 9.9 h·μg/mL) and mean residence time (22.7 ± 2.5 h) were obtained using a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic model. It was determined that the current 7-day WDT regulation was still legitimate for the kidney and liver as well as for the breast and leg muscles, which were estimated by linear regression analysis of the 99% upper distribution limit. The unregulated heart and gizzard were considered safe even when the lowest MRL of muscle (100 ng/g) was applied. While at the present time the extra-label use of drugs is only allowed under specific conditions, in the future it may become necessary to increase the general dosage of DC, and the current results suggest a safe range of DC hyclate in chicken; however, skin/fat tissue residues warrant further studies.",

We also investigated the relationship between the age of mares and their AMH levels. The possible effect of seasonality of AMH levels was also assessed. Twenty-three mares between 6 and 24 years of age were included in the experiment. Mares were divided into two groups: Group 1 included mares aged 6 – 15 years ( n = 11), while Group 2 included individuals older than 15 years of age ( n = 12). Venous blood was collected and ovarian activity was monitored parallelly by transrectal ultrasonography. Serum AMH concentrations varied widely between the two different groups. AMH concentrations were significantly lower in old mares than in younger animals. A positive relationship was detected between AMH concentration and the number of medium-sized follicles ( P = 0.022), large follicles ( P = 0.016) and the total follicle count ( P = 0.026).

The pathological effects of T. vistulensis on the gills of the European catfish were mainly related to the attachment sites of the parasite to its host, but damage also affected adjacent structures. The primary attachment relies on the anchors at the opisthaptor which commonly adheres both superficially and deeply, into the basal region between adjacent secondary lamellae. At the attachment sites, the haptoral disc of the parasites formed deep concave cup-like depressions on the surface of the gill lamellae. Deep anchor penetration occasionally distorted the extracellular cartilaginous matrix and induced a marked proliferation of epithelial tissue. Epithelial hyperplasia leading to lamellar fusion and subsequent extravasated erythrocytes in the gill lamellae was also observed. The damage caused by the parasites also led to the fusion of lamellae at the tips of the heavily infected gill filaments, forming club-like structures. Epithelial eosinophilic granular cells were frequently observed at the attachment sites. The pathological changes caused by this monopisthocotylan parasite frame the need to implement effective management strategies for controlling T. vistulensis infections in farmed European catfish populations.",

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) – a secondary bile acid, a byproduct of intestinal bacteria with potent antioxidant properties – against PTX-induced liver injury. PTX was administered intraperitoneally at 2 mg*kg −1 for 5 days to induce liver damage. Rats in the first treatment group received UDCA orally at 60 mg*kg −1 for fifteen days, while the second group received the same dose for ten days. Serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, total protein, and albumin were analysed using an autoanalyzer. Liver tissue was assessed for total oxidative status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) and total antioxidant status (TAS). Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were also conducted. UDCA administration ameliorated PTX-induced changes in bodyweight and liver enzymes. It reduced necrosis, hydropic degeneration and mononuclear cell infiltration in liver tissue. UDCA also significantly decreased TOS and OSI levels, alleviating oxidative stress, and increased TAS. Furthermore, UDCA reduced DNA damage, evidenced by lower 8-OHdG immunoreactivity, and regulated autophagy and apoptosis by reversing elevated LC3B and cleaved caspase-3 levels. These findings suggest that UDCA may offer therapeutic benefits against PTX-induced hepatotoxicity.",

Samples were collected from 11 turkeys (from 4 flocks) and 9 pheasants (from 3 farm-raised flocks) suspected to have histomonosis. These samples were molecularly and phylogenetically analysed. In nine turkeys, five 18S rRNA genes and two ITS sequence variants of Histomonas meleagridis were identified. These variants were identical between the caecum and liver of the same bird in most cases, but different 18S variants were identified between sampling sites. In one turkey, an unnamed species, here designated as “Dientamoebidae sp. HUN35”, was identified. Its 18S rRNA gene sequence was near-identical (99.6–99.3%) to the sequence reported previously; and the ITS-1/5.8S/ITS-2 region confirmed a close relationship with H. meleagridis and Dientamoeba fragilis . In one pheasant, Tetratrichomonas gallinarum was detected. Different 18S rRNA variants had either identical or different ITS sequences, thus optimally, both should be used for molecular epidemiological studies. Our results suggest the unnamed Dientamoebidae sp. has been present in Hungary since its first detection in 2010 and the host range of this species as well as that of T. gallinarum is broader than previously thought.",

Duck hepatitis A virus serotype 3 (DHAV-3), duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) and novel duck reovirus (NDRV), belonging to the family Picornaviridae , Flaviviridae and Spinareoviridae , respectively, are important pathogens with similar symptoms in infected ducks. To detect and differentiate these viruses, this study developed a triplex real-time PCR assay targeting the VP1, E and σC genes of DHAV-3, DTMUV and NDRV, respectively. Validation tests and clinical applications followed the optimization of the triplex real-time PCR assay. The novel triplex assay showed high specificity with no cross-reactivity with eight other common duck viruses. The detection limits were 1 × 10 1 copies/μL for DTMUV, DHAV-3 and NDRV, with intra- and inter-assay variation coefficients (CV) below 4%. A total of 135 clinical samples were tested to evaluate the method's feasibility. The positive rates for DHAV-3, DTMUV and NDRV were 13.33%, 10.37% and 8.15%, respectively. Using virus isolation as a reference, the triplex qPCR assay showed 100% detection sensitivity for all three viruses, with specificity and coincidence values above 97%. In conclusion, the established triplex TaqMan PCR is highly specific, sensitive and reproducible, providing a practical approach for detecting and monitoring DHAV-3, DTMUV and NDRV in ducks.",

A 4-year-old intact female hairless guinea pig showed bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands and high cortisol levels. Urine was collected and, after initial saliva sample collection, 0.01 mg*kg −1 dexamethasone was administered. Saliva was collected with a 1 mL syringe to determine cortisol levels upon 2, 4 and 8 h after dexamethasone application. The urine cortisol:creatinine ratio was above 465.4*10 −6 . Before applying dexamethasone, the cortisol level was 171 nmol*L −1 . 2 h after initial application, it was 79 nmol*L −1 , at 4 h it was 70 nmol*L −1 , and at 8 h it rose to 1,280 nmol*L −1 . The LDDST used in canine medicine to diagnose hypercortisolism can be adapted to guinea pigs and yields results to diagnose Cushing's syndrome in this species. As dexamethasone is more accessible, cheaper and more sensitive than the ACTH stimulation test, it should be a preferred choice from all aspects.",

It is the most common systemic mycosis in cats, primarily documented through case reports and retrospective studies. In feline cases, clinical symptoms typically begin with skin lesions appearing in the nasal and frontal regions, as observed in the case presented here. This case report details a 13-year-old European shorthair cat that presented with a 3-month history of progressive naso-ocular lesions and weight loss. The cat was likely infected through cat scratches, leading to contamination with encapsulated yeast cells, which resulted in localized skin lesions. Skin scrape cytology of the lesions showed many macrophages with numerous extra and intracytoplasmic organisms compatible with Cryptococcus species. Histopathological examination revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation with encapsulated yeasts. Latex cryptococcal antigen agglutination test on serum was positive. Fungal culture identified Cryptococcus neoformans . Unfortunately, shortly after the initiation of targeted treatment, the cat passed away. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of this cryptococcosis case. Cryptococcosis is an underdiagnosed disease and its early detection can be challenging due to nonspecific symptoms. Early initiation of targeted antifungal therapy significantly increases the chances of recovery.",

A 16-year-old spayed female, Shih Tzu, previously diagnosed with stage 2 chronic kidney disease, presented increased levels of serum urea, creatinine, total calcium, ionized calcium, phosphorus and PTH, indicating THPT. Clinical treatment for the renal condition was initiated and cinacalcet hydrochloride (0.5 mg*kg −1 , orally, once daily for 7 days, followed by 1 mg*kg −1 , orally, once daily for 7 days) was administered to correct the hormonal disorders. PTH, total calcium and ionized concentrations decreased by 56%, 76% and 15%, respectively, in 14 days. However, exacerbation of the uremic crisis was observed, leading to death 26 days after the initiation of the medication. This report appears to be the first to comprehensively discuss THPT in veterinary medicine. The shorter life expectancy of these animals compared to that of humans may be a determining factor for the low prevalence of THPT in dogs. The tendency toward a reduction in PTH, total calcium and ionized calcium achieved after the initiation of cinacalcet hydrochloride use encourages the development of further clinical studies to investigate its application in animals.",

At the end of the study, the expression levels of Bcl-2, Caspase-3, P38-MAPK, STAT3, JAK2 and PI3K genes were analyzed by Western blot analysis. As the proportion of buckwheat in the diet increased, caspase-3 gene expression increased, but the expression of other genes decreased. In testicular histology, the structure of the Control Group and Group-1 was preserved, while deterioration was observed in the other two groups. Since this damage would also affect spermatogenesis and spermatozoa in the epididymis, subsequent spermatologic analysis showed a significant decrease in semen quality in Group-3. It was concluded that 12% buckwheat supplementation positively affected the testicular structure and semen quality of rats, while 36% buckwheat supplementation negatively affected the testicular structure and semen quality.",

However, the occasional entrapment of cartilage debris under the graft prevented perfect alignment in the present cadaver study in 27% of the grafts transplanted in this manner. Since the protrusion of grafts never exceeded 1.5 mm, we conclude that drilling 3-5 mm deeper than graft length with graft length deep dilation can avoid disadvantageous protrusion of the transplanted hyaline cartilage caps, achieving bone decompression at the same time.",

Permethrin and propetamphos residues were determined in the skin, meat and liver of chickens kept on 'Blotic-B' treated litter and in eggs collected at different times after the treatment of layer houses. Permethrin residues could not be detected in any of the samples (< 0.01 mg/kg). Meat and fat tissues of chickens slaughtered on the day after treatment contained small amounts of propetamphos (0.003 and 0.02 mg/kg, respectively). In the case of chickens kept on the treated litter and slaughtered after one week, active ingredient was not detected in meat, but 0.006 mg/kg propetamphos was present in the fat. The residue content of other samples (liver, egg) was below the detection limit of the applied method at all sampling times. From the food toxicological point of view these pesticide combinations can be used safely if the recommended withdrawal period is observed between ectoparasiticide administration and slaughter.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is increasingly threatened by intensive agriculture, environmental pollution, extinction of natural habitats and several other factors. Several mammalian species including ungulates have disappeared or are threatened by extinction. However, ungulates play an important role both in the ecosystem and in the economy. In general, species or breeds are considered endangered if their population does not exceed 1,000 individuals. In these cases conservation programmes should be initiated in order to maintain or even increase their number. This review deals with the possibilities and limitations of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in the conservation of ecologically valuable wild, rare and indigenous ungulates. The methods discussed here are artificial insemination, cryopreservation of semen and embryos, embryo recovery and transfer,in vitroproduction of embryos, as well as micromanipulation techniques including sperm injection, assisted hatching and cloning. Some of these procedures are already being exploited in the breeding of farm ungulates, but more basic information about the reproductive patterns of wild, rare and indigenous animal species is needed before the routine use of ARTs.",

Among the 16 drugs examined, penicillin G, ampicillin (MICs ranging from ≤ 0.06 μg/ml to 1 μg/ml), ceftazidim (with MICs from ≤ 0.06 μg/ml to 0.12 μg/ml), erythromycin, tylosin, tilmicosin (with some exceptions MICs ranged from ≤ 0.06 μg/ml to 1 μg/ml) and tiamulin (MICs varied from ≤ 0.06 μg/ml to 2 μg/ml) were the most effective. Lincomycin, oxytetracycline and enrofloxacin also gave good inhibitions, but with most strains in a higher concentration (MICs ranged in most cases from 2 μg/ml to 8 μg/ml). The other antibiotics inhibited the growth of O. rhinotracheale only in very high concentrations (colistin) or not at all (apramycin, spectinomycin, polymyxin B). At 37 °C, O. rhinotracheale did not survive on egg-shell for more than 24 hours, while upon inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs it killed embryos by the ninth day, and from the 14th day post-inoculation no O. rhinotracheale could be cultured from the eggs at all. These results suggest that O. rhinotracheale is not transmitted via eggs during hatching.",

Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) was the only myiasis-causing fly species identified. It was assumed that unknown volatile chemicals might be responsible for the attraction of gravid females to the undamaged vulvar region. These odours are supposed to be produced during different physiological and/or pathological events associated with oestrus, prolonged puerperal period or inflammation of tissues.

White Wistar rats were allotted into four groups as follows: sham-operated (Group SOP), ischaemia-reperfusion only (Group I/R), I/R with deferoxamine (Group D) or L-arginine (Group A) treatment. Concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), overall concentration of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-alkenals (LPO586), activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) of the jejunal homogenates were determined. The same analytes except LPO586 were assayed in RBC haemolysates. Measurements of ferric reducing ability (FRAP), total antioxidant status (TAS) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations of plasma samples were also completed. The only significant change observed in the SOP group was an increased SOD activity after the ischaemic period. In the I/R group significant increase of intestinal LPO586 concentration was observed during hypoxia that was followed by similar changes in intestinal and RBC TBARS and plasma FRAP values upon reperfusion. In Group D the intestinal TBARS and LPO586 concentrations were significantly lower while FRAP and NO concentrations were significantly higher compared to the I/R group. At the same time RBC TBARS concentration and GPX activity significantly decreased within Group D. In Group A the intestinal LPO586 concentration was significantly lower than in the I/R group whilst RBC TBARS concentration showed a similar pattern. Plasma FRAP and NO concentration showed similar changes to those seen in Group D. It is concluded that I/R increased the LPO in the intestinal tissue and altered some parameters of plasma and RBCs, too. Deferoxamine treatment prevented these effects, while the usefulness of L-arginine remained doubtful.",

Moderate hypothyroid state was induced in two groups of female rabbits (3 and 12 months old) by giving 50 mg/kg body weight (BW) of propylthiouracil (PTU) per os for 6 days and 20 mg/kg BW of methimazole (MMI) for further 14 days. Serum T 4 and T 3 concentrations decreased by about 38-40 and 32-36%, respectively. The induced hypothyroidism resulted in a significant decrease in the serum concentration of the lipid peroxidation end-product malondialdehyde, as measured by the thiobarbituric-acid assay. Erythrocytes of hypothyroid animals exhibited higher resistance to oxidative stress, while submitted to free radicals generator 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH) in vitro . Using two detector systems (phospholipid liposomes and deoxyribose), sensitive to either organic or inorganic oxygen radical damage, the ability of euthyroid and hypothyroid rabbit plasma to protect against oxygen radicals was evaluated. The plasma of hypothyroid animals showed about 20% higher ability to protect against iron-binding organic radicals, but about 50% lower chain-breaking antioxidant activity. The antioxidant capacity of plasma against inorganic radicals was not affected by hypothyroidism. In conclusion, the results show that thyroid hormones modulate the free-radical-induced oxidative damage of lipids and that hypothyroidism offers some protection against lipid peroxidation.",

This parasite, introduced from the Far East, causes intensive infection on the fins of fingerlings of the carp subspecies cultured in Europe (European carp, Cyprinus carpio carpio ). This infection of the common carp occurs in the Hungarian fish farms every year. Until the present study, this parasite had not been recorded from the fins of koi or coloured carp ( Cyprinus carpio haematopterus ), a carp of Far Eastern origin, which is cultured in Hungary as an ornamental fish. A recent survey conducted in common carp, koi and goldfish stocks demonstrated that T. nikolskii infection of low prevalence and intensity occurs also in koi populations, but its prevalence and intensity are markedly lower than in common carp kept in the same ponds. It is suggested that the observed differences are due to disparities in the susceptibility of the two carp subspecies to T. nikolskii , and that the koi is less susceptible to this infection. Other signs of susceptibility can also be observed in the European subspecies, since in 15% of the fish plasmodium development was arrested at an early stage. Thelohanellus nikolskii infection could not be demonstrated on goldfish ( Carassius auratus ).",

    "abstract": "The authors' hypothesis is that the members of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) such as citrate decrease in association with increased ketone body formation. To prove this hypothesis the connection between ketone bodies and citrate formation of milk was studied. A fluorimetric method was used to determine citrate and a headspace sampling gas chromatographic (GC) method was developed for determination of ketone bodies. Under real conditions of milk sampling, transport and storage, preserved milk samples of 119 clinically healthy dairy cows obtained in the 48 hours after milking were investigated. A low level of acetoacetate (ACAC) was found in all samples. This fact can be explained by the spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate during sample storage (previously decarboxylised acetoacetate = pdACAC) and, consequently, the majority of the amount of acetoacetate in the samples (AC + pdACAC) appeared in the measured acetone concentrations. Based on the measured acetone concentration of milk samples two groups were formed retrospectively: HA (high-acetone) group (n = 41) with an AC + pdACAC concentration of > 0.4 mmol/l and a LA (low-acetone) group (n = 78) with an AC + pdACAC level of < or = 0.4 mmol/l. In the milk of cows of Group HA a positive correlation (r = +0.623) and linear connection between acetone (AC + pdACAC) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) levels was found [BOHB = 2.491 + 0.586 x (pdAC + ACAC)]. Furthermore, in this group a negative correlation between citrate and BOHB and AC + pdACAC was also established (r = -0.579). Focusing on the results of this group the authors found a significant drop of AC + pdACAC and citrate during the metabolically critical first 1-4 weeks of lactation. For this reason they suggest that simple, easy, automated methods (i.e. flow injection analysis, Fourier transformation infrared analysis) should be introduced for the simultaneous determination of acetone and citrate concentration in milk to make the evaluation of the energy status of high-producing dairy cows easier and more certain.",

    "abstract": "The effect of feeding ochratoxin A (OTA) contaminated diet (379.6 and 338.1 μg/kg in starter and grower diets) on production traits, lipid peroxidation and some parameters of the glutathione redox system were investigated in weaned piglets over a seven-week period. Feed intake and feed conversion ratio (FCR) did not differ significantly, but in the first phase (0–28 days) the daily weight gain was significantly lower in the piglets fed the OTA-contaminated diet. Lipid peroxidation, as measured by the amount of malondialdehyde, glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activity, did not change significantly in the blood plasma and red blood cell haemolysate in the OTA-loaded group, while malondialdehyde content increased significantly in the liver and markedly but not significantly in the kidney of piglets fed OTA-contaminated feed. Glutathione content did not differ significantly in the studied organs of the two groups while glutathione peroxidase activity of the OTA-loaded animals was significantly lower both in the liver and in the kidney. The results suggest that the use of feed-stuffs contaminated with low levels of OTA for seven weeks did not cause marked differences in the production traits or in lipid peroxidation and amount or activity of the glutathione redox system in the blood plasma, red blood cells and kidney, while significant changes occurred in the liver homogenate.",

    "abstract": "Nutrigenomics examines nutrient-gene interactions on a genome-wide scale. Increased dietary fat or higher non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) from starvation-induced mobilisation may enhance hepatic oxidation and decrease esterification of fatty acids by reducing the expression of the fatty acid synthase gene. The key factors are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Dietary carbohydrates--both independently and through insulin effect--influence the transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene. Oleic acid or n-3 fatty acids downregulate the expression of leptin, fatty acid synthase and lipoprotein lipase in retroperitoneal adipose tissue. Protein-rich diets entail a shortage of mRNA necessary for expression of the fatty acid synthase gene in the adipocytes. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) are activators of PPAR and also induce apoptosis in adipocytes. Altered rumen microflora produces CLAs that are efficient inhibitors of milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland ('biohydrogenation theory'). Oral zinc or cadmium application enhances transcription rate in the metallothionein gene. Supplemental CLA in pig diets was found to decrease feed intake and body fat by activating PPARgamma-responsive genes in the adipose tissue. To prevent obesity and type II diabetes, the direct modulation of gene expression by nutrients is also possible. Nutrigenomics may help in the early diagnosis of genetically determined metabolic disorders and in designing individualised diets for companion animals.",

The authors give a complete description of an extremely rare congenital cardiac malformation in an equine neonate. The diagnosis of a complete, balanced common atrioventricular canal of type C in Rastelli's classification scheme was based on two-dimensional, contrast and colour Doppler echocardiography and subsequent postmortem gross pathology. To support our diagnosis and study the pathophysiological effect of the alteration, physical examination, blood gas analysis and other laboratory tests, electrocardiography and thoracic radiography were also performed. Our search of the literature suggests that this type of developmental anomaly might account for a higher percentage of equine congenital cardiac defects than was thought earlier. We suppose that some previously described congenital heart abnormalities were misinterpreted: these anomalies could have actually represented some type of atrioventricular canal defect, resulting from the failure of the endocardial cushions to undergo complete and proper fusion.",

Twelve dogs fulfilling the antemortem inclusion criteria (breed, age, adequate vaccination, history of progressive posterior ataxia and/or paraparesis, no radiographic and myelographic abnormalities in the spinal cord and vertebral column) were allocated. All these dogs presented signs of thoracolumbar syndrome (T3-L3), scored as grade I (mild to moderate ataxia and paraparesis) in 10 and grade II (severe ataxia and ambulatory paraparesis) in 2 cases. Treatment included the use of ɛ-aminocaproic acid and N-acetylcysteine, supplemented with vitamins B, C and E. Prednisolone was given for the first two weeks and upon worsening of neurological signs. Daily exercise, performed as walking or swimming, was strongly recommended. Clinicopathological evaluation was normal in all 12 dogs, and survey radiographs and myelograms did not show spinal cord compression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed only in 4 dogs, did not disclose compressive disorders or intramedullary lesions. Neurological signs were progressively worsening in all 12 animals, eventually resulting in severe paraparesis (grade III) or paraplegia (grade IV). The applied medications do not appear to be an attractive alternative to conservative management (physiotherapy) or euthanasia in canine degenerative myelopathy, irrespective of its chronicity.",

Viral DNA was found in 30% of the adult swine and 73% of the weaned pigs tested. Liver and intestine of weaned pigs were also tested and found to be infected at a lower rate. The TTV sequences found in sera and intestines were similar and could be clustered as swine genogroup 1.

In this work, changes in the concentration of plasma parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) and markers of bone metabolism were studied in Holstein cows and heifers in the dry period and early lactation to determine the role of PTHrP in the relationship between the rate of bone remodelling and the onset of lactation in dairy cows. Blood samples were taken 14 days before calving ('D-14', n = 23) and then on day 10 ('D+10', n = 21) and day 30 after calving ('D+30', n = 23). Using enzyme immunoassay (EIA), the concentrations of PTHrP, parathyroid hormone (PTH), carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and oestradiol and the activity of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSALP) were determined. The results showed a statistically significant increase in plasma PTHrP (p < 0.005) and CTX (p < 0.0001) in cows on 'D+10' as compared to 'D-14' and CTX on 'D+30' as compared to 'D-14' (p < 0.0001). Significant negative correlations were found between the concentrations of PTHrP and oestradiol (r = -0.29, p < 0.05) and those of CTX and oestradiol (r = -0.54, p < 0.0001). In nonpregnant heifers (n = 6), the concentration of CTX and the activity of BSALP were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than in dry cows. The observed increments of PTHrP and bone resorption after parturition reveal adaptations of bone metabolism to lactation in dairy cows.",

We tested the association of allergies in humans and their pets. A nested unmatched case-control study was performed in a random sample of 4261 inhabitants, aged 25-74 years, of the City of Augsburg, Germany and two adjacent counties. Using standardised computer-assisted face-to-face interviews, we determined and compared the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed atopic diseases (hay fever, asthma, atopic dermatitis) in the study subjects and veterinarian-diagnosed allergies in their pets. Pets were kept in 48.0% of the households (cats 26.1%, dogs 20.1%, rodents 9.7%) and a veterinarian had diagnosed an allergy in 3.9% (cats 3.3%, dogs 4.7%, rodents 1.2%). Atopic diseases were diagnosed in 20.2% of the study subjects (asthma 6.1%, hay fever 13.7%, atopic dermatitis 5.1%). After adjustment for age, sex, parental predisposition and social status a significant association between hay fever in the study subjects and allergies in their pets was observed [odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.97]. This association was more pronounced when investigating dogs only (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.32-5.77) where in addition an association with the overall prevalence of atopic diseases in the study subjects reached significance (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.16-4.58). We conclude that there is indication for a concomitant occurrence of allergies in humans and their pets. Shared environmental factors are the most likely explanation.",

Double staining and Hoechst/FITC-Pisum sativum agglutinin (FITC-PSA) labelling were tested for evaluating the viability and acrosome reaction induced by calcium ionophore of bull spermatozoa. In our experiments no significant differences were detected in the frequency of acrosome-reacted sperm either by double staining (37.98%) or by FITC-PSA labelling (39.33%). The viability of sperm stained by the double staining method was 67.17%, and a higher portion of viable sperm (82.67%) was observed by staining with the Hoechst procedure (P < 0.01).

While biochemical parameters were within the reference range, the cat had leukocytosis and rapidly decreasing haematocrit values, and eventually died 7 days after the sudden onset of aggravating clinical signs.

Enterococci (n = 562) were collected from intestinal samples of slaughtered broiler chickens. The presence of van genes was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) strains carried only the vanA gene. Genus- and species-level identification of the vanA gene carrier strains was carried out by PCR using specific primers. In 2001, 25 out of the 289 isolated strains (8.6%) were vanA carriers (1 Enterococcus mundtii, 13 E. durans and 11 E.faecium). In 2002 (n = 87), 20 (23%) strains were vanA positive (11 E. durans and 9 E. faecium). In 2003 and 2004, none of the strains (n = 95 and 91, respectively) were positive for the most common van genes. In 2003, there was only one strain for which higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of vancomycin (4 mg/L) and teicoplanin (8 mg/L) were found. In 2004 there were three strains for which the MIC of vancomycin was 8 mg/L, and 2 strains and 1 strain with teicoplanin MICs of 4 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The potential similarity of these strains was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The VRE strains were not closely related to one another. The annual data of vancomycin resistance indicate an association between the recovery of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and the use of avoparcin in animal feeds. This study indicates that with the reduced use of antibiotics in food animals, it is possible to decrease the rate of resistant bacteria. Although the use of avoparcin had been banned in 1998, the VRE strains disappeared only five years later.",

    "abstract": "Sensitisation to mites is frequent in atopic dogs. The main mite genus involved in canine atopic dermatitis is Dermatophagoides. The importance of storage mite allergens in dogs has been controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitisation rates against storage mites (Lepidoglyphus destructor and Tyrophagus putrescentiae) and house dust mites (Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus) in atopic dogs from Galicia, a highly humid and temperate region of Spain, using a FcepsilonRIalpha-based immunoglobulin E (IgE) in vitro test. The study was performed on 95 dogs suffering from atopic dermatitis and presenting detectable specific serum IgE levels: 91.6% of the dogs tested positive for storage mites, whereas sensitisation to house dust mites was detected in 87.4%. These results indicate the importance of storage mites in this specific geographic area.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of drugs used in the treatment of endotoxaemia on disseminated intravascular coagulation, cytokine levels and adenosine deaminase activities in endotoxaemic rats. Rats were divided into seven groups. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected into all groups, including the positive control group. The other six groups received the following drugs: enrofloxacin (ENR), flunixin meglumine (FM), low-dose dexamethasone (DEX), high-dose DEX, ENR + FM + low-dose DEX, and ENR + FM + high-dose DEX. After the treatments, serum and plasma samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours (h). A coagulometer was used to determine the levels of coagulation values, while ELISA was used to assay serum cytokines and adenosine deaminase (ADA). Low-dose DEX alone and combined treatments depressed the levels of cytokines and ADA (from 371 to 70 IU/L at 6 h) significantly and inhibited the decrease of coagulation values (antithrombin from 67 to 140% at 6 h, fibrinogen from 54 to 252 mg/dL at 6 h). In summary, FM + high-dose DEX may be the preferred treatment of endotoxaemia because of its highest effectiveness. FM plus high-dose DEX may be a new therapy for endotoxaemic domestic animals.",

In this study, the influence of IL-1β on secretory activity within the corpora lutea (CL) of cyclic and gravid pigs was determined in vitro during different stages of the CL lifespan, e.g. on Days 10–11, 12–13 and 15–16 of the oestrous cycle and pregnancy. IL-1β (10 ng/ml) increased prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) secretion from CL of the cyclic and gravid pigs during studied days of the oestrous cycle and pregnancy. Increase (P &lt; 0.05) of prostaglandin F 2α (PGF 2α ) in IL-1β-treated CL was demonstrated only on Days 10–11 of the oestrous cycle. More potent stimulatory effect of IL-1β on PGE 2 than PGF 2α secretion resulted in the enhancement of the PGE 2 :PGF 2α ratio in cyclic and early pregnant CL. IL-1β increased (P &lt; 0.05) progesterone (P4) secretion only in gravid CL and had no effect on oestradiol-17β (E2) release. Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA was stimulated (P &lt; 0.05) in IL-1β-treated cyclic and gravid CL. Expression of prostaglandin synthase mRNAs in response to IL-1β did not increase. In conclusion, IL-1β modulates PGE 2 , PGF 2α and P 4 secretion from porcine CL, depending on luteal stage and the surrounding hormonal milieu. The cytokine may act locally in porcine CL for luteotrophic support throughout the PGE 2 -mediated synthesis and secretion.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify relationships among seasonal differences of fertility, metabolic parameters and appearance of irregular luteal forms in high-yielding dairy cows. Holstein-Friesian cows were put on the Provsynch regimen in winter (n = 10) and in summer (n = 10). Blood sampling (starting 35 days post partum) and rectal ultrasound examinations (starting post insemination) were carried out once a week in each examination period. Metabolic [plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and serum beta-carotene] and endocrine parameters [plasma thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and insulin levels] were measured. In summer, two cows were excluded from the study because of metritis and none of the remaining animals became pregnant, but 6 of the 8 cows had irregular luteal forms (ILF) on their ovaries. In winter, one cow was excluded because of metritis and 6 of the 9 cows became pregnant, while 2 of the 3 open cows had irregular luteal forms. In summer the mean plasma NEFA and BHB concentrations were significantly higher, while serum carotene and plasma IGF-I concentrations were significantly lower than in winter. The high plasma NEFA concentration found in summer seemed to be in association with the lower body condition score (BCS) caused by depressed appetite. In conclusion, statistical analysis supports the hypothesis that increased plasma NEFA and BHB and decreased plasma IGF-I concentrations may result in reduced fertility in summer. These changes may be associated with the more frequent appearance of ILFs and probably have a negative effect on ovarian function and/or oocyte quality.",

A male, seven-week-old Labrador retriever puppy, exhibiting severe anaemia and haemoglobinuria, was presented at the Clinic of Internal Medicine in February 2011. The puppy was euthanised. The most relevant pathological changes were icterus, severe splenomegaly, generalised lymphadenopathy and haemoglobin nephrosis. Samples were collected from various organs for histology within one hour post mortem. Impression smears were also prepared from the spleen after overnight storage at 4 °C. Tissue sections and smears showed the presence of multiple, coccoid intraerythrocytic bodies that measured 1-2 μm and resembled small babesiae. No large piroplasms were seen. DNA was extracted from the spleen, and a conventional PCR was performed for the amplification of a 450-bp region of the 18S rRNA gene of piroplasms. The causative agent was identified as Babesia canis canis, with 99% sequence identity to other European isolates. Sequence identity to B. gibsoni was only 91%. This is the first account to verify that the morphology of the large canine piroplasm, B. canis, can be uniformly small babesia-like post mortem or following the storage of tissue samples.",

The DEB values of the purchased commercial broiler diets were modified with the addition of NH4Cl or NaHCO3 to formulate the diets (DEB 325, 250, 175, 100, 25 and -50 mmol/kg) for this investigation. A total of 396 chickens were divided into 6 treatment groups and fed with the experimental diets for 6 weeks. During the first two weeks of life, DEB did not influence feed intake and body weight gain; however, by the 21st day of age DEB 175 and between 22 and 42 days of age DEB 250 mmol/kg gave significantly better results than the control. DEB did not affect the macromineral concentrations of bone ash. The immune response of broilers on low DEB (< 175 mmol/kg) was faster and more intensive than that of chickens on diets with medium or high DEB (> 175 mmol/kg). It can be concluded that the optimal DEB value required for the best body weight gain is significantly influenced by the age of broilers. Our results call attention to the discrepancy between the decreasing DEB level of commercial broiler diets and the age-related increase of 'electrolyte requirements' of broilers. It is also interesting that DEB may influence not only the performance but also the immune response of broilers.",

The possible relationship between newborn survival and the studied parameters, as well as the effects of maternal parity, fetal gender and Apgar score were assessed.

After opening the fetal membranes, amniotic fluid samples were collected aseptically from the amniotic sac of each fetus. The data obtained from 74 amniotic fluid samples collected from 27 bitches showed that amniotic glucose concentration was lower (P < 0.05) in non-surviving than in surviving puppies. Within the normal, surviving puppies, amniotic glucose concentration was higher (P < 0.05) in male than in female newborns, and the lactate/creatinine ratio was significantly higher in multiparous than in primiparous bitches (P < 0.05). These preliminary results demonstrate the relevance of amniotic glucose, but not of uric acid, lactate, creatinine and the lactate to creatinine ratio for detecting puppies at risk of death immediately after birth.",

From day 1 after hatching, all chickens were fed an identical control diet for two weeks. Then chickens of Group 1 continued to be fed the control diet, whereas Group 2 was fed the same diet supplemented with lignin at 0.5% level. Simultaneously, Group 3 started to receive a diet contaminated with DON (2.95 mg kg-1) and ZEA (1.59 mg kg-1), while Group 4 received an identical contaminated diet supplemented with 0.5% lignin for further two weeks. Samples of blood and duodenal tissue were collected from 6 birds of each group at 4 weeks of age. Neither counts of white blood cells nor phagocytic function in the peripheral blood were significantly affected in the mycotoxin- and/or lignin-treated birds. As compared to the control, increased numbers of IgM-bearing cells were found in the peripheral blood in Group 3 fed the contaminated diet (P < 0.05) and in Group 4 given the contaminated diet supplemented with lignin (P < 0.01). While the contaminated diet led to reduced numbers of duodenal CD4+ cells, in Group 2 treated only with lignin the number of duodenal CD4+ cells was increased. Lignin enrichment of the contaminated diet did not eliminate the mycotoxin-induced reduction in the number of duodenal CD4+ cells. The results suggest that dietary supplementation of lignin as an indigestible compound to poultry feed may increase the density of some intestinal immunocompetent cells without exerting effects on that in the peripheral blood. However, when added to a diet contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins, lignin did not prevent the mycotoxin-induced changes in the numbers of blood and intestinal immunocompetent cells.",

A total of 188 postpartum cows, aged from 2 to 8 years, were utilised for 2 experiments. In Experiment 1, cows affected with RP/PM were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Cows in Group A (n = 17) were treated with 600 mg of ceftiofur intramuscularly for 3 days followed by intrauterine lavage with 0.1% chlorhexidine and infusion with 0.5% povidoneiodine, while cows in Group B (n = 16) received two intrauterine infusions, first with 5 g of oxytetracycline and then with 0.5% povidone-iodine. Cows with normal postpartum findings were regarded as the healthy control group (n = 26). Ultrasonographic examination revealed that the ovarian activities including the appearance of a dominant follicle and days to first ovulation of the cows in Group A during the early postpartum period differed from those of Group B (P < 0.05), which coincided with the results of uterine swabbing for bacteriology. In Experiment 2, cows with normal postpartum findings were allocated to Group D (n = 78), which received an ovulation protocol (GnRH - 7 d PGF2α - 48 h hCG - 24 h AI) on day 50 ± 2 postpartum. Cows affected with PM were randomly divided into two groups, Group E (n = 25) combined the treatments applied in Groups A and D, while Group F (n = 26) repeated the treatment administered in Group E except for uterine lavage. The results indicated that the pregnancy rate within 150 days postpartum and the mean days open in Group E (76.0% and 106.3 ± 4.6 days, respectively) were significantly different from those in Group F (38.5% and 137.9 ± 10.9 days, respectively) (P < 0.05). This study suggests that reproductive efficiency could be improved by using the two-step treatment to regulate uterine involution and an early resumption of ovarian function in cows with RP/PM.",

The aim of the study was to assess stress in relation to the type of milking and the frequency of human interaction. Parlour milking involved regular moving and crowding of the animals with frequent human interaction, which were much less frequent in automatic milking. The first phase of the study was conducted prior to the changeover [n = 27] and the second two months afterwards [n = 19 (of the cows from the first phase)]. Heart rate (HR) was recorded by the Polar RS800 CX recording system. HRV parameters indicative of sympathovagal balance were calculated for periods of lying and standing in the barn, waiting before milking and milking, respectively. Morning and evening faecal glucocorticoid concentrations were also measured. Fear of humans was tested by an avoidance distance test. Baseline HRV parameters showed no difference (P &gt; 0.05) between the two systems. In the periods before, during and after milking a higher sympathetic tone was detected in cows in the PARL phase. Mean faecal glucocorticoid concentrations were higher at the time of parlour milking. The avoidance distance did not differ between the two phases. The results suggest that automatic milking might be less stressful for cows than parlour milking, possibly due to the shorter duration of restraint after milking and the less frequent human interaction.",

The aligned autochthonous sequences were less polymorphic. The phylogenetic analysis separated sequences reported previously in Nigeria from the autochthonous sequences. The present work shows that the strain of E. canis detected in the study area is genetically different from those reported in the northern part of Nigeria and more closely related to sequences from Brazil and India.",

We identified genes integrated into the chromosomal DNA without known integrative and conjugative elements. These genes conferred resistance to streptomycin ( strA ), tetracycline ( tetB ), chloramphenicol ( catAIII ), and sulphonamides ( sulII ). We also detected mutation in the quinolone-resistance-determining regions of parC . No plasmids could be isolated from strain Pm238. These results suggest that P. multocida can accumulate multiple resistance determinants on the chromosome as single genes.",

The following tyrosine kinases and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) were examined in malignant and healthy mammary tissues of 13 dogs: VEGFR1, VEGFR2, EGFR, ErbB2, PDGFR1, c-KIT and c-MET. Expression levels of all these factors were significantly higher in tumour samples than in normal mammary tissues taken from the same animal. Higher grading was associated with higher VEGFR1 levels. Grade III tumours showed significantly higher VEGF, c-MET and c-KIT mRNA expression, while Grade I tumours with lower malignancy showed significantly higher PDGFR1 and EGFR expression than tumours classified as Grade II or III. The increased presence of VEGF, VEGFR1, c-KIT and c-MET is a negative prognostic factor as these signal transduction molecules contribute to increased tumour malignancy. The presented data provide evidence, for the first time, for the existence of a complex overexpression and dysregulation of VEGF and several oncogenic tyrosine kinases such as VEGR1, PDGFR1, c-KIT and c-MET in canine mammary tumours. Therefore, canine mammary tumours may be potential targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.",

After the reappearance of an emerging enteropathogen, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in Hungary in 2016, an extensive survey was initiated in an attempt to identify diarrhoea-related porcine viruses, including adeno-, astro-, boca-, calici-, circo-, corona-, kobu-, rota- and Torque teno viruses. A total of 384 faecal samples collected during a twoyear period from diarrhoeic and asymptomatic pigs of various ages in 17 farms were screened by conventional and real-time PCR methods. Half of the samples contained at least one examined virus with the dominance of kobuvirus (55.1%) followed by bocaviruses (33.2%) and rotavirus groups A and C together (20.9%), while coronaviruses including PEDV were not found in this set of samples. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant difference (P &lt; 0.0001) in the frequency of single infections compared to mixed ones with the exception of weaned pigs, in which group additionally most viruses were detected. The results of this study suggest that the complexity of this disease may vary with age, which makes the prevention of diarrhoea a challenge, especially in weaned pigs.",

No eggs of Eucoleus aerophilus were detected. Morphological identification of first instar larvae (L1) was also carried out. In the faeces of 60 cats (19.8%) from 17 settlements and Budapest, L1 of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus were found. More than half of the cats were from the western part of the country. The average number of larvae per gram of faeces was 190.2 ± 304.88. These results are in line with the former findings on the prevalence of aelurostrongylosis of domestic cats in Hungary. In addition, Oslerus rostratus was also found for the first time in the faecal samples of three cats from the eastern part of the country, infected also with Ae. abstrusus. The average age (2.51 ± 1.26 years) of infected cats indicates that lungworm infection is more common among younger cats. No relationship was found between the lung-worm infection and the sex of cats. Non-neutered cats had a significantly higher proportion of lungworm infections. Two-thirds of the infected cats were apparently healthy, and only 19 individuals showed clinical signs of respiratory disorders.",

Metacercariae of P. cuticola are widespread in Europe and cause black spot disease. Several species of Posthodiplostomum were described also from North America but none of them has been isolated in Hungary up to now. Posthodiplostomum centrarchi Hoffman, 1958 has been detected recently in pumpkinseeds ( Lepomis gibbosus L., 1758) in several European countries. Posthodiplostomum centrarchi was isolated for the first time in Hungary from pumpkinseeds caught in the Maconka water reservoir in 2015. Thereafter, several natural waters (e.g. the River Danube, Lake Balaton and the Sió channel) were sampled in order to determine its presence and distribution. Only the native species P. cuticola was detected in Lake Balaton on cyprinids but a relatively high infection rate of P. centrarchi was observed in the Sió channel close to the lake. Pathological changes were absent, and metacercariae were mostly attached to the surface of the liver, kidney and heart. The phylogenetic analysis of the ITS and COI sequences of P. centrarchi and P. cuticola clustered into two distinct branches, which was in agreement with the morphological results.",

In this study, ten water samples were randomly collected from pet shops' fish tanks and home aquaria inhabited by several fish species (silver arowana, koi, goldfish, catfish, pictus fish, silver shark and silver dollar fish). Altogether 298 colonies were isolated using Aeromonas selective agar. A total of 154 isolates were then confirmed as belonging to the genus Aeromonas using the GCAT gene. Using ERIC-PCR, a total of 40 duplicate isolates were excluded from the study and 114 isolates were subjected to PCR-RFLP targeting the RNA polymerase sigma factor ( rpoD ) gene using lab-on-chip. A total of 13 different Aeromonas species were identified. The most prevalent species were A. veronii (27%, 31/114), followed by A. dhakensis (17%, 19/114), A. finlandiensis (9%, 10/114), A. caviae (8%, 9/114), A. hydrophila (4%, 4/114), A. jandaei (4%, 4/114), A. rivuli (3%, 3/114), A. enteropelogens (2%, 2/114), A. tecta (2%, 2/114), A. allosaccharophila (1%, 1/114), A. eucrenophila (1%, 1/114), A. media (1%, 1/114) and A. diversa (1%, 1/114). Twenty-six isolates (23%) were unidentifiable at species level. The present study demonstrates that Aeromonas species are highly diverse in freshwater fish tanks, and suggests the potential risks posed by the isolated bacteria to the health of ornamental fish species.",

    "abstract": "In the equine practice, attempts have been made to examine the fetus in the second and third trimester of pregnancy but all of the available methods have limitations. Until now, transabdominal ultrasonography has been regarded as the most informative examination. This method allows us to measure fetal heart rate, fetal activity as well as the quality and quantity of the fetal fluids. A modified biophysical profile for horses was used by several researchers in the USA from the 1990s as a gold standard. However, it is not sensitive enough and, in the authors' experience, professionals can face difficulties during its application (e.g. for measuring aortic diameter and fetal breathing movements). In cows, this method was first used for this purpose by a Canadian research group in 2007. They reported that transabdominal ultrasound was promising but showed low sensitivity in this species. The present studies show that birth weight cannot be predicted from fetal aortic diameter measurement in cows as suggested by other researchers. Transabdominal ultrasound needs special equipment (2-3.5 MHz convex transducer) and basic ultrasonographic knowledge; however, we suggest that in most cases it can be performed with the dam placed in a stock and without shaving the examination area. The method provides useful information within 30-40 minutes, enabling the examiner to determine whether or not the fetus is alive and to recognise placentitis or twins. This technique also allows measuring the combined thickness of the uteroplacental unit, and the authors' ongoing study showed higher normal values in Lipizzaner mares compared to values in other breeds. In conclusion, with the help of advanced techniques, simple and low-cost methods should be developed for the evaluation of the pregnant dam and its fetus to assess fetal viability in the veterinary practice.",

The different layers of the thoracic wall appeared as narrow bands of variable echogenicity. Reverberation artefacts appeared as lines of variable echogenicity that ran parallel to the pulmonary surface medial to the pleura. Because of its air content, the pulmonary parenchyma was not visualised in all camels. On the right side, the pulmonary surface was seen in the 5th through the 10th intercostal space (ICS). In addition, it was imaged in the 11th ICS in 20 camels and in the 4th ICS in three camels. The dimension of the ventral lung border was largest at the 4th ICS and smallest at the 11th ICS. The echogenic line on the surface of the lung, consisting of the costal and the parietal pleurae, was 1 to 4 mm thick. The left pulmonary surface and pleura were imaged with approximately the same frequencies as the right side. At this side, only the pulmonary surface and pleura were imaged in 15 camels in the 11th ICS. In conclusion, ultrasonography of the lungs and pleura provides information that can be used as a reference when examining camels suspected to have respiratory diseases.",

Drinking water and feed were provided ad libitum. On day 18 of the experiment 50% of chickens in each treatment group were immunised with bovine serum albumin. Ten and 21 days after immunisation blood samples were collected to determine the anti-albumin IgY titre, interleukin 6 (IL6) and interferon gamma (IFNG) and to measure the weight of the liver, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and thymus. Arg or Gln supplementation of the diets influenced neither the production nor the organ weights until 18 days of age. Between 18 and 39 days of age both Arg (0.5% and 1%) and Arg + Gln supplementation improved the feed conversion ratio (FCR) by 3.7%, 6.3% and 4.9%, respectively, while Gln-1% worsened it by 15%. Immunisation slightly (-0.79%) depressed the body weight gain of broilers fed the control diet, which was significantly improved by both Arg (0.5 or 1%) and Arg + Gln supplementation. Immunisation increased the weight of the spleen, bursa and thymus and decreased that of the liver. Supplementation with 1% Gln depressed (-5.13%) the body weight gain of the immunised chickens but strongly stimulated the immune response. Supplementations with Arg and Gln did not influence the IL6 and IFNG level of the blood; however, on day 10 after immunisation these two parameters showed a negative correlation with each other. Regarding production, organ weights and immunity, Arg supplementation should be recommended in the grower phase, while Gln supplementation can be useful in pullets raised for egg production, where a good immune response to vaccinations is an important factor.",

Steroid injections are the main way of treating these disorders. However, this approach brings usually only temporary effects of pain relief, and may cause many side effects. Alternative therapies focus on regeneration of damaged tissue using adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Since 2002, the great plasticity and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs isolated from adipose tissue (AdMSCs) have been used successfully in the treatment of degenerative joint diseases (DJD) of both dogs and horses. Possible simultaneous application of steroid therapy and stem cell transplantation could improve the commonly used clinical procedure. In this paper, the influence of the two steroid drugs (betamethasone and methylprednisolone) on AdMSCs was evaluated on the basis of morphology and proliferation rate. Both steroids positively influenced the viability and proliferation state of cells in a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. However, the concentration of 1 mg/ml had a cytotoxic effect. Moreover, the lower dosage of steroid drugs used in the experiment did not affect the morphology of cells and significantly increased cellular activity. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the stimulating effect of steroid drugs on cell morphology, proliferation rate and cytophysiological activity. These findings may influence the use of stem cells and steroids in applied regenerative veterinary medical practice in the future.",

Histone acetylation level was detected from hepatocyte nuclei by Western blotting, while microsomal CYP activity was examined by specific enzyme assays. Hyperacetylation of hepatic histone H2A at lysine 5 was observed after butyrate supplementation, providing modifications in the epigenetic regulation of cell function. No significant changes could be found in the acetylation state of the other core histones at the acetylation sites examined. Furthermore, butyrate did not cause any changes in the drugmetabolising activity of hepatic microsomal CYP2H and CYP3A37 enzymes, which are mainly involved in the biotransformation of most xenobiotics in chicken. These data indicate that supplementation of the diet with butyrate probably does not have any pharmacokinetic interactions with simultaneously applied xenobiotics.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to assess the effects of an inactivated phase I vaccine against Coxiella burnetii at the start of the third trimester of gestation on serological profiles, bacterial shedding patterns and subsequent reproductive performance in dairy cows. Cows were randomly assigned to a control (n = 78) or a vaccinated (n = 78) group on days 171-177 of gestation. Samples of placenta and colostrums at parturition, vaginal fluid, faeces, milk (PCR identification) and blood (anti-C. burnetii antibody detection) were obtained on the day of treatment and on days 91-97 post partum, and also on parturition day and weekly on days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28 and 29-35 post partum in a subset of 70 animals. By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, no significant effect of vaccination was detected on any of the reproductive variables studied. According to the odds ratio, C. burnetii shedding on days 171-177 of gestation was highly correlated with seropositivity against C. burnetii (OR = 9.1), while vaccination was not linked to reduced shedding of the bacterium. In shedders compared to others, the likelihood of pregnancy to first AI decreased and increased by factors of 0.26 and 16.1 on days 1-35 and 91-97 post partum, respectively. In conclusion, when administered at the start of the third trimester of pregnancy, the inactivated C. burnetii phase I vaccine failed to reduce bacterial shedding.",

Besides known vector-pathogen associations, in Amblyomma cohaerens ticks sequences of Anaplasma marginale and A. phagocytophilum were detected, the latter for the first time in any ticks from cattle in Africa. In addition, part of the gltA gene of Ehrlichia ruminantium was successfully amplified from tsetse flies (Glossina pallidipes). First-time identification of sequences of the above pathogens in certain tick or tsetse fly species may serve as the basis of further epidemiological and transmission studies.",

Our study was composed of determining the reproducibility of serum Fe concentration as a prognostic criterion in cows with ACM (Study 1) and clarifying the sequential changes in serum Fe concentration in cattle that received endotoxin (Study 2). Seventy-seven cows with (n = 47) or without (n = 30) ACM were enrolled in Study 1. The proposed diagnostic cut-off value of serum Fe concentration indicating a poor prognosis of ACM based on the analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curves was &lt; 31.5 µg/dL. Ten young cattle aged 176.8 ± 23.7 days were enrolled in Study 2. Five young cattle received endotoxin (LPS group) and the remaining five received physiological saline (control group). Blood collections were carried out before endotoxin challenge (pre), and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after the challenge. As a result, a significant decrease in serum Fe concentration was not observed until 24 h after endotoxin challenge. Because in cows with clinical ACM it is difficult to know the time course after infection, the alteration in serum Fe concentrations alone may be an insufficient prognostic criterion.",

A Coxiella burnetii prevalence of 97.6% has been found by ELISA and PCR tests of the bulk tank milk in dairy cattle farms of Hungary. The herd- and individual-level seroprevalence rates of C. burnetii in the examined dairy cows and farms have dramatically increased over the past ten years. Three high-producing industrial dairy farms were studied which had previously been found ELISA and PCR positive for C. burnetii by bulk tank milk testing. Coxiella burnetii was detected in 52% of the 321 cows tested by ELISA. Pregnancy loss was detected in 18% of the cows between days 29–35 and days 60–70 of gestation. The study found a higher seropositivity rate (80.5%) in the cows that had lost their pregnancy and a seropositivity of 94.4% in the first-bred cows that had lost their pregnancy at an early stage. The ELISA-positive pregnant and aborted cows were further investigated by the complement fixation test (CFT). In dairy herds an average of 66.6% individual seropositivity was detected by the CFT (Phase II) in previously ELISA-positive animals that had lost their pregnancy and 64.5% in the pregnant animals. A higher (Phase I) seropositivity rate (50.0%) was found in the cows with pregnancy loss than in the pregnant animals (38.5%). The high prevalence of C. burnetii in dairy farms is a major risk factor related to pregnancy loss.",

Local anaesthetic drugs are considered the safest and the most effective agents to inhibit oral pain. Recently, tramadol was used as an adjuvant to local anaesthetics to increase the duration of analgesia. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of maxillary nerve block induced by lidocaine or lidocaine-tramadol on perioperative pain in dogs undergoing upper fourth premolar extraction. A randomized blinded clinical study was conducted over five months involving sixteen animals divided into two groups, Group L (8 animals, Group Lidocaine) and Group LT (8 animals, Group Lidocaine-Tramadol). Both drugs provided effective pain control during and after surgical intervention, but lidocaine-tramadol resulted in longer analgesia than lidocaine alone. These findings suggest that the maxillary nerve block with lidocaine-tramadol can ensure adequate and prolonged pain control in dogs undergoing dental extraction. Although these are preliminary results, tramadol showed promising effects as a potential drug to use during oral surgery in association to local anaesthetics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective To identify associations between the occurrence of sacrocaudal fusion and the potential morphology of certain hind limb bones in actively racing greyhounds. Methods The calcaneus, talus and patella from each hind limb were collected from 94 male and 77 female mature greyhound cadavers and grouped into four groups; right or left bones from greyhounds with a standard or fused sacrum. The measurements were recorded for the following parameters: body mass of the greyhound, mass, length, and width of the right and left calcanei, tali and patellae. Results A fused sacrum (4 sacral vertebrae) was present in 41% of specimens. The right and left calcanei, tali and patellae in greyhounds with a standard or fused sacrum were anatomically similar. Overall, left to right asymmetry was found, in the width of calcaneus ( P &lt; 0.01) and the talus ( P &lt; 0.05) and the length of calcaneus ( P &lt; 0.001) all these being larger in bones from the left hind limbs. Comparing bones from dogs with a fused or unfused sacrum showed that the right calcaneus length ( P &lt; 0.05) was significantly less than the left in those greyhounds with standard sacrum; the right calcaneus width was significantly less ( P &lt; 0.01) than the left in those with a fused sacrum. There were no significant differences in the means of measurements of bones between greyhounds with a standard and those with a fused sacrum except for the mass of the right (95% CI 0.22 to 1.10, P &lt; 0.01) and left (95% CI 0.18 to 1.04, P &lt; 0.01) calcaneus which were heavier in greyhounds with a fused sacrum than those with a standard sacrum. Conclusion In a population of greyhounds that race on anticlockwise tracks, the left calcaneus was wider and longer than the right and the left talus was wider. This asymmetry was more significant in dogs with sacrocaudal fusion and those dogs had more massive calcanei than dogs with standard sacrums, suggesting a difference in the way these bones were loaded in dogs with sacrocaudal fusion compared to dogs with the standard sacral anatomy.",

While brown to black melanophoromas are most prevalent in reptiles, sporadic cases of non-pigmented chromatophoromas have been reported. This case study documents the clinical presentation, histopathological features and IHC (IHC) profile of an oral non-pigmented chromatophoroma in a 13-year-old male savannah monitor ( Varanus exanthematicus ). Histopathological examination revealed a poorly demarcated tumour located in the mucosa. Non-pigmented neoplastic cells with marked anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and numerous mitotic figures formed solid packets separated by collagenous septa. IHC analysis revealed that tumour cells were positive to melan-A, S100 protein, neuron-specific enolase and cytokeratins AE1/AE3. Based on the histopathological and IHC findings, the tumour was diagnosed as a non-pigmented chromatophoroma. Detailed histopathological and IHC profiling enhances our comprehension of the diversity within chromatophoromas and underscores the diagnostic complexities involved. Immunohistochemistry is a crucial tool for identifying non-pigmented chromatophoromas.",

Between August 2021 and May 2023, 1,200 faecal samples from locally reared sheep in North Kashmir were examined using the sedimentation technique to detect trematode eggs. Positive samples were further assessed using the McMaster technique to determine eggs per gram. The overall prevalence of trematodes was 5.33%, with amphistomes accounting for 2.33%, Fasciola spp. for 2.08%, and Dicrocoelium spp. for 1.33%. Season, age and breed showed no effect on significant effect on prevalence, while sex and body condition had a significant impact. Trematode prevalence also varied between districts. EPG values ranged from 0 to 300, with a mean of 151.563 ± 8.181. Amphistomes, Fasciola spp. and Dicrocoelium spp. had EPG ranges of 0–300, 0–300 and 0–250, with mean values of 186.957 ± 14.817, 150.000 ± 8.704 and 114.286 ± 17.719 respectively.

To prevent disease outbreaks and reduce environmental contamination with metacercariae, deworming should be carried out in late winter/early spring, early summer/mid-summer and mid-autumn/late autumn. Low EPG values may indicate lower infection levels. The study shall help in strategic treatment of animals, which will help in conserving the efficacy of drugs.",

Physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. Botanical sampling revealed horseweed ( Conyza canadensis ) as the most abundant species and a potential allergen plant due to sesquiterpene lactones (SQL). Differential diagnosis strongly suggested that the clinical signs were the result of a hypersensitivity reaction to this plant. Former studies brought controversial data about the toxic or allergic potential of horseweed especially for equids thus our paper is the first interpretation of horseweed induced urticaria.",

During the diagnostic necropsy, a large volume of reddish pericardial and thoracic effusion was observed resembling heartwater disease. Ehrlichia cf. ewingii was detected from the thoracic effusion by PCR and sequencing. The selenium content of multiple organs (liver, kidney, heart and skeletal muscles) were measured, but no increase was found. PCR tests for the detection of adenoviruses from the liver, lungs and spleen were negative. The routine bacteriological culture from the liver did not yield specific results either. To establish a causal relationship between the presence of E. cf. ewingii and the animal's death, further investigations are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Assisted reproduction (AR) is a rapidly developing clinical area both in human and animal reproductive medicine. The assisted reproductive techniques (ART) used in human and animal AR are very similar and, in many cases, identical. Therefore, the laboratory/clinical assisted reproductive experiments with animals and their gametes/embryos are very useful for the development of procedures used in human AR. The purpose of the application of ARTs is basically the same in human and veterinary medicine, i.e. to promote and support reproduction. However, there is a marked difference between them in terms of indication. In human AR, these procedures are used to treat individuals and couples with fertility problems, so that they can have children. In veterinary medicine, however, ARTs are used on animals that are completely healthy from a reproductive biological point of view (fertile) but carry some advantageous genetic trait(s). Therefore, the purpose of application of ARTs is to have as many offspring as possible during their lifetime, more than what could be achieved naturally. Due to the large number of gametes/embryos transferred, the mouse and bovine species are the most suitable for gaining experience that can be directly applied in human AR. Assisted reproductive techniques can be performed under less stringent conditions in animals, thus accelerating progress in human AR.",

This study aimed to confirm these changes in beef cows. Blood samples collected one month before parturition from 434 clinically healthy, pregnant Hanwoo beef cows were analysed. Fourteen haematological parameters were measured using a Hemavet 950. The average CBC parameter values of four age groups (≤36, 37–72, 73–108, and ≥109 months) and four parity groups (parity 0, 1, 2–4, and ≥5) were compared. Ten parameters differed across the age groups ( P &lt; 0.05). Ten parameters also differed across the parity groups ( P &lt; 0.05). The CBC results of the pregnant cows differed for only one parameter when they were stratified by the sex of the calf confirmed after delivery and for two parameters based on the birth weight of the calf. Our results confirm that the CBC reference intervals in beef cows can be affected by age and parity. Additionally, these results emphasise the need to establish reference intervals for age- and parity-based subclasses of beef cattle to increase the accuracy of CBC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In small ruminants, assessing the success of superovulatory treatments can be challenging, as there is considerable variability between individual animals. The current „gold standard” for examination of the superovulated ovaries is laparoscopy. B-mode ultrasonography with a transrectal or transvaginal transducer can also be used to locate the ovarian structures. In this study, 23 Merino ewes were used to test two types of ultrasonographic examination techniques against laparoscopy. The ewes were treated with long-term (12 days) progesterone treatment followed by a single injection of eCG (1000 IU) at removal of the progesterone sponge. The animals were examined two days after sponge removal and 7 days after the first examination. The chance of localizing the ovaries was significantly higher with the transrectal method than with the vaginal ultrasonography ( P &gt; 0.05). In cases when the ovary was successfully visualized, there was a significant difference between the number of ovarian structures (antral follicles and corpora lutea) detected by transrectal ultrasonography and laparoscopy ( P &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference between intravaginal examination and laparoscopy in this regard. The current results are promising in the usefulness of vaginal ultrasonography as an alternative to the more commonly used transrectal technique. However, more research is needed to evaluate if either the transrectal or the vaginal ultrasound examination can be completely reliable in assessing the results of a superovulatory treatment.",

A total of 45 tumoural masses taken from 22 dogs with mammary tumours were included in the study. Based on the histopathological results of mammary tissues, study groups were formed as bening tumours (Group BT; n = 15) and malignant tumours (Group MT; n = 30) with Group MT divided into 2 subgroups as malignant epithelial tumours (Group MET; n = 16), carcinosarcomas and malignant mixed tumours (Group MMT; n = 14). Mean ER and EGFR levels in Group BT were significantly higher than both in Group MT ( P &lt; 0.01) and Group MET ( P &lt; 0.05). In Group MET, only PR levels exhibited significant differences related to the clinicopathological parameters. In conclusion, with the PR biomarker, a distinction can be made between Grade 2 and Grade 3 tumours and invasive or non-invasive tumours. It has been observed that these biomarkers can reveal the presence of the tumour and may be beneficial in evaluating the clinical and pathological characteristics of the tumour.",

Paired samples t -test values, Passing-Bablok regression equations and Bland-Altman plots were generated following statistical analysis of the total protein values. Statistical analysis revealed that the refractometer produced a significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher mean total protein value than the biuret method. The statistical precision and accuracy were 97.16% and 97.52%, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficient test (0.9476) showed a strong linear relationship between the total protein values obtained by the two methods and a moderate agreement between the two methods of total protein determination, but based on the Passing- Bablok analysis, both methods can be used independently. Furthermore, the CUSUM test for linearity with a large P of 0.10 also indicated a linear relationship between the two methods. The Bland-Altman plot indicated an analytical error of 3.0% which is clinically insignificant. The refractometry method was accurate with high precision for the determination of plasma total protein concentrations in cattle. It is portable, accurate and cost-effective.",

Yersinia ruckeri was reisolated from the internal organs of all experimental fish. By histopathological examination moribund fish had generalised bacteriaemia with inflammation, degeneration and necrotic foci in kidney, liver and spleen, corresponding to findings described pre- viously in ERM of rainbow trout. Survivors of challenge on Day 28 had a chronic disease characterised by prominent peritonitis and enteritis, exhaustion of the erythroid, granuloid and lymphoid components in haematopoietic kidney tissue as well as focal degeneration and necrosis in organs. These data indicate a high sen- sitivity of carp to intraperitoneal infection with a relatively low dose of Y. ruckeri .",

A total of 12 lambs and 12 goats were divided into two equal groups as control and Zn groups in separate experiments. The lambs and goats of the control groups were fed basal rations alone. The Zn contents of these rations prepared for lambs and goats were 40 mg/kg and 35 mg/kg in dry matter (DM), respectively. Both species of animals in the Zn groups were fed a basal ration supplemented with zinc sulphate adjusted to 250 mg Zn/kg diet in DM. The feeding trial lasted for 12 weeks in lambs and 8 weeks in goats. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein at 4-week intervals. Both animal species in the Zn groups had higher plasma Zn values than the controls throughout the experimental period, except in the 4th week in goats. However, the levels of serum total thyroxine (T 4 ) and triiodothyronine (T 3 ) were lower in the lambs and goats of the Zn groups, except in the 4th week, as compared to those in the controls. Moreover, serum total thyroid hormone levels of the goats were higher at the 4th week than at the 8th week. Although there was a decrease in the levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine of both small ruminant species in the Zn groups when compared to the controls, these alterations were not statistically significant. These results may show that zinc supplementation to the diet at this dose reduces total thyroid hormone levels in small ruminants but does not yet impair the euthyroid status of the organism.",

To facilitate this, the immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive effect of a mild (G-87), an intermediate (LIBD) and an intermediate-plus (IBDV 2512) IBDV strain were tested after the in ovo inoculation of 18-day-old SPF and broiler chicken embryos. It was established that no noteworthy difference existed between the immunized and the control embryos in hatching rate and hatching weight. The higher the virulence of the vaccine virus strain, the more severe damage it caused to the lymphocytes of the bursa of Fabricius. In SPF chickens, the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres induced by a Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine administered at day old decreased in inverse ratio to the virulence of the IBD vaccine strain, while in broiler chickens this was not observed. Despite the decrease of the HI titre, the level of protection did not decline, or did so only after the use of the ‘hot’ strain. SPF chickens immunized in ovo with a complex vaccine prepared from strain IBDV 2512 and IBD antibody showed the same protection against Newcastle disease as the broilers. In broiler chicken embryos immunized in ovo , only strain IBDV 2512 induced antibody production, and such chickens were protected against IBD at 3 weeks of age.

Histological examination revealed necrosis of the epithelial layer and lympho-histiocytic vasculitis in the corium, here and there accompanied by thrombosis and fibrinoid degeneration. The kidneys were pale brown and harder to tear, with cortical petechiae in most cases. By histopathological examination, intra- and extracapillary glomerulonephritis accompanied by fibrinoid exudation was seen. Some of the renal tubules were dilated, others were atrophied, and in advanced cases proliferation of the intertubular connective tissue and inflammatory cell infiltration also occurred.

The average incidence of BVDV antibodies (around 70%) was similar as determined 30 years ago. Of 84 serum samples from seronegative animals originating from 14 farms in which 70-98% seropositivity was observed, six were positive in Ag-BVDV ELISA indicating persistently infected (PI) cattle. On a farm to which animals were imported from abroad, a BVD outbreak was observed. Of 110 animals tested, four were positive in Ag-ELISA indicating the presence of PI cattle on this farm. Genetic typing of two isolates from imported animals performed by RT-PCR (324/326 primers from 5´-UTR), sequencing of PCR products and computer-assisted phylogenetic analysis revealed that they belong to BVDV-1h group.",

Silver carp and bighead were infected at a similar rate, having 8 to 27 copepods attached to the end of the clubbed filaments or the proliferated epithelium of 2 to 10 fused filaments. In histological sections the head part of the parasite was found in a deep cavity of the proliferated epithelium, piercing its antennae deep into the tissues. Only the end of the filaments showed changes. In this part the proliferated epithelium was infiltrated by eosinophilic granular cells. In the central and basal parts of the hemibranchia the original structure of the filaments was preserved with intact secondary lamellae.",

Infection causes damage and necrosis of the endothelial cells. The virus was not observed in the parenchymal cells.

Typhimurium) specific PCR systems in screening faecal and caecal samples of poultry, poultry feed and poultrymeat for Salmonella, by keeping the opportunity to obtain Salmonella cultures from positive samples. Peptone broth pre-enrichment cultures of the samples were tested by PCR. In faecal and caecal samples from broiler chicks a strong inhibitory action was frequently observed. This could be reduced markedly by the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) acting as amplification facilitator. The results of testing pre-enrichment cultures from artificially contaminated faecal, poultry feed and poultrymeat samples (using S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S. Hadar as contaminants) suggest that the sensitivity of the above systems is 10(1)-10(2) CFU g(-1) sample. The testing of 95 caecal samples from slaughtered chicks resulted in 49% culture-positive and 76% PCR-positive samples. The suitability of a generic real-time PCR for testing faecal samples of poultry was also studied. Its detection limit for these samples was found to be lower than that of the diagnostic PCR system. Both methods reduced the time required for Salmonella detection to 24-30 h, and the advantage of the real-time PCR was its increased sensitivity. We have established a diagnostic and a real-time PCR system for rapid and reliable genus- and serovar- (S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium) specific detection of Salmonella for monitoring purposes in the poultry food chain. Sensitivity is equal to, or higher than, that of the standard bacterial culture method, and the method still provides the Salmonella culture if needed.",

Adrenocortical cells were incubated with or without genistein, daidzein, biochanin A (0.5, 5, 10 or 50 microM), oestradiol (10, 50, 100 or 500 pg/mL) and ACTH (5 nM--positive control). All incubations were performed for 8 h (95% air and 5% CO2, 37 degrees C). ACTH increased cortisol and androstenedione secretion. Genistein, daidzein and biochanin A suppressed cortisol output, whereas androstenedione secretion was enhanced by these phytoestrogens. In contrast, oestradiol did not alter steroid secretion by porcine adrenocortical cells, which may suggest that phytoestrogens have a non-oestrogenic mechanism of action.

In the uterus, ERs were present in the stromal cells, while ERβ was present in the luminal epithelium. In the non-reproductive fetal porcine tissues ERβ was localised in the lungs, kidneys, adrenal glands and in the umbilical cords. Both ERs were observed in the intestine.

Plasma corticosterone levels in hens reared in standard and enriched cages and those kept on deep litter from 15 to 75 weeks of age were evaluated. The highest corticosterone levels were observed in hens kept on deep litter, which was associated with a lower intensity of egg production, longest time of movement and a high percentage of time spent dustbathing and scratching. Hens housed in the enriched environment exhibited low levels of aggression, low body weight at the end of the experiment and similar or higher corticosterone levels compared to those of hens kept under standard conditions. Thus, the results of the present study show that housing technologies which are more similar to the animal’s natural environment need not be associated with decreased levels of plasma corticosterone. Keeping hens in traditional cage technology was not found to be particularly stressful, which may be an important finding with respect to the current restrictions on outside housing in regions with an increased risk of viral infection.",

On 23 February (day 0), slow-release melatonin implants were inserted subcutaneously into rams (n = 8). Control animals (n = 8) received no treatment. In both groups, basic semen parameters (concentration, total motility, fast and slow forward motility, morphology), GnRH-induced testosterone response and basal IGF-I concentration were evaluated on days 0, 47 and 71. No differences were found in concentration of spermatozoa, total motility, and numbers of spermatozoa with fast and slow progressive motility and normal/abnormal morphology between the melatonin-treated and the control group. However, in melatonin-treated animals, basal and GnRH-induced testosterone levels were slightly elevated on day 47 and became significantly higher on day 71 (P &lt; 0.05) as compared to controls. There was no difference in plasma IGF-I levels between the groups. In conclusion, slow-release melatonin applied during the non-breeding season improves testicular testosterone production but does not influence the semen characteristics and the IGF-I level of semen donor Awassi rams used in an AI programme and kept in the temperate continental zone of Europe.",

Three serial sections were prepared in each case. Two sections were pre-treated with enzyme and heat, respectively, while the last section was not pre-treated. In seven cases the sensitivity of histochemical staining (HSM), IHC and bacteriological culture were compared. Heating of the sections in a microwave oven was the most effective method in the case of almost all pathogens used. Strong or moderate positive reactions were observed for 26 bacterial species, all fungal and 2 protozoal species, while weak reactions occurred for 2 bacterial and 1 protozoal species. Only 4 protozoal and 12 bacterial species, including Leptospira and all the five Mycoplasma species examined, showed no reaction in this test. IHC had almost the same sensitivity as bacteriological culture and was more sensitive than HSM. The IHC method presented here should be preferred to HSM as a general screening tool in cases where pathological lesions suspicious for infections are evident and no microorganism can be cultured in vitro or only formalin-fixed tissue samples are available for the laboratory examination.",

    "abstract": "Atrophic rhinitis (AR) is a widespread and economically important disease of swine caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica and Pasteurella multocida . It can be controlled by vaccination. This study investigates the effect of altering the composition (adjuvants and/or addition of formalin-inactivated P. multocida toxin, fPMT) of conventional vaccines on the serological profile and on protection against AR in swine. A significantly higher B. bronchiseptica specific antibody titre was detected for vaccines with novel immunostimulants, the best being Montanide IMS 1313 (1:630 compared to 1:274 obtained with alum). The highest B. bronchiseptica antibody titre was demonstrated for a combination of B. bronchiseptica — fPMT, while PMT antibody titre was highest for monovalent fPMT (both adjuvanted with IMS 1313). The AR-specific antibodies were transmitted from dams to their offspring in similar titres and with the same hierarchy of effectiveness. After a B. bronchiseptica — P. multocida bacterial challenge, piglets from dams vaccinated with fPMT combined with B. bronchiseptica or B. bronchiseptica — P. multocida bacterins showed the lowest nasal lesions scores (4.5 and 3.2, respectively, out of a possible maximum score of 18). These combinations, both of which were adjuvanted with IMS 1313, gave the best protection against experimentally induced AR. Our results show that the adjuvant and the antigen composition of the vaccine strongly affect seroconversion, and that the AR-specific antibody titre does not necessarily correlate with the degree of protection.",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected into the positive control group. The other six groups received three different tylosin doses concurrently without or with LPS: 10 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg + LPS, 100 mg/kg + LPS and 500 mg/kg + LPS. After treatment, serum samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin 1beta (IL1beta) and IL10 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tylosin doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg induced no cytokine production in the healthy mice. Tylosin at 500 mg/kg had no effect on TNFalpha or IL1beta production, but it induced IL10 production in healthy mice. All doses of tylosin reduced the elevated TNFalpha and IL1beta in LPS-treated mice but increased their IL10 levels. In conclusion, these data suggest that tylosin has an immunomodulatory effect at the dose recommended for use against infection.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to establish the effect of intravesical administration of resiniferatoxin (RTX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) on the chemical coding of paracervical ganglion (PCG) neurons supplying the urinary bladder in the pig. In order to identify the PCG neurons innervating the bladder, retrograde tracer Fast Blue was injected into the bladder wall prior to intravesical RTX or TTX administration. Consequent application of immunocytochemical methods revealed that in the control group 76.82% of Fast Blue positive PCG neurons contain nitric oxide synthetase (nNOS), and 66.92% contain acetylcholine transferase (ChAT). Intravesical infusion of RTX resulted in a reduction of the nNOS-IR neurons to 57.74% and ChAT-IR to 57.05%. Alternative administration of TTX induced an increase of nNOS-IR neurons up to 79.29% and a reduction of the ChAT-IR population down to 3.73% of the Fast Blue positive PCG cells. Our data show that both neurotoxins affect the chemical coding of PCG cells supplying the porcine urinary bladder, but the effects of their action are different. Moreover, these results shed light on the possible involvement of NO-ergic and cholinergic neurons in the mechanisms of therapeutic action exerted by RTX and TTX in curing the overactive bladder disorder.",

    "abstract": "The 2006 epidemic due to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 in Hungary caused the most severe losses in waterfowl which were, according to the literature at the time, supposed to be the most resistant to this pathogen. The presence of pathological lesions and the amount of viral antigen were quantified by gross pathology, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the organs of four waterfowl species [mute swans (n = 10), domestic geese (n = 6), mulard ducks (n = 6) and Pekin ducks (n = 5)] collected during the epidemic. H5N1 subtype HPAIV was isolated from all birds examined. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR) was also applied on a subset of samples [domestic geese (n = 3), mulard (n = 4) and Pekin duck (n = 4)] in order to compare its sensitivity with IHC. Viral antigen was detected by IHC in all cases. However, the overall presence of viral antigen in tissue samples was quite variable: virus antigen was present in 56/81 (69%) swan, 22/38 (58%) goose, 28/46 (61%) mulard duck and 5/43 (12%) Pekin duck tissue samples. HPAIV subtype H5N1 was detected by qRRT-PCR in all birds examined, in 19/19 (100%) goose, 7/28 (25%) mulard duck and 12/28 (43%) Pekin duck tissue samples. As compared to qRRTPCR, the IHC was less sensitive in geese and Pekin ducks but more sensitive in mulard ducks. The IHC was consistently positive above 4.31 log10 copies/reaction but it gave very variable results below that level. Neurotropism of the isolated virus strains was demonstrated by finding the largest amount of viral antigen and the highest average RNA load in the brain in all four waterfowl species examined.",

Significant differences were demonstrated between autumn-winter (P = 0.012) and autumn-spring (P = 0.015) in testis volume. The highest basic T concentration (Tb) was observed in autumn and the lowest in summer. The provoked T concentration (Tincr) was significantly higher in autumn than in spring (P = 0.0007). A strong correlation was observed between T concentrations and testis volume in spring. The highest ejaculate volume was measured in winter while the lowest in autumn. Significant differences were found in semen concentration as well as in the total number of spermatozoa per ejaculate between seasons. The highest number of abnormal sperm cells was observed in spring while the lowest in summer. It can be concluded that the ejaculate of the Mangalica breed tends to be of lower volume and higher sperm concentration as compared to most pig breeds. Seasonal differences could be observed in testicular measurements, testosterone production capacity and sperm morphological features; however, sperm motility remained constantly high during the study.",

    "abstract": "Relatively few, and inconsistent, data are available in the literature about the properties of EnSeal®, an electrosurgical tissue-sealing device. For this reason, we conducted control safety tests on experimental pigs. The mean burst pressure of sealed vessels (2-7 mm in diameter) proved to be 873.89 ± 120.57 mmHg (n = 60). Surface temperature increased to 69.25 ± 0.98 °C in average (n = 22). The mean diameter of the collateral microscopic thermal injury zone was found to be 0.28 ± 0.04 mm, and it did not show significant differences among the groups of tissues studied (n = 183). During our studies, the device worked reliably and met the relevant requirements in all cases. It can be established that EnSeal® enables high-safety clinical interventions at high blood pressure values, in different tissues and even at sites adjacent to heat-sensitive tissues, and thus it paves the way for new operative solutions in both human and veterinary surgery. In our opinion, the discrepancies between data reported in the literature arise from differences in the design of studies and in the designated limit values. To ensure standardisation, we recommend the use of the nitroblue-tetrazolium chloride/lactate dehydrogenase (NBTC/LDH) enzyme histochemical technique for studying thermal injury induced by the different performance levels and application times of devices operating with electromagnetic energy.",

    "abstract": "Mastitis is a persistent, inflammatory reaction of the udder tissue, which entails a decline in potassium, and is also responsible for a higher somatic cell count (SCC) and electrical conductivity (EC) of milk. The measurement of EC is an indirect, rapid method to detect subclinical mastitis from milk. The aim of this study was to analyse the EC of milk throughout the lactation, around the day of mastitis detection, and also to estimate its heritability based on data from a large-scale dairy farm. Shortly after calving the EC value generally decreases; however, it was discovered that from the thirteenth week onwards, substantial differences arise between the mastitic and healthy groups of cows. The authors observed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in EC before the detection of clinical mastitis. This higher value (around 11 mS) persisted for 4 days, then it gradually returned to the normal level. The EC of milk from daughters sired by different bulls responded differently in case of mastitis. The heritability of EC seems to be high (h2 = 0.56). Therefore, the EC trait can be a beneficial indicator in detecting mastitis and should be considered in sire selection.",

All calves were born C. burnetii seronegative. Only those born to seropositive dams seroconverted following colostrum intake. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the likelihood of dam seropositivity was 21 and 4.85 times higher for multiparous than for primiparous (65.6% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.006) and for prepartum shedding cows (75% vs. 38.2%, P = 0.03) compared to the remaining animals, respectively. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate no detectable precolostral antibody response in calves born from dams with cotyledons positive for C. burnetii by qPCR. In order to analyse the possibility of persistent infection due to immunotolerance to an early in utero infection, further studies will need to test for C. burnetii DNA. In addition, in the present study multiparous cows showed a significantly higher seroprevalence than primiparous cows and heifers, colostral antibodies were efficiently transferred to newborn calves, and there was a link between bacterial shedding on days 171-177 of gestation and Coxiella seropositivity of the dam.",

Five groups of M. hyopneumoniae with thirteen to twenty-four serine repeats were observed. Analysis of three samples from each farm indicated that the specific isolate is ubiquitous in pigs of different ages. Furthermore, seven clusters were observed within 27 tested samples.

The objective of the present study was to compare a conventional phenotypic method with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA (16S rDNA RFLP) for identification of streptococci isolated from composite milk samples collected in connection with intramammary infection (IMI) in six Argentinean dairy farms. Composite milk samples (n = 1223) from cows belonging to six herds were collected for bacteriological analysis. Twelve reference strains and fifty streptococci or streptococcuslike isolates were identified to species level by the API 20 Strep system, conventional biochemical tests and 16S rDNA RFLP in a blind assay. The remaining streptococci or streptococcus-like isolates (n = 40) were identified to the species level both by 16S rDNA RFLP and conventional biochemical tests. As indicated by Kappa values, agreement between the 16S rDNA RFLP and the conventional scheme for identification of Streptococcus agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis, S. equinus and Enterococcus faecalis was 0.91, 0.73, 0.92, 0.81 and 0.85, respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper reports an outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by Pasteurella multocida B:2 in beef calves, a disease that has not been described in the Hungarian literature since 1943, and has not been reported to the World Organisation For Animal Health (OIE) since 1970. Acute haemorrhagic septicaemia was confirmed in beef calves on one small farm, and was suspected on two further nearby holdings with concomitant unexplained losses. The source of the infection could not be determined. Apart from a short duration of depression and loss of appetite, the affected calves developed characteristic distal limb oedema. Gross findings in two calves submitted for laboratory examinations included subcutaneous oedema and haemorrhages on serous membranes, and in one case severe pharyngeal lymph node enlargement was observed. Histological examinations revealed lesions characteristic of septicaemia. Moderate to large amounts of Pasteurella antigens were detected in all organs tested by immunohistochemistry. Two isolates of P. multocida (Pm240, Pm241) were cultured from these cases and examined in detail. These were identified as P. multocida ssp. multocida biovar 3. Both were toxA negative and belonged to serotype B:2. Multilocus sequence typing was used to assign these to a new sequence type (ST64) that is closely related to other haemorrhagic septicaemia causing strains of P. multocida regardless of the host.",

The aqueous portion of the tear film was measured using Schirmer tear test (STT) commercial strips bilaterally by the same investigator with the animal in standing position. The average STT value recorded was 18.45 ± 3.93 mm/min and the range 10.8–26.2 mm/min. STT was significantly affected by the season and the recorded values were significantly higher in summer compared to winter. The breed had no significant effect on tear secretion. The results of the present study provide a reference range of STT values in sheep and indicate that tear secretion is significantly affected by the season.",

Increased LYM counts were observed in E1 throughout the study, whereas in E2 the LYM counts were higher only between days 14 and 28, and consistently lower in E3. The MID count had broadly comparable values for all groups. Stimulation of the CD2(+) response was observed in E2 and E3 in contrast with E1 which had a lower CD2(+) throughout. The CD4(+) response was dominant in E1 and E2, whereas in E3 a parallel CD4(+) and CD8(+) stimulation was observed. The B-cell response (WC4(+)) and an increased CD4:CD8 ratio was most apparent in E1. The main host responses to M. bovis infections are a stimulation of CD4(+) cells and an enhancement of the WC4(+) response.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of caprine oocytes and embryos to retinoids enhances embryonic development, but the mechanisms governing this phenomenon have not been characterised. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the incidence of apoptosis is affected by the addition of retinyl acetate (RAc) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) during in vitro maturation (IVM) of caprine oocytes. Embryonic development was recorded on days 3 and 8 post-fertilisation, and apoptosis was measured by caspase activity and DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay). Control zygotes had lower capacity to cleave and reach the blastocyst stage (24.45 ± 2.32 and 5.32 ± 0.81, respectively) than those of RAc- (29.96 ± 1.62 and 7.94 ± 0.93, respectively) and RA-treated groups (30.12 ± 1.51 and 7.36 ± 1.02, respectively). Oocytes and blastocysts positive for TUNEL assay were more frequent, respectively, in the controls (8.20 ± 0.78, 8.70 ± 1.05) than in RAc (5.60 ± 0.52, 4.80 ± 0.51) and RA (6.40 ± 0.69, 5.40 ± 0.69). Caspase activity did not differ between control oocytes (7.20 ± 0.91), RAc (6.60 ± 0.68) and RA (7.30 ± 0.67), but it was reduced in RAc- (5.05 ± 0.62) and RA-treated blastocysts (5.75 ± 0.22) compared to controls (8.35 ± 0.71). These results indicate that the addition of retinoids during IVM increases the developmental potential of goat embryos with a concomitant reduction in apoptosis rates.",

The results show, for the first time, that the exposure of chick embryos to EMF augments the heart rate, especially from 17 days of incubation. The increased heart rate in the embryos exposed to EMF was associated with considerable increases in plasma T4 and T3 concentrations, which were recorded during the final stage of embryogenesis. The significant effect of the 100-μT field on heart weight and blood AST levels in the embryos suggests that EMF has a direct effect on the physiological function of cardiac muscle.",

Since pigs represent a likely animal reservoir for the hepatitis E virus, the epidemiology of naturally occurring hepatitis E was investigated in Croatian swine herds. Nearly all tested animals were seropositive for antibodies against the hepatitis E virus (55/60, 91.7%). Active infection was detected in all age groups by RT-PCR of viral RNA in serum (8/60, 13.3%) and bile samples (3/37, 8.1%), which was further confirmed by histopathological findings of characteristic lesions in the livers of the infected animals. Three new strains of hepatitis E virus were isolated from Croatian pig herds. Phylogenetic analysis using median-joining networks clustered those Croatian strains with isolates from various parts of the world, indicating their likely origin in international trade. Similarity to human isolates implies a zoonotic potential of Croatian strains, which raises a public health concern, especially in the light of the high prevalence of hepatitis E in the herds studied.",

The tumour was 0.5 cm in diameter and macroscopically appeared as a single dermal mass, but histopathological analysis identified it as a biphasic collision mixed tumour. In the anatomically uniform tumour, 70% (4 mm in diameter) of the total parenchyma was formed by a high-grade sarcoma (with the presence of giant cells), and about 30% of it (1 mm in diameter) was a malignant melanoma (again with the presence of giant cells). The histologically distinct, but anatomically uniform tumour parts were separated by a macroscopically invisible, non-neoplastic epithelial process originating from the overlying hyperplastic epidermis. The two malignant components did not infiltrate the peritumoural vessels and each other's substance. In the sarcoma part, the mitotic and apoptotic indexes were 32 and 8, respectively, whereas in the melanoma part the same parameters were 10 and 6, respectively. During the immunohistochemical investigations anti-α-SMA, anticytokeratin AE1-AE3, anti-Melan-A, anti-Ki-67 and anti-claudin-5 antibodies were applied. In conclusion, this is the first report of a primary cutaneous malignant biphasic collision mixed tumour formed by an anaplastic sarcoma with giant cells and a malignant melanoma.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between metabolic disorders and the distribution of fat in different body regions is not clearly understood in humans. The aim of this study was to develop a suitable method for assessing the regional distribution of fat deposits and their metabolic effects in dogs. Twenty-five dogs were subjected to computed tomographic (CT) imaging and blood sampling in order to characterise their metabolic status. The different fat areas were measured on a cross-sectional scan, and the animals' metabolic status was evaluated by measuring fasting glucose, insulin and leptin levels. The volume of visceral adipose tissue is the main determinant of leptin levels. The correlation of visceral fat volume and leptin concentration was found to be independent of insulin levels or the degree of insulin resistance. There was a positive correlation between the visceral to subcutaneous fat volume ratio and serum insulin concentration, and a similar trend was observed in the relationship of fat ratio and insulin resistance. The distribution of body fat essentially influences the metabolic parameters in dogs, but the effects of adiposity differ between humans and dogs. The findings can facilitate a possible extrapolation of results from animal studies to humans with regard to the metabolic consequences of different obesity types.",

    "abstract": "Man-made barriers are well known for their effects on ecosystems. Habitat fragmentation, for instance, is a recognised consequence of modern-day infrastructure. The aim of the present study was to investigate the diversity and abundance of tick species, as well as the risks of acquiring tick-borne infections in habitats adjacent to a freeway. Therefore, ixodid ticks were collected from the vegetation at two-week intervals (in the main tick season, from March to June) in eight habitats of different types (forest, grove, grassland) along both sides of a freeway. Ixodes ricinus females were molecularly screened for three species of tick-borne bacteria. In the study period, 887 ixodid ticks were collected. These included 704 I. ricinus (79.4%), 51 Dermacentor reticulatus (5.7%), 78 D. marginatus (8.8%), 35 Haemaphysalis inermis (3.9%) and 19 H. concinna (2.1%). There was no significant difference in the abundance of tick species between similar habitats separated by the freeway, except for the absence of Dermacentor spp. on one side. In I. ricinus females, the overall prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum was low, and (in part due to this low rate) did not show significant difference between the two sides of the freeway. Rickettsia helvetica had significantly different overall prevalence between two distant habitats along the same side of the freeway (12.3% vs. 31.4%), but not between habitats on the opposite sides. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. showed significantly different overall prevalence between habitats both on the same and on the opposite sides of the freeway (8.6–35.9%), and the difference was higher if relevant habitats were also separated by the freeway. Importantly, the prevalence rate of the Lyme disease agent was highest in a forested resting area of the freeway, and was significantly inversely proportional to the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum (taking into account all evaluated habitats), apparently related to deer population density. Prevalence rates of these bacteria also differed significantly on single sampling occasions between: (1) closely situated habitats of different types; (2) distant and either similar or different habitat types; and (3) habitats on the opposite sides of the freeway. In conclusion, the findings of the present study show that a fenced freeway may contribute to differences in tick species diversity and tick-borne pathogen prevalence along its two sides, and this effect is most likely a consequence of its barrier role preventing deer movements.",

Samples from the caecum were collected on days 4 and 7 post Campylobacter infection (dpi), for the isolation of mRNA of TGF-β4, IL-17 and for immunohistochemistry. The relative mRNA expression of TGF-β4 was upregulated in the combined (EFAL41 + CJ) group compared to other groups during both samplings, but the expression of IL-17 was downregulated. Similarly, the highest density of CD3+ was detected in the combined group at 7 dpi, but the number of IgA+ cells was increased in both groups with EFAL41. It was concluded that the EFAL41 probiotic E. faecium strain can modulate the expression of selected cytokines (upregulation of TGF-β4 but downregulation of IL-17 relative expression), and activate IgA-producing cells in the caeca of chicks infected with C. jejuni CCM6191.",

    "abstract": "It is known that inflammatory organ damages due to various agents, such as microorganisms including mycoplasmas, lead to oxidative stress. Nitric oxide (NO) functions as an antimicrobial agent, and arginase decreases proinflammatory cytokine release. There are very few studies on arginase activity, NO level and oxidative stress status in mycoplasmal infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate erythrocyte arginase activity, plasma NO level and oxidative stress status in sheep with contagious agalactia. The study material consisted of 10 healthy sheep and 14 sheep with contagious agalactia characterised by mastitis, arthritis and keratoconjunctivitis. Erythrocyte arginase activity, plasma NO, malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidant capacity (TOC) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels were measured. Significant decreases in erythrocyte arginase activity and plasma TAC level (P &lt; 0.001), and significant increases in plasma NO, MDA and TOC levels (P &lt; 0.001) were found in the diseased sheep as compared with the healthy animals. This study suggests that contagious agalactia may cause oxidative stress due to increased plasma MDA and TOC levels and decreased plasma TAC levels, and that the decrease in erythrocyte arginase activity and increase in plasma NO level may contribute to the elimination of mycoplasmal agents causing contagious agalactia.",

A total of 30 tumours were examined in parallel to patient history. The tumours were allotted to four groups: tubulopapillar carcinomas, complex carcinomas, benign tumours, and other malignant tumours. A monoclonal mouse antibody (C494) was used for the immunohistochemical evaluation of Pgp and a polyclonal rabbit antibody for p53. We found that the intact ductal epithelium and connective tissue showed pronounced Pgp expression. The most intensive staining was detected in tubulopapillar carcinomas for both Pgp and p53. The expression rate of Pgp and p53 differed significantly between tubulopapillar carcinoma and complex carcinoma, and between tubulopapillar carcinoma and benign mammary tumour, respectively. The expressions of Pgp and p53 highly correlated statistically; therefore, both can determine malignancy in a similar manner. In the case of tubulopapillar carcinomas, more relapsed tumours occurred than in relation to complex carcinomas and other malignant tumours. Pgp expression rate was proportional to the probability of the tumour becoming recidivant postoperatively, as well. These results suggest that routine evaluation of Pgp expression in canine mammary tumours may be prognostically helpful.",

CDT is a heterotripartite toxin consisting of three protein subunits, CdtA, CdtB and CdtC. The active subunit, CdtB has DNase activity and causes DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in the target cell. However, several studies have highlighted different roles for CdtA and CdtC subunits. In order to reveal the necessity of CdtA and CdtC subunit proteins in the CDT-specific phenotype, expression clones containing the cdt-V subunit genes were constructed. Using cell culture assays, we demonstrated that clones expressing only the CdtB subunit or in combination with only CdtA or CdtC were unable to trigger the specific cell cycle arrest and changes in cell morphology in HeLa cells. At the same time, the recombinant clone harbouring the whole cdt-V operon caused all the CDT-associated characteristic phenotypes. All these results verify that all the three CDT subunit proteins are necessary for the genotoxic effect caused by CDT-V.",

Accordingly, the authors initiated a survey among the major poultry producers in Hungary in order to reveal the prevailing IBV serotypes in the country. Tracheal swabs and organ samples (caecal tonsils, kidneys, and trachea) were collected from broiler, layer, and meat-type breeder flocks, and were subjected to IBV detection by virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The IBV-positive samples were further characterised by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the S1 IBV gene. Seventeen out of the 26 submitted samples proved to be positive for IBV. Sequence analyses revealed ten 4/91 and six QX serotypes, and a single D274 type IB virus. One sample contained a mixture of QX and Massachusetts serotype viruses. Presumably most of the 4/91 and D274 type viruses were vaccine strains. The proportion of QX type viruses and their observed variation are in good agreement with the situation in a few other European countries. The detected viruses clustered largely according to their geographic origin, with a few exceptions. If updated regularly, the preliminary 'virus map' will be useful for the adjustment of vaccination protocols.",

    "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) bacteria frequently cause watery diarrhoea in newborn and weaned pigs. Plasmids carrying genes of different enterotoxins and fimbrial adhesins, as well as plasmids conferring antimicrobial resistance are of prime importance in the epidemiology and pathogenesis of ETEC. Recent studies have revealed the significance of the porcine ETEC plasmid pTC, carrying tetracycline resistance gene tet (B) with enterotoxin genes. In contrast, the role of tet (A) plasmids in transferring resistance of porcine ETEC is less understood. The objective of the present study was to provide a comparative analysis of antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene profiles of porcine post-weaning ETEC strains representing pork-producing areas in Central Europe and in the USA, with special attention to plasmids carrying the tet (A) gene. Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypes of 87 porcine ETEC strains isolated from cases of post-weaning diarrhoea in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the Midwest USA was determined by disk diffusion and by PCR. Central European strains carrying tet (A) or tet (B) were further subjected to molecular characterisation of their tet plasmids. Results indicated that &gt; 90% of the ETEC strains shared a common multidrug resistant (MDR) pattern of sulphamethoxazole (91%), tetracycline (84%) and streptomycin (80%) resistance. Tetracycline resistance was most frequently determined by the tet (B) gene (38%), while tet (A) was identified in 26% of all isolates with wide ranges for both tet gene types between some countries and with class 1 integrons and resistance genes co-transferred by conjugation. The virulence gene profiles included enterotoxin genes ( lt , sta and/or stb ), as well as adhesin genes ( k88 / f4 , f18 ). Characterisation of two representative tet (A) plasmids of porcine F18 + ETEC from Central Europe revealed that the IncF plasmid (pES11732) of the Czech strain (~120 kb) carried tet (A) in association with catA1 for chloramphenicol resistance. The IncI1 plasmid (pES2172) of the Hungarian strain (~138 kb) carried tet (A) gene and a class 1 integron with an unusual variable region of 2,735 bp composed by two gene cassettes: estX - aadA1 encoding for streptothricin-spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance exemplifying simultaneous recruitment, assembly and transfer of multidrug resistance genes by the tet (A) plasmid of porcine ETEC. By this we provide the first description of IncF and IncI1 type plasmids of F18 + porcine enterotoxigenic E. coli responsible for cotransfer of the tet (A) gene with multidrug resistance. Additionally, the unusual determinant estX, encoding for streptothricin resistance, is first reported here in porcine enterotoxigenic E. coli .",

We observed significantly increased expression of genes important for M. synoviae pathogenicity, including cysteine protease cysP , neuraminidase nanH , haemagglutinin vlhA , and the putative nuclease MS53_0284. Moreover, the pattern of gene expression was dependent on the infection environment. In CCH, significant changes in the expression of genes encoding catabolic enzymes of the cartilage extracellular matrix (cathepsins B, K and L, aggrecanase ADAM10, and matrix metalloproteinase MMP2) were demonstrated. Infection of CCH with M. synoviae also elevated the expression of the gene encoding peptidyl arginine deiminase, type III (PADI3), which is responsible for the post-translational citrullination of proteins.",

It was concluded that most of the cases were related to locations with a medium to high urbanisation index, although the proximity of mosquito-bearing waters also played an important role in the observed spatial infection patterns.

Mean colostral IgG level of sheep was 156.68 ± 7.23 g L-1, optical and digital Brix refractometer values (%) were determined as 27.43 ± 0.53 and 27.69 ± 0.60, respectively. Ewes carrying twin lambs produced significantly higher quality colostrum than those carrying single lambs. However, parity did not affect the colostrum quality. Optical and digital Brix values were correlated with gold standard radial immunodiffusion (RID) colostral IgG level (r = 0.70 and r = 0.64, respectively). Also, optical and digital Brix refractometers were found to be highly correlated (r = 0.98, P < 0.001). While the optimal Brix value was 22% for the 50, 60 and 70 g L-1 IgG threshold values (by means of RID as the potential good quality threshold value for ewe colostrum quality), this value was 23% for 80 g L-1. We can conclude that Brix refractometers is a valuable tool for determining ewe colostrum quality. A cut point of 22% Brix for defining good quality colostrum in ewes was most appropriate for our data.",

Tiamulin provoked a dose-dependent hepatic enzyme induction. The combined administration of monensin and tiamulin at low doses (10 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) resulted in marked elevation of P450-related enzyme activities. The enzyme induction was more pronounced in females than in males.

The following ultrasonographic diagnoses were established compared to surgical findings: gallbladder obstruction caused by bile sludge (correct/incorrect: 1/2, surgical diagnosis: choleliths in one case), gallbladder obstruction caused by neoplasm (0/1, surgical diagnosis: mucocele), gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction due to choleliths (3/3), extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction caused by pancreatic mass (1/1) and small intestinal volvulus (1/1). Bile peritonitis caused by gallbladder rupture (4/4) was correctly diagnosed by ultrasound, aided with ultrasonographically-guided abdominocentesis and peritoneal fluid analysis. Rupture of the gallbladder should be suspected in the presence of a small, echogenic gallbladder or in the absence of the organ together with free abdominal fluid during ultrasonography. Laparotomy was correctly indicated by ultrasonography in all cases. However, the direct cause of obstruction could not be determined in 2 of the 12 dogs by ultrasonography alone.",

    "abstract": "There are two main theories explaining offspring sex biases in polygynous mammals. Trivers and Willard (1973) argue that mothers with greater reproductive resources should invest in the sex with the greater variance in reproductive success, usually sons. In contrast, because daughters in many polygynous mammals stay with their mother and compete with her for food, Local Resource Competition theory (e.g. Clark, 1978; Silk, 1983) predicts that the mothers with the greatest reproductive resources should invest in daughters. We investigated the strategy of sex allocation of a captive, outdoor population of 139 mouflon mothers, Ovis musimon, kept in a game state. A complex picture emerged in which, despite weight and body condition being correlated with age in female mouflons, mothers lambed more daughters with increasing age but also, within a given age, gave birth to more sons with increasing weight. Results may be useful in game management aimed at increasing the recruitment or quality of males in managed populations.",

The control group received the basic diet without any supplementation. The changes observed over time in the haematological parameters and in certain biochemical variables could be regarded as physiological. By day 21 of the experiment, beta-carotene supplementation had significantly lowered the neutrophilic granulocyte percentage and elevated the lymphocyte percentage, while in the other two groups a change of opposite tendency occurred. At the end of the experimental period there was a decrease in plasma vitamin E concentration due to carotene supplementation (control: 6.1 ± 1.5, nucleotide: 6.3 ± 2.5, carotene: 2.3 ± 1.5 mg/L).

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the interactions between growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on progesterone (P4) secretion by porcine luteal cells cultured in vitro . Cells isolated from corpora lutea (CL) collected at three different periods of the luteal phase (CL1 - early luteal phase; CL2 - middle luteal phase and CL3 - late luteal phase) were incubated with different doses of GH (10, 100 or 200 ng/ml). After 48 h cultures were terminated and the media were frozen until further P4 concentration analysis. GH (100 ng/ml) increased P4 secretion by CL1 and CL2 and had no effect on CL3. In separate studies these cells were treated for 48 h with IGF-I alone or with GH combined with IGF-I. IGF-I alone increased basal P4 secretion only by cells collected from CL1 while concurrent treatment with GH had no effect on P4 secretion by any type of CL. To investigate the possible mechanism of GH and IGF-I mediated induction of P4 secretion, an inhibitory study was conducted. In this experiment, luteal cells collected from CL1 were cultured in the absence or presence of cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) or actinomycin D (an inhibitor of DNA transcription). Cycloheximide or actinomycin D completely blocked the stimulatory effect of both GH and IGF-I on P4 production but did not reduce basal progesterone secretion suggesting involvement of gene transcription and translation in the GH and IGF-I action on luteal cells. Additionally, the activity of 3ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3ß-HSD) under the influence of GH added alone or together with IGF was measured by the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. Stimulation of P4 secretion in P5-treated cells in GH-stimulated cultures was not observed, however, high stimulatory effect was noted in IGF-I treated cultures. In conclusion, the present studies indicate that there is direct and cycle stage dependent influence of GH and IGF-I on steroidogenesis in porcine luteal cells. It is suggested that both IGF and GH may exert some regulatory action during CL development in the pig.",

Four (5.9%) cases proved to be positive by fetal serological investigation, but none of these cases showed any EHV-1 specific lesions and in none of these cases could the virus be detected by virus isolation or by immunohistochemistry. According to the results, fetal serology does not seem to be a useful test in virus-positive cases, while the immunohistochemical method seems to be a reliable and a slightly more sensitive method than virus isolation in the diagnosis of EHV-1 infection.",

After 10 and 20 h of IVM, there was no difference in nuclear status between the NGF-treated and control oocytes. Significant differences were detected in nuclear progression of oocytes matured in the presence or absence of NGF at 30 h of culture. A higher proportion of NGF-treated oocytes were at M-II stage compared to the control. Nevertheless, at the end of the 40-h IVM period, there was no difference in the proportion of M-II stage oocytes between the NGF-treated and control groups. NGF in IVM medium did not influence the developmental competence of putative embryos. Most embryos remained at the 2- to 4-cell stage; however, a significant amount of embryos reached the morula stage both in the NGF and the control groups. These results suggest that NGF during IVM accelerates nuclear progression of porcine oocytes by enhancing the post-diakinetic events of meiosis.",

The purpose of these studies was to explore the flagellin genes of biphasic and monophasic Salmonellae for future targeted genetic interventions. The PCR primers were designed for two different structural genes of flagellin (fliC, fljB) , for the repressor of fliC (fljA) , for the operator region of fliC, and for the invertase system responsible for phase variation in Salmonella (hin, hixL, hixR) . PCR analysis revealed that all of the examined genes (fliC, fliC-operator, fljB, fljA, hin, hixL, hixR) were present in all S . Typhimurium (n = 10)and S. Hadar (n = 10) strains tested. The results obtained on S . Typhimurium and S. Hadar strains confirmed their biphasic character at DNA level. However, the S . Enteritidis (n = 46) and S . Gallinarum (n = 5) strains lacked the invertase system (hin, hixL, hixR) as well as the fljA and fljB genes, while fliC and its operator were detectable. Consequently, the S . Enteritidis strains could only express fliC gene resulting in phase H1 flagellin. The examined S . Gallinarum strains were also demonstrated to have a cryptic flagellin gene (fliC) . On the other hand, PCR results on S . Abortusequi (n = 2) indicated that both flagellin genes (fliC, fljB) and the whole phase variation system were present in both strains tested but only the H2 phase gene (fljB) was expressed. The phenotype of these strains could be clarified by motility test and/or by classical flagellar serology. The findings are also substantiated by the results of serovar-specific PCR for S . Typhimurium and S . Enteritidis. In conclusion, the PCR system developed in this study proved to be suitable for characterisation of Salmonella flagellin genes and confirmed serological results regarding all S . Typhimurium, S . Hadar and S . Enteritidis strains. This system could also identify cryptic flagellar genes of S . Abortusequi and S . Gallinarum.",

The aim of this work was to compare immature and in vitro matured porcine oocytes regarding their morphology and ability to be fertilised after vitrification by the open pulled straw (OPS) method. In four experiments 830 oocytes were examined. To investigate the effect of cumulus cells on oocyte survival after OPS vitrification, both denuded and cumulus-enclosed oocytes were vitrified at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, then after vitrification they were matured in vitro . Besides, in vitro matured oocytes surrounded with a cumulus and those without a cumulus were also vitrified. The survival of oocytes was evaluated by their morphology. After in vitro fertilisation the rates of oocytes penetrated by spermatozoa were compared. Our results suggest that the vitrification/warming procedure is the most effective in cumulus-enclosed oocytes (22.35 ± 1.75%). There was no difference between the order of maturation and vitrification in cumulus-enclosed oocytes, which suggests the importance of cumulus cells in protecting the viability of oocytes during cryopreservation.",

The simultaneous use of high-dose vitamin E supplementation and T-2 toxin load caused a significantly higher plasma vitamin E content but the changes were less expressed in the group subjected to T-2 toxin load. Vitamin E supply also resulted in a marked and significant increase in vitamin E concentrations of the liver on days 3 and 7 even in the T-2 loaded group, but this concentration significantly decreased thereafter. The results show that T-2 contamination of the diet has an adverse effect on the utilisation of vitamin E in broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "Serum amyloid A (SAA) is of interest as the circulating precursor of amyloid A protein, the fibrillar component of AA (secondary) amyloid deposits, and also as an extremely sensitive and rapid major acute phase protein. Serum concentrations of acute phase proteins (APPs) provide valuable information about the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases, and thus the relevance of APPs for monitoring the health status of domestic animals is widely accepted. More importantly, the measurement of SAA concentration assists in assessing the prognosis in secondary amyloidosis, which is a common disease of geese, affecting an increasing number of animals. In the present study we introduce a highly sensitive goose-specific ELISA method for measuring SAA concentration in goose serum or plasma samples. Samples were taken from geese of the Landes Grey and Hungarian White breeds, which were stimulated for an acute phase reaction by administration of a commercially available fowl cholera vaccine containing inactivated Pasteurella multocida. Strong and characteristically rapid acute phase responses were measured in both breeds, peaking at approximately 24 h after inoculation. The maximum SAA concentration was 1200 microg/ml. At 72 h postinoculation, the concentrations returned to pre-inoculation values. There was significantly (p = 0.004) less intense response in the control groups; however, a very mild increase of SAA levels was detected due to the stress inevitably caused by the sampling procedure.",

This paper reports the first detection of PCV1 in Hungarian wild boars. Samples were collected at slaughterhouses and processed for polymerase chain reactions. The complete genome of PCV1 detected in the samples was determined and compared with the available PCV1 sequences of the GenBank database. The genomes formed two distinct clusters with minimum differences, where the Hungarian wild boar PCV1 (WB-H8) grouped together with genomes originating from domestic swine from China and Australia and with a genome detected in a porcine pepsin product.",

In order to reduce the time required for the detection of the pathogens, the assay was optimised to a RapidCycler PCR instrument. The multiplex PCR assay was shown to be specific, sensitive and rapid, because the results were read in less than 60 min after sample preparation.

Macrocyclic lactones are used for preventing the infection; however, their activity against the microfilariae and mature stages of this species is questionable. Selamectin is widely used for the prophylaxis of heartworm (D. immitis) infection. The objective of the present study was to test the microfilaricidal efficacy of the topical formulation of selamectin in dogs naturally infected with D. repens . A total of 78 Beagle dogs were examined for the presence of circulating microfilariae by Knott's test. Twenty-three of the microfilaraemic dogs were divided into four groups and included in the trial. The dogs received monthly or biweekly selamectin treatment and were subjected to monthly blood testing for a period of 252 or 336 days. At the end of the study, 65% of the dogs were not microfilaraemic and the rest had low number of microfilariae in their blood. These results indicate that chronic spot-on selamectin treatment may be a useful tool also in the control of canine subcutaneous dirofilariosis.",

    "abstract": "Arcobacter cryaerophilus was isolated from naturally infected rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum), and its pathogenicity was tested by intramuscular injection using healthy 1-year-old rainbow trout under cold-water conditions (at 5 °C). The lethal dosage of 50% end point (LD 50 ) for A. cryaerophilus was calculated as 7.79 × 10 5 viable cells. Experimental infection caused gross clinical abnormalities such as fallen scales, exophthalmia, oedema in injection region and at the base of fins, pale gills, kidney necrosis, hyperaemic areas in pale liver, haemorrhagic spots in heart, elongated spleen and swollen gallbladder. Activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of glucose, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride and calcium in the serum of the experimentally infected rainbow trout were significantly decreased compared with the healthy fish. Positive correlations were observed among blood parameters. Total lipid weights increased in the brain, muscle and liver tissues of infected fish and dropped in the gill and spleen tissues. Lipid peroxide contents in the brain, liver, kidney, spleen, muscle and gill tissues of infected rainbow trout were significantly higher than in healthy animals. The present work shows that A. cryaerophilus can be moderately virulent for rainbow trout at low water temperature, and changes in lipid and lipid peroxide contents of tissues and blood indices can highlight barely detectable effects of A. cryaerophilus infection in rainbow trout under laboratory conditions. However, the application of these indices in farm biomonitoring using rainbow trout will need more detailed studies and a careful consideration of the environmental parameters.",

The purpose of this work was to compare the results of cystatin C analysis obtained by PETIA and PENIA assays in the dog. Forty dogs of different genders and breeds were classified into four groups of 10 animals each based on serum creatinine concentrations (4 stages of chronic kidney disease). Serum cystatin C concentration was measured using PETIA and PENIA assays, the results were compared, and correlation with serum urea and creatinine concentrations was established. The correlation coefficient for results obtained using PETIA and PENIA assays was r = 0.706. Serum cystatin C concentrations obtained in PETIA had a lower correlation coefficient with creatinine concentrations than those found in PENIA (r = 0.614 and r = 0.904, respectively); similarly, serum cystatin C was less correlated with serum urea concentration in PETIA than in PENIA (r = 0.463 and r = 0.636, respectively). The results obtained in this study suggest that the nephelometric assay is more sensitive and was shown to be more closely correlated with other renal function indicators than the PETIA assay.",

PCV2 is recognised as the essential infectious agent in post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and has been associated with other disease syndromes such as porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Since circoviruses commonly occur in the pig populations and there is a correlation between the severity of the disease and the viral load in the organs and blood, it is important not only to detect PCV2 but also to determine the quantitative aspects of viral load. The PriProET real-time PCR assay described in this study was tested on various virus strains and clinical forms of PMWS in order to investigate any correlation between the clinical signs and viral loads in different organs. The data obtained in this study correlate with those described earlier; namely, the viral load in 1 ml plasma and in 500 ng tissue DNA exceeds 10(7) copies in the case of PMWS. The results indicate that the new assay provides a specific, sensitive and robust tool for the improved detection and quantification of PCV2.",

Blood samples of Ross 308 broilers were tested at the age of 1, 3 and 6 weeks. Total protein (TP) concentration increased in wheat-based and decreased in LP groups in week 3, while butyrate reduced albumin/TP ratio in week 1.

Aspartate aminotransferase activity was increased by wheat-based diet in week 3, and creatine kinase activity was intensified by LP in weeks 3 and 6. Blood glucose level decreased in wheat-based groups in week 3; however, triglyceride concentration was augmented in the same groups in week 3. No change of glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and insulin concentration was observed.

    "abstract": "Oestrogen (E2) and thyroid hormones (THs) are key regulators of cerebellar development. Recent reports implicate a complex mechanism through which E2 and THs influence the expression levels of each other's receptors (ERs and TRs) to precisely mediate developmental signals and modulate signal strength. We examined the modulating effects of E2 and THs on the expression levels of their receptor mRNAs and proteins in cultured cerebellar cells obtained from 7-day-old rat pups. Cerebellar granule cell cultures were treated with either E2, THs or a combination of these hormones, and resulting receptor expression levels were determined by quantitative PCR and Western blot techniques. The results were compared to non-treated controls and to samples obtained from 14-day-old in situ cerebella. Additionally, we determined the glial effects on the regulation of ER-TR expression levels. The results show that (i) ER and TR expression depends on the combined presence of E2 and THs; (ii) glial cells mediate the hormonal regulation of neuronal ER-TR expression and (iii) loss of tissue integrity results in characteristic changes in ER-TR expression levels. These observations suggest that both E2 and THs, in adequate amounts, are required for the precise orchestration of cerebellar development and that alterations in the ratio of E2/THs may influence signalling mechanisms involved in neurodevelopment. Comparison of data from in vitro and in situ samples revealed a shift in receptor expression levels after loss of tissue integrity, suggesting that such adjusting/regenerative mechanisms may function after cerebellar tissue injury as well.",

The animals of both groups were slaughtered on day 14 of pregnancy or on day 14 of the oestrous cycle, respectively. PPARs mRNA abundance in the endometrium and the corpus luteum (CL) was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. During pregnancy, PPARA and PPARD μmRNA abundance in the porcine endometrium was significantly higher in the horn containing embryos than in the contralateral horn, where embryos were absent. The endometrial PPARG1 mRNA abundance did not differ between the two horns during pregnancy and the oestrous cycle, but a higher level of the transcript was observed during pregnancy when compared to the oestrous cycle. In the CL, there were no significant differences in PPARA and PPARDμ mRNA abundance between horns in pregnant or cyclic sows. However, there was a significant increase of PPARA and PPARD transcript level in the CL from cyclic compared with pregnant sows. The results of our study suggest that PPARA and PPARD have regulatory functions in early pregnancy, and they indicate that increased levels of endometrial gene expression are correlated with the presence of embryos in the uterine horn. Higher levels of PPARA and PPARD expression in the porcine CL on day 14 of the oestrous cycle than on day 14 of pregnancy suggest that both forms are involved in the regulation of CL functions.",

Blood samples were collected 6, 12 and 24 hours, and 7 and 14 days following vaccination with either live or inactivated Newcastle disease virus, La Sota strain, at 14 days of age, and the abundance of transcripts for each cytokine was assayed by real-time RT-PCR. Physiological saline and vaccine emulsion without viral antigen were administered to control groups for live and inactivated vaccine groups, respectively. The abundance of IFN-γ transcripts was elevated during the early times following vaccination and had reached baseline by the seventh day but the abundance of IFN-α transcripts remained elevated. Transcripts for neither IFN gene were detected in the control birds. The abundance of transcripts for each IFN was not different between the two vaccinated groups at any time. Transcripts for IL-2 were detected only in spleens from chicken embryos that had been inoculated with the live virus. The results show that cells stimulated to produce IFN-α and IFN-γ enter the circulating blood but those stimulated to produce IL-2 do not, or in very low number, and the IFN responses to both vaccines are the same.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal sclerosis is the most common imaging finding of intractable human epilepsy, and it may play an important role in canine and feline epileptogenesis and seizure semiology, too. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria of hippocampal sclerosis are T2 hyperintensity, shrinkage and loss of internal structure. The detection of these changes is often challenging by subjective visual assessment of qualitative magnetic resonance (MR) images. The recognition is more reliable with quantitative MR methods, such as T2 relaxometry. In the present prospective study including 31 dogs with idiopathic epilepsy and 15 control dogs showing no seizure activity, we compared the T2 relaxation times of different brain areas. Furthermore, we studied correlations between the hippocampal T2 values and age, gender and skull formation. We found higher hippocampal T2 values in the epileptic group than in the control; however, these findings were not statistically significant. No correlations were found with age, gender or skull formation. In the individual analysis six epileptic dogs presented higher hippocampal T2 relaxation times than the cut-off value. Two of these dogs were also evaluated as abnormal in the visual assessment. Individual analysis of hippocampal T2 relaxation times may be a helpful method to understand hippocampal involvement in canine epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Babesia vesperuginis is the only piroplasm known to infect bats. Unlike most members of the genus Babesia , it is probably transmitted by a soft tick species (i.e. Argas vespertilionis ). Recently, two studies have been conducted to clarify the phylogenetic status of this species, and both agreed on placing it into a basal position among Babesia sensu stricto (s.s.). However, several important groups of piroplasms were not included in the already reported phylogenetic trees of B. vesperuginis isolates. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to amplify an approx. 950-bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ( cox1 ) gene of B. vesperuginis from A. vespertilionis specimens, and to compare its sequences with those from other piroplasmid groups in a broader phylogenetic context. Sequence comparisons focusing on either 18S rRNA or cox1 genes, as well as phylogenetic analyses involving separate and concatenated 18S rRNA and cox1 sequences indicate that B. vesperuginis is more closely related to the phylogenetic group of Theileriidae than to Babesia s.s. In particular, B. vesperuginis clustered closest to Cytauxzoon felis and the ‘prototheilerid’ B. conradae . The results of this study highlight that B. vesperuginis is a unique and taxonomically important species, which should be included in future studies aimed at resolving the comprehensive phylogeny of Piroplasmida.",

    "abstract": "Allergic conditions are prevalent equine diseases that can be diagnosed by clinical examination alone, but definitive diagnosis is more likely with laboratory testing. The ELISA Allercept © test was used to analyse the serum samples of 73 horses with allergic diseases. Sixty-one horses (83.5%) had allergen-specific IgE levels ≥ 150 ELISA Units (EU), the cut-off defined by the assay. Fifty-four horses had allergic dermatitis (AD) with high IgE levels to Tyrophagus putrescentiae (51.9%), Rumex crispus (48.1%), Tabanus (46.3%) and Dermatophagoides farinae/ D. pteronyssinus (40.7%). Seven horses with recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) had a high prevalence of T. putrescentiae (85.7%), followed by that of Acarus siro (57.1%) and D. farinae/D. pteronyssinus (57.1%). Horses affected with RAO had more positive reactions to mites (2.22 ± 0.84) than did horses with AD (1.51 ± 0.61, P &lt; 0.05). A strong correlation of serum allergen-specific IgE level was found between Culex tarsalis and Stomoxys ( r = 0.943) and between Dactylis glomerata and both Secale cereale ( r = 0.79) and R. crispus ( r = 0.696). These results indicate that among horses with allergic diseases in Spain, ELISA tests demonstrated a high prevalence of serum allergen-specific IgE in response to mites. Our study emphasises the importance of laboratory testing and updating allergy panels to improve the likelihood of a definitive diagnosis and the identification of allergens that should be included in allergic disease treatment.",

The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of Tris supplementation at different concentrations (0, 8, 24 and 72 μM) into the freezing extender on the quality and fertilising capacity of frozen-thawed boar spermatozoa. The results showed that the supplementation of 24 μM of Tris gave significantly higher percentages of sperm viability and plasma membrane integrity than those of the control group at any time point of assessment (0 h and 3 h post-thawing) (P &lt; 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the acrosome integrity parameter among the groups. Higher percentages of sperm motility were observed in the spermatozoa cryopreserved with 24 μM of Tris compared to the control groups when the samples were analysed 0 h after thawing (P &lt; 0.05). However, an increase of the Tris concentration to 72 μM did not enhance the sperm motility parameters. The total numbers of fertilised oocytes and blastocysts obtained with spermatozoa frozen with 24 μM Tris were significantly higher than those of the control group without Tris (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the supplementation of 24 μM Tris into the freezing extender contributes to a better boar sperm quality and fertilising capacity after the process of freezing and thawing.",

The semen was collected, pooled and diluted in three commercial extenders: Inra 96® (INRA) based on skimmed milk, Biladyl® A fraction (BIL) based on egg yolk, and Ovixcell® (OVIX) based on soybean lecithin. Then, sperm motility was evaluated at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. In order to evaluate fertility, samples stored at 15 °C were used after dilution in INRA and OVIX. Results showed that progressive motility was significantly higher up to 72 h of storage in sperm samples maintained at 5 °C in comparison with 15 °C, similarly for each tested diluent. When samples were stored at 5 °C in OVIX, kinematic parameters such as velocity (except curvilinear velocity, VCL), trajectory [linearity (LIN), straightness (STR), wobble (WOB)], amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH) and beat/cross frequency (BCF) were higher than in INRA and BIL. No significant differences in pregnancy rate were detected between INRA (62.6%) and OVIX (58.9%). In conclusion, liquid storage at 5 °C with OVIX extender is an interesting option since non-animal components are used, and this extender offers similar in vitro and in vivo efficacy as other extenders containing animal components.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malignant neoplasm of the skin in cats. Tumour angiogenesis is the pivotal event for tumour progression and metastasis. We assessed protein and gene expression of angiogenic growth factors including bFGF, VEGF-C, TGF-β, PDGF-A, PDGF-C and PDGFR-α that possibly contribute to the angiogenic phenotype of feline SCC (FSCC) and could, therefore, be a good target in the treatment of SCC. In the present study, a total of 27 FSCC cases were investigated. Tumour cases were histopathologically classified as well differentiated (10/27), moderately differentiated (5/27), and poorly differentiated (12/27). The expression levels of the growth factors were detected using immunohistochemistry and assessed semi-quantitatively. Growth factor expression levels were evaluated at different locations: in the oral region, in areas exposed to solar UV radiation including the ears, eyelids and nasal planum, and other miscellaneous locations. Our findings have revealed that FSCC arising from different anatomical sites of the body and showing differences in aggressiveness, metastasis, and prognosis may be angiogenesis dependent, and angiogenic key regulators could play a role in the development of FSCC.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Que on DON-induced oxidative stress in a non-tumourigenic porcine IPEC-J2 cell line. Two experimental designs were used in our experiments as follows: (a) pretreatment with 20 µmol/L Que for 24 h followed by 1-h 1 µmol/L DON treatment and (b) simultaneous application of 20 µmol/L Que and 1 µmol/L DON for 1 h. Cell cytotoxicity, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of cell monolayers and extracellular/intracellular redox status were studied. It was found that DON significantly decreased TER and triggered oxidative stress, while Que pretreatments were beneficial in maintaining the integrity of the monolayers and alleviated oxidative stress. However, co-treatment with Que was unable to preserve the integrity and redox balance of the cells exposed to DON. These results indicate that only the 24-h preincubation of cells with 20 µmol/L Que was beneficial in compensating for the disruption caused by DON in extracellular oxidative status.",

We used tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) and augmented it by supportive therapy with MMSCs in three patient groups. In the first patient group, the dogs were injected with MMSCs directly into the treated stifle one month after surgery. In the second group, MMSCs were delivered in a silk fibroin scaffold which was placed in the osteotomy gap during surgery. In the third group, MMSCs were first mixed with bone tissue and blood from the patient and delivered into the osteotomy gap during surgery. In the control group, patients underwent the TTA procedure but did not receive MMSC treatment. In the group of patients who received cells in the silk fibroin scaffold during surgery, the osteotomy gap did not heal, presumably due to the low absorption of silk fibroin. Patients who received MMSCs mixed with bone tissue and blood during surgery into the osteotomy gap recovered clinically faster and had better healing of the osteotomy gap than dogs from the other two treated groups and from the control group, as assessed by clinical examination and quantification of radiographs. In conclusion, dogs that received stem cells directly into the osteotomy gap (Group 3) recovered faster compared to dogs from Groups 1 (MMSCs injected into the joint one month after surgery), 2 (cells implanted into the osteotomy gap in a silk fibroin scaffold), and the control group that did not receive additional MMSCs treatment.",

The experiment was started with day-old birds, kept at a temperature of 25 °C or 37 °C. After a 7-day adjustment period, the LRE supplementation lasted for 35 days. The levels of different adipokines, including visfatin (VF), adiponectin (ADP), chemerin (CHEM), as well as the concentration of plasma citrulline (CIT) and the levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood were measured at 21 and 42 days of age. A significant correlation ( P &lt; 0.01) was found between LRE supplementation and the decrease in serum VF, ADP, CIT, T3 and T4 levels in partridges exposed to HS.

Seropositivity to C. burnetii was positively related to twin pregnancy after the two rounds of vaccination (OR = 2.1 and 3.5, respectively). These results indicate that two consecutive vaccination rounds against C. burnetii in advanced gestation reduce subfertility and early fetal loss in dairy cows.",

    "abstract": "Avian nephritis virus (ANV) infects poultry flocks worldwide, but no confirmed cases have been reported from India so far. In the current study, disease investigation was carried out in 21 broiler flocks at different parts of India with clinical signs of nephritis, uneven and stunted growth, diarrhoea, reduced body weight, and mortality up to 9.72%. Out of the 21 flocks screened, two were found positive for ANV in RT-PCR assay. BLAST analysis revealed that the ANV of Indian origin was closely related to ANV-1 strains reported from Japan, Hungary and China. However, comparison of a small portion (~12% of nucleotides, i.e. ~60 nts, common site for ANV-1 and ANV-3, position 2200-2260 of ORF 1a gene) of the Indian ANV sequence with ANV-3 sequences revealed 89-93% identities with different ANV-3 isolates. Phylogenetically, ANV-1 forms three clades, and the Indian ANV clustered under clade II. This study confirms the existence of ANV in Indian poultry flocks and is the first report on the molecular detection and genetic characterisation of ANV from India.",

Radiographic examination of the caudal vertebrae was performed in 595 client-owned dogs undergoing routine radiological examination of the hip joints. Anomalies of the caudal vertebrae were divided into four groups: (1) congenital anomalies with aberrant fusion of the vertebral epiphysis, like hemivertebra, block or transitional vertebra; (2) morphological anomalies like vertebra curva and dysplastic vertebral epiphysis; (3) post-traumatic changes, represented by fracture or luxation; and (4) degenerative changes, represented by spondylosis, osteophyte formation and mineralisation of intervertebral spaces. A total of 303 caudal vertebral anomalies were detected in 259 dogs (43.53% of all dogs examined). A single type of vertebral anomaly was present in 215 dogs and a combination of two pathologies was recorded in 44 dogs, which represents 83.01% and 16.99%, respectively, of the affected dogs. Congenital anomaly was present in 11.09% of the dogs examined. Sacrocaudal transitional vertebra was the most common congenital anomaly, present in 12.74% of the affected dogs. Radiographic examination of the caudal vertebrae is recommended as an essential part of any screening process to confirm the presence of congenital anomaly as a cause of kinked tail.",

Taking into account that the collection site in the present study is close to the French border of Belgium, and migration of Bechstein’s bat is known between Belgium and France, it is reasonable to suppose that I. ariadnae also occurs in France.

In addition, the two most important key parameters for milk quality assessment, total bacterial count (TBC) and somatic cell count (SCC) were also followed. Production parameters showed significant seasonal and yearly changes. The overall mean fat, protein, lactose and solids-non-fat (SNF) contents of cow's milk were 3.81%, 3.32%, 4.74% and 8.76%, respectively. A circannual variation was observed in the chemical composition and yield of milk components of samples examined between 2011 and 2020. Concerning milk fat, milk protein and SNF, the values were the lowest in summer and the highest in winter. In the case of lactose, the minimum values were measured in autumn and the maximum values in spring. An obvious trend of long-term elevation of lactose and SNF was found in the raw cow milk samples over the observed period. The overall mean TBC and SCC of cow's milk were 52 × 10 3 CFU ml −1 and 270 × 10 3 cells/ml, respectively. Although there were differences in the monthly average values, no seasonal cyclicality was observed.",

The aim of this study was to examine the biofilm-forming ability and its potential effects on environmental survival and antibiotic resistance in Mycoplasma anserisalpingitidis , the clinically and economically most important waterfowl Mycoplasma species. The biofilm-forming ability of 32 M. anserisalpingitidis strains was examined by crystal violet assay. Biofilms and planktonic cultures of the selected strains were exposed to a temperature of 50 °C (20 and 30 min), to desiccation at room temperature (16 and 24 h), or to various concentrations of eight different antibiotics. Crystal violet staining revealed great diversity in the biofilm-forming ability of the 32 tested M. anserisalpingitidis strains, with positive staining in more than half of them. Biofilms were found to be more resistant to heat and desiccation than planktonic cultures, while no correlation was shown between biofilm formation and antibiotic susceptibility. Our results indicate that M. anserisalpingitidis biofilms may contribute to the persistence of the organisms in the environment, which should be taken into account for proper management. Antibiotic susceptibility was not affected by biofilm formation; however, it is important to note that correlations were examined only in vitro .",

Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein of 53 mare-foal pairs within twelve hours after parturition. Plasma melatonin levels were measured by ELISA. The melatonin concentration, adjusted for the moment of parturition using a generalised linear model, was 34.58 pg mL-1 in mares. It was significantly lower (27.63 pg mL-1) in the new-born foals. However, the melatonin concentration declined differently by the end of the twelve hours, it decreased less in the offspring than in the mothers. An artificial light supplementation at the end of gestation reduced the melatonin concentration both in mares and their foals by about 10 pg mL-1, compared to the controls. An elevated melatonin production may be related to preparation of mares for parturition and ensures the chances of survival of offspring, therefore the melatonin may reach its peak at the moment of foaling regardless of its actual time. The effect of low melatonin concentration in new-born foals might be associated with the foal's health and subsequent performance. The need to monitor the melatonin concentration in the offspring justifies further studies.",

We report a case of severe bovine mastitis caused by N. cyriacigeorgica that did not respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy in a small holding in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After isolation of the pathogen, further identification by routine microbiological methods was not possible. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was tested using the disc diffusion method according to published recommendations. The sample was also tested by MALDI-ToF MS with inconclusive results. In addition, 16S rRNA sequence analysis, verified by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using the gyrB, 16S rRNA, secA1, and hsp65 sequences, confirmed the species N. cyriacigeorgica. To our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of N. cyriacigeorgica from a clinical case of bovine mastitis in a European dairy farm and the first MLSA method approach to distinguish a Nocardia spp. strain isolated from animals.",

    "abstract": "Parvoviruses have small genomes and, consequently, are highly dependent on their host for various functions in their reproduction. Since these viruses generally use ubiquitous receptors, restrictions are usually intracellularly regulated. A lack of mitosis, and hence absence of enzymes required for DNA replication, is a powerful block of virus infection. Allotropic determinants have been identified for several parvoviruses: porcine parvovirus, canine parvovirus (CPV), feline parvovirus (feline panleukopenia virus), minute virus of mice, Aleutian disease virus, andGmDNV (an insect parvovirus). Invariably, these identifications involved the use of infectious clones of these viruses and the exchange of restriction fragments to create chimeric viruses, of which the resulting phenotype was then established by transfection in appropriate cell lines. The tropism of these viruses was found to be governed by minimal changes in the sequence of the capsid proteins and, often, only 2 or 3 critical amino acids are responsible for a given tropism. These amino acids are usually located on the outside of the capsid near or on the spike of the threefold axis for the vertebrate parvoviruses and on loops 2 or 3 for the insect parvoviruses. This tropism is not mediated via specific cellular receptors but by interactions with intracellular factors. The nature of these factors is unknown but most data point to a stage beyond the conversion of the single-stranded DNA genome by host cell DNA polymerase into monomeric duplex intermediates of the replicative form. The sudden and devastating emergence of mink enteritis virus (MEV) and CPV in the last 50 years, and the possibility of more future outbreaks, demonstrates the importance of understanding parvovirus tropism.",

The insignificant increase found in blood total protein content and the simultaneous small differences in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) values in cows supplied with the yeast culture were probably associated with a high ammonia incorporation into microbial protein in the rumen, which increased protein supply for milk protein synthesis and decreased the nitrogen loss.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the present study was to find out the best interval after hCG injection in PMSG primed prepuberal gilts for retrieval of in vivo matured oocytes for in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Altogether 66 gilts were superovulated with 1500 IU PMSG and 500 IU hCG 72 h later. Ovum pick up was performed endoscopically 24, 28, 32 or 36 h after hCG and a total of 869 cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were aspirated from 1400 follicles. COCs were tested for quality, and an aliquot was immediately fixed and stained to determine meiotic configuration. The remaining COCs were fertilised in vitro using frozen-thawed epididymal semen. Quality and developmental stage of embryos were tested after IVF, and the number of nuclei was counted. At 24 to 32 h after hCG only few oocytes have entered the second meiotic cycle (18 to 25% vs. 58% at 36 h, p < 0.05). The overall cleavage rate was significantly influenced by insufficient maturation rate at the early collection times (14% at 24 h vs. 49% at 36 h). Additionally, when oocytes were collected 24 to 32 h vs. 36 h the cleavage rate based on mature oocytes was lower (26 vs. 62%, p < 0.05). Once embryonic development has been initiated, the further in vitro development to blastocyst stages did not differ between groups. However, the number of cells was lower at collection times 24 to 32 h as compared to 36 h after hCG (12 to 15 cells vs. 22 cells, p < 0.05). The results indicate that the time of COC collection affects the in vitro developmental competence up to the blastocyst stage and should not be performed earlier than 36 h after hCG treatment.",

    "abstract": "The extenders and freezing rates from three different freezing protocols were combined and compared to each other in order to study the post-thawing acrosome integrity and fertility of frozen dog sperm. A commercial bovine TRIS-base extender (TRILADYL) and two self-made canine semen extenders (Norwegian and Dutch) were combined with a conventional bovine and two canine freezing regimes, and acrosome integrity of frozen/thawed spermatozoa was assessed by fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated peanut agglutinin staining (FITC-PNA). Differences between freezing/thawing protocols were reflected in the proportion of cells with acrosomal damage and not based on motility results. It was concluded that during dog semen cryopreservation extenders had less influence on the post-thawing sperm quality than did the freezing rates. The optimal extender/freezing rate combination (TRILADYL/Norwegian) was used in the clinical practice to evaluate the fertility of frozen sperm administered by intrauterine insemination using a surgical approach. The pregnancy rate was 57% (4/7), but the average litter size was low (2.8). This may have been due to the insufficient sperm numbers contained in an insemination dose and/or to the incorrect timing of artificial insemination (AI). The final conclusion is that the commercial bovine extender is useful for freezing dog semen, and the TRILADYL/Norwegian freezing protocol is recommended as the most advantageous combination for the freezing of canine semen in the clinical practice.",

In this study an enzymatic flow procedure ( QuickChem 8000 Ion Analyser , Lachat Instruments, Milwaukee, USA) to determine the urea content in ovine and bovine milk was evaluated. Urea content is determined by the Berthelot reaction after splitting it enzymatically with urease. The free ammonia diffuses through a teflon membrane into a stream of reagent solutions. Detection takes place by means of a reaction between the ammonium ions with hypochlorite and salicylate producing a green colour, which is measured spectrometrically in a flow meter at 660 nm. By using a diffusion cell chemical deproteinisation of milk is not necessary and capacity is high. The assessed procedure exhibited high accuracy and precision and reached a sample capacity of 55 samples an hour. Storage of the milk samples for several days as well as chemical preservation with bronopol had no effect on the measurement procedure. Due to the complexity of the apparatus and the costs associated therewith, the device proves less suitable for routine diagnostics but rather serves as a reference method for the measurement of urea concentration in milk.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of thoracic percussion and ultrasonography with the help of distance measurements and statistical methods in the determination of the caudal lung border in horses with recurrent airway obstruction (RAO). Examinations were performed on 11 healthy, warm-blooded horses of different breeds, age and grade of disease. First, the caudal lung border was determined by the traditional indirect percussion method in the 10th, 12th, 14th and 16th intercostal spaces at the end of inspiration and expiration on both sides of the thorax. To apply standardised measurements, a fix point was chosen as described earlier by the same authors for healthy horses. The distance between this point and the caudal lung border was measured with a tape-measure. Percussion was followed by ultrasonographic determination of the caudal lung border. Measurements were performed in the same way as described for the percussion technique. Mean values and standard errors of absolute values of differences between percussion and ultrasonographic measurements were the following, in centimetres (10th, 12th, 14th and 16th intercostal spaces). Left side expiration: 1.4, 0.4; 0.8, 0.2; 0.9, 0.2; 0.8, 0.4; left side inspiration: 0.8, 0.3; 1.5, 0.3; 1.4, 0.3; 1.1, 0.3; right side expiration: 2.1, 1.0; 2.1, 0.5; 1.6, 0.5; 0.8, 0.1; right side inspiration: 1.5, 0.7; 1.2, 0.6; 0.8, 0.2; 0.8, 0.3, respectively. Ultrasonography proved to be reliable in determining the caudal lung borders in horses with RAO. Results of the percussion examination did not differ significantly from those of the ultrasound method which was used as a reference technique. The differences between inspiration and expiration were greater in horses with RAO than in healthy horses in a previous study. Based on these results, percussion can be used as an integrated part of the physical examination in diagnosing caudal shift of the caudal lung border of horses suffering from RAO.",

Bacteriological culture of the urine revealed Corynebacterium renale and Escherichia coli infection in 18 cows, while the remaining 5 cows were negative. By cystoscopy catarrhal cystitis was diagnosed in 2 cases, haemorrhagic cystitis in 5 cases, and fibrinous-purulent and fibrinous-haemorrhagic cystitis in 13 cases. Three cows showed no pathological changes of the urinary bladder mucosa by endoscopic examination.

A total of 309 Israeli Holstein-Friesian cows from one kibbutz were investigated in three lactations, and information was given for a period of five years from 1996 to the end of 2000. The distribution of milk components and milk yield during lactation, and changes of the absolute and relative energy amount in the different milk components were calculated and evaluated. The results showed changes in the energy content of milk and its different components throughout the lactation. Each component (fat, lactose and protein) is dominant in different periods during the lactation. The energy amount from fat reaches a peak first, between days 40 and 50. Lactose has a peak at about day 66 of lactation, and protein reaches the peak last, approximately at day 104 of lactation. It seems that this peak sequence is constant and it is considered to be physiological. It might be suggested that there is a regulation governing the secretion of the different components at different times, and only one component is dominant in a given period. Each component exerts negative and positive influences on the secretion of the other components, which interact with each other and are not fully independent.",

New results on the pathogenesis and therapeutic aspects are discussed in this review. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity may be involved in the largest subset of atopic patients, yet there is another subset for which such involvement cannot be documented. Alterations in epidermal barrier function, priming of cutaneous antigen-presenting cells with IgE, intrinsic keratinocyte defects, and development of autoimmunity are also factors that contribute to the primary disease. Polymorphisms in regions of the genome that are of key importance to the inflammatory response contribute to the patient's clinical picture. Secondary infections, especially with Staphylococcus and yeast organisms, strongly modify or augment the inflammatory response, which changes over time. After the treatment of secondary infections and skin inflammation the avoidance of causal allergens would prevent relapse. Another causative therapy is the variously effective allergen-specific immunotherapy. The newest treatments for canine AD (cyclosporin A and tacrolimus) are highly effective at suppressing the allergic response and comparable to treatment with glucocorticoids. Canine AD presents a substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenge over a patient's lifetime, and no single treatment is universally effective.",

The modified method is simpler and more practical. This method was performed on eight Thoroughbred mares with third-degree perineal lacerations after delivery. The rectovestibular septum was reconstructed by three lines of sutures in a transverse direction in relation to the longitudinal axis of the rectum. In one of the eight cases pneumorectum was observed after using the new method. The conception rate obtained after using the new surgical technique was 62.5%. Pregnant mares delivered normally without any new lacerations at the subsequent parturition.

    "abstract": "Increasing use of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) live vaccines has led to a need for the differentiation of MG strains. The MG strains MK-7, MS-16, S6, FS-9 and R strains and the MG live vaccine strain F were compared by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in this study. Using RAPD, different patterns were found among the MG strains. In addition to this, we examined the differentiating potential of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) primers targeted at the crmA, crmB, crmC, gapA, mgc2 and pvpA genes encoding cytadherence-related surface proteins. These proteins may take part in the pathogenesis of MG-induced disease. Differentiation of strain F is based on the identification of restriction enzyme sites in the PCR amplicons. Using HphI enzyme, crmC PCR amplicons produced different RFLP patterns. Digestion of amplicons of gapA-specific PCR with MboI enzyme also produced distinct patterns. Differences were observed among strains R and F by digestion of mgc2 PCR amplicons with HaelIl and VspI enzymes and digestion of pvpA PCR amplicons with AccI, PvulI and ScrFI endonucleases. This method can be used for the rapid differentiation of vaccine strain from wild strains. Differentiation of MG strains is a great advantage for diagnosticians or practitioners and it is useful for epidemiological studies.",

    "abstract": "The effect of free-range versus cage management system on corticosterone transfer into the eggs was studied in laying hens. Hungarian Yellow laying hens (age: 21 weeks, body weight: 2.0 +/- 0.5 kg) were divided into two groups in the spring: Group I, free-range keeping (n=15 layers, density: > 0.5 bird/m2) in outdoor runs, with continuous access to a commercial layer feed; Group II, hens kept in battery cages (n=17 layers, density: 2 birds/m2, natural light, continuous access to feed and water). Eggs were collected after a one-week adaptation period on days 2, 7 and 16. Corticosterone (CST) was extracted from homogenised egg samples using an ASE-200 Accelerated Solvent Extractor and then assayed by liquid chromatography linked with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [Thermo Quest Surveyor high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) interfaced via Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation (APCI) ion source to Finnigan/Thermo Quest LCQ Deca MS/MS] using dexamethasone as internal standard with positive APCI ionisation. CST concentrations of whole eggs laid by free-range hens on days 2, 7 and 16 were 0.370 +/- 0.218, 0.259 +/- 0.066 and 0.915 +/- 0.745 ng x g(-1), respectively, while those of eggs laid by caged hens were 0.206 +/- 0.157, 0.223 +/- 0.165 and 0.184 +/- 0.110 ng x g(-1) at the above sampling times. It is concluded that in free-range laying hens the sharp changes of environmental weather conditions significantly increased the corticosterone content of eggs, while the environmentally controlled and closed battery cage management technology resulted in relatively uniform corticosterone concentrations in the whole eggs.",

Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the effects of tiletamine-zolazepam anaesthesia on oxidant/antioxidant status in blood plasma and on haematological parameters in 10 healthy Awassi ewes. The tiletamine-zolazepam combination was administrated in a dose of 7.5 mg/kg intramuscularly. The animals were spontaneously breathing air during the procedure. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture before induction and at 30, 60, 120 min, 24 h and 3 days after anaesthesia. Malondialdehyde concentration, an index of lipid peroxidation, was higher at 30, 60, 120 min and 24 h (P < 0.05) than the baseline value in the plasma. The level of glutathione decreased (P < 0.05) at 30, 60 and 120 min, then returned to the baseline level. Beta-carotene concentration was lower (P < 0.05) than the baseline value during anaesthesia with the exception of its level at 120 min. Glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities decreased (P < 0.05) at the onset of anaesthesia, then returned to baseline values. There was no significant change in vitamin A level. Red blood cell count, haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration significantly decreased (P < 0.05) only at 30 min and thereafter they gradually returned to the baseline values. Based on the results tiletamine-zolazepam anaesthesia seems to accelerate lipid peroxidation and to impair the enzymatic antioxidant defence in the blood plasma.",

To this end, low doses of dexamethasone 21-isonicotinate (DEX) alone or in combination with prostaglandin F 2a (PG) were used in five treated groups (n = 20 each) and one control group (n = 136) of Chios ewes. On day 143 of pregnancy 1.5 mg DEX was given in Group 5, while on day 146 the following treatments were applied: 0.0375 mg PG in Groups 4 and 5, and 1, 1.5 and 2 mg of DEX in ewes of Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The control ewes received no treatment. The 1.5 and 2 mg dose of DEX was more effective in synchronising labour as regards the treatment to lambing interval and the proportion of ewes that gave birth within 3 days. However, obstetrical manipulations were needed, and dead lambs were born when 2 mg DEX was used. It was concluded that lambing can be safely synchronised in Chios ewes with 1.5 mg DEX given on day 146, without affecting the viability of lambs and without parturition complications.",

    "abstract": "Despite the variety of hormonal treating regimes used, a proportion of cows with cystic ovarian disease (COD) fail to be cured. The hypothesis of this study was that cyst aspiration would improve the curing rate and/or accelerate the resumption of ovarian activity in affected cows. In four groups of cows the following treatments were administered: Group A (n = 18) only cyst aspiration, Group AGP (n = 19) cyst aspiration and a combination of GnRH and PGF 2α , Group GP (n = 25) only GnRH and PGF 2α , and Group C (n = 15) untreated control. Cysts were aspirated without ultrasonographic guidance, using a new device. All cows from Group AGP responded to treatment, while 5.5% from Group A and 16% from Group GP remained anoestrous (P &lt; 0.05). These refractory cases were re-treated with the AGP protocol and exhibited oestrus within 12.4 ± 1.1 days. The interval from PGF 2α injection to oestrus was significantly reduced in cows treated with cyst aspiration. Until day 80 post partum (pp), 11 of the 15 untreated cows (73.3%) retained the initial cyst and remained anoestrous. It is concluded that persisting cases of COD can be treated by combining aspiration with a hormonal regime. The technique presented here has no complication for the cow, is efficient, easy, safe for the operator, and requires low-cost equipment.",

A total of 317 fetuses of 219 pregnant females were monitored at 24-hour interval, from days 30 to 60 of pregnancy in ewes, and from days 40 to 60 in goats. Examinations were performed using transrectal ultrasound equipped with a linear transducer of double frequency. Fetuses were identified as male when the GT was next to the umbilical cord and female when the GT was next to the tail. The average time of GT migration in ewes (41.3 ± 3.1 days) was shorter (P &lt; 0.05) than in goats (47.2 ± 2.3 days). In goats, the average time of GT migration of Saanen fetuses was later (P &lt; 0.05) than in fetuses of other breeds, with no difference in the average time of GT migration between male (46.9 ± 2.2) and female fetuses (47.4 ± 2.4). In ewes, the average time of GT migration did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) among breeds and sexes. In goat and sheep, no difference was noticed in the accuracy of fetal sexing between males and females (P &gt; 0.05). The results show that fetal sexing in ewes must be done earlier than in goats, fetal sexing in Saanen goats must be performed later, and fetal sex does not influence the time of GT migration in either of the two species.",

    "abstract": "Recently, an increase in the occurrence of oral diseases in cats has been observed. Symptoms vary from case to case, but loss of appetite or fastidiousness can almost always be noted. Proliferative inflammatory eosinophilic granulomatosis is a common disease in cats, which may be localised to the skin, the mucocutaneous junctions or the oral cavity. The disease has three different manifestations: indolent cellular ulcer, eosinophilic plaque, and eosinophilic granuloma. The last mentioned form predominantly affects the medial surface of the thigh, the cheek, the tongue and the palate. Pain is not common, the lesion is nonpruritic if localised to the skin, but the nodular form in the oral cavity may make deglutition difficult. In this case, a 10.5-year-old cat was presented in poor condition due to feeding problems. Examination revealed a mass of unknown origin with macroscopically tumorous appearance, localised to the pharyngeal part of the tongue, which made swallowing and voluntary feeding difficult. The granuloma was removed by laser-assisted surgery. After adequate preparation, a LASER diode with 6-10 W output power was used, set to continuous constant-amplitude output (CW) running in a 0.6 mm optic fibre to the site of interest. The removed tissue was examined for pathomorphological features: haematoxylin and eosin, Giemsa, Azan and PAS stainings were performed to aid diagnosis. After surgery the cat recovered fast on steroids, and its condition and quality of life improved greatly. The traditional surgical technique was inapplicable due to the heavy vasculature and corresponding bleeding of the tongue.",

The present study has evaluated the expression of claudin-4 in 10 normal canine hepatoid glands and in 67 hepatoid glands with hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions. The lesions studied included normal hepatoid glands (n = 10), nodular hyperplasias (n = 10), adenomas (n = 12), epitheliomas (n = 15), differentiated carcinomas (n = 15) and anaplastic carcinomas (n = 15). There was an intensive expression of claudin-4 in normal canine hepatoid glands as well as in hyperplasias and adenomas. Claudin-4 was detected as a well-localised linear circumferential membranous staining pattern of epithelial cells (mature hepatoid cells) in normal hepatoid glands, perianal gland hyperplasias and adenomas. In nodular hyperplasia and adenoma, the reserve cells showed membrane positivity for the claudin-4 molecule. There was a weaker expression in hepatoid gland epitheliomas. In the epitheliomas, the basaloid reserve cells never expressed the claudin-4 molecule. The multiple small parts of epitheliomas in which the cells exhibited typical hepatoid features showed a well-localised linear circumferential membranous staining pattern for claudin-4. The numerical score for cellular expression of claudin-4 was higher in differentiated carcinomas than in epitheliomas, but moderately lower than in adenomas. The anaplastic, poorly differentiated hepatoid gland carcinomas showed an overexpression of claudin-4. These results suggest that low claudin-4 expression in epitheliomas is a molecular characteristic indicative of increasing cellular disorientation, detachment motility and invasion by tumour cells, and claudin-4 seems to be helpful in distinguishing undifferentiated carcinomas from differentiated carcinomas and epitheliomas of the hepatoid gland. In addition, claudin-4 can help distinguish epithelioma from differentiated carcinoma of the canine hepatoid gland.",

This paper presents the first report on the presence of MRSA on large pig breeding farms in Croatia, together with the determination of the mecA gene, the results of spa typing and susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials. Dust samples (7-11 per farm) were collected from eight large pig farms in Croatia. Of the total 68 swabs, the mecA gene was detected in 24 isolates growing on the MRSA agar. All isolates were resistant to oxacillin, tetracycline and streptomycin, and susceptible only to vancomycin, while 92% of the strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Genotyping of the MRSA strains was performed by spa typing, and revealed t011 (n = 17), t034 (n = 5) and t1451 (n = 2).

Mercury concentrations in the livers were significantly higher in the adult population (4.479 ± 3.336 mg/kg dry matter, DM) than in the juvenile birds (2.682 ± 2.087 mg/kg DM), indicating an increase of bioaccumulation with age.

The average levels of mercury (3.580 ± 2.906 mg/kg DM) and lead (0.746 ± 0.499 mg/kg DM) were statistically different in the liver. No correlation was found between the concentrations of the two heavy metals. Recently, the wild birds have been chronically exposed to subtoxic amounts of metals which have a tendency to accumulate especially in the soft tissues.",

    "abstract": "Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) can cause a variety of neoplasms, including mainly myeloid leukosis (myelocytomatosis) and nephromas. Other tumours, such as histiocytic sarcoma (HS), haemangiosarcoma and mesothelioma, may also develop. In a previous article we described a case in which myeloid leukosis, haemangiomas and leiomyosarcomas appeared simultaneously in a commercial layer flock with infection by ALV-J. The present research was completed to understand the molecular characteristics of the ALV-J strain that induced clinical myeloid leukosis, haemangiomas and leiomyosarcomas. Two strains of ALV-J (SDAU1001 and SDAU1002) were isolated and identified, and their full-length sequences were analysed. The complete genome nucleotide sequences of these two isolates were different in length, 7652 nt and 7636 nt, respectively. They shared 98.9% identity with each other, and 93.4% to 97.8% nucleotide identity to the reference ALV-J isolates. A 19-nucleotide repeat sequence was identified in the primer binding site (PBS) leader region of isolate SDAU1001. A base substitution mutation (base 15 C-T) in this insertion was identified. However, the identical insertion at the same site was not found in SDAU1002. The gag and pol genes of the two viruses were more conserved than the env gene. One key deletion in the E element was a common feature of SDAU1001 and SDAU1002. SDAU1001 and SDAU1002, possibly recombinants of ALV-J and another avian retrovirus, may share the same ancestor. Co-infection by SDAU1001 and SDAU1002 isolates is a possible explanation why myeloid leukosis, haemangiomas, and leiomyosarcomas appeared simultaneously in the same commercial layer flock.",

G1789A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was investigated as a candidate for litter size. Samples from 80 purebred Mangalica sows and data of their 335 litters were provided by Olmos & Tóth Ltd. Hair follicles were used to isolate the required DNA. Allelic discrimination was performed by means of the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method using the AluI restriction enzyme and agarose gel electrophoresis. In the population examined, the A allele was found to be preferable in the Mangalica breed group. The most advantageous AA genotype was the least prevalent (8.75%), while the frequencies of AB and BB were 40% and 51.25%, respectively. Remarkably, the average number of piglets born alive per litter was 1.11 ± 0.39 higher in sows with AA as compared to those with BB genotype. By raising the frequency of the AA genotype, the litter size is likely to increase. However, the effect of PRLR genotypes can differ among pig breeds and even lines. Further studies may be required to observe and estimate possible pleiotropic effects of this polymorphism on other traits.",

Detailed ultrastructural examination revealed an additional concurrent infection with chlamydia-like particles. The particles were identified by PCR as fowlpox virus and Chlamydophila psittaci. It is worth noting that both pathogens can generate morphologic forms capable of prolonged survival and inducing latent and persistent infection. We suggest a possible interaction between the two pathogens on ultrastructural level and assess the clinical consequences of the mixed infection. This study also demonstrates a potential of the transmission electron microscope (TEM) for identifying a superinfection with another pathogen (in this case C. psittaci), which may remain undetected by routine techniques.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of rIL-10 on lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) induced haematological and biochemical disturbances in rats. In the present study, 40 rats were used and divided equally into four groups. Group 1 (control group, C) was treated with 0.9% saline. Group 2: LPS was injected intravenously (1.6 mg/100 g), Group 3 received rIL10 treatment (125 μg/kg) 2 min before 0.9% saline injection, Group 4 received rIL10 treatment 2 min before endotoxin treatment. When compared with the controls, platelet count, leukocyte count (with a marked neutrophilia and lymphopenia) and fibrinogen were decreased, while activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged in the endotoxaemic rats. In addition, LPS caused statistically significant increases in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities as well as creatinine, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, while it caused a statistically significant decrease in glucose, total protein and albumin levels as compared to the control group. On the other hand, rIL10 significantly suppressed disturbances in the haematological and biochemical parameters associated with endotoxaemia. As a result, rIL10 may be efficacious in preventing haematological disorders, tissue damage and changes in lipid, protein and carbohydrate metabolism in endotoxaemia.",

However, little is known about their mRNA expression pattern and encoded proteins distribution in porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation (IVM). Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from 31 puberal crossbred Landrace gilts and analysed for their Cdk4 and Cx43 mRNA expression using RQ-PCR and for the respective protein expression by confocal microscopic observations. An increased Cdk4 and Cx43 mRNA expression was found in oocytes after IVM (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Confocal microscopic observations revealed a significant increase of Cdk4 protein expression in the cytoplasm of oocytes during the maturation process. The localisation of Cx43 changed from zona pellucida before to cytoplasm of oocytes after IVM. It is supposed that the increased expression of Cdk4 and Cx43 mRNA in oocytes after IVM is linked with the accumulation of a large amount of templates during the process of oocyte maturation. The translocation especially of Cx43 from the zona pellucida into the cytoplasm may be associated with a decrease in gap junction activity in fully grown porcine oocytes. Both Cdk4 and Cx43 can be used as 'checkpoints' of oocyte maturation.",

Twenty healthy Thoroughbred horses were selected for the study based on a 25-item rating questionnaire survey used for characterising equine temperament. Eight temperamental and twelve calm horses took part in the experiment. The horses trotted as a warm-up activity, and then galloped on a rounded sand track. Blood sampling was conducted four times for each horse. Horses with a more excitable temperament showed a higher cortisol response to the test (P = 0.036). In conclusion, cortisol levels in response to a mild intensive exercise can be affected by temperament in horses. Serum cortisol may be a relevant marker to quantify individual temperamental differences in racehorses.",

    "abstract": "Double ovulation occurs more frequently in multiparous cows with high milk production than in primiparous cows and the rate of twin pregnancy/calving is increasing worldwide. Diagnosis of twin pregnancy is possible by ultrasound at the time of early pregnancy examination [28-34 days after artificial insemination (AI)]. Pregnancy proteins are also well-known indicators of gestation. The risk of pregnancy loss during the first trimester of gestation for cows carrying twins is three to nine times higher than for cows carrying singletons. Pregnancy-specific protein B (PSPB) is a good indicator not only of pregnancy but also of pregnancy loss. The aims of this study were (a) to collect calving data in some Hungarian Holstein-Friesian herds (n = 7,300) to compare PSPB serum concentrations (measured 29-35 days post insemination) in twin- and singleton-calving cows (Trial 1), and (b) to check the predictive value of PSPB serum concentration for twin pregnancy and pregnancy loss in high-producing Spanish Holstein-Friesian cows (n = 98; Trial 2). Our results showed almost 7% twin calving rate. Although hormonal treatments are commonly believed to be major causes of twin pregnancies, our data do not support this hypothesis. The only exception is the single PGF injection, which significantly increased twin calving. No effect of milk production on the risk of twin pregnancy was found, and twin pregnancy increased with parity. The AI bull, the bull's sire, the bull's grandfather and the cow's father also affected twin calving (P ≤ 0.02). We found much higher frequency of twin calving in cows diagnosed pregnant with higher than 3 ng/ml serum PSPB concentrations at 29-35 days after insemination. In Trial 2, non-significant but well-marked differences were found in PSPB serum concentration between singleton- and twin-pregnant cow samples (2.1 and 2.9 ng/ml) at different bleeding times. Probably the small size of the study population and the effects of milk production on PSPB values may explain this lack of significance.",

RT-PCR positive products were submitted for Sanger's sequencing and phylogeny reconstruction. Bacteriological examinations were performed to diagnose a possible bacterial involvement. BLAST analysis revealed that the nucleotide sequences of the six (18.8%) RT-PCR positive amplicons were 90-97% identical to the partial sequence of the ORF1a gene of the recently described ball python nidovirus. All tested snakes were negative for ferlavirus. Thirteen out of 32 samples (40.6%) were bacteriologically positive. Respiratory tract diseases can be a substantial problem for snake breeders, considering the rapid transmission of respiratory pathogens. The results and published studies show that ball python nidovirus is circulating in python collections and could be linked to suboptimal management practices. Surveillance programs are desirable as part of the routine snake health assessment. Tracheobronchial lavage is a fast, practical, cost-effective procedure for sample collection.",

Molecular characterisation was performed by sequencing, followed by phylogenetic analysis of the novel sequences.

The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the NDV isolates from different areas of Egypt were genetically closely related and all belonged to genotype VII. The histopathological hallmarks included haemorrhagic tracheitis, interstitial pneumonia with syncytia formation, haemorrhagic proventriculitis, necrotising pancreatitis, pan-lymphoid depletion, non-suppurative encephalitis and nephritis. Immunological detection of NDV antigen clarified the widespread presence of viral antigen in different organs with severe lesions. The present study confirmed that a virulent NDV of genotype VII became the predominant strain, causing severe outbreaks in poultry farms in Egypt. The presence of viral antigen in different organs indicates the pantropic nature of the virus. Immunohistochemistry was a very useful diagnostic tool for the detection of NDV antigen.",

The intention was to elucidate their immediate involvement in pneumonia formation. Due to the cross-reactivity of the applied antibodies, a species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for both targeted Mycoplasma species was applied additionally. In the 42 cases (60.9%) positive for at least one pathogen, several agents were present in a high proportion of the samples ( P. multocida – 34.8%, B. bronchiseptica – 29.0%), while others were present in a moderate (feline herpesvirus type 1 – 18.8%, M. gateae – 13.0%, M. felis – 10.1%) or low percentage ( T. gondii – 1.4%). All samples were negative for C. felis , feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus. Mixed infections of up to four pathogens were more frequent than single infections. Mycoplasma preferably colonised lung tissue damaged by other pathogens because they never occurred as single infections. Pasteurella multocida , B. bronchiseptica , M. felis , feline herpesvirus type 1 and T. gondii showed abundant replication within lung lesions, thus suggesting a prominent role in pneumonia formation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is one of the major pathogens causing acute enteritis, which is characterised by vomiting and watery diarrhoea and commonly leads to high rates of mortality and morbidity in suckling piglets. Chitosan has been regarded as a promising natural disinfectant. In this study, the disinfectant effect and mammalian-cell toxicity of chitosan were evaluated against PEDV using Vero cells. A 0.01% solution of chitosan was determined to be an effective disinfectant. In addition, no evidence of toxicity was observed during the cell toxicity test; on the contrary, chitosan promoted cell proliferation. In conclusion, chitosan is a promising candidate for an effective and safe disinfectant against PEDV as well as other coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this 30-day feeding study was to elucidate the changes, correlations, and mechanisms caused by the replacement of the starch content of the AIN-93G diet (St) with glucose (G), fructose (F) or lard (L) in body and organ weights, metabolic changes and caecal microbiota composition in rats (Wistar, SPF). The body weight gain of rats on the F diet was 12% less ( P = 0.12) than in the St group. Rats on the L diet consumed 18.6% less feed, 31% more energy and gained 58.4% more than the animals on the St diet, indicating that, in addition to higher energy intake, better feed utilisation is a key factor in the obesogenic effect of diets of high nutrient and energy density. The G, F and L diets significantly increased the lipid content of the liver (St: 7.01 ± 1.48; G: 14.53 ± 8.77; F: 16.73 ± 8.77; L: 19.86 ± 4.92% of DM), suggesting that lipid accumulation in the liver is not a fructose-specific process. Relative to the St control, specific glucose effects were the decreasing serum glucagon (–41%) concentrations and glucagon/leptin ratio and the increasing serum leptin concentrations (+26%); specific fructose effects were the increased weights of the kidney, spleen, epididymal fat and the decreased weight of retroperitoneal fat and the lower immune response, as well as the increased insulin (+26%), glucagon (+26%) and decreased leptin (–25%) levels. This suggests a mild insulin resistance and catabolic metabolism in F rats. Specific lard effects were the decreased insulin (–9.14%) and increased glucagon (+40.44%) and leptin (+44.92%) levels. Relative to St, all diets increased the operational taxonomic units of the phylum Bacteroidetes. G and L decreased, while F increased the proportion of Firmicutes. F and L diets decreased the proportions of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Correlation and centrality analyses were conducted to ascertain the positive and negative correlations and relative weights of the 32 parameters studied in the metabolic network. These correlations and the underlying potential mechanisms are discussed.",

In this study we examined the prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria in food-producing animals. We collected 100 porcine and 114 poultry samples to examine the prevalence of ESBL producers. Isolates were identified using the MALDI-TOF system and their antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the disk diffusion method. ESBL gene families and phylogroups were detected by polymerase chain reactions. The prevalence of ESBL producers was relatively high in both sample groups: 72 (72.0%) porcine and 39 (34.2%) poultry isolates were ESBL producers. Escherichia coli isolates were chosen for further investigations. The most common ESBL gene was CTX-M-1 (79.3%). Most of the isolates belong to the commensal E. coli phylogroups. The porcine isolates could be divided into three phylogroups, while the distribution of the poultry isolates was more varied. In summary, ESBL-producing bacteria are prevalent in the faecal samples of the examined food-producing animals, with a dominance of the CTX-M-1 group enzymes and commensal E. coli phylogroups.",

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by the disk diffusion method. The observed drug resistance rate was the highest to ampicillin and cefazolin, while the lowest against ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. In the molecular assays, bla TEM (8 Citrobacter spp.), bla SHV (2 Escherichia coli , 1 Hafnia alvei , and a Serratia liquefaciens ), tet A genes ( E. coli and Klebsiella spp.) and a class 1 integron without any gene cassette ( E. coli ) were detected. Among the strains, no plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance [ qnrA , qnrB , qnrS , qepA and aac (6 ′)-Ib-cr ] was found. However, two of three quinolone-resistant Klebsiella strains showed the novel amino acid substitution in the gyr A gene resulting in Ser83Asp and Asp87Glu.The clonality between E. coli isolates was also examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.

The presence of pseudorabies virus (PrV) DNA was confirmed in samples originating from six domestic pigs (3%) and one wild boar (0.95%). Positive samples were sequenced and analysed on the basis of a gC genome fragment. PrV strains have shown to be genetically identical and they are strongly related to some representative strains in the relatively heterogeneous Clade A. The results clearly show that PrV is still circulating among the domestic pig population in Croatia. Furthermore, the presence of pseudorabies virus in wild boars underlines the importance of this species as a PrV reservoir.

The purpose of the immobilisation was to provide opportunity for microchip implantation, ear tag placement, intradermal tuberculin test and blood sampling. All animals were immobilised with thiafentanil oxalate 6 mg/animal (0.007-0.01 mg/kg) and azaperone 40 mg/animal (0.07-0.04 mg/kg) using Dan-inject darts and gun. The opioid reversal agent naltrexone hydrochloride 60 mg/animal (0.07-0.1 mg/kg) was given intravenously to the ear vein. The mean induction time was 3.9 ± 0.2 min, the recovery time was 1.65 ± 0.87 min. The results of the present study indicate that thiafentanil oxalate, this low-volume, high-potency, reversible drug combined with azaperone provides fast induction and smooth recovery. The authors recommend this drug combination as a reliable immobilising regimen for African buffalo.",

None of the suture lines is stitched through the auricle completely as they all run intradermally on the side of the haematoma and to the cartilage on the other side. Twenty-three dogs with aural haematoma were treated between 2006 and 2012. In 21 (91%) of them, the haematoma healed without any auricle deformity. No secondary intervention was necessary in any of the cases. None of the 23 animals experienced a relapse during follow-up.

Food samples of 25 g or 25 ml were homogenised in 225 ml of Listeria Enrichment Broth (LEB) with Oxford supplement, and the redox potential measurement technique was applied. For Listeria species the measuring time was maximum 34 h. The absence of L. monocytogenes could reliably be proven by the redox potential measurement method, but Listeria innocua and Bacillus subtilis could not be differentiated from L. monocytogenes on the basis of the redox curves. The presence of L. monocytogenes had to be confirmed by real-time PCR. The combination of these two methods proved to detect < 10 cfu/g of L. monocytogenes in a cost- and time-effective manner.

This study attempted to monitor the geographical and seasonal distribution of these two Nosema species in Hungary, using a simple laboratory method. The distribution of N. ceranae and N. apis infection rates along all seasons was homogeneous (P = 0.57). In co-infected samples, the intensity of N. ceranae infection was always significantly higher than that of N. apis infection (P < 0.001). The infection rate of infected bees in exterior samples was higher than in interior samples in each season; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The species N. ceranae had been present in Hungary already in 2004. Statistical analysis of data shows that the infection level is best represented by sampling exterior bees to establish the proportion of infected bees rather than by determining the mean spore count.",

The correct detection of CDV had been achieved in ten out of eleven positive cases (90.9%) upon initial investigation, but the presence of bacterial pathogens, like B. bronchiseptica (10 cases) and P. multocida (17 cases) had been missed in all but one case. While CDV and CRCoV infections were exclusively found in dogs younger than one year, the vast majority of infections with P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica were both common either in dogs younger than 4 months or older than one year.

The expression of key insulin signalling proteins (IRβ, PKCζ and mTOR) was assessed by semiquantitative Western blotting from the tissues mentioned. The type of diet had a remarkable influence on the insulin homeostasis of chickens. The wheat-based diet significantly increased IRβ and mTOR expression in the liver as well as mTOR and PKCζ expression in the adipose tissue when compared to animals kept on a maize-based diet. IRβ expression in the liver was stimulated by the lower dose of non-protected butyrate as well, suggesting the potential of butyrate as a feed additive to affect insulin sensitivity. Based on the results obtained, the present study shows new aspects of nutritional factors by comparing the special effects of butyrate as a feed additive and those of the cereal type, presumably in association with dietary non-starch polysaccharide- (NSP-) driven enteric shortchain fatty acid release including butyrate, influencing insulin homeostasis in chickens. As the tissues of chickens have physiologically lower insulin sensitivity compared to mammals, diet-associated induction of the insulin signalling pathway can be of special importance in improving growth and metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Canine congenital sensorineural deafness (CCSD) affects predisposed breeds of dogs and is primarily caused by an atrophy of the stria vascularis of the organ of Corti. The analysis of the brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) is a reliable method for the evaluation of hearing in animals as it allows an accurate detection of unilateral or bilateral deafness. The occurrence of unilateral and bilateral deafness using the BAER was determined in a representative group of dogs in Poland, including Bull Terriers (n = 117), Australian Cattle Dogs (n = 62), English Setters (n = 32) and the Dogo Argentino (n = 32). Overall deafness, deafness in each dog breed and an association between deafness and phenotype were studied. Among the 243 dogs tested, 156 (81%) had a normal BAER, 27 (11%) were unilaterally deaf, and 12 (5%) were bilaterally deaf. The amplitudes and latencies of waves I, II, III, V, the V/I wave amplitude ratio, and wave I-V, I-III and III-V inter-peak intervals were recorded for each dog. Unilaterally and bilaterally deaf dogs were present in all the dog breeds studied. There were 17 (14.5%) deaf Bull Terriers, three (4.8%) deaf Australian Cattle Dogs, seven (21.9%) deaf English Setters, and 12 (37.5%) deaf Dogos Argentinos. Preventive BAER screening should be routinely performed in these four breeds to prevent the spread of genes responsible for deafness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The information about the clinical features of Leishmania infantum infection in cats is scarce. In this study, we evaluated the serum protein electrophoresis of samples from 19 infected but apparently healthy cats. To detect L. infantum infection, two serological tests, i.e. western blot (WB) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as well as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on the blood samples were performed. Eventual infection by several selected bacterial and viral pathogens was also tested. All but one of the cats were found positive with WB. The WB-negative cat was positive by ELISA only. From the 18 WB-positive cats, only three were positive also by ELISA and eight with qPCR, including the only animal which was positive in all the three tests. No concomitant infections were detected in any of the cats. The main alteration of the proteinogram was characterised by an increase of the α- 2 fraction. In the five cats with hypergammaglobulinaemia, the pattern detected was polyclonal. None of the cats were seropositive to any other pathogens tested. The presence of polyclonal gammopathy and elevation of the α -2 fraction could suggest the presence of active infection. In contrast, the only detection of an increase of the α -2 fraction alone with the presence of positive serological result could be associated by immune response activation against L. infantum.",

Six dose groups (A to F) were established with changing caffeine concentrations (from 0.625 to 10 mg/mL). The control samples were prepared by diluting the ejaculate only with physiological salt solution. The samples were examined after 0, 1, 2 and 3 h of incubation at 5 °C and 37 °C. The motility parameters were evaluated by Computer Assisted Semen Analyzer (CASA) system, and the viability was assessed by the mitochondrial toxicity test at the end of the incubation. A positive effect of the lowest tested caffeine concentration on the motility parameters was observed throughout the incubation period at 5 °C. At the end of the 3h incubation, the viability in every sample in these groups, treated with any caffeine concentration, showed lower values compared to the control. At the higher incubation temperature (37 °C), caffeine positively affected the motility in samples B ( P &lt; 0.05) and D, E, F ( P &lt; 0.001) after 3 h of incubation; however, the viability showed a slightly decreasing tendency. Our results suggest that caffeine, in an optimal concentration, may be used as a component of stallion semen extenders.",

Each particular microelement reached a high concentration [molybdenum (Mo) 39.00, cadmium (Cd) 2.30, lead (Pb) 4.01, mercury (Hg) 30.00, and selenium (Se) 36.20 mg/kg dry matter] in the carrot. In a metabolic balance trial conducted with 15 male and 15 female New Zealand White rabbits, the control animals (n = 5) were fed ad libitum with concentrate as basal diet, while the other rabbits received the basal diet and carrots containing the particular microelement. Blood samples were taken to determine the activity of serum enzymes. To investigate the metabolism of Mo, Cd, Pb, Hg and Se, samples were taken from the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, ovaries/testicles, entire digestive tract, adipose tissue, femur, hair, faeces and urine. Carrot had significantly higher digestibility for all nutrients than the rabbit concentrate. Carrot samples of high Pb content had the lowest digestibility of crude protein. The microelements differed in their rate of accumulation in the organs examined: Mo and Cd accumulated in the kidneys, Pb in the kidneys, liver, bones and lungs, Hg in the kidneys and liver, while Se in the liver, kidneys and heart. The proportions of microelements eliminated from the body either via the faeces and urine (Mo 80.18% and Se 47.41%) or via the faeces (Cd 37.86%, Pb 66.39%, Hg 64.65%) were determined. Pathohistological examination revealed that the rate of spermatogenesis was reduced in the Mo, Cd, Pb and Hg groups compared to the control. Lead, Cd and Hg intake resulted in a considerable decrease in gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and in an increase of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity because of damages to the kidneys and bones. All experimental treatments decreased the activity of cholinesterase (CHE) because of lesions in the liver.",

Two of the species could be identified as M. alburni and M. obesus . Of the other two species, the gill parasite proved to be a hitherto undescribed species which is described here as a new species by the name of M. margitae . One of the two gillparasitic species, M. obesus , formed plasmodia in the respiratory lamellae of the gill filaments, while the plasmodia of M. margitae n. sp. were formed in the afferent artery of the primary gill filaments. The plasmodia containing spores morphologically identifiable with the species M. alburni were located in the connective tissue between the fin rays. The less frequently found muscle-parasitic Myxobolus species has not been identified precisely. The plasmodia of M. obesus were found in the fish in May and June, while those of M. alburni and M. margitae n. sp. in July and August. The prevalence of infection in fish examined in these periods was 15.5% for M. obesus , 11.5% for M. margitae and 14.0% for M. alburni .",

A total of 28 diarrhoeic (n = 18) and healthy (n = 10) Holstein-Friesian calves of different sexes, between 1 and 30 days of age, were used. Blood and urine samples were obtained from diarrhoeic calves before the treatment and then three more times at 24-h intervals during the treatment. From healthy calves, samples were taken only once. Therapy was started by the intravenous administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 0.9% sodium chloride solutions for the first 24 h, followed by the oral application of a commercial electrolyte solution (sodium chloride 3.5 g, trisodium citrate 2.9 g, potassium chloride 1.5 g and glucose anhydrous 20 g in 1 litre H 2 O) up to the 48th h of therapy. Before the therapy, the average levels of pH (7.10 ± 0.12), bicarbonate (HCO 3 - ) (16.48 ± 3.80 mmol/l), base deficit (-12.65 ± 5.97 mmol/l) and fractional excretion (FE) of sodium (0.16 ± 0.11%) and potassium (15.07 ± 8.56%) were significantly lower while serum urea (17.48 ± 10.32 mmol/l) and creatinine (Cr) concentrations (169.72 ± 98.12 µmol/l), haematocrit levels (45.13 ± 13.60%) and urinary gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)/Cr ratio (8.6 ± 4.3 × 1/10 3 U/µmol) were significantly higher in diarrhoeic calves than in healthy calves. Alterations in parameters indicating the presence of renal dysfunction were normalised in the diarrhoeic calves that survived (83.3%). Three calves with severe metabolic acidosis and azotaemia died at the beginning of therapy. It was concluded that the FE of Na and K (FE Na , FE K ) and urine GGT/Cr ratio may have an important role in assessing renal function in diarrhoeic calves and in evaluating the effectiveness of an applied fluid therapy.",

These findings suggest that the Chimalhuacan strain of NDV causes an early and severe damage of the haematopoietic cells including thrombocyte precursors, which might explain the marked thrombocytopenia detected in early stages of this disease.",

Eight-cell stage embryos were zona drilled and one blastomere was removed. Developed morulae or blastocysts were vitrified in microdrop (35% EG + 5% PVP + 0.4 M trehalose) or in straw (7.0 M EG + 0.5 M sucrose). Following recovery, embryos were cultivated in vi tro or transferred into recipients. Cryopreservation had an effect not only on the survival of biopsied embryos but also on their subsequent development in vitro . Cryosurvival of biopsied morulae vitrified in straw was significantly inferior to SSV. The post-warm development of biopsied and non-biopsied morulae was delayed on Day 3.5 and 4.5 in both vitrification groups. A delay in development was observed on Day 5.5 among vitrified non-biopsied blastocysts. The percentage of pups born from biopsied morulae or blastocysts following cryopreservation did not differ from that of the control. No significant differences could be detected between methods within and between embryonic stages in terms of birth rate. The birth rate of biopsied embryos vitrified in straw was significantly lower compared to the non-biopsied embryos. The novel cryopreservation protocol of SSV proved to be effective for cryopreservation of morula- and blastocyst-stage biopsied embryos.",

There was a significant difference in laterality between cows that developed mastitis and cows that did not. Cows that developed mastitis, had an increased left laterality in lying, which was related to the increased probability of a right-sided mastitis episode. However, the effect was not significant due to the large variation in the data. At the same time, significantly more cows with clinical mastitis had a somatic cell count (SCC) higher than that of cows without clinical mastitis. While a significant correlation was found between the occurrence of treated mastitis cases and SCC > 1,000,000, no statistically significant differences could be observed in milk production between the two groups.",

The main findings of the study, conducted on a total of 10 owls, are as follow: (1) The thyroid gland of barn owl can be stimulated by the classical TRH stimulation test. (2) T3 response was much more pronounced both under cold (around 10°C) and warm (around 20°C) conditions, whereas T4 response ranged so widely that we could not point out any significant change in it. (3) Basal T3 plasma level was significantly (p = 0.036) higher in birds exposed to cold temperature, and they responded to TRH treatment with a lower plasma T3 elevation than the birds kept in a warm chamber. This pattern, however, cannot be explained by increased food intake, but is in agreement with the fact that enhanced T3 level may account for higher avUCP mRNA expression, which results in higher heat production on the cell level. From the results it is concluded that altering T3 plasma level plays a significant role in cold-induced thermoregulation.",

IVF mouse embryos were vitrified by the open-pulled straw (OPS) method. After warming, embryos were morphologically evaluated and assessed by their development to blastocysts, hatched blastocysts or term. The results showed that a high proportion (93.3-100.0%) of vitrified embryos at all developmental stages were morphologically normal after recovery. The developmental rate of vitrified 1-cell embryos to blastocyst (40.0%) or hatched blastocyst (32.7%) or term (9.3%) was significantly lower than that from other stages (P < 0.05). Vitrified embryos from 2-cell to early blastocyst stage showed similar blastocyst (71.8-89.5%) and hatched blastocyst rates (61.1-69.6%) and could develop to term without a significant loss of survival compared with those of fresh embryos (P > 0.05). Vitrified 2-cell embryos showed the highest survival rate in vivo (50.6%, 88/174), compared with that from other stages (9.3-30.5%, P < 0.05). The data demonstrate that the OPS method is suitable for the cryopreservation of IVF mouse embryos from 2-cell stage to early blastocyst stage without a significant loss of survival. Embryos at the 2-cell stage had the best tolerance for cryopreservation in the present study.",

Five birds were used for each nutrient at each concentration of phytate tested. Leucine uptake decreased linearly (P &lt; 0.001) and that of glutamate showed a tendency to decrease (P = 0.055) as the phytate concentration increased. Absorption of lysine and glucose were unaffected by the presence of phytate. In conclusion, phytate in the small intestinal lumen exerted a depressive effect on the absorption of specific free amino acids from the lumen. Its depressive effect was greatest for leucine followed by glutamate, and phytate had little effect on the absorption of lysine.",

The molecular mechanisms that control the mycotoxin-mediated effects are far from being completely understood. Various results show that these mycotoxins could inhibit cell proliferation. In the present short communication, the influence of β-ZOL and DON on the abundance and phosphorylation state of kinases that are included in regulation of the initiation of mRNA translation (which is correlated with cell proliferation) was compared in porcine endometrial cells (PEC). Our results indicate that these mycotoxins modulate the expression and phosphorylation of these factors in a different manner. Whereas β-ZOL mainly had an impact on the biological activity of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (Akt), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and its repressor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), DON reduced the abundance of p38 MAPk, Akt and specific 4E-BP1 bands. In summary, these results indicate that β-ZOL influences molecular events that are included in the initiation of mRNA translation in the porcine endometrium but DON does not alter such processes clearly.",

All diets were fed to the cows over a period from 21 ± 3 days (d) prior to the expected calving to d 100 ± 5 postpartum. On d 25 (basal sample) and d 14 prepartum as well as on d 5 and 25 postpartum liver samples were collected by percutaneous biopsy.

At d 5 postpartum, both control and CAS cows had higher liver lipid (P &lt; 0.05) and lower glycogen (P &lt; 0.05) concentrations than cows in the HTG group. No significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences were detected in liver fat content among the groups at d 14 prepartum or d 25 postpartum. The glycogen concentration slightly decreased in the liver of cows in each treatment group from d 14 prepartum to d 5 postpartum; however, this decrease was more intensive in both the control and CAS groups than in the HTG group. The variations in liver lipid concentrations were accompanied by significant changes in the proportion of C16:0, C16:1n-7, C18:0, C18:1n-9, C18:2n-6 and C20:4n-6 fatty acids in the liver lipids.

Typhimurium inoculated to the food samples without any preceding procedure of enrichment. The duration of the entire experiment from DNA isolation and purification to PCR amplification was less than 12 h. This study demonstrated that realtime PCR is a rapid and reliable technique for quantifying S . Typhimurium possessing the spaQ gene in pure culture and in meat products.",

    "abstract": "A real-time PCR assay was evaluated for the rapid detection (10 h) of Salmonella in meats using molecular beacon probes available as a commercial kit (iQ-Check, Bio-Rad laboratories). Raw (chicken, pork) and ready-to-eat (RTE) meats were artificially contaminated with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium at the estimated level of 2 to 4 cells per 25 g. After 8 h of pre-enrichment in buffered peptone water, a molecular beacon-based PCR assay was performed to detect contamination in raw and RTE meats. The sensitivity and accuracy of the assay were compared with the conventional USDA microbiological procedure. Comparative evaluation of the USDA procedure with the rapid PCR assay for meat samples (n = 63) revealed 1 false negative pork sample with the PCR assay. All uninoculated controls (n = 34) but one sample were negative by both the 10-h PCR assay and the USDA procedure. Developing rapid pathogen detection methods with shorter pre-enrichment times (8-h) and real-time data monitoring capabilities will benefit the industry in preventing recall of contaminated meats by stopping the contaminated products from being introduced into the marketplace.",

Livers of rats, cats, guinea pigs and humans were used. The different nerve elements were identified by ABC immunohistochemistry and analysed semiquantitatively. Large numbers of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibres were observed in the human and guinea pig liver, and they were in close contact with portal triads, central veins and ran parallel with liver sinuses. A few substance P, somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide IR nerve fibres were also detected intralobularly, while galanin nerve fibres were only observed around portal triads. In the rat liver only a few NPY-positive nerve fibres were found, exclusively in portal tracts. Some nerve cell bodies (IR for NPY and somatostatin) were also found in the liver of guinea pigs, young cats and humans, therefore some of the nerve terminals might originate from these intrinsic ganglia. It can be concluded that the innervation pattern of the guinea pig liver shows the highest similarity to that of the human liver.",

C2 cells were cultured in media supplemented with linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, alpha-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as lipid peroxides was tested. Furthermore, stressor-induced DNA damage was measured. Exposure of the cells to PUFAs resulted in a significant increase in the synthesis of both ROS and lipid peroxides. Distinct differences between the PUFAs tested underline the impact of the unsaturation degree of fatty acids as well as the position of double bonds on mast cells.",

Progressive motility showed the highest positive correlation with morphology on day 0 of collection, and progressive motility on day 3 (P < 0.05) showed a negative correlation with acrosome abnormalities (P < 0.05). According to the area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (AUCs), progressive motility could also be used in predicting semen quality after 3 days of storage (AUC > 0.5; P < 0.05). TNF-α in seminal plasma is the only parameter measured on day 0 to show a significant correlation with the percentage of viable spermatozoa after 3 days of semen storage (r = 0.495, P < 0.05). ROC analysis shows that TNF-α level is helpful in discriminating viability outcome after semen storage (AUC = 0.94, P < 0.001). We can predict with 92.35% certainty that fresh semen samples with more than 150 pg/ml of TNF-α in the seminal plasma will retain more than 85% of viable spermatozoa after 3 days of storage.

No gross pathological or histological lesions that could be associated with B. pilosicoli or B. alvinipulli were detectable in the intestinal mucous membrane including the colonised intestinal glands. Mortality did not occur during the experimental period. Decrease in body weight gain was significant in the T-2-toxin-treated groups, and it was slight (not significant) in the Brachyspira-infected groups. Crust on the beaks, necrosis, crusting and ulceration in the mucous membrane of the oral cavity and on the skin of the feet, atrophy of the thymus and bursa of Fabricius due to the effect of T-2 toxin, accompanied by lymphocyte depletion, were observed. These lesions were most prominent on days 14 and 21 PI but were seen on day 28 PI as well.

Ninety female sheep were divided into nine groups of various ages and physiological states (dry, lactation and pregnancy). Serum ALP, BALP and mineral levels were determined by commercial immunoassay, molecular absorbance spectrophotometry and chemical luminescence for BALP determination. Serum ALP and BALP decreased as sheep aged, and no statistically significant differences were obtained between ewes in different physiologic states. The continuous decline of serum BALP concentration along the sheep lifespan, namely in mature and old sheep, is a sign of decreasing bone turnover associated with ageing. Serum calcium concentrations increased slightly until 2 years of age and then showed a tenuous but statistically significant decrease in mature sheep, while serum phosphorus maintained an uninterrupted decrease as sheep matured. The knowledge of serum values of bone biomarkers throughout the sheep lifespan may be useful in preclinical orthopaedic research studies and for animal science studies using sheep.",

The efficiency of reverse transcription reaction was compared including a range of reverse transcriptases, thermal conditions and priming methods based on results obtained in the following realtime PCR. Depending on catalysis and the priming method used in the study a significant diversity of results was observed. The best efficacy of reverse transcription was obtained using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and priming with random nonamers and reverse, gene-specific primer. This combination improved the sensitivity of RT-PCR nearly 1000 times as compared to the method with AMV reverse transcriptase coupled with random hexamers. In summary, this study has demonstrated that the optimisation of reverse transcription can contribute to a higher sensitivity of RT-PCR diagnostic methods.",

The incidence of the disease had been decreasing since the late 1980s when deletion mutant variants (porcine respiratory coronavirus, PRCoV) of the virus emerged, repressing TGE gradually. Although disease manifestations are infrequent, the virus is still present in pig herds, causing sporadic outbreaks in a milder form. Identification and characterisation of the spike genes from TGEV and PRCoV, detected in such outbreaks, were performed in Hungary. Analysis of the amplified partial gene sequences showed that TGEV was present in herds with TGE clinical signs together with PRCoV. The sequences, apart from the deletions in PRCoV, were identical and at least two types of PRCoV spike proteins could be identified based on the length of the deleted sequence.",

The groups were fed a control and three experimental, isocaloric and isonitrogenous grower diets containing 15, 20 and 25% DDGS, respectively, combined with lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met) supplementation until 6 weeks of age. It was found that DDGS inclusion increased the ether extract content of the diets which resulted in higher reduced glutathione (GSH) content and elevated glutathione peroxidase activity (GSHPx) in the liver. However, DDGS addition with Lys and Met supplementation did not influence the malondialdehyde content of the blood and the liver. The oleic acid proportion of the diet showed a close positive correlation with GSH content of the liver. A smaller ratio of methionine and cysteine in the diet with DDGS resulted in significantly higher liver GSH content. GSHPx activity increased parallel with the elevated GSH content of the liver homogenate, suggesting that the enzyme is activated by the actual supply of its co-substrate. In conclusion, the results show that DDGS, even at a high inclusion level combined with Lys and Met supplementation, has no initiative effect on lipid peroxidation in the blood and liver of broiler chickens.",

J/M values for insulin and glucose concentrations were above 1.0 in all groups of cows. The ratios for NEFA and BHBA concentrations were under or equal to 1.0 in dry and LY cows but above 1.0 in the MY and HY groups, indicating that in MY and HY cows those metabolites are apparently utilised by the mammary gland. J/M values for urea were above 1.0 in dry and LY cows but less than 1.0 in groups MY and HY, indicating that in the latter case urea is apparently released by the mammary gland. In conclusion, J/M for NEFA, BHBA and urea may be useful for estimation of the critical point when the mammary gland receives insufficient energy precursors for its current activity.",

There is still scarce information as to whether or not gathering causes distress and pain to geese. A series of experiments was carried out by our research group to determine the effect of gathering on plasma corticosterone level in growing geese. In the present experiment, the reactions of five groups (two gathered and three not gathered groups) of 9-week-old Babat Hungarian Upgraded geese were compared regarding gathering. Blood samples were taken right before, during and 5 min, 1 and 3 h after gathering into heparinised tubes from all groups. The plasma concentration of corticosterone was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The results show that the plasma concentration of corticosterone is high in the first sample of all groups but is significantly lower at subsequent blood samplings compared to the first samples, especially in gathered geese. Compared to the first sampling, we observed higher corticosterone levels in samples collected 1 and 3 h after gathering. This was true only for groups which were not gathered, especially for the group which was not given any antistress material. From these results it can be concluded that the handling of geese causes an elevation in plasma corticosterone level and that feather gathering does not result in a higher corticosterone level than the handling or catching of the bird. Therefore, it can be concluded that feather gathering - especially when it is done adequately in time - does not cause more distress than the handling or catching of the bird.",

Significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) expression of the PTGS 2 gene was detected in the repeat breeders with SE, whereas there was no significant difference in the expression of PTGFS and mPTGES 1 mRNAs between repeatbreeding cows with SE and those without it (P &gt; 0.05). Our study confirms that increased endometrial expression of the PTGS 2 gene is involved in the inflammatory response in repeat breeders.",

    "abstract": "In this preliminary study, we determined the effect of a modified method involving the administration of two low doses of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) at an interval of 24 h on luteolysis in dairy cows, and compared it with the standard single-dose method. Twenty-six cows were assigned to three groups treated with two low doses (TLD group, n = 10), one standard dose (SD group, n = 10), and one low dose (OLD group, n = 6) on day 9 to 10 of the oestrous cycle (day 0 = the day of PGF2α administration). Their serum progesterone (P4) levels and corpus luteum (CL) sizes were measured daily from day 0 to 4 to assess CL regression. The results indicated that the proportion of complete luteolysis, indicating a P4 value ≤ 1 ng/mL on day 3, was higher in the TLD group (100.0%) than in the SD (60.0%) and OLD (66.7%) groups. Ultrasonically detected changes in the CL area correlated with the shifts in the P4 values in both the TLD and the SD groups. The remaining CL area was significantly smaller in the TLD group (17.8% ± 3.3%) than in the SD or OLD group on day 4. Thus, we concluded that the proportion of luteolysis in cows was increased with two low doses of PGF2α as compared to a single PGF2α dose, indicating the necessity of the second dose of PGF2α. However, further studies with larger sample sizes in the field are required.",

Our objective was to establish reference intervals for haematological parameters using the haematological cell counter LaserCyte (IDEXX). For this purpose, blood samples from 100 healthy adult horses (13 females and 87 males, ranging from 3 to 25 years of age) were analysed. The reference intervals were estimated following the ASVCP guidelines with the Reference Value Advisor software. The obtained reference intervals were 6.4–10.1 × 10 12 /L for red blood cells, 30.6–45.1% for haematocrit, 11.6–17.1 g/dL for haemoglobin, 42.8–53.2 fL for mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 15.5–20.8 pg for mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), 33.7–39.4 g/dL for mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, 17.8–20.3% for red cell distribution width (RDW), 4.5–10.1 × 10 9 /L for white blood cells, 2.2–6.0 × 10 9 /L for neutrophils, 0.9–4.9 × 10 9 /L for lymphocytes, 0.2–0.5 × 10 9 /L for monocytes, 0.1–0.6 × 10 9 /L for eosinophils, 0.0–0.1 × 10 9 /L for basophils, 78.5–172.2 K/mL for platelets, 4.3–9.4 fL for mean platelet volume, 18.8–24.2% for platelet distribution width, and 0.06–0.12% for plateletcrit. LaserCyte equine reference intervals are transferable to the Lusitano horse for 18 of the 22 analytes studied. Regarding age, significant statistical differences were observed for MCV, RDW, neutrophils and lymphocytes between the mean values of young (3–6 years old), middle-aged (7–14 years old) and old (&lt; 15 years old) age groups. MCH means were statistically significantly different between the three age groups. The haematological reference intervals established in this study might represent a valuable and applicable tool for haematological assessment of adult Lusitano horses, providing useful information that helps clinicians to interpret clinical data.",

    "abstract": "Reports of Sarcocystis rileyi -like protozoa (‘rice breast disease’) from anseriform birds had been rare in Europe until the last two decades, when S. rileyi was identified in northern Europe and the UK. However, despite the economic losses resulting from S. rileyi infection, no recent accounts are available on its presence (which can be suspected) in most parts of central, western, southern and eastern Europe. Between 2014 and 2019, twelve mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ) were observed to have rice breast disease in Hungary, and the last one of these 12 cases allowed molecular identification of S. rileyi , as reported here. In addition, S. rileyi was molecularly identified in the faeces of one red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ). The hunting season for mallards in Hungary lasts from mid-August to January, which in Europe coincides with the wintering migration of anseriform birds towards the south. Based on this, as well as bird ringing data, it is reasonable to suppose that the first S. rileyi -infected mallards arrived in Hungary from the north. on the other hand, red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes ), which are final hosts of S. rileyi , are ubiquitous in Hungary, and our molecular finding confirms an already established autochthonous life cycle of S. rileyi in the region. Taken together, this is the first evidence for the occurrence of S. rileyi in Hungary and its region.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and corresponding toxin genes of C. difficile in faecal samples and meat of quails. Thirty samples of packed quail meat in Mashhad, Iran and 500 faecal samples (pooled to n = 5) were collected on quail farms in the Northeastern Khorasan region for further investigation. Of 100 pooled quail faecal samples 10% showed cultural growth of C. difficile. In meat samples two out of 30 specimens (7%) showed cultural growth. In six of ten isolates from faecal samples toxin genes (tcdB and tcdA) were present, while four isolates harboured no toxin genes. However, in meat isolates no toxin genes were present. Mutations in the tcdC gene were not detected, indicating that 'hypervirulent' strains such as RT027 and RT078 were not present. The data suggest that quail and quail products might hold a potential for the spread of C. difficile.",

The fish were caught in the River Danube near Budapest. Papillomas were found around their oral cavity, at the operculum and at the pectoral fins, while epidermal hyperplasias were seen on the body surface. Cyprinid herpesvirus 1 (CyHV-1) was detected in the kidney of the specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and barbel circovirus 1 (BaCV1) was found in all internal organs and in the tissues of the tumours. The whole genome of BaCV1 and three conserved genes from the genome of CyHV-1 were sequenced. Previously, BaCV1 had been reported only once from a mass mortality event among barbel fry. The whole genome sequence of our circovirus shared 99.9% nucleotide identity with that of the formerly reported BaCV1. CyHV-1 is known to infect common carp and coloured carp ( Cyprinus carpio ), and has been assumed to infect other cyprinid fish species as well. We found the nucleotide sequences of the genes of CyHV-1 to be identical in 98.7% to those of the previous isolates from carp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular confirmation of the presence of CyHV-1 DNA in cyprinid fish species other than carp.",

The cells were exposed to DOX and DER for 24, 48 and 72 h. The viability and malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) and total glutathione (GSH) activities of CMT-U27 cells were determined. The half inhibition concentration (IC50) of DOX was found to be ∼0.9 μM in the 72-h period. IC50 and 1/10 IC50 concentrations of DOX were combined with all concentrations of DER (50-1000 μM) in the combination experiments. The results showed increased oxidative status associated with significant decreases of CAT and GSH levels in CMT-U27 cells exposed to 10-μM and higher concentrations of DOX compared to control cells. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the groups tested with any of the concentrations of DER (50-1000 μM). In combination treatments, DER attenuated DOX-induced oxidative damage by modulating the enzymatic and non-enzymatic components in CMT-U27 cells. We suggest that the combination of DOX and DER can be beneficial in the treatment of cancer cells by increasing cellular responses to oxidative stress. In conclusion, the use of COX inhibitor in conjunction with a chemotherapeutic agent may provide a basis for new concepts of cancer treatment through systematic modulation of the antioxidant defence systems in mammary cancers of animals.",

This bacterium usually causes disease in waters of more than 25 °C temperature. However, with the introduction of intensive fish farming systems, infected fish exposed to stress develop disease signs also at lower temperatures; in addition, the temperature of natural waters rises to the critical level due to global warming. Twenty-five isolates from wild and cultured freshwater fishes were identified as F. columnare by specific PCR, although both the fragment lengths and the results of PCRRFLP genotyping with BsuRI (HaeIII) and RsaI restriction enzymes raised doubts regarding this species classification. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene revealed that 23 isolates belonged to the species F. johnsoniae and two represented Chryseobacterium spp. The isolates were found to have high-level multidrug resistance: all were resistant to ampicillin and polymyxin B, the 23 F. johnsoniae strains to cotrimoxazole, 88% of them to gentamicin, and 72% to chloramphenicol.

The supernatant of pPG612.1-pLF-N/ L. pentosus had an inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus strain CVCC26003, Bacillus subtilis strain CVCC63501, Escherichia coli strain CVCC10141 and Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica Choleraesuis strain CVCC79102, while it did not inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus casei strain ATCC393. A mouse model was established to test the effectiveness of the orally administered probiotic L. pentosus recombinant strain in the gastrointestinal tract. Mice were immunised with an attenuated porcine Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV) vaccine. Serum antibody levels determined using a mouse Aujeszky’s disease IgG ELISA showed that IgG levels were significantly higher in the pPG612.1-pLFN/ L. pentosus group than in the PBS and Lactobacillus pentosus groups at days 7 and 21 (P &lt; 0.01) and at day 14 (P &lt; 0.05), indicating that this oral recombinant strain can improve the effectiveness of the vaccine and play a role in immune enhancement through humoral immunity. These results suggest that the recombinant Lactobacillus pentosus not only has the beneficial characteristics of lactic acid bacteria but also produces biologically functional lactoferrin.",

The results indicate that recombination events are not rare in the case of BVDV, which frequently causes immunotolerance and, consequently, persistent infection in calves. The lack of specific immunity provides an ideal possibility for multiple infections by antigenically related but genetically different BVDV strains, and hence recombinations may occur. Among the 62 BVDV-1 genomes five recombinants and their possible parent strains, while among the 50 BVDV-2 genomes one simple recombinant and its parent strains were identified, which were supported by extremely strong probability values (P values varying between 1.26 × 10 –4 and 1.58 × 10 –310 ). Besides the newly identified recombinants, recombination events described previously were confirmed, but in some of these cases former information was completed with new data, or different parent(s) were suggested by the programme (RDP 4.46 BETA) used in this study.",

A group of nine gilts (F1generation of Swedish Landrace Ã Large Yorkshire) were treated with 1 mg atrazine/kg body mass daily, mixed to the feed for 19 days before the onset of expected oestrus. Blood samples were obtained by cranial vena cava puncture three times daily at 3-h intervals on five post-treatment days, i.e. before and during oestrus.

The plasmodia of the parasite can be found on the gills typically in the spring months, and are located in the central part of the gill filaments. They start to develop in the lumen of capillaries of the secondary lamellae and remain in intralamellar location also after they have reached the mature stage. The spores have a very characteristic shape, as on the surface of the spore valves a distinctly emerging ridge runs parallel to the sutural line. In addition to breams from the typical habitat, Lake Balaton, the plasmodia of M. hungaricus could be detected also on breams originating from the river Danube.",

Rabbits of Group C received no dehydrated olive cake pulp in their diet, while rabbits of Group E1 and Group E2 were fed 10% and 20% dehydrated olive cake pulp, respectively.

Similarly, after 56 days of experimental fattening no significant differences were found between the control group and the experimental groups in the catalytic activity of the serum enzymes alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate amino-transferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). However, Group E2 rabbits manifested a significantly higher alanine amino-transferase (ALT) activity in the serum than did rabbits of Group E1.

This increase was not significant when insemination was performed at the end of the breeding season (2.0 vs. 1.4). These results indicate that the addition of seminal plasma can influence the fertility of ewes or the fertilising capacity of extended ram semen to some extent.",

    "abstract": "Because of the rapid development and spread of antimicrobial resistance it is important that a system be established to monitor antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic zoonotic and commensal bacteria of animal origin. Susceptibility testing of bacteria from carcasses and different samples of animal origin has been carried out in veterinary institutes for a long time but by an inconsistent methodology. The disc diffusion method proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was introduced in all institutes in 1997. In order to obtain a coherent view of the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria a computer system was consulted, consisting of a central computer to store all data and some local computers attached to it through the network. At these local measuring stations computers are connected to a video camera, which displays the picture of Petri dishes on the monitor, and inhibition zone diameters of bacteria can be drawn with the mouse by the inspector. The software measures the diameters, evaluates whether or not the bacteria are sensitive, and stores the data. The evaluation is based upon the data of the NCCLS. The central computer can be connected to as many local computers with measuring stations as we wish, so it is suitable for an integrated system for monitoring trends in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria from animals, food and humans, facilitating comparison of the occurrence of resistance for each circumstance in the chain. It depends on the examiners which antibiotics they want to examine. Thirty-two different antibiotic panels were compiled, taking into consideration the active ingredients of medicinal products permitted for veterinary use in Hungary, natural resistance and cross-resistance, the mechanism of resistance and the animal species, i.e. which drugs were recommended for treatment in the given animal species, and the recommendations of the OIE Expert Group on Antimicrobial Resistance. The members of the panels can be changed any time, even during the measuring process. In addition to the inhibition zone diameters of bacteria the database also includes information about bacterial and animal species, the age of animals and the sample or organ where the bacteria are from. Since January 2001 the antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter and Enterococcus strains isolated from the colons of slaughter cows, pigs and broiler chickens has also been examined. Each of the 19 counties of Hungary submits to the laboratory three tied colon samples from a herd of the above-mentioned animals every month.",

Follicular development was induced by injections of 1000 IU PMSG followed by 500 IU hCG 72 h later. Cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were recovered from preovulatory follicles of the left ovary, and follicular fluid (FF) from the right ovary always 34 h after hCG by endoscopy. Altogether, 19 gilts were used in the prepuberal (P) and cycling (C) trials and 12 of them in the primiparous trial (S). Altogether 168, 190 and 82 follicles were aspirated from the left ovary and 106, 125 and 42 COCs recovered (recovery rate 60.5 +/- 26.9, 62.7 +/- 20.9 and 52.9 +/- 21.8%). The average number of follicles was higher in C compared to P (19.7 +/- 6.8 vs. 15.7 +/- 6.8, p = 0.06) and to S (14.2 +/- 4.0, p < 0.05), respectively. More uniform expanded COCs were aspirated from prepuberal and cycling gilts as compared to sows (89.7 and 78.4% vs. 46.3%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the meiotic configuration in oocytes differed (p < 0.05) between these groups (55.5 and 61.7% vs. 0% Telo 1/Meta 2). Concentrations of progesterone in FF decreased (p < 0.05) from 590.0 +/- 333.6 (P) to 249.1 +/- 72.6 (C) and 161.4 +/- 75.2 ng/ml (S). FF concentrations of oestradiol-17 beta were different between gilts and sows (9.3 +/- 2.9, 21.9 +/- 10.6 and 94.0 +/- 15.9 pg/ml, p < 0.05). The progesterone/oestradiol ratio was 72.1, 15.2 and 4.7. Results indicate a different follicular and oocyte development during the investigated lifetime periods. Cycling gilts should preferably be used in IVF and breeding programs. The lower reproductive potential of primiparous sows is taken into consideration at breeding. Prediction of lifetime performance based on individual ovarian reaction of prepuberal gilts is unsuitable.",

Autoradiography of Western ligand blots indicated different IGF binding protein (IGFBP) profiles between sera from different categories of cattle. Each IGF radioimmunoassay was validated by determining the effects of IGFBPs, ligand and contraligand, as well as serial dilution and comparison with results obtained after molecular sieve chromatography in acid. In female cattle mean values for IGF-I varied from 5.1 nmol/l in postparturient Holstein cows to 18.5–20.5 nmol/l in growing beef heifers, while mean IGF-II concentrations ranged from 30.0 nmol/l in the cows to 14.7–15.7 nmol/l in the beef heifer calves. In male cattle mean serum IGF-I ranged widely from 8.2 nmol/l in 1-day-old Holstein calves to 67.4 nmol/l in 16-month-old Simmental-type bulls. Mean IGF-II concentrations decreased from 22.9 nmol/l in 1-day-old Holstein bull calves to 11.9 nmol/l in 12-month-old beef bulls. Thus, total molar IGF concentrations were fairly stable in female cattle (24.7–35.1 nmol/l) but extended from 27.3 nmol/l to 81.8 nmol/l in the male cattle. The tendency for a reciprocal relationship between serum concentrations of these growth factors was most obvious in the periparturient cows.",

The most severe lesions developed in the carpal joints. All animals died after 3-8 days of disease. Four dead kids were necropsied. All of them had serofibrinous and purulent polyarthritis, and in two animals bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleuritis and meningitis were also found. In the articular exudates the presence of mycoplasmas was detected by PCR using a general mycoplasma primer. Mycoplasmas were cultured from the joints of all animals, from the abdominal parenchymal organs of two kids and from the lungs of one animal. The cultured mycoplasmas grew in strikingly large colonies, proved to be glucose positive, arginine negative and phosphatase positive, and liquefied the coagulated serum. They survived incubation at 45 degrees C for more than 24 h. Based upon their biochemical properties, the results of the immunofluorescence (IF) and growth inhibition tests and the sequence analysis of the PCR product, the cultured strains were identified as M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC. Animals purchased in the previous autumn had been introduced to both farms. The disease may have been introduced with asymptomatic carrier animals, as earlier no similar disease had been observed at either farm.",

    "abstract": "A Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccine (Respisure, Pfizer AH) was tested for its effects on antibody formation, daily weight gain (DWG) in different growing periods, lung lesions and quality of meat (chemical composition, physicochemical properties and fatty acid composition). Two groups of conventional piglets were used for the investigation. One group of 11 females and 11 males was vaccinated intramuscularly at the age of 1 and 3 weeks. The other group of 22 piglets was left nonvaccinated as control. The results showed that antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae in the vaccinated group had been formed 14 days after the second vaccination and remained present till the end of the study at 147 days of age. In the nonvaccinated group, seroconversion started at 49 days of age and by the end of the study 10 out of 22 pigs had become seropositive.Vaccinated pigs achieved significantly higher daily weight gain (+30 g) and finishing body weight (+6.04 kg) than the nonvaccinated animals. In addition, the vaccinated pigs showed lesions involving 3.27% of the lung surface in average, while in the nonvaccinated pigs 9.04% of the lung surface was affected. Investigation of meat quality showed that the longissimus dorsi muscle of vaccinated pigs contained significantly lower percentage of fat (-0.63%) and its tryptophan/hydroxyproline ratio was significantly lower (-23.57) in comparison with the control animals. In addition, some other parameters also showed a favourable tendency, e.g. lean meat percentage was 0.91% higher, the protein content of the longissimus dorsi muscle was 0.35% higher, its water-binding capacity was also higher by 0.78%, its monounsaturated fatty acid concentration was 2.97% lower, while its polyunsaturated fatty acid content was 1.65% higher in the vaccinated pigs than in the nonvaccinated animals.",

While extracts of strain B58 proved toxic in intravenously inoculated mice, similar extracts from strain B58GP had lost toxic activity. The parent (B58) and the mutant (B58GP) strains of B. bronchiseptica each possessed comparable virulence for mice. These findings confirmed that DNT production was successfully abolished in strain B58GP while other virulence characteristics required for pathogenicity in mice remained intact, at a comparable level to the parent strain. Turbinate atrophy was observed in mice infected with the DNT+ strain, but not in those infected with the DNT-strain. This indicates that DNT is the cause of turbinate atrophy in the mice and not other factors produced by phase I strains of B. bronchiseptica. B. bronchiseptica DNT showed a lienotoxic effect (lymphocyte depletion and a reduction in the intensity of extramedullar haemocytopoieis) that is considered to adversely alter the immune function of the host animal. In mice infected with strain B58GP, catarrhal pneumonia with characteristic lympho-histiocytic peribronchial and perivascular infiltration was noticed. In mice infected with strain B58, large necrotic areas were seen surrounded by an inflammatory reaction. The DNT appears to directly damage lung tissues, at least in mice. DNT production seems to enhance the establishment of B. bronchiseptica in the lungs, presumably by reducing the local resistance and causing severe local damage to the lung tissues.",

The samples were extracted with a mixture of acetonitrile and water (84 + 16). Part of the extract was evaporated and purified on Florisil and activated charcoal columns. HPLC separation was performed on a C18 column, using acetonitrile-water (8 + 92) as eluent. Diode array detection (DAD) was performed at 218 and 236 nm, by determination of the UV spectrum. Quantitative analysis was carried out by the external standard method, using the UV spectrum obtained by DAD for confirmation. The recovery rate of DON was 75 +/- 3.1% and the detection limit was 0.05 mg/kg DON. Using this method, the DON content of 99 feeding wheat samples grown in the northeastern part of Hungary in 1998 was determined. Eighty-eight percent of the samples originating from three counties contained 0.94 mg/kg DON on the average. The highest individual value was 4.3 mg/kg. DON contamination of wheat was of higher prevalence (100%) and severity (0.27-4.3 mg/kg) in the southeastern county of Békés than in Szabolcs county located in the northeastern part of Hungary (ratio of positive samples: 82%; DON concentration: 0.05-1.3 mg/kg). The higher than usual DON contamination of feeding wheat can be explained by the rainy summer weather. DON contamination of feeding wheat poses a major risk to the production and animal health status of pig herds.",

The experiment was carried out in a herd comprising 1000 sows which was free of PRRS, Aujeszky's disease, swine dysentery and leptospirosis, and the prevalence of mycoplasmal pneumonia was low because the farm had recently been restocked. Groups C1 and C2 served as untreated controls, while Groups R1 and R2 received a prestarter diet containing 100 ppm Tiamutin from the time of weaning. Piglets of Group R1 were vaccinated with Respisure vaccine once on day 69, while those of Group R2 twice, on days 65 and 80. Piglets of Groups ST1 and ST2 were fed 100 ppm Tiamutin in the diet for 7 days at the time of weaning and then at 4 months of age, while pigs of Group ST2 received such treatment also in the 6th month of life. The efficacy of treatment was analysed on the basis of the number of animals that died, were emergency slaughtered or were retarded in growth in the different groups, the body weight of animals at weaning, at 94 and 148 days of age and at the time of slaughter, their daily body weight gain, the lung lesions found in animals slaughtered from the different groups, the costs of medication and vaccination, and the cost-benefit calculations of the results. The mortality and emergency slaughter rate was 2.88% and 4.62% in Groups ST2 and ST1, respectively, 4.23% and 4.62% in Groups R2 and R1, respectively, and 8.39% and 9.44% in the control groups (C2 and C1, respectively).

Two selective plating media proved to be the best for the isolation of R. equi from contaminated samples.

These two media allowed the growth of at least 62-72% of R. equi present in the artificially contaminated samples, and the inhibition of unwanted contaminant bacteria and fungi was satisfactory with both media. TCP medium proved to be superior to CAZ-NB since the colony morphology of R. equi was much more characteristic (shiny, smooth, black colonies 3-5 mm in diameter) on it, and it inhibited the unwanted contaminant bacterial and fungal flora more effectively, especially in the case of faecal and soil samples. Therefore, TCP is recommended as a new, highly selective plating medium for the isolation of R. equi from contaminated samples.",

The lean meat percentage, the muscle/fat tissue ratio within the total body and separately within the bacon part were estimated by image analysis. The lean meat content of the total body was determined by the EU reference method. A correlation of r = 0.97 was found between lean meat content of the total body determined by CT estimation and the slaughtering results. The pigs were divided into seven groups on the basis of their lean meat content. The muscle percentage of the bacon part was 26% and 67%, respectively, in the two groups representing the two extremes of lean meat percentage (36% and 67%, respectively). The total volume of the bacon part was relatively constant (8.6 +/- 1 dm3) in the groups representing different lean meat categories.

To describe changes in the tissue composition of the bacon part during fattening, 10 castrates were scanned repeatedly at 70, 90 and 110 kg of liveweight. A linear regression model was developed to characterise the continuous decrease observed in the muscle/fat ratio within the bacon part due to increasing liveweight.",

The present study examines the possibility of using high hydrostatic pressure to reduce substantially the freezing point of the embryo-holding solution, in order to preserve embryos at subzero temperatures, thus avoiding all the disadvantages of freezing. The pressure of 210 MPa lowers the phase transition temperature of water to -21°C. According to the results of this study, embryos can survive in high hydrostatic pressure environment at room temperature; the time embryos spend under pressure without significant loss in their survival could be lengthened by gradual decompression. Pressurisation at 0°C significantly reduced the survival capacity of the embryos; gradual decompression had no beneficial effect on survival at that stage. Based on the findings, the use of the phenomena is not applicable in this form, since pressure and low temperature together proved to be lethal to the embryos in these experiments. The application of hydrostatic pressure in embryo cryopreservation requires more detailed research, although the experience gained in this study can be applied usefully in different circumstances.",

During that period the number of clinical cases showed fluctuation with intervals of 4-5 years and monophasic seasonality (peaking in June). In order to assess the current status of bovine babesiosis in that region, blood samples were collected from 654 cattle on 44 farms of 36 settlements in or near the endemic area during 2005, and serum levels of IgG antibodies to B. divergens were measured by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Only 2 samples (0.3%) showed positivity. In one village clinical babesiosis was observed over the past few years. Animals brought into the endemic area during the spring developed haemoglobinuria in the summer of the same year, but those introduced during the summer or autumn showed clinical signs only after two years. Sampled animals born and raised locally had neither haemoglobinuria nor seroconversion. Reduction in the number of cases during the past decades may have been influenced by the availability of hosts (i.e. decrease of cattle breeding) and the activity of vectors associated with climate-related changes (e.g. increase of annual sunlight hours in the endemic area). This is the first report on the prevalence of antibodies to B. divergens in cattle in Hungary.",

In this study, we selected I. michaelbakeri (Chung Hsing strain) as a pathogen to orally inoculate russet sparrows (Passer rutilans), spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata), canary (Serinus canaria), Java sparrows (Padda oryzivora), chicken (Gallus domesticus), ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and BALB/c mice. The results indicated that I. michaelbakeri infected only russet sparrows. Infected sparrows displayed lethargy, muscular weakness and fluffy feathers, followed by rapid death. Liver and spleen enlargement was seen in the infected birds. Schizonts were identified in thin smears from the venous blood, enlarged livers and spleens. Histopathological examination revealed schizonts and merozoites from the liver and spleen of infected russet sparrows, but not from other species experimentally inoculated with I. michaelbakeri in the present study.",

Currently, a commercial ELISA and a colorimetric assay are the methods of choice for measuring CRP and Hp, respectively; however, these assays showed interference when using haemolysed, lipaemic or hyperbilirubinaemic samples. Recently, time-resolved immunofluorometric assays (TR-IFMAs) have been developed for measuring canine CRP and Hp. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of increasing concentrations of haemoglobin, lipids and bilirubin in CRP and Hp serum measurements using these new fluoroimmunoassays. Haemolysis was produced by freezing blood cells at -20 degrees C. The haemolysate was added to pooled sera at final concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 g/L. A commercial emulsion of triglycerides was added to homologous pooled sera at 0, 0.35, 0.7, 1.4, 2.8, 5.6 and 11.2 mmol/L. Bilirubin, initially dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide, was added to pooled sera at 0, 64.2, 128.4, 256.8, 513.7 and 1027.4 micromol/L. Addition of fresh haemolysate, triglycerides or bilirubin to serum samples did not affect either CRP or Hp concentrations (P > or = 0.18), so the TR-IFMAs could be an alternative to the traditional tests for measuring canine CRP and Hp in those laboratories where immunofluorometric assays are available.",

    "abstract": "In rotaviruses, intragenic recombination or gene rearrangement occurs almost exclusively in the genome segments encoding for non-structural proteins. Rearranged RNA originates by mechanisms of partial sequence duplications and deletions or insertions of non-templated nucleotides. Of interest, epidemiological investigations have pointed out an unusual bias to rearrangements in genome segment 11, notably in rotavirus strains of lapine origin, as evidenced by the detection of numerous lapine strains with super-short genomic electropherotype. The sequence of the full-length genome segment 11 of two lapine strains with super-short electropherotype, LRV-4 and 3489/3, was determined and compared with rearranged and normal cognate genome segments of lapine rotaviruses. The rearranged genome segments contained head-to-tail partial duplications at the 3' end of the main ORF encoding NSP5. Unlike the strains Alabama and B4106, intermingled stretches of non-templated sequences were not present in the accessory RNA of LRV-4 and 3489/3, while multiple deletions were mapped, suggesting the lack of functional constraints. Altogether, these findings suggest that independent rearrangement events have given origin to the various lapine strains that have super-short genome pattern.",

    "abstract": "The breeding of Mangalica, a native pig breed in Hungary, had been started in 1833, but this pig breed almost became extinct in Hungary in the past decades. In 1991, the number of sows was only 200. Although in these days the existing Mangalica population consists of more than 6000 animals representing different colour variations, the preservation of this traditional pig breed is still very important. Vitrification is a potential tool for the preservation of gametes and embryos of these animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitrification on the developmental competence of Mangalica (M) and Large White (LW) oocytes following fertilisation. The oocytes were vitrified by the Open Pulled Straw (OPS) method using different concentrations of ethylene glycol and dimethyl sulphoxide as cryoprotectants. After rehydration the oocytes underwent in vitro fertilisation; the resultant zygotes were then cultured in vitro for four days to assess embryonic development. In the first experiment, in vitro maturation of M and LW oocytes was compared. No significant difference was observed in the nuclear maturation rate of LW and M oocytes. In the second experiment, the sensitivity of oocytes to vitrification was examined by evaluating oocyte morphology after thawing. A higher percentage of LW oocytes showed normal morphology compared to M oocytes, indicating that Mangalica oocytes are more sensitive to cryoprotectants than Large White oocytes. After warming and in vitro fertilisation, more than 50% of the oocytes started embryonic development and by the end of the incubation period morula stage embryos had developed in both groups. The results show that the OPS vitrification technique is well suited to preserve Mangalica oocytes and from these oocytes morula embryos can be produced.",

Another aim was to compare the virulence of two H. somni strains by collecting clinical and postmortem data of experimentally infected and control animals. Seventeen conventionally reared 3-month-old calves were divided into three groups. Two groups of six animals each were exposed to suspensions containing H. somni on three consecutive days using a vaporiser mask. The third group of five animals was used as control. The data of individual clinical examination were recorded daily. All animals were exterminated, and gross pathology of all lungs was evaluated on the 15th day after the first infection. Both H. somni strains caused an increase of rectal temperature, respiratory signs, decrease of weight gain, and severe catarrhal bronchopneumonia in both infected groups. Although some chronic lesions were detected in the lungs of the control animals as well, the histopathological findings in the infected and control groups were different. H. somni was recultured from all lungs in the challenged groups but it could not be reisolated or detected by PCR examination in the control group. This is the first paper on aerosol challenge of calves with H. somni using repeated infection and verified by detailed pathological, bacteriological and histopathological examination. The infection method proved to be successful. There was no difference in the virulence of the two H. somni strains used in the trial.",

Samples from the cardiac muscle of internal control broiler chickens (ICs) (n = 36) and chickens having died of SDS (n = 36) were obtained during the rearing period. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and the concentration of lactate were measured in the cardiac tissue using available commercial kits. The expression of hypoxia-inducing factor 1α (HIF1α), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDHK4) and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) genes was determined in the myocardium by real-time PCR analysis. The results showed the elevation of lactate level and activities of LDH and CPK in the cardiac muscle of SDS-affected chickens compared with the IC birds (P < 0.05). The cardiac muscle expression of HIF1α, MCT4 and GLUT1 genes was increased, while the PDHK4 mRNA level was decreased in the SDS-affected group compared to those in the IC chickens (P < 0.05). Our results showed that metabolic remodelling associated with hypoxia in the cardiac tissues may have an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac insufficiency and SDS in broiler chickens.",

All the groups were frozen and thawed in a water bath for spermatological evaluation. The lowest motility was observed in the control group (47.60 ± 5.70%) (P < 0.05), while the highest viability (62.45 ± 1.68%), plasma membrane and acrosome integrity (44.81 ± 4.57%), and high mitochondrial membrane potential (35.96 ± 2.50%) were observed in the low GA group (P < 0.05). Also, the lowest hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOS +) value was found in the high GA group (47.60 ± 4.82%) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementing a low concentration (1 mM) of GA to the Tris-based semen extender had a positive effect on spermatological parameters after freeze-thawing of Honamli goat semen.

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of these strains revealed that they shared molecular features with the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strains, which emerged globally during 2009. The PB2, HA and NA genes contained unique amino acid changes compared to the available new H1N1 influenza virus sequences of pig origin. Furthermore, the investigated strains could be separated with respect to parallel amino acid substitutions affecting the polymerase genes (PB2, PB1 and PA) and the nucleoprotein (NP) gene, supporting the proposed complementarities between these proteins, all required for the viral fitness. Molecular characterisation of two Hungarian human pandemic H1N1 isolates was also performed, so that we could compare contemporaneous strains of different host species origins. Shared molecular motifs in various genes of animal and human influenza strains suggested that the Hungarian porcine strains could have originated from humans through direct interspecies transmission. This study is among the few that support the natural human-to-pig transmission of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus.",

Jejunal and ileal MLNs of slaughtered goats infected with L. serrata were collected and fixed in 10% neutral formal saline. Histopathological changes included follicular necrosis accompanied by a loss of lymphocytes and oedematous cystlike spaces. Granulomatous lesions were formed by mononuclear cell infiltration and necrotic tissue. Some lymphocytes were apoptotic with chromatolysis. A more frequent vascular abnormality was vasculitis. These findings show that larval migration is the main factor to initiate trauma and cause irritation in the MLNs of goats.

To minimise stress through anaesthesia in live animals, preliminary examinations were carried out on four dog cadavers.

Therefore, only 3D sequences were applied for the main examinations performed on six clinically healthy Beagles. The anonymised MR images were rated by three experienced reviewers using a five-point scale. The most valuable sequence was a T2-weighted CISS sequence (TR = 16.7 ms, TE = 8.08 ms). This sequence proved to be most suitable for illustrating the inner ear structures and enabled good tissue contrasts. The sequence ranked second best was also a T2-weighted DESS sequence (TR = 19 ms, TE = 6 ms), allowing the imaging of the tympanic cavity and enabling 3D reconstruction due to its isotropic voxels. Due to low contrast and strong noise, the other sequences (TSE, FISP, MP RAGE) were not suitable for anatomical illustration of the middle and inner ear.",

    "abstract": "Anaplasma phagocytophilum strains from different geographical regions are characterised by diverse potential infectivity for humans and domesticated animals. We investigated the potential pathogenicity of A. phagocytophilum strains in Ixodes ricinus ticks from 11 geographically different localities in Serbia. Sequences obtained in this study showed a high variability of p44 paralogues. Some of them, however, formed groups with similarities greater than 86% (‘similarity groups’). Previous studies showed that ‘similarity groups’ were nearly always country specific. Our results correlated with this observation, and we also observed significant clustering of paralogues according to vector and reservoir origin of A. phagocytophilum strains. According to the high genetic similarity of sequences isolated from ticks collected in four localities, namely Avala, Batrovci, Hajdučka česma and Ljubovija, with paralogues with proven pathogenicity isolated from human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) patients and A. phagocytophilum infected sheep, we could assume that strains with potential infectivity for humans and domestic animals were present in Serbia.",

    "abstract": "Despite numerous studies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its importance during hydrocephalus or myelography, no reliable values exist about its overall volume in dogs. In this study, our aim was to measure the intracranial (IC) volume of CSF in dogs and assess its possible relationship with body size and the symmetry of the lateral ventricles. We ran a 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence on the central nervous system of 12 healthy, male mongrel dogs between 3-5 years of age and 7.5-35.0 kg body weight. A validated semiautomatic segmentation protocol was implemented to segment the CSF and measure its volume. Values for the volume of the ventricular compartment were between 0.97 and 2.94 ml, with 62.1 ± 11.7% in the lateral ventricles, 17.6 ± 4.9% in the third ventricle, 4.9 ± 1.6% in the aqueductus mesencephali and 15.5 ± 6.6% in the fourth ventricle. In 11 cases a significant asymmetry was found between the lateral ventricles. The results suggest that it may be normal for a dog to have one of the lateral ventricles 1.5 times larger than the other. The correlation between body weight and CSF volume was linear, indicating that the current dosage protocols for myelography, based on a hypothetical proportional relationship with body weight, may have to be revised.",

Here, we first cloned the fulllength cDNAs of the NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 genes of Hainan black goat and produced their polyclonal antibodies. Tissue-specific expression and histological distribution of these genes were analysed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these three goat genes had high homology with Bos taurus genes and low homology with avian or fish genes. After immunisations with these recombinant Histagged proteins, the titres of antiserum were higher than 1:1024 and purified IgG was obtained. These three genes were expressed in all examined tissues, the mRNA expression level of NLRP3 and caspase-1 was most abundant in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), while ASC was primary expressed in the liver, spleen and kidney. The histological distribution of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 was detected in myocardial cells, hepatocytes, focal lymphocytes, bronchiolar epithelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, cortical neurons and endothelial cells of the germinal centres in the MLNs. These results will be helpful in further investigations into the function of the NLRP3 inflammasome and in elucidating its role in caprine inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) is a viral disease appearing in various forms and causing high economic losses in the cattle stocks of Hungary. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in Hungary through a monitoring survey carried out on samples collected in cattle-keeping units throughout the country. Since no such survey had been carried out in Hungary during the last thirty years, our study may serve as a basis for later monitoring investigations aimed at following the progress of an expected eradication campaign of BVD. The tests were carried out using an ELISA method, on a total of 1200 blood samples submitted from 54 cattle herds. The herds had not been vaccinated against BVDV before the sampling. Out of the 1200 samples, 521 proved to be positive (43.4%), 40 gave doubtful result (3.3%) and 639 were negative (53.3%). In some stocks the samples were collected from cows having completed several lactation periods, and therefore the seronegativity indicates the BVDV-free status of the given stock. Moreover, among the positive herds we found a few where the seropositivity rate was rather low (< 5%). According to the results of the survey, a rather high portion (about one third) of the cattle-keeping units of Hungary can be regarded as BVDV free, which ratio is much higher than had been expected on the basis of surveys carried out on a lower number of samples and in smaller regions of the country. Hence, the chances of an eradication campaign launched in the near future, or carried out parallel to the IBR eradication programme, are better than previously expected.",

The objective of this study was to eliminate PRRS from a farrow-to-finish pig farm by serum inoculation. The owner was acquainted with the strict biosecurity measures. Breeding pigs were immunised with serum, which was obtained from PRRSV-positive weaners from the same farm. The percent of antibody high positive breeding pigs decreased six months after serum inoculation, while 34 months after serum inoculation no more antibody high positive pigs were detected and 56.8% of breeding pigs and all other categories were free of antibodies. In the breeding herd no virus was detected during all testing while PRRSV circulated in 2-month-old weaners until 12 months after serum inoculation. Later all tested samples from weaners, growers and fatteners were negative. Herd closure and the adoption of strict biosecurity measures are essential. Serum inoculation of the breeding herd proved to be a successful measure for eliminating PRRS from this farrow-to-finish farm.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence of MVI in clinically healthy Beagle populations. A total of 79 adult healthy Beagles (41 females and 38 males; age: 5.6 ± 2.7 years, range 1.4 to 11.7 years) were examined. The diagnosis of MVI was based on the detection of a systolic murmur heard above the mitral valve, and was confirmed by colour flow Doppler (CFD) echocardiography. Systolic mitral valve murmurs were detected in 20/79 dogs (25.3%), of them 11 males and 9 females with no statistically significant gender difference (P = 0.6059). The strength of the murmur on the semi-quantitative 0/6 scale yielded intensity grade 1/6 in 10 dogs, grade 2/6 in 4 dogs, and grade 3/6 in 6 dogs. Mild to moderate MVI was detected by CFD in all these 20 dogs with systolic murmurs. Of them, 17 dogs had mild and 3 demonstrated moderate MVI, showing 10-30% and 30-50% regurgitant jets compared to the size of the left atrium, respectively. The age of dogs with MVI was 7.1 ± 2.3 years, which was significantly different from that of dogs without MVI (5.1 ± 2.7 years, P = 0.0029). No significant differences in body weight (P = 0.1724) were found between dogs with MVI (13.8 ± 2.8 kg) and those without MVI (12.8 ± 3.0 kg). Mitral valve disease causing MVI is relatively common in Beagle dogs, just like in other small breed dogs reported in the literature.",

Routine diagnostics is often complemented with immunohistochemical analysis. This study was conducted on 110 patient records from all veterinary faculties in Poland from dogs diagnosed with heart tumours between 1970 and 2014. The dogs' age, breed and sex with tumour localisation and histopathological diagnosis were analysed. Because of its most common incidence, samples of haemangiosarcoma underwent further examination with assessment of the expression of cell markers that have not been evaluated earlier (i.e. minichromosome maintenance proteins and beta-catenin). We noted 111 tumours including 88.3% malignant and 10.8% benign ones. Haemangiosarcoma and aortic body tumour were the most frequent cardiac neoplasms in the dogs examined (45.9% and 27.9% of all tumours, respectively). Immunohistochemical analysis of haemangiosarcoma showed a positive expression of all markers examined. CD31, vimentin, and beta-catenin showed a positive reaction in all 11 samples examined. At least one proliferative marker (Ki-67, MCM-3 or MCM-7) showed a positive reaction in each sample. MCM-3 showed a higher expression than the two other proliferative markers (P = 0.006), but only Ki-67 showed a positive correlation with the mitotic index (P > 0.05, r = 0.89). Although beta-catenin, MCM-3 and MCM-7 showed a positive reaction in the haemangiosarcomas examined, their usefulness as diagnostic and prognostic factors should be a topic of further research.",

However, no studies have investigated whether the immune system gene expression differs between owned dogs kept in better care conditions and stray dogs living outside. To investigate this, blood samples were taken from 90 dogs (45 owned and 45 stray dogs) that were checked and confirmed as healthy. By using qPCR, the amples were analyzed for the expression of the perforin, granzyme A and granzyme B genes, which are associated with the activation of apoptotic pathways in the immune system. We found that the perforin and granzyme A gene expression levels were higher in stray dogs although the differences were not statistically significant. On the other hand, a 2.81 times higher and a notable difference ( P &lt; 0.001) was found in the expression level of granzyme B gene in stray dogs. These results indicate that the immune system in stray dogs might be more prepared for diseases than that of the owned dogs and the granzyme B gene plays a more dominant role in the immune response than granzyme A and perforin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This retrospective study was performed on 71 dogs which had been admitted for heartworm screening or with clinical suspicion of heartworm disease. The examination methods included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify Dirofilaria immitis and/or Dirofilaria repens infections and a heartworm antigen (Ag) test (VetScan). By using PCR, 26 dogs were found positive only for Dirofilaria immitis (Group 1), while 21 dogs for both D. immitis and D. repens (Group 2). Group 3 included 24 dogs with D. repens infection only according to the PCR results. The sensitivity of the VetScan Ag test for the Group 1 and 2 animals proved to be 97.7% (95% Blaker confidence interval; CI 89.0%–99.9%). The specificity of the VetScan Ag test, calculated from the results of Group 3, was found to be 66.7% (95% CI 45.6%–83.1%), which was lower than that reported from the USA, where D. repens does not occur. In cases when PCR results were positive for D. repens but negative for D. immitis , the occult dirofilariosis was the likely explanation for the positive D. immitis Ag tests. These observations highlight the importance of performing more Ag tests simultaneously in those areas where both Dirofilaria species are present.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Anaplasma phagocytophilum is the causative agent of granulocytic anaplasmosis in humans, dogs, cats, horses and tick-borne fever in ruminants. In Europe, its main vector is the tick species Ixodes ricinus . In this study, spleen and liver samples, as well as ticks from 18 wild-living mammals (belonging to seven species) were analysed for the presence of A. phagocytophilum with molecular methods. The zoonotic ecotype-I of A. phagocytophilum was identified in a European wildcat ( Felis silvestris ) and its tick, a European pine marten ( Martes martes ) and a Eurasian red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ). All PCR-positive samples were collected in 2019 and originated in the same geographic area. These results indicate that taxonomically diverse mammalian species can maintain the local enzootic cycle of the same genotype of A. phagocytophilum . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the zoonotic variant of A. phagocytophilum in the wildcat and in the European pine marten in a broad geographical context, as well as in the red squirrel in Hungary. Since all these host species are well known for their urban and peri-urban presence, the results of this study verify their role in the synanthropic enzootic cycle of granulocytic anaplasmosis and tick-borne fever.",

    "abstract": "Dirofilaria immitis is an endemic mosquito-borne pathogen widely spread throughout Europe as well as North and South America. Infection by D. immitis has been reported in domestic ferrets, although little is known about the occurrence and the epidemiological features of this nematode in this species. The aim of the present retrospective study was to assess the prevalence of D. immitis antibodies using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specifically developed for use in ferrets. One hundred and eighty-six serum samples were obtained from the Province of Valencia (Spain), an area endemic for dirofilariosis. Of the 186 serum samples included in the study, 27 (14.51%) were classified as D. immitis seropositive and 159 samples as D. immitis seronegative. The results provide valuable information on the seroprevalence of D. immitis infection in domestic ferrets in an area endemic for this vector-borne pathogen. The presence of seropositive ferrets should be taken into account and preventive measures should be implemented, including the possibility of serological screening for the early detection of Dirofilaria antibodies as a serological marker of exposure. This is the first study that demonstrates the presence of D. immitis exposure in ferrets in Spain. Veterinarians working in endemic areas should be aware of this infection in ferrets and their susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As a continuation of our previous work, here we examined the occurrence, virulence factors and antibiotic resistance of non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) bacteria in faecal samples of healthy cattle in Tunisia. From 260 faecal samples, 236 E. coli isolates were obtained, of which 30 (12.7%) proved to be non-O157:H7 STEC. The presence of STEC-serogroup virulence genes stx1, stx2 , eaeA and ehxA was detected by PCR. Further virulence genes and other genes used for phylogenetic grouping were also examined among the STEC isolates. The most dominant serogroup was O145, followed by O103 and O45. Shiga toxin gene ( stx1 ) was found in 70% of the STEC strains, stx2 and ehxA were detected in 17 isolates (56.7%). Other virulence genes, including fimH , traT, sfa/focDE , iutA , cdt3 , hly, fyuA and ibeA, were detected in 100%, 60%, 46.7%, 46.7%, 36.7%, 10%, 6.7% and 3.3%, of the strains, respectively. More than 70% of the isolates were susceptible to most of the tested antibiotics. We concluded that the presence of STEC O145, O103 and O45 (12.7%), together with the earlier described STEC O157:H7 (4.2%) in cattle, intended for slaughter, may represent a threat to public health. Efficient control measures are needed in the farms and slaughterhouses in Tunisia.",

Pairs of testes from German Mutton Merino ( n = 7) and Hungarian Black Racka ( n = 7) rams were collected at a slaughterhouse, transported to the laboratory and stored overnight (4−5 °C) before processing. Post mortem ram epididymal spermatozoa (REPS) were obtained from the cauda epididymidis by slice or incision methods. Fresh samples were extended to 200 × 10 6 /mL cell concentration, filled into mini straws and equilibrated at 5 °C for 2 h. Freezing was performed manually in a Styrofoam box. The fresh and post-thaw total motility, progressive motility and kinematic parameters of REPS were assessed using the CASA technique. The collection method did not affect significantly the fresh and post-thaw motility and kinematic parameters. Merino had higher ( P &lt; 0.05) testicular weight. Racka had significantly better fresh and post-thaw linear movement but had statistically the same ( P &gt; 0.05) cryotolerance as Merino. In conclusion, both collection methods were found suitable for REPS retrieval. The REPS from Racka exhibited better linear movement values than those from the Merino breed. The cryotolerance of REPS of both breeds was comparable.",

The virus caused clinically apparent disease in some of the piglets born at term, which indicates that it had crossed the placenta. More than half (57%) of the live-born piglets died within 60 days of birth. The sows and their progeny did not shed the virus.

The present studies were undertaken to examine the effects of FK 33-824 (opioid agonist) alone or in combination with LH, PRL or naloxone (NAL, opioid antagonist) on steroidogenesis in cultured porcine theca cells. Moreover, we have tested β-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (β-END-LI) concentrations in culture media under control conditions and following treatments of theca cells with LH, PRL, progesterone (P 4 ), oestradiol (E 2 ) or testosterone (T). FK 33-824 and NAL significantly increased P 4 release by theca cells and inhibited stimulatory effect of LH on this steroid output. PRL-induced P 4 secretion from the cells was blunted only by FK 33-824. Secretion of androstenedione (A 4 ) and T was essentially elevated in the presence of FK 33-824 and this potentiation of both androgen release was completely abolished by PRL. NAL blocked stimulatory effect of the opioid agonist only in case of T. Secretion of oestradiol and oestrone was completely free from the influence of both the opioid agonist and antagonist. Pig theca cells were able to produce β-END-LI but none of tested hormones (LH, PRL, P 4 , E 2 and T alone or in combination) significantly affected this production.

The Draize eye irritation test receives particular criticism because of the injuries inflicted on the test animals. In recent years various in vitro methods have been developed to replace the heavily criticised Draize rabbit eye test for irritation testing. One of the best-studied alternative methods is the Hen's Egg Test-Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM). In the present studies comparative screening was performed with a set of pesticides to establish parallel data on in vitro (HET-CAM) and in vivo (Draize) results. The tested pesticides included Arelon 500 FW (isoproturon), Banvel 480 (dicamba), Dikamin D (2.4 D), Karathane LC (dinocap), Ronstar (oxadiazon) and Modown 4 F (bifenox). In most cases a good correlation was found between the HET-CAM assessment and results of the Draize rabbit eye test. Although the current form of the HET-CAM test is a valuable prescreen method for predicting the ocular irritation potential of chemicals, and can be used for reducing the number of experimental animals, a number of technical problems must still be addressed before these systems can replace whole animal tests. The HET-CAM test can be a useful component of a battery of tests needed for replacing the Draize rabbit eye test.",

The sonographic changes associated with various inflammatory and neoplastic conditions and mechanical obstruction of the GI system were recorded and discussed. Sonographic alterations of the pancreas and the tissues adjacent to the GI tract were also included in the study. Ultrasonographic alterations of the GI tract were classified into three main categories: thickening of the GI wall, changes in peristalsis and dilation of the lumen. Localised thickening of the GI wall with disruption of its structure was caused by both neoplastic diseases and by inflammatory disorders. However, diffuse thickening with retained wall structure was generally associated with inflammatory diseases. The criteria previously established for the ultrasonographic diagnosis of intestinal obstruction were successfully applied to a large number of GI disorders. Pancreatitis was most often associated with hyperechoic mesentery and hypoechoic pancreas mass, but similar alterations were encountered in some cases of gastric or duodenal ulceration. Except in cases of invaginations and intestinal obstructions, the observed ultrasonographic changes were not specific enough for a definitive diagnosis. Nevertheless, ultrasonography proved to be a valuable technique in the diagnostic process of GI disorders of the dog.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of chicken infectious anaemia virus (CAV) infection was studied in 6-week-old and one-day-old SPF chickens inoculated intramuscularly with graded doses of Cux-1 strain (10 6 −10 2 TCID 50 /chicken). Viraemia, virus shedding, development of virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies and CAV distribution in the thymus were studied by virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunocytochemistry (IP) and in situ hybridization until postinfection day (PID) 28. In 6-week-old chickens infected with high doses of CAV, viraemia and VN antibodies could be detected 4 PID and onward without virus shedding or contact transmission to sentinel birds. However, virus shedding and contact transmission were demonstrated in one-day-old infected chickens. In the 6-weekold groups infected with lower doses, VN antibodies developed by PID 14, transient viraemia and virus shedding were detected. The thymus cortex of all 1-dayold inoculated chickens stained with VP3-specific mAb. Cells with positive in situ hybridization signal were fewer and scattered throughout the thymus tissue of the one-day-old inoculated chickens as compared to IP-positive cells. These results suggest that early immune response induced by high doses of CAV in 6-week-old chickens curtails viral replication and prevents virus shedding.",

In Phase II, the two compounds were administered simultaneously to study the toxic interaction (monensin 10 mg/kg and tiamulin 40 mg/kg b.w., respectively). Monensin proved to be toxic to rats at doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg. Tiamulin was well tolerated up to the dose of 200 mg/kg. After combined administration, signs of toxicity were seen (including lethality in females). Monensin caused a dose-dependent cardiotoxic effect and vacuolar degeneration of the skeletal muscles in the animals given 50 mg/kg. Both compounds exerted a toxic effect on the liver in high doses. After simultaneous administration of the two compounds, there was a mild effect on the liver (females only), hydropic degeneration of the myocardium and vacuolar degeneration of the skeletal muscles. The alteration seen in the skeletal muscles was more marked than that seen after the administration of 50 mg/kg monensin alone.",

The aim of the present study was to examine whether dietary fumonisin B 1 (FB 1 ) has any effect on the humoral and cellular immune response in weaned pigs, depending on the dose and the time of toxin exposure. Fusarium moniliforme fungal culture was added to the experimental animals' diet to ensure an FB 1 intake of 1, 5 and 10 ppm (first experiment) or 100 mg per animal per day (second experiment). The control animals were fed a toxin-free diet. In order to determine the immune response, the animals were vaccinated against Aujeszky's disease with inactivated vaccine (Aujespig K, Phylaxia-Sanofi, Budapest, Hungary). Specific and nonspecific in vitro cellular immune response was measured by the lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) induced by PHA-P, Con A, LPS and inactivated suspension of the Aujeszky's disease virus. Humoral immune response, e.g. specific antibody titre, was measured by the virus neutralisation (VN) test. None of the immunological parameters examined showed significant differences between groups. It could be concluded that fumonisin B 1 had no significant effect on the humoral and cellular specific and nonspecific immune response when fed in a high dose (100 mg/animal/day for 8 days) or in a low concentration even for a longer period (1, 5 and 10 ppm for 3-4 months).",

    "abstract": "The morphology of canine platelets (changes in size, shape, staining characteristics, degree of activation and clump formation, distribution of granules, appearance of vacuoles on Giemsa -stained smears) was investigated in 20 healthy control and 181 diseased dogs. In the group of the sick dogs 84 animals suffered from disorders affecting directly the haematological parameters or the haematopoietic organs such as bleeding, thymic haemorrhage, haemolytic disorders, lymphoma, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and other 97 dogs were affected by other diseases (hepatopathy, nephropathy, hepatic, splenic or intestinal neoplasm, skin diseases, diabetes mellitus, Cushing'ssyndrome, sepsis). The alterations found in platelet morphology were not specific for any disorder. The most common platelet abnormalities were polychromasia and the presence of giant platelets. These changes occurred in a high number in disorders accompanied by bleeding or haemolysis. Anisocytosis was the most frequent finding in hepatic, splenic or intestinal neoplasms and in certain endocrinopathies. Microcytosis was observed in immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, hepatic neoplasms and endocrine disorders. Extreme platelet activation was common in haemolysis, hepatopathies, neoplastic diseases and sepsis. Vacuolisation was present in thymic haemorrhage, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus and Cushing's syndrome. A new morphologic phenomenon, i.e. a ring-like formation of granules, was described in the cytoplasm of the platelets both in healthy and diseased animals. In addition, two forms of pathologic granulation were also described for the first time in Giemsa-stained blood smears: the pseudonuclear and the spot-like formation of granules, which were observed especially in disorders affecting the blood cells. The granulation and morphological characteristics of platelets on smears stained by periodic acid-Schiff reaction (PAS) were also studied. Three localisations of granulation were observed, such as peripheral, eccentric and diffuse. The ratio of PAS-positive and -negative platelets was evaluated in several diseases. Our findings support the diagnostic value of platelet evaluation by light microscopy and help clinicians/clinical pathologists to understand why morphologic changes of thrombocytes might be expected in several diseases.",

In the first part of the study 20 dogs of various breeds were examined. The diameter of the left atrium just above the mitral annulus (LAama) was compared to the linear (left to right) dimension of the left atrium (LAr-l) as published earlier. There was a linear relationship between LAr-l and the body weight (LAr-l = 0.5061 BW (kg) + 22.206; R2 = 0.81), but the proportion of LAr-l/LAama was independent of the body weight (LAr-l/LAama = 0.0004 BW (kg) + 1.0833; R2 = 0.01). In the second part of the study the left atrial diameter just above the mitral annulus (LAama) was measured in 121 dogs of various breeds. There was a positive linear relationship (R2 = 0.697; p < 0.001) between body weight and LAama (LAama = 0.54 BW (kg) + 18.502+/-4.76), but there were no significant correlations between the age of animals and LAama (p = 0.45) as well as between the gender of animals and LAama (p = 0.78). Two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) determination of LAama as described in the present study can be recommended for use in those dogs where measurement of LAr-l encounters technical difficulties. In these cases LAr-l can be calculated from LAama using the formula LAr-l/LAama = 0.0004 BW (kg) + 1.0833, worked out in the first experiment.",

During a systematic health monitoring programme conducted in the period from January 2002 to June 2003, PMWS was suspected on eight different pig-producing farms in Croatia. The diagnosis of PMWS met all three key criteria: the presence of compatible clinical signs, the presence of the characteristic microscopic lymphoid lesions, and the detection of PCV2 within the lesions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by in situ hybridisation (ISH). Moreover, PCV2 DNA from swine tissues was extracted and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis of 4 Croatian PCV2 strains showed close relationship to PCV2 strains isolated in Slovenia, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China and Hungary. PCV2 was also demonstrated by electron microscopy in the lymph node of an affected animal. This is the first demonstration of PMWS in Croatia based on all scientifically accepted diagnostic criteria.",

To this end, 144 ovaries were obtained from mares aged 16-21 months and transported to the laboratory in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS) at 30°C. Oocytes were harvested from the ovaries by slicing, and then selected for in vitro maturation (IVM) according to the number of cumulus cell layers and the characteristics of the cytoplasm. The selected oocytes were washed three times in TCM199 medium plus HEPES (TCM-199H) or in the same medium plus glutamine (TCM-199G), then matured in vitro in six study groups established according to the in vitro maturation (IVM) treatment to see possible interactions between HEPES and glutamine on other supplements: Ten percent EMS was added to two of these media (TCM-199H+EMS and TCM-199G+EMS) and 10% HFF was added to the media in two other groups (TCM-199H+HFF and TCM-199G+HFF). IVM was performed at 38.5°C for 40 h in a controlled atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% relative humidity). The findings indicate that the presence of EMS or HFF in the TCM-199H medium gives rise to the best results in terms of the proportions of oocytes reaching maturity (37.7% and 36.8%, respectively). The values obtained with EMS and HFF were statistically similar to each other but differed from the other treatments. The media containing glutamine led to the highest proportions of degenerated oocytes.",

Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were collected every second day, and the cells were stained with phycoerythrin-labelled CD11b-specific mouse monoclonal antibody and fluorescein-conjugated bovine herpesvirus 4-specific mouse monoclonal antibody. The numbers of double-stained cells from PBLs of the control and inoculated groups were measured and compared in FACSTREK analyser. Double-stained cells were detected in the virus-inoculated group on postinoculation days (PID) 2-5 and 9-12. The results indicated that CD11b+ PBLs were permissive for BoHV-4 infection, and are probably the main reservoir of the virus during the latent period. The data did not indicate production of infectious viral particles, but virus-specific proteins were expressed on the surface of CD11b+ cells. The two waves of double-stained cells gave similar results to the PCR assays from serum samples, which showed the presence of viral DNA in the serum on the same days when virus-infected CD11b cells were also present. Productive BoHV-4 infection of mast cells or undifferentiated leukocytes in the bone marrow and the antiviral immune response might be responsible for this periodic appearance of the virus in CD11b+ PBLs and in the serum. The paper provides evidence that CD11b+ PBLs are the main target cell populations in the blood for BoHV-4.",

We found 26 EHV1- and 4 EAV-positive aborted or prematurely born foals from 16 and 4 outbreaks, respectively, proving that despite the widely applied vaccination, EHV1 is a far more important cause of abortions in the studs than EAV. We compared the virus content of different organs of the fetuses by PCR and isolation to identify the organ most suitable for virus demonstration. Our investigations indicate that the quantity of both viruses is highest in the lungs; therefore, according to our observations, in positive cases the probability of detection is highest from lung samples of aborted or newborn foals. Both the PCR and the virus isolation results revealed that the liver, though widely used, is not the best organ to sample either for EHV1 or for EAV detection. From the analysis of the epidemiological data, we tried to estimate the importance of the two viruses in the Hungarian horse population.",

    "abstract": "Changes in both the morphology and the steroidogenic activity of porcine ovaries denervated surgically on day 12 of the oestrous cycle were studied. Neurectomy of the plexus and the superior ovarian nerves caused a dramatic reduction in the number (or even a disappearance) of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase- and/or neuropeptide tyrosine-immunoreactive nerve terminals. On day 20 of the subsequent oestrous cycle, the number of small follicles increased (P < 0.01) and that of large follicles decreased (P < 0.05) in the denervated ovaries, as compared to the controls. Neurectomy led to a decrease in the level of progesterone (P4; P < 0.001) and androstenedione (A4; P < 0.01) in the fluid from small follicles, A4 (P < 0.001) and testosterone (T; P < 0.05) in the fluid from medium-sized follicles, as well as in the content of all these steroids in the fluid from large-sized follicles (P < 0.001 for P4 and P < 0.05 for A4 and T). Denervation also caused a decrease in the content of A4 (P < 0.01) and T (P < 0.001) in the wall of follicles. Neurectomy resulted in a significant increase in the immunoexpression of cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 in the follicles and a decrease of 33-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. After denervation, plasma levels of LH, P4, A4, T, oestrone and oestradiol-17beta were lower (P < 0.05-0.001) on the particular days of the study than in the control group. Our data revealed that the denervation of ovaries during the middle luteal phase of the oestrous cycle in gilts caused distinct changes in both the morphology and the steroidogenic activity of the organ, confirming an important role of the peripheral nervous system in the control of the gonad in this species.",

    "abstract": "Coagulation and inflammation are closely related as part of the mechanisms of host defence during a severe infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between thrombin as a factor in both the coagulative and inflammatory processes and neutrophil secretory function on the basis of lactoferrin (LF), elastase and myeloperoxidase release in the course of mastitis and metritis in cows. Thrombin generation was measured on the basis of hydrolysis of SAR-PRO-ARG-pNA and lactoferrin concentration was estimated by an ELISA method. The greatest thrombin generation was observed in the metritis group (1.18 +/- 0.62 IU). The level of LF was the highest in the group of cows with mastitis (0.74 +/- 0.55 mg/ml) in the first phase of the disease. In the second phase of the diseases the level of serum LF in cows with mastitis diminished to the value of 0.41 +/- 0.16 mg/ml, whereas in cows with metritis the level of LF increased to 0.51 +/- 0.17 mg/ml. This study reveals that the excessive production of thrombin not only causes hypercoagulatory disorders but also exaggerates neutrophil function by the release of some enzymes which may play a destructive role during disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). These enzymes also inhibit anticoagulative systems, thus potentially worsening the course of the disease.",

The metagenomic analysis conducted on our samples has revealed the significant predominance of aphid lethal paralysis virus (ALPV) and Big Sioux River virus (BSRV) in Hungary for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis was used to clarify the relationship to previously identified ALPV strains infecting honey bees, showing that our strain possesses a close genetic relationship with the strains that have already been described as pathogenic to honey bees. Furthermore, studies have previously confirmed the ability of these viruses to replicate in adult honey bees; however, no signs related to these viruses have been revealed yet.

    "abstract": "Anatipestifer disease is a contagious disease caused by Riemerella anatipestifer , affecting primarily ducks, geese and turkeys, and characterised by listlessness, diarrhoea, sneezing, nasal discharge, and nervous signs. Sporadically, it occurs in a wide range of other domesticated and wild birds as well. The incidence and characteristics of the disease seen in the three main host species are summarised based on birds submitted for routine laboratory investigation in Hungary over the period 2010–2014. The infection was diagnosed in a higher percentage in geese (9.9%) and ducks (7.5%). It occurred in 5-day-old to 17-week-old geese and 3- to 6.5-week-old ducks, respectively. The pathological lesions were comparable in these two species: enlarged spleen, serofibrinous pericarditis, perihepatitis, airsacculitis, catarrhal enteritis, subcutaneous oedema and hyperaemia over the cranium, mucopurulent exudate in the nasal cavity and occasionally pneumonia, conjunctivitis, purulent arthritis and caseous salpingitis. In some cases, R. anatipestifer produced only secondary lesions, which complicated other diseases such as circovirus infection, mycotoxicosis, mycoplasmosis, or Derzsy’s disease. In turkeys, the disease occurred rarely (0.5%) and at an older age (12 to 19 weeks). The lesions most frequently seen were purulent osteomyelitis of the cranium and seropurulent meningitis. Purulent osteomyelitis in the cranium caused by R. anatipestifer infection had not been reported in turkeys previously. To various extents, other local lesions such as serofibrinous pericarditis, airsacculitis, arthritis, and in one case septicaemia were also observed. The high incidence of the disease in waterfowl underlines the importance of appropriate treatment and prevention that should be based on accurate diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, proper biosecurity and vaccination with regard to the serotype(s) present on the farm.",

Calvings occurred between 2013 and 2015 in three periods from June to November each year (n = 314). Data were collected from the farm record and ultrasonographic examinations were performed between 22 to 28 and 43 to 49 days in milk (DIM), respectively. The animals were followed until successful artificial insemination (AI), i.e. until becoming pregnant or until culling, but at most at 365 DIM. The prevalence of dystocia, twin calving, stillbirth rate and retained fetal membranes (RFM) was 23.2%, 3.8%, 3.5%, and 34.4%, respectively. Altogether 38.9% of the cows (n = 122) had bacterial complications of involution in the first 49 DIM. The prevalence of Grade 2 clinical (puerperal) metritis (CM) was 20.1% within 5 DIM, 10.5% between 6 to 10 DIM and 13.1% from 11 to 20 DIM, while 9.9% of the cows had clinical endometritis (CEM) between 21 and 28 DIM and 1.3% of the cows between 42 and 49 DIM, respectively. Pyometra was diagnosed in 1% of the cows between 21 and 28 DIM and 0.3% between 42 to 49 DIM, respectively. About 80% (80.6%) of the cows were inseminated at least once (n = 253). The success rate of the first AI was 26.9% (n = 68). Dystocia, twin calving, RFM, CM, CEM and cyclicity had no significant effect on the days between calving and first AI, however, according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis stillbirth significantly increased the number of days from calving to first AI (P = 0.039). According to the Kaplan- Meier analysis dystocia, twin calving, stillbirth, RFM, and cyclicity had no effect on the days open. In cows with CM developed within 5 DIM or with CEM diagnosed between 21 and 28 DIM the number of days open significantly decreased (P = 0.009 and P = 0.007, respectively), which confirms the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of uterine diseases. Similar surveys should be conducted to discover the risk factors for reproductive diseases in order to decrease the reproductive losses in dairy farms.",

The prion-like protein gene (PRND) is closely located downstream of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and the prion-like protein (Doppel) is a homologue with PrP. Previous studies have shown that an association between prion diseases and polymorphisms of the PRND gene is reported in the main hosts of prion diseases. Hence, we examined the genetic variations of the PRND gene in Thoroughbred horses. Interestingly, polymorphisms of the PRND gene were not detected. In addition, we conducted a comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of the PRND gene to identify the differences between horses and other species. The amino acid sequence of the horse PRND gene showed the highest identity to that of sheep (83.7%), followed by that of goats, cattle and humans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genetic study of the PRND gene in horses.",

All MRSA isolates from goats belonged to one clonal group showing Multi-Locus Sequence type 398. All strains studied (n = 36) were resistant to non-carbapenem beta-lactam antibiotics and susceptible to teicoplanin, linezolid, vancomycin, rifampicin, quinupristin-dalfospristin and mupirocine. In MRSA isolates, the highest percentage of resistance obtained, besides beta-lactam non-carbapenem antibiotics, was to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and, in the case of MRCoNS isolates, to phosphomycin and erythromycin. A total of 12 resistance patterns were obtained, presenting differences between patterns obtained for MRSA and MRCoNS, with 7 different patterns for MRSA and 5 for MRCoNS. We therefore consider it essential to expand the epidemiological study of these strains of animal origin, as well as to increase surveillance and control measures at all stages of the food chain.",

Therefore, in this study DNA extracts of 28 I. kaiseri (collected from dogs and red foxes in Germany, Hungary and Romania) were screened with reverse line blot hybridisation (RLB), PCR and sequencing for the presence of 43 tick-borne pathogens or other members of their families from the categories of Anaplasmataceae, piroplasms, rickettsiae and borreliae. Rickettsia helvetica DNA was detected in one I. kaiseri female (from a red fox, Romania), for the first time in this tick species. Six ticks (from red foxes, Romania) contained the DNA of Babesia vulpes , also for the first time in the case of I. kaiseri . Molecular evidence of R. helvetica and B. vulpes in engorged I. kaiseri does not prove that this tick species is a vector of the above two pathogens, because they might have been taken up by the ticks from the blood of foxes. In addition, one I. kaiseri female (from a dog, Hungary) harboured Babesia sp. badger type-B, identified for the first time in Hungary and Central Europe (i.e. it has been reported previously from Western Europe and China). The latter finding can be explained by either the susceptibility of dogs to Babesia sp. badger type-B, or by transstadial survival of this piroplasm in I. kaiseri .",

The aim of this study was to determine whether RIs of the general canine population may be applied to the Italian Greyhound (Piccoli Levrieri Italiani or PLI), and to generate breed-specific RIs, where appropriate. Sixty-three privately owned clinically healthy fasted dogs were examined. Routine haematology and biochemistry were performed on 58 enrolled patients using the ADVIA 120 haematology analyzer and the Cobas Mira system, respectively. Changes in haematological and biochemical parameters depending on sex, age and attitude (resting vs. running dogs) were investigated. The results of PLI were compared with the RIs of the general canine population. In those cases in which these RIs were not validated, new RIs were generated according to the guidelines of the American Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology. Pre-existing RIs were considered valid based on the recommendations by the Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). RIs were higher for mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), cell haemoglobin concentration mean (CHCM) and lower for large unstained cells (LUC). A wider discrepancy between pre-existing and newly established RIs was found for some ADVIA parameters regarding red blood cell (RBC) or reticulocyte morphology. For total protein and cholesterol the new RIs were wider than the pre-existing ones, while albumin, calcium and iron were higher. This study suggests that most of the RIs published in veterinary textbooks cannot be validated for PLIs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An epizootic caused by a new orthobunyavirus called Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was recognised in European ruminants in 2011 and 2012. The re-emergence of the infection was reported in several countries in the subsequent years. Although the main clinical sign of SBV infection is abortion, the impact of SBV in natural cases of abortion in domestic ruminants had not been systematically examined before this study. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of SBV infection and to compare it to the importance of other causes of abortion by examining 537 natural cases of abortion that had occurred between 2011 and 2017 in Hungary. The cause of abortion was determined in 165 (31%) cases. An infectious cause was proved in 88 (16%) cases. SBV infection was found only in a total of four cases (0.8%) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Three of them proved to be inapparent SBV infection, and one case was attributed to SBV-induced abortion by detecting non-purulent encephalitis and SBV nucleoprotein by immunohistochemistry in a brain tissue sample. According to the results, SBV played a minor role in natural cases of domestic ruminant abortion in Hungary during the 7-year period following the first SBV outbreak in 2011.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, feed naturally containing Fusarium mycotoxins was fed to gilts during the perinatal period, and the effects on the thymus were investigated in one-week-old piglets. Twenty gilts were divided into equal control (0.26 mg deoxynivalenol, DON) and experimental (5.08 mg DON, 0.09 mg zearalenone and 21.61 mg fusaric acid per kg of feed) groups. One suckling piglet from each litter ( n = 20) was sacrificed at one week of age to obtain thymus samples for further analysis. The cortex to medulla ratio of the thymus was morphometrically analysed using NIS Elements BR (Nikon) software. Paraffin-embedded thymus sections were stained to quantify apoptosis (with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling – TUNEL method), cellular proliferation (Ki-67) and macrophages (MAC 387). The results showed that the thymus cortex ( P = 0.023) to medulla ( P = 0.023) ratio was significantly lower in the experimental group. The number of apoptotic cells (cortex, P = 0.010, medulla, P = 0.001) and the number of proliferating cells in the thymus cortex ( P = 0.001) and medulla ( P &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in the experimental group. Our results indicate that feeding Fusarium mycotoxins to a parent animal during the perinatal period induces significant alterations in the thymus of one-week-old piglets, which indicates an immunosuppressive effect in piglets.",

Knowledge about the occurrence of van A-carrying enterococci in broiler and environmental samples is important as antibiotic resistance can be transferred to human bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of VRE in broiler cloacal and environmental (house) samples and to genotype the isolates. In this study, 350 swabs were collected from broiler farms. All samples were plated onto enterococcus selective agar containing 6 mg/L vancomycin and 64 mg/L ceftazidime. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined for vancomycin and teicoplanin. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) was isolated from 6 out of 300 (2%) broiler cloacal samples and 13 out of 50 (26%) house samples. All E. faecium isolates had van A genes. All VREfm isolates (19 isolates) were confirmed to be 95% similar to each other. In conclusion, although 20 years have passed since the ban on avoparcin in Turkey, the present study shows that VREfm isolates are still present in broiler production and especially in broiler houses, and most importantly, a major VREfm clone was isolated from broiler cloacal and house samples.",

Chickens can be treated by thermal conditioning to have better heat stress tolerance. Our purpose was to determine the effect of acute heat stress on the immune response, i.e. antibody production against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and change in the proportion of leukocyte components, in chicks subjected to prenatal heat conditioning. Eighty as-hatched broiler chicks from the same parent stock were used: control (40 chicks incubated at 36.7 °C from days 18–20 of embryonic life) and thermally manipulated (TM) (40 chicks incubated at 38.4 °C from day 18–20 of embryonic life; 4 h/day). The chickens were exposed to heat stress: at day 19 (31 °C/8 h) and at day 35 (32 °C/10 h). The first heat stress (day 19) decreased the lymphocyte counts and significantly increased the heterophil counts ( P &lt; 0.05) in both treatments (from 34.25 to 55% in the controls and from 37 to 60.06% in the TM chicks). The second heat stress (day 35) did not alter the heterophil and lymphocyte profiles of the chickens. Before the heat stress, all of the chickens (control and TM) presented the same positive antibody titres to NDV vaccination. After the first heat stress, 50% of the control samples and 40% of samples from the TM chickens were negative. After the second heat stress, 80% of the TM samples were negative.",

The aim of this study was to detect and characterise FHV-1, FPLV, FeLV, FIV and feline foamy virus (FFV) in oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs from 93 cats that had been screened for FCV previously. We wanted to determine the possible risk factors for infection with these viruses. The prevalence was found to be 12.9% for FHV-1 and 9.7% for FPLV. FIV was detected only in two samples and FeLV in one sample, whereas the presence of FFV was not demonstrated in any of the clinical samples. The statistical analysis of the results showed that breed, age, health status, and lifestyle are important predisposing factors to FHV-1 ( P &lt; 0.05). For FPLV, only clinically unhealthy animals were found to be at risk ( P &lt; 0.001). Sequence analysis revealed that the two FIV-positive samples in this study contained different (A and B) subtypes of the virus.

Motility and plasma membrane integrity of spermatozoa exposed to TEB (0.001–100 µM) were evaluated at different incubation times (0–6 h), while TEB-induced spermiotoxicity was assessed after 24 h in cell cultures. Testicular cells, obtained from the parenchyma of bovine testes, were seeded at 1.0 × 10 4 and 1.5 × 10 6 cells/well in 96- and 12-well culture plates and incubated for 48 h in culture media containing TEB (0.001–100 µM) to evaluate cytotoxicity and hormone release, respectively. TEB did not affect the motility and plasma membrane integrity. However, significant spermiotoxicity occurred at higher TEB (1–100 µM) concentrations ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to control and lower doses. Although no dose caused cytotoxicity in testicular cells ( P &gt; 0.05), 1 and 100 µM TEB caused a significant increase in testosterone secretion ( P &lt; 0.05). As a result, high doses of TEB (1–100 µM) had slightly suppressive effects on spermatozoa; however, these doses had stimulatory effects on testosterone secretion by testicular cells. It appears that the disruption of hormonal homeostasis of testicular cells after TEB exposure may result in metabolic and especially reproductive adverse effects in bulls.",

Alterations of the chicken embryos were evaluated during necropsy performed on day 19 of incubation, together with mortality, body weight and the type of developmental abnormalities. Based on the results, the injection application appeared to be more toxic than the immersion method, as it induced increased mortality and reduced the average body weight, and resulted in a higher incidence of congenital anomalies. Supposedly, a toxicodynamic interaction occurs between copper sulphate and glyphosate, which may reduce the vitality of embryos and thus decrease the number of offspring in wild birds.",

After receiving inconclusive results regarding the type of piroplasm, the dog was diagnosed with simultaneous infections with B. canis and Babesia gibsoni via real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) testing. The dog was treated with imidocarb, atovaquone and azithromycin, and in a follow-up examination, the PCR results were negative for B. canis and B. gibsoni. Several weeks later, the dog was presented again, and a PCR was positive for B. gibsoni . After atovaquone and azithromycin failed to eliminate the parasites, a therapy attempt using metronidazole, clindamycin and doxycycline was initiated.

    "abstract": "Seasonal differences in the resumption of postpartum ovarian activity, milk production and periparturient metabolic status were investigated in lactating non-suckling dairy Awassi sheep in two consecutive experiments. In Experiment 1, autumn-lambing (AL, n = 27) and spring-lambing (SL, n = 37) ewes were investigated. Ovarian activity was monitored by means of individual progesterone (P4) profiles from day 5 to day 100 post partum. Most of the AL dams (89%) ovulated till day 35 after parturition and became cyclic thereafter. Incidence of persistent corpus luteum (CLP) and short luteal phases (sCL) was frequent (18% and 29%, respectively) among non-conceiving dams. In contrast, only 24% of the SL ewes ovulated before day 35. P4 levels during the luteal phase were lower in cyclic animals, and the cycle was longer in SL than in AL animals. No CLP or sCL was detected in the spring-lambing group, and 61% of SL ewes remained acyclic till the end of the trial. Lactation length was significantly longer in SL dams than in AL ewes (P = 0.008). According to the plasma metabolites (BHB, NEFA) and metabolic hormones (insulin, IGF-I, thyroxine) examined, negative energy balance did not appear in any of the animals. However, seasonal differences were seen in IGF-I and thyroxine levels, which were higher in the SL dams. In Experiment 2, influence of additional lighting was studied in autumn-lambing ewes. The long-day photoperiod (LD, n = 23) group was exposed to artificial light from sunset till midnight (approx. 16 h light/8 h dark) from some weeks before the expected date of delivery in mid-September until the end of December. The control group (n = 25) experienced only natural daylength. The first postpartum ovulation tended to occur later in the LD animals than in the controls (P = 0.047). The lactation of the LD group tended to be longer (P = 0.061). NEFA, BHB, insulin, IGF-I and thyroxine levels did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: ( i ) The ovarian function of the Awassi population is seasonal under temperate continental climate conditions. ( ii ) The first postpartum ovulation of non-suckling, autumn-lambing dams may occur very early, even before the completion of uterine involution. ( iii ) Additional artificial lighting may delay the time of first postpartum ovulation in AL ewes. ( iv ) Postpartum negative energy balance is unlikely to occur in dairy Awassi ewes even in high-producing intensive systems.",

Excluding morphologically normal ovarian fol-licles (antrum < 2 cm, wall < 1 mm), there were 27 fluid-filled ovarian structures. Ovulatory structures > 16 mm in diameter were designated as Group A (cavity ≤ 10 mm and wall > 10 mm) or Group B (cavity > 10 mm and wall < 10 mm). The volume of luteal tissue was less (P < 0.05) in Group B than in Group A, whereas that of a solid corpus luteum (CL) was intermediate (least square means ± SEM: 72 ± 1.92, 11.22 ± 1.57 and 5.84 ± 1.92 cm3, respectively). There was a greater proportion (P < 0.05) of small luteal cells in Group B compared to a solid CL, whereas Group A was intermediate (58.6 ± 5.3, 37.4 ± 5.3 and 44.0 ± 4.4%, respectively). Connective tissue was thicker (P < 0.05) in Group B than in Group A (295.4 ± 46.9 vs. 153.9 ± 38.2 μm).

Furthermore, there were three groups of anovulatory ovarian structures. Structures in Group C were termed persistent/anovulatory follicles (overall diameter and wall thickness ≤ 20 and 1-3 mm, respectively). Finally, Groups D and E were designated as a follicle-fibrous cyst and a follicle-luteinised cyst (based on histological structure) for anovulatory structures with an overall diameter and wall thickness of ≥ 20 and ≤ 3 mm, and ≥ 20 and ≥ 3 mm, respectively.",

Supplementation of SOF with 3 g/L BSA increased Day-7 blastocyst expansion rates (18.3 ± 1.6 vs. 14.4 ± 0.7; P < 0.05), although no differences in hatching rates were found. Addition of FCS to SOFaa (SOF with amino acids) medium supplemented with sodium citrate (SOFaaci) at 48 and at 72 h post-insemination (PI) allowed obtaining higher Day-6 embryo development rates than when FCS was added at 18 or 96 h PI (Day-6 morulae + blastocyst rate: 30.0 ± 1.1, 40.8 ± 1.1, 43.9 ± 2.3 and 39.3 ± 0.5 for FCS addition at 18, 48, 72 and 96 h, respectively). Hatching rates were significantly improved when serum was added at 72 h PI. Finally, both refrigeration and lyophilisation appeared as useful cryopreservation procedures for SOFaaci, although a significant loss of its ability to support embryo development, compared to the control fresh culture medium, was observed.",

Thirty-eight nucleotide sequences of the gag region encoding the matrix protein were determined and compared to sequences derived from the GenBank, revealing that Slovenian SRLV strains belong to sequence groups A and B, being maedivisna virus (MVV) and CAEV-like, respectively. In one goat herd, the presence of more than one genotype was confirmed and the majority of goat SRLV sequences were more closely related to MVV than to CAEV prototype strains.",

    "abstract": "To understand the genetic diversity of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in South China, we collected 231 clinical samples from pigs with suspected PRRSV infection in Guangdong between 2007 and 2009. We found that 74 of 231 samples were positive by RT-PCR. The PCR products of the ORF5 gene of 35 isolates from different farms were sequenced and their DNA sequences were compared to 23 other PRRSV isolates in the GenBank. We found that the nucleotide similarity among all South China isolates ranged from 87.6% to 100%, and all belonged to the North American genotype. Most of them were classified into subgenotype I, but the rest mapped to subgenotypes III, V or VI. Those in subgenotypes I and III were found to be highly variable in the primary neutralising epitope (PNE) with a specific amino acid mutation (F39/L39→I39), and a few isolates in subgenotypes I and III isolates also had a mutation at L41 (L41→S41). PRRSV isolates in subgenotypes III, V and VI had less potential glycosylation sites than those in subgenotype I. Our data contribute to the understanding of molecular variation of PRRSV in South China.",

The feed of another two groups of pigs (n = 10 each) contained 0.3 or 0.5 mg/kg T-2 toxin, respectively, plus a feed additive developed for splitting up the molecular structure of Fusarium toxins, in particular trichothecenes, by deepoxidation of the molecule, at 2 kg/tonne concentration. One group (n = 10) served as positive control; their feed was free from T-2 toxin but contained the feed additive at the above concentration. Toxin concentrations at these low dietary levels impaired the feed intake and growth rate of pigs. The feed additive alleviated the negative effects and justified its potential for prevention. Data of the present study indicated a 0.2 mg/kg feed no observed effect level (NOEL) of T-2 toxin in growing pig feeds.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) in dogs suspected of having cerebellar cortical degeneration (CCD). In the years 2009-2011, six dogs with suspected CCD were examined. Both MRI and BAER examinations revealed abnormalities in all dogs (100%). By MRI, T2-weighted midsagittal images revealed an increased amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding the cerebellum within the sulci of the folia in all dogs (100%). In 4 out of the 6 dogs (66.66%), cerebellar hypoplasia was more visible in the region of the dorsal cerebellar lobules. In 5 out of the 6 dogs (83.33%), the fourth ventricle was enlarged. In our studies, the brain to cerebellum ratio evaluated on the midsagittal image was 11.93%, in comparison to 14.9% in normal dogs. By BAER examination, the amplitude of the first and second waves was diminished and III-V interlatency was prolonged in 5 out of the 6 dogs (83.33%). In one out of the 6 dogs (16.67%), only the III-V interlatency was prolonged. In one dog (16.67%), somato-nervous deafness in the left ear was detected, whereas in the right ear the III-V interlatency was prolonged. MRI of the cerebellum is a reliable method for the antemortem diagnosis of CCD in American Staffordshire terriers, as is BAER examination. BAER is an objective diagnostic tool, which - along with other diagnostic modalities - can be helpful in the assessment, management and follow-up of dogs with cerebellar abiotrophy. It proved to be useful in determining the severity of neurological lesions in comparison to MRI findings, as well as in assessing the prognosis.",

The necropsy samples taken from dogs included 10 nonneoplastic pancreatic tissues, 10 well-differentiated pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas, 10 poorly differentiated pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas, 5 intrahepatic metastases of well-differentiated and 5 intrahepatic metastases of poorly differentiated acinar cell carcinomas. A strong lateral membrane claudin-5 positivity was detected in exocrine cells in all intact pancreas samples. The endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans and the epithelial cells of the ducts were negative for claudin-5. The endothelial cells of vessels and lymphatic channels in the stroma of the intact pancreas showed strong membrane positivity for this claudin. All well-differentiated exocrine pancreas carcinomas and all poorly-differentiated pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma samples showed a diffuse loss of claudin-5 expression. The claudin-5-positive peritumoural vessels and lymphatic channels facilitated the detection of vascular invasion of the claudin-5-negative cancer cells. In liver metastasis samples, the pancreatic carcinomas were negative for claudin-5. It seems that the loss of expression of claudin-5 may lead to carcinogenesis in canine exocrine pancreatic cells.",

The presence and genotype diversity of Lpf operons was screened in a collection of 97 Escherichia coli O157 strains representing different pathotypes, isolated from healthy cattle (n = 43) and human patients (n = 54) in several countries. Individual structural genes of Lpf were scanned by PCR, and allelic variants were detected with a recently developed typing scheme. Ninety-five strains carried at least one whole Lpf operon (genes lpf ABCD and/or lpf ABCDE ). The 64 enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) and 24 enteropathogenic (EPEC) strains all carried two Lpf operons, allele 3 of lpfA1 and allele 2 of lpfA2 , a combination characteristic of the O157:H7/NM serotype. Out of the 9 bovine atypical (AT; stx-, eae- ) strains, 7 carried one complete Lpf operon, allele 1 of lpfA2 . The atypical strains belonged to main phylogenetic groups A and B1, while the EHEC and EPEC strains were from group D. Lpf variants carried by the 72 strains of the Escherichia coli Reference Collection (ECOR) were determined with the same typing scheme. Alleles were detected in 25 strains, of which 6 were found negative for the respective Lpf operons in earlier studies. The marker value of the Lpf allelic combination for the O157:H7/NM serotype was confirmed, and further evidence was given for the presence of at least two different genetic lineages of atypical bovine E. coli O157 strains.",

Infections in small ruminants due to tetracyclineresistant Mycoplasma agalactiae strains are becoming a frequent problem worldwide. In the present paper the detection and analysis of three tetracycline-resistant M. agalactiae strains, isolated from infected goats in Cyprus, are reported. The three field isolates were identified as M. agalactiae by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showing 98% identity to the M. agalactiae PG2 reference strain. Furthermore, they were found sensitive to tylosin, enrofloxacin, spiramycin and lincomycin. In contrast, they were resistant to tetracycline. None of the putative genes [tet(M), tet(O) and tet(S)] that commonly contribute to high-level resistance to tetracycline could be amplified from their genome. Contrarily, the field isolates were found to carry ISMag1, an insertion sequence related to the IS30 family of mobile elements. Although ISMag1 is widely believed to induce high-frequency chromosomal rearrangements resulting in phenotypic changes of microorganisms, its potential role in tetracycline resistance of mycoplasmas requires further studies.",

Tungsten particles coated with plasmid DNA encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) were used for the bombardment of Eimeria maxima unsporulated oocysts. Seven Mpa (1015 psi) helium pressure, 65 mm target distance and −0.098 Mpa (24.8″ Hg) chamber vacuum were the optimised parameters for bombardment. After sporulation, the bombarded oocysts were inoculated into chickens, and the progeny oocysts were checked under fluorescent microscope and subjected to genomic DNA extraction, which was used either for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification or plasmid rescue assay. Although the expression of EYFP was not observed, the gene was amplified from both genomic DNA and the rescued plasmid, suggesting that the plasmid DNA existed in the form of episome. These results are encouraging for the genetic processing of the sporogony stage of eimerian parasites.",

Parenteral application of hrIL-1b decreased oocyst shedding to 62%, but the infection ran a similar course in treated and control birds. The PHA-P skin test demonstrated increased cellular immune reaction in chickens receiving IL-1b, but there was no significant difference in the humoral responses of the two groups as detected by ELISA. On the other hand, indomethacin mixed to the feed lessened oocyst shedding to 13.7% and also shortened its duration. Immunological parameters as reflected by PHA-P skin test and ELISA results indicated enhanced cellular but unaltered humoral immune response. These data suggest that the sys- temic application of interleukin-1 can induce partial protection against C. baileyi in chickens and that prolonged, abundant oocyst shedding is due to an indometha- cin-sensitive immunodepression via the prostaglandin pathway.",

Eight sows were vaccinated with the Chinese strain of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). The length of time between vaccination and farrowing was 167-217 days. Milk samples from the front, middle and back udder sections and blood samples were taken from the sows on days 3 and 14 after farrowing. Blood samples were obtained from the piglets at the age of 3, 6 and 10 weeks. The antibody level of the milk was examined by ELISA, and that of blood samples by the virus neutralization (VN) test as well. In all 3-week-old piglets and in 80% of the 6-week-old animals the neutralizing antibody level reached the titre of 1:40. In none of the 10-week-old piglets did the titre exceed the value of 1:20, but in about 25% of the piglets it reached 1:20; the half of these piglets came from two litters. In none of the piglets did the antibody level reach the negative threshold in the ELISA test during the study. No significant differences were found between the udder sections in milk antibody level by ELISA.",

Luteal cells from days 2-4, 5-10 or 11-17 of the oestrous cycle were pre-incubated for 20h. Subsequently DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium was replaced by fresh medium and the cells were treated for 6 h as follows: In Experiment I with HDL (5-75μg cholesterol per ml), NA, isoprenaline (ISO) or luteinising hormone (LH). In Experiment II cells were incubated for further 24h in deficient medium (without FCS) and next treated as in Experiment I. In Experiment III cells were stimulated with NA, ISO or LH alone and together with HDL. In Experiment IV cells were treated with PLC inhibitor (U-73122) or with PKC inhibitor (staurosporine) or stimulator (phorbol 12-myristrate 13-acetate) and with either NA, insulin or LH. Only luteal cells from days 5-10 of the cycle responded on HDL and β-mimetics (P&lt;0.05). LH stimulated progesterone secretion from the luteal cells during all stages of the cycle (P&lt;0.001). Cells incubated in deficient medium and supplemented with HDL secreted as much progesterone as those stimulated by LH in all stages of the cycle. Beta-mimetics were unable to enhance the stimulatory effect of HDL. Blockade of PLC had no influence on progesterone secretion from cells treated with either NA or LH, but this did impair the stimulatory effect of insulin (P&lt;0.05). Similarly, blockade of PKC by staurosporine impaired (P&lt;0.05) the effect of insulin only but not that observed after LH or NA treatment. We suggest that: (a) noradrenergic stimulation does not enhance utilisation of cholesterol from HDL for progesterone secretion; (b) the fasting of luteal cells seems to activate enzymes responsible for the progesterone synthesis; (c) effect of NA on progesterone secretion from luteal cells does not involve the PLC-PKC pathway.",

The material of this study consisted of 20 clinically healthy Holstein-Friesian cows of the same age and milk yield. Blood and urine samples were collected on 190-200th, 240-250th and 270-280th days of pregnancy and on days 1-7th, 35-45th and 75-85th after calving, altogether 6 times. An increase was observed in Fe Ca and Fe Mg during the transition from the lactation to the dry period (p &lt; 0.05), and a decrease in Fe Ca (p &lt; 0.05), Fe Mg (p &lt; 0.01) in the 2nd month of the dry period. Fe PO4 and Fe Mg , respectively, increased on levels of p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, while Fe Ca decreased on a level of p &lt; 0.05 after gestation compared to the level before gestation. Fe Na and Fe K showed a decrease of p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively, between the 1st and 2nd months of the dry period, while after gestation this value showed an increase in Fe Na (p &lt; 0.05) and Fe K (p &lt; 0.01). Fe Cl increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) only from postpartum to the 1st month of lactation. There was a strong positive correlation between Fe Na and Fe Cl in all of the periods. It was concluded that there were significant changes in the Fe of Na, K, Cl, Ca, PO 4 and Mg before parturition and during lactation; these changes could have an important role in assessing renal function and electrolyte balance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare different types of movement pattern and velocities of stallion spermatozoa depending on cryopreservation during breeding and non-breeding season. Ejaculates were collected from four stallions during May (n = 24) and December (n = 24). Parameters of sperm movement were evaluated by computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) system, and included percentages of motile spermatozoa, different patterns of motility, the velocity, linearity (LIN), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH) and beat-cross frequency (BCF). In winter the average percentages of motility were slightly higher compared to the breeding season in May (70.8 +/- 12.7% vs. 66.8 +/- 12.2%, respectively). Cryopreservation and thawing led to a significant decrease in the number of motile sperm to 11.3 +/- 5.8% in May and 15.6 +/- 7.0% in December. The pattern of motility was also changed. Detailed analysis by CASA demonstrated that cryopreservation resulted in a shift from the proportions of linear to more non-linear motile spermatozoa and to a significant increase of local motile and hyperactivated spermatozoa. Mean velocity of fresh motile spermatozoa differed between May and December (119.1 +/- 43.9 vs. 164.4 +/- 66.4 microm/sec, respectively; P < 0.05). Cryopreservation and thawing led to a slight increase of curvilinear velocity (VCL) and straight line velocity (VSL). The motility analysis has shown that the parameters BCF and ALH were highly correlated in stallion spermatozoa (r = -0.67; P < 0.001). The BCF of stallion spermatozoa was slightly reduced in the non-breeding season. Altogether, the influence of factors on the motility of stallion spermatozoa has the following rank order: cryopreservation (P < 0.0001) > stallion (P < 0.001) > season (P < 0.05).",

Tracer quantities of iodothyronines, displaying the onset of thyroid hormone activity, were found in the thyroid tissue on day 39, i.e. before the appearance of a measurable quantity of iodothyronines in the serum. The T 4 and T 3 thyroidal content showed the first rise between days 56 and 76. Then, T 3 was increasing sharply from day 92 till birth, while T 4 content was decreasing from about day 76 to a low value between day 92 and 105, and then showing an increase shortly before birth. The rT 3 content was the highest on day 39 and then it was steadily decreasing to reach a nadir on about day 76. Measurable amounts of thyroid hormones (TH) in the serum were observed not earlier than on day 46 of gestation. Near birth, the tissues of the pig fetus are in a milieu characterised by the highest blood TH concentrations. The serum to thyroid concentration ratio for rT 3 and T 4 was generally below 1.0 until the last trimester of gestation, when it was over 5.0 for rT 3 and over 4.0 for T 4 . By contrast, the T 3 serum to thyroid ratio was below 0.5 throughout the gestation. The results show that the fetal pig thyroid displays a low rT 3 and T 4 content, but the marked T 3 elevation observed near term supports the view that a high production and secretion of T 3 near term may be a critical factor for normal postnatal adaptation to extrauterine cooling in the pig.",

Microscopic analysis showed that the lymph nodes in both dolphin species were surrounded by a connective tissue capsule comprising smooth muscle cells. The parenchyma of the mesenteric and bifurcational lymph nodes in bottlenose dolphin was divided into the peripherally situated cortex with the lymphatic nodules and diffuse lymphatic tissue, and the centrally situated medulla structured of the medullary cords separated by the medullary sinuses. These lymph nodes structurally correspond to the lymph nodes in the majority of terrestrial mammals. The mesenteric lymph node of striped dolphin also had a peripherally situated cortex and a centrally positioned medulla as the majority of terrestrial mammals. In the bifurcational lymph nodes of striped dolphin, there was a central dense lymphatic tissue with the lymphatic nodules and a peripheral less dense lymphatic tissue structured of the cell cords and sinuses. The bifurcational lymph node in striped dolphin resembled porcine lymph nodes and belonged to the inverse lymph nodes.",

The elimination half-life remained unchanged during the three days of administration (T1/2beta = 1.33 +/- 0.029 h for the IV route and T1/2beta = 2.75 +/- 0.38 h for the IM route).

Bioavailability after IM administration was 95%. Serum profiles of urea, creatinine, albumin, electrolytes and pH after 5-day treatment with amikacin at a dose of 25 mg/kg per day IM revealed no changes. Assessment of diffusion of amikacin to milk by a commercially available screening method to detect antibiotic residues revealed that amikacin could not be detected by the fifth milking period after the last treatment.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether pentoxifylline could prevent coagulation disturbances in LPS-treated rabbits. Endotoxaemia was induced with E. coli lipopolysaccharide in New Zealand White rabbits. Forty rabbits were used and divided into four equal groups. Group 1 served as a control group; Group 2: lipopolysaccharide was injected intravenously, Group 3: pentoxifylline was injected intraperitoneally, Group 4: lipopolysaccharide and pentoxifylline were injected simultaneously. Blood samples were collected 6 h after the treatments. In rabbits with endotoxin-induced DIC, platelet count, leukocyte count, percentage of differential leukocyte values, fibrinogen level, antithrombin III (AT-III) and protein C (PC) activity were decreased. Moreover, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged when compared to the control group. In conclusion, haemostatic disturbances associated with endotoxin-induced DIC were moderately suppressed by the administration of PTX.",

The infection was introduced by wild-captured Patagonian conures (Cyanoliseus patagonus) despite 61 days of quarantine. The disease affected several parrot species and, interestingly, three out of seven bearded barbets (Lybius dubius). The mortality rate was 30.93%. Autopsy revealed abdominal hyperaemia with liver haemorrhages and, in less rapid cases, yellowish discoloration and fragility of the liver. Death was caused by the collapse of circulation. Histopathology demonstrated liver cell necrosis, disintegration of the lobular structure, and a few intranuclear inclusion bodies. Icosahedral virions were detected by electron microscopy. The virus was isolated in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs as well as in chicken embryo fibroblast cell culture. A 281-bp-long fragment of psittacid herpesvirus DNA was detected by PCR in cell culture material and liver samples of the affected birds. To our knowledge this is the first report of Pacheco's disease in bearded barbets as well as the first occurrence of Pacheco's disease in Hungary.",

The data using the Chisquared test were consistent with the null hypothesis that the technical effectiveness was equal in the groups under investigation (P &gt; 0.05). On the contrary, using the two-sample unpaired t -test the null hypothesis, that the mean EIXRR was equal, was rejected (P &lt; 0.001). The estimated EIXRR was 3.4 ± 0.7 and 5.7 ± 1.2 (mean ± SD) for MPP and SPM, respectively.

However, it is stated as well that ‘the technical reference data for head-only electrical stunning of pigs such as 1.3 Amps are either rather old or worked out under experimental laboratory conditions’. This study was carried out to verify the electrical parameters of pig stunning under commercial conditions. Altogether 145 fattener pigs (body weight range: 30–150 kg, median 109 kg) were tested at four different private slaughterhouses in Hungary where head-only electrical stunners were used with different constant voltage settings. In each case the following data were recorded: individual liveweight (kg), current (A) and voltage (V) (measured with an individually developed analogue device placed in the circuit), current duration (s), effectiveness of stunning, grading of carcass. Correlations between these parameters and effectiveness were examined. Besides that, any correlation between the test parameters and impedance of head was examined. In 128 out of the 145 cases the stunning was effective (88.3%). Effectiveness was significantly related to current but not to other parameters such as voltage and duration of load. Impedance of head was not correlated with the size of the animal and the meat grading scores. Generally, it was concluded that the use of a single electrical parameter (e.g. a minimum current of 1.3 A) as a prerequisite of good stunning is not ideal.",

The strains were identified and genotyped in order to determine their epidemiological background. Standard biotyping methods and Bruce-ladder were used to identify the strains. Genotyping was done using multilocus variable number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) on 16 and multilocus sequence typing analysis (MLST) on nine loci. Results were compared to each other and to internationally available data. Twenty- five novel genotypes and two sequence types were identified. All tested strains, apart from vaccine and reference strains, showed very close phylogenetic and geographic relationships. The genotyping results indicate the endemicity of brucellosis in this region. MLST showed no variation, confirming the stability of housekeeping genes. The results confirm already established routes of disease spread in this area, showing that a more detailed and vigorous control of this zoonosis is necessary.",

A novel approach in the characterisation of prion by using its genic variation was also implemented. The authors established that the proportion of deleterious sites (%) can be a useful indicator of the eradication programme. Based on a large sample size, it was confirmed that the scrapie resistance of the Cikta breed is low, and the classification of this breed according to risk category has not improved.

The careful use of these genotypes is permitted and will contribute to the maintenance of breed diversity.

Seventy out of 628 adult sheep (11%) died in the affected pen during the six days of the outbreak. None of the 146 lambs kept in the neighbouring pen showed any clinical signs during that period. Several preceding events (shearing, vaccination and antiparasitic treatment) can be regarded as factors predisposing to the disease. Five adult sheep (4 females and 1 male) were sent for laboratory examination. Clinical, gross pathological, histological and bacteriological examinations revealed results corresponding to those reported previously in lambs that had died of a B. trehalosi-induced septicaemia.",

Accordingly, two- and three-dimensional computed tomographic images of the anatomical structures of the proximal femora of 58, hip-dysplasia-free, mature dogs of medium and large breeds were studied. Based on the length of their femora the dogs were allocated to Group I (from 145 to 195 mm) and Group II (from 196 to 240 mm). The FNA was measured on each femur using multi-slice spiral computed tomography (CT). The two- and three-dimensional image data were processed as multi-planar and threedimensional reconstructions using Advantage Workstation software. The CT measurements revealed that Group I had an average femoral neck angle of 147.59° (min. 144.05°, max. 153.35°), while in Group II the average FNA was 147.46° (min. 141°, max. 154.35°). There was no significant correlation between the length of the femur and the FNA in either group. The optimal FNA for a total hip prosthesis is 147.5° for medium and large dog breeds.",

It is characterised by various areas of their coat colour becoming diluted due to a malfunction in the eumelanin-producing pigment cells. Recent studies have shown that the exact size of the short interspersed element (SINE) insertion is in correlation with specific phenotypic attributes, but was not able to absolutely confine dogs to a certain colour pattern. Our study focused on the merle variations occurring in the Mudi breed. Altogether, 123 dog samples from 11 countries were tested and genotyped. The exact length of the merle alleles were determined by automated fluorescent capillary fragment analysis. The most frequent merle genotype in this Mudi sample collection was the 'classic' merle (m/M: 61.8%), whereas other variants, such as atypical (m/Ma and m/Ma+: 5.7%), harlequin (m/Mh: 13.8%), double merle (M/M: 0.8%) and mosaic profiles (17.9%) were also observed. The practical significance of testing this mutation is that, phenotypically, not only merle dogs are carriers of this insertion, but also the so-called hidden merle individuals (where the merle phenotype is fully covered by the pheomelanin-dominated colouration) are potentially capable of producing unintentionally homozygous 'double merle' progeny with ophthalmologic, viability and auditory impairments.",

Parasite invasion was examined in three fish species with various susceptibility levels: the type host brown trout, the highly susceptible rainbow trout, and the non-susceptible gibel carp, in which parasite spores do not develop. We investigated the first two hours of fish invasion, and measured the site preference of triactinomyxons (TAMs) during attachment and penetration of fish in three body parts (gills, fins, skin). Infection prevalence and intensity were estimated using a species-specific nested PCR, optimised in the present study. The highest infection prevalence was detected in the most susceptible fish species, rainbow trout. Interestingly, higher prevalence was observed in gibel carp than in the type host, brown trout (95.2% vs. 85.7%). Considering body locations, remarkable differences were detected in infection intensities. The highest intensity was observed in fins, whereas skin was the least infected body part in every fish species examined. Infection prevalence and intensity did not differ significantly among fish species. Thus, we confirmed that M. cerebralis TAMs cannot discern fish species. Furthermore, we proved experimentally that fish fin is significantly more attractive to fish-invading parasite TAMs than gills or skin.",

LigaSure had the lowest mean ST in spleen, mesentery, muscle and liver, followed by Thunderbeat and EnSeal with significant differences between all types of tissues and devices. The significantly lowest mean WT max was obtained for EnSeal in mesentery, muscle and liver. LigaSure and EnSeal operated at the lowest temperature in spleen without a significant difference between them. Thunderbeat produced significantly higher temperature peaks in all cases. The lowest mean MTZ total was caused by LigaSure and EnSeal in spleen, mesentery and muscle without significant differences between them, followed by the significantly higher values of Thunderbeat. Nevertheless, Thunderbeat produced the significantly lowest mean MTZ total in the liver. EnSeal produced the lowest mean MTZ collat in the liver, followed by LigaSure and Thunderbeat showing significant differences. EnSeal and LigaSure produced the lowest mean MTZ collat in the spleen, mesentery and muscle without significant differences between them, followed by the significantly higher values of Thunderbeat.

In the second division, thirty cadaveric limbs (ten for each approach) were injected with an equal volume of iopamidol through relevant joint pouches to compare the dorsal, lateral and plantar IA approaches for each joint. The former technique was applied to nine live, healthy adult buffaloes to evaluate the accuracy of IA injection of the hind digit in vivo . Injection criteria were assessed, scored and statistically compared among the three approaches. The summation of injection criteria scores showed a significant increase ( P &lt; 0.05) in the dorsal and lateral approaches for IA injection of the fetlock, pastern and coffin joints in the buffalo digit compared to the plantar one. However, median and range of injection criteria scores between the dorsal and lateral approaches were slightly less significant. In conclusion, the present study established a reference for IA injection of the buffalo digit that could aid the diagnosis and treatment of digit-related lameness.",

To elucidate the genetic variability and to estimate the burden of the pathogen, MRSA from our strain collection and prospectively collected Staphylococcus aureus (SA) isolates originating from two milk hygiene laboratories were investigated. Between 2003 and 2018, 27 MRSA strains originating from 10 dairy farms were deposited and characterised. Most strains (n = 20) belonged to ST1-t127-SCCmecIV and were recovered from three unrelated farms. From other farms, variable genotypes were identified sporadically: ST22-t032-SCCmecIV from three farms; a newly described double locus variant of ST97, ST5982-t458-SCCmecIV from two farms; and ST398-t011-SCCmecIV and ST398-t011-SCCmecV from two respective farms. The prospective screening of 626 individual SA isolates originating from 42 dairy farms resulted in four (0.48 %) MRSA strains from three (7.14 %) farms. All MRSA isolates belonged to the clonal complex 398 and a novel spa-type t19251 was also identified. Most isolates were resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes. The occurrence and significance of MRSA of dairy origin seems to be unchanged in the past decade in Hungary. However, the low host specificity and multiresistance of the identified genotypes calls for periodic revision on the role and distribution of the pathogen in the Hungarian dairy sector.",

The first subgroup (9 patients) comprised dogs with neovascularisation observed in 1 to 2 quadrants of the right and left cornea, while the second subgroup (16 patients) comprised dogs with neovascularisation observed in 3 to 4 quadrants of the right and left cornea.

The study indicated that the median serum VEGF concentration in healthy dogs was 14.9 pg/mL. The VEGF level observed in sick German shepherds was elevated (19.5 pg/mL) as compared to the values found in healthy dogs; however, a statistically significant increase in VEGF concentration, as compared to the values observed in healthy dogs, was only noted in the first subgroup, where the median VEGF concentration was 22.0 pg/mL. Elevated serum VEGF concentration was observed in German shepherds diagnosed with CSK. A statistically significant increase in VEGF levels was observed in dogs in the first stage of the disease, i.e. the early stage of neovascularisation.",

    "abstract": "Both resiniferatoxin (RTX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) have been reported to be effective in several clinical trials aiming to cure urinary bladder dysfunction. The goal of this experiment was to study the effect of intravesical administration of RTX and TTX on the chemical coding of paracervical ganglion (PCG) neurons that supply the urinary bladder in pigs. The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the opioid family member Leu5-enkephalin (LENK) are both known for their regulatory effects in the function of the porcine genitourinary tract. The PCG neurons innervating the urinary bladder were identified by application of the retrograde tracer Fast Blue (FB), injected into the bladder wall prior to intravesical RTX or TTX administration. Immunocytochemical detection of LENK and VIP expression in the FB-labelled perikarya revealed that in the control group 25.15% of the FB-positive PCG neurons contained LENK, and 9.22% of them expressed VIP. Intravesical infusion of RTX resulted in an increase in the number of LENKIR neurons to 48.19% and VIP-IR perikarya to 11.25%. Optional treatment with TTX induced increase of LENK-IR neurons up to 81.67% and VIP-IR population to 16.46% of the FB-positive PCG cells. The present results show that both neurotoxins affect the chemical coding of PCG nervous cells supplying the porcine urinary bladder and that they stimulate both LENK and VIP expression. Furthermore, the results indicate a possible involvement of LENK and VIP neurons in the mechanisms of action of RTX and TTX in the therapy of overactive bladder disorder.",

Those from the cows that showed oestrus within 5 days after treatment were inseminated (Group 1: n = 39). Other group of cows showing oestrus without treatment (Group 2: n = 41) were inseminated and served as controls. The ovaries of each cow were scanned by transrectal ultrasonography from the day of detected oestrus (Day -1p.m.) until ovulation, to measure the changes in the areas of the CL and the largest follicle and to determine the occurrence of ovulation. Although no significant differences were found between the treated and untreated cows in terms of a reduction in the area of the corpora lutea and of an increase in the area of the dominant follicles, the mean area of these follicles in Group 2 was somewhat greater than in Group 1. The highest conception rate was achieved if AI was performed at the same day as ovulation occurred in both groups (conception rate in treated group was: 62.5%, in untreated group: 66.6%, respectively) between Day 0a.m. to Day 0p.m.. In Group 1, 54.5% conception rate has been achieved if ovulation occurred between Day 0p.m. to Day 1p.m., or 50% between Day 1p.m. to Day 2p.m. after AI, and 53.3% and 44.4% in Group 2, respectively. The conception rate for cows that ovulated before AI in Group 2 was 25%. No ovulation occurred in 7 cows until Day 2p.m. after AI and none of them became pregnant. The overall conception rate was approximately 50% in both groups, but when the cows had ovulated too early or too late relative to the time of AI, the conception rate was significantly lower, thus determination of the optimal time for AI is of great practical importance in dairy herds.",

The present study evaluated the effectiveness of vulvar skin temperature changes as a predictor of ovulation in sows and determined the fertility rates obtained after AI with frozen-thawed semen supplemented with rosmarinic acid (RA). Semen was collected from mature boars and cryopreserved in experimental extenders supplemented with or without 105 μM of RA. Multiparous sows were inseminated with a single dose of semen when vulvar skin temperature decreased to a value below 35 °C. Intrauterine insemination was performed using 1.5 × 109 spermatozoa. The sows were slaughtered 48 h after AI and the embryos and oocytes were recovered from the oviducts. Total and progressive motility, viability and acrosome integrity were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in RA-supplemented semen samples compared with the control. Fertilisation occurred in all sows inseminated in the study, although there were no significant differences between the experimental groups. Sows inseminated with RA-supplemented semen showed a slight increase in the number of embryos recovered as compared to sows inseminated with control semen. In conclusion, insemination according to vulvar skin temperature changes resulted in successful fertilisation in all sows, although supplementation of the freezing media with RA did not improve the fertilising ability of frozen-thawed boar sperm.",

Five of the eight PCR-RFLP profiles (I, III, V, VI and VII) were detected among the field strains. Only a correlation of limited strength was found between the classical somatic serotypes and the PCR-RFLP profiles. However, the results confirmed that molecular methods could confidently distinguish serotype A:1 strains from the other serotypes.

Based on the serological profiles, infection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was determined to take place at 3-7 weeks of age in the PMWS-affected and at 3-11 weeks of age in the control farms. To compare the dynamics of seroconversion to PCV2 among farms, cross-sectional serological profiles were normalised in relation to the inferred age of infection. The results indicated that the proportion of seropositive pigs increased significantly slower in the affected herds. The most pronounced difference was observed about 4 weeks after infection, when the proportion of seropositive pigs ranged from 0 to 53.3% and from 70 to 100% in PMWS-affected and control herds, respectively. Mean antibody titres at that age were also significantly lower in the affected farms. These observations suggest a delay in the production of PCV2-specific antibodies and indicate that serological methods may be helpful in identifying herds with a high risk of PMWS.",

    "abstract": "Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) bacteria frequently cause severe enteric diseases primarily in children and in young rabbits. Their pathogenicity for pigs has been tested by oral infection of colostrum-deprived newborn, and of severely immunosuppressed weaned pigs, but colonisation of conventional weaned pigs by porcine EPEC has not been experimentally studied. EPEC show similarities to enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) additionally carrying shiga toxin genes integrated into the chromosome by lambdoid phages. We have demonstrated earlier that the porcine EPEC prototype strain P86-1390 (O45) could be transduced in vivo (in ligated loops of weaned pigs), by Stx2 phage derived from a human EHEC. Thus, the ability of this porcine EPEC strain to colonise conventional weaned pigs under farming conditions became a question of relevance to human health. To clarify this question, four intragastric infection experiments were performed on a total of 95 conventional weaned pigs. The EPEC P86-1390 and other well-characterised porcine EPEC strains were applied to 54 pigs, leaving 41 weaned pigs as negative controls. In three experiments moderate predispositions were applied: coinfections with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) or with low-virulence TGE coronavirus, application of fumonisin B1 with a normal therapeutic dose of dexamethasone, and the increase of soybean protein concentration in the feed. A total of 41 weaned pigs served as negative controls inoculated with a commensal porcine E. coli. Housing conditions simulated the farm environment. As an overall result, ileal segments of 18.5% of infected pigs were shown to be colonised by EPEC, while no EPEC were detected in the ilea of controls. Among predisposing factors occurring on farms, feed protein content increased by 20% (26.3% crude protein, provided by 48% soybean meal) seemed to enhance EPEC colonisation and resulted in the mobilisation of spontaneous latent EPEC/ETEC infection. The results indicate that under normal farm conditions porcine EPEC may colonise conventional weaned pigs by inducing ileal attaching effacing (AE) lesions with reasonable frequency, without clinical signs. The results also suggest that conventional weaned pigs may represent undetected reservoirs of porcine EPEC, potentially giving rise to the emergence of new types of EHEC due to natural transduction by Stx phages.",

Here, a modified stable HepG2 cell line was transfected with pcDNA3.1-ORF3 to express the swine HEV ORF3 protein. Based on this cell line, a novel immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) was developed to detect antibodies against HEV. The results show that this method has good specificity, sensitivity and repeatability. When used to investigate 141 porcine serum samples, the IPMA had a coincidence rate of 92.2% with a commercial ELISA kit. The established IPMA described herein is valuable as a supplemental method to ELISA and can differentiate infections by HEV and other viruses.",

The purpose of this study was to experimentally contaminate fresh pork with three different concentrations of PRRSV and to study virus survival at ambient (25 °C), refrigerated (4 °C), and frozen (-20 °C) temperatures. Concentrations of virus representing natural infectivity level and 'worst case scenario' were studied. The virus was detected in fresh pork at all three virus concentrations for up to 48 h at ambient temperature. At 4 °C, the virus survived for 6 days in pork inoculated with the higher virus concentration and for 3 days in pork inoculated at the lower concentration. At frozen temperature, PRRSV was detected for up to 60 days in pork inoculated at the higher concentration and for 7 days in pork inoculated at the lower concentration. These results suggest that fresh pork has the potential to be a vehicle for virus dissemination depending upon temperature and time of storage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Infections of pigs with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) can lead to various clinical conditions including reproductive disorders (PCV2-RD). In general, a transplacental infection of fetuses leads to mummification and stillbirth. So far, PCV2-RD has mainly been described in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) herds or farms with a high proportion of gilts. From December 2018 to February 2019, a high abundance of mummified fetuses (15.5%) was observed in two farrowing groups in an Austrian piglet-producing farm. PCV2 DNA was detected using qPCR in organs of all six investigated fetuses (2.07 × 10 8 –1.09 × 10 12 PCV2) genome equivalents/g tissue and via in situ hybridisation in organs from five fetuses, while histologic lesions were not observed in a single fetal heart. All isolates were sequenced and identified as PCV2d. After the implementation of a regular vaccination of all sows against PCV2, the abundance of mummified fetuses dropped to 3.5% in May 2019. In contrast to previous reports about PCV2-RD, this farm was neither an SPF herd nor a start-up herd with a high proportion of gilts. The implementation of regular PCV2 vaccination helped to reduce the abundance of mummified fetuses substantially.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent form of oral cancer in humans and dogs. The altered expression of cell adhesion molecules, including E-cadherin (CDH1) and syndecan-1 (SDC1), is involved in cancer progression. This study aimed to investigate the protein expression of CDH1 and SDC1 in early and late clinical stages of human and canine OSCC (hOSCC and cOSCC, respectively), using immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissue blocks were obtained from 21 hOSCC, 8 human normal gingiva, 26 cOSCC, and 13 canine normal gingiva. Clinical stages and histological subtypes of samples were evaluated. The results indicated that both human and canine OSCC exhibited reduced levels of CDH1 and SDC1 expression at the cell membrane regardless of clinical stage or histological subtype. Additionally, decreased levels of total SDC1 expression were observed in hOSCC compared with normal controls. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a similarity in the immunohistochemical expression of CDH1 and SDC1 between humans and dogs with OSCC, lending support to the potential use of dogs as a model for studying human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",

The increase and spread of the antimicrobial resistant P. mirabilis is considered alarming worldwide. Transmission mainly occurs through consumption of contaminated poultry products. We investigated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence markers in broiler chicken-originated P. mirabilis isolates from 380 fecal samples. Phenotypic AMR test was performed against seventeen different antimicrobials. Genotypic AMR test was performed to detect sixteen different AMR genes. The samples were also tested for the presence of eight different virulence genes and biofilm formation. P. mirabilis was isolated in 11% of the samples, with significantly high multidrug-resistant (MDR) prevalence (63%). All isolates were resistant to tetracycline (100%). The combined disc method indicated that all isolates were of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, which was compatible with the high bla TEM prevalence (95%). This was associated with bla TEM being responsible for more than 80% of ampicillin resistance in enteric pathogens. The absence of phenotypically carbapenem-resistant isolates was compatible with the very low prevalences of bla OXA (2%) and bla NDM (0%). All isolates were positive for pmfA, atfA, hpmA, and zapA (100%) virulence genes, while biofilm formation rate (85%) indicated high adherence abilities of the isolates.",

Depending on the advancement of RA, SD-OCT examinations identified retinal abnormalities ranging from layer disorganisation to advanced atrophy. The most advanced RA occurred ventral to the optic disc. Total retinal thickness in both eyes (mean ± SD) was lower in dogs with RA compared to controls dorsally (77.7 ± 39.5 μm vs 173.5 ± 13.3 μm), ventrally (33.4 ± 29.9 μm vs 139.5 ± 10.8 μm), nasally (65.0 ± 34.5 μm vs 163.9 ± 11.0 μm) and temporally (61.8 ± 41.7 μm vs 171.9 ± 11.1 μm) to the optic disc. In dogs with locally normal architecture of inner retina, loss of definition of outer retinal layers occurred in many regions. Dark and light-adapted ERGs were reduced in 2 dogs with RA and were unrecordable in 11 dogs. Lesions evident in SD-OCT scans of mixed breed dogs affected with retinal atrophy initially appear ventrally to the optic disc and ventro-dorsally in advanced RA. In all mixed breed dogs with retinal atrophy, clinical signs and SD-OCT results correlate with ERG findings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Potential arrhythmias recorded by cardiac monitors using the built-in human algorithm are as follows: total number of episodes, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, bradycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and the percentage of time spent in atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. Long-term use of an insertable cardiac monitor (loop recorder) has been reported in one horse earlier, but its accurate role as a diagnostic tool is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term applicability of the Reveal XT cardiac monitor for recording cardiac arrhythmias in adult horses. The Reveal XT cardiac monitor was implanted in 12 horses under sedation in standing position. Median duration of data recording calculated for the population was 1,169 days. The number of false positive detections of asystole and bradycardia was extremely high in all horses. For atrial fibrillation, false positive detection occurred in five and false negative detection occurred in one horse. The present study showed that the long-term use of the Reveal XT cardiac monitor is feasible, well-tolerated and the devices work reliably, without complications. The human algorithm could not be used for automatic detection of arrhythmic episodes in the study population. The device could detect atrial fibrillation in horses, but the recorded AF burden was inaccurate and the stored ECGs had to be manually interpreted. Because the human analyser algorithm of this cardiac monitor fails to identify bradyarrhythmias in horses based on our results, this instrument is not capable for accurately determining the aetiology of episodic collapse in this species.",

Genomic DNA was extracted from 110 Harnali sheep using an Automated Maxell RSC DNA/RNA purification system. A 294 bp fragment, covering the 5′ flanking region of the IGF-1 gene, was amplified with specific primers. The resulting PCR product, harboring the g.857G&gt;A mutation, was digested with the Hae II enzyme to determine genotypes. The frequency of the A allele of the IGF-1 gene was higher (0.59) in the studied Harnali sheep population, with the GA genotype being the most prevalent (0.64). The presence of the A allele was associated with higher body weights, suggesting its potential as a selection criterion for improving flock performance. Furthermore, the GA genotype was linked to a lower average age at first lambing (727.93 days) compared to the GG genotype (753.08 days). The A allele was linked to higher body weights, while the GA genotype was associated with a lower age at first lambing. These findings highlight the potential of these genetic markers for improving breeding strategies and enhancing flock performance. However, validation on larger samples is warranted.",

The grafts were removed after one month. Five grafts remained patent. The Doppler showed good, relatively increased flow (median flow rate: 383 cm/sec) after one month in all of the cases. Slight increase in diameter was present in all cases. By microscopy the five patent grafts showed viable morphology, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and thin fibrin layer in the wall. The grafts were lined partially with a neoendothelial monolayer and a thin fibrin layer. In conclusion, this graft presents an acceptable patency rate and low thrombogenicity, and could be useful in transplantation.

Two days before E. coli challenge all chicks were vaccinated with a live attenuated strain of infectious bronchitis virus (H-52).

Using this model, the efficacy of two different dosing methods of norfloxacin (continuous and pulse dosing) was evaluated. The once-per-day pulse dosing of norfloxacin administered via the drinking water at 15 mg/kg body weight proved to be more efficacious than the continuous dosing method of 100 mg/L for 5 days in chickens, while there were no convincing differences between the two treatment regimens in turkeys.

    "abstract": "The teratogenic effects of lead acetate (Trial 1) and the possible teratogenic effect of this compound administered in combination with a fungicide containing 80% mancozeb (Trial 2) were studied in rats. The test substances were administered by gavage on Days 6-15 of gestation. In Trial 1, five groups were treated with lead acetate administered at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 10.0 and 1000.0 mg/kg body weight (bwkg), respectively. In Trial 2, lead acetate was applied at doses of 0.1, 10.0 and 1000.0 mg/bwkg, respectively. In the latter case the dose of the pesticide was 750 mg/bwkg in all treated groups. Lead acetate was not teratogenic after a single administration. Combined administration of lead acetate and mancozeb gave rise to the following toxic effects: average maternal weight decreased during pregnancy, the ratio of live fetuses decreased after the two lowest doses, and fetal mortality increased in the lowest and in the highest dose groups. The ratio of fetal resorption was higher in all the treated groups than in the control group. A significant decrease occurred in average fetal and placental weight in each treated group as compared to the control. Maternal toxicity was expressed in paralysis of the hindlimbs in the two lowest dose groups. Maternal mortality was between 16.7 and 23.3% at the three dose levels. Phocomelia and hernia cerebri occurred as characteristic fetal developmental anomalies in all the treated groups. It is concluded that the joint administration of lead acetate and a mancozeb-containing fungicide can cause maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity and characteristic teratogenic effects.",

Thyroid gland and liver weights were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in both groups fed 00-RPM than in the group fed SM. The epithelium of the thyroid gland was cuboidal or columnar and the follicular area was moderately enlarged in pigs fed 00-RPM. Marked changes in liver histology were not observed. The 00-RPM diet increased (P &lt; 0.01) the serum values of total proteins in the first fattening period. At the end of fattening both groups fed 00-RPM had higher (P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.01) concentrations of plasma glucose than the control group. The inclusion of 10% of 00-RPM during the finishing period increased (P &lt; 0.05) the serum values of insulin. Daily weight gain during the growing and the finishing period was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the experimental groups than in the control group. The results suggest that 6-10% 00-RPM can be used as a protein source in the diet of fattening pigs without poisonous side effects.",

    "abstract": "Besides the well-known O157:H7 clone causing enterohaemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome in Europe, Japan and North America, the number of Escherichia coli isolates with non-motile (NM) phenotype has considerably increased. We supposed that spontaneous antibiotic resistance mutation could cause this phenotypic change. To model our hypothesis we isolated rifampicin- (Rif) and ampicillin- (Amp) resistant mutants from E. coli O157:H7 prototype strains 7785 and EDL933. Among Rif r mutants we could isolate strains with no or reduced motility, while the Amp r mutants became hypermotile. The biochemical profile of the mutants had not changed but phage sensitivity and generation time of the mutants were altered. Among the representative strains we did not find polymorphism with Southern blot analysis and no polymorphism was found in the fliC gene of the mutants. The described characteristics have proven to be stable. In a mice virulence assay by intravenous infections the virulence of the derivatives was also found to be changed. In summary, we found that the antibiotic-resistant phenotype in E. coli O157:H7 was coexpressed with several other phenotypic changes including motility and virulence. It can be assumed that expression of the involved phenotypes may be under the influence of a common regulatory cascade. Further work is needed to identify the components and mechanism of this regulatory system.",

    "abstract": "Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific POU-domain DNA binding factor, which binds to and trans-activates promoters of growth hormone- (GH), prolactin- (PRL) and thyroid stimulating hormone beta- (TSHβ) encoding genes. Pit-1 has been identified in several mammalian and avian species. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is located in the hypothalamus and it stimulates TSH, GH and PRL release from the pituitary gland. In the present study, we successfully developed a competitive RT-PCR for the detection of Pit-1 expression in the chicken pituitary, that was sensitive enough to detect picogram levels of Pit-1 mRNA. Applying this method, the effect of TRH injections on Pit-1 mRNA expression was determined in the pituitary of chick embryos and growing chicks. In both 18-day-old embryos and 10-day-old male chicks the Pit-1 mRNA expression was significantly increased following TRH injection, thereby indicating that the stimulatory effects of TRH on several pituitary hormones is mediated via its effect on Pit-1 expression. Therefore, a semi-quantitative RT-PCR method was used to detect possible changes in GH levels. TRH affected the GH mRNA levels at both developmental stages. These results, combined with the data on Pit-1 mRNA expression, indicate that Pit-1 has a role in mediating the stimulatory effects of TRH on pituitary hormones like GH.",

Cerebella of CDV-infected dogs showed nonsuppurative demyelinating encephalomyelitis, classified as acute, subacute or chronic. Immunolocalisation of CDV antigen also confirmed the infection. Tissues were examined for co-localisation of the CDV antigen with either an astrocyte-specific marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or an oligodendrocyte-specific marker, galactocerebroside (GalC). Immunoreactive cells were counted in demyelinating areas of the white matter. The number of astrocytes (GFAP positive) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in CDV-infected dogs compared to controls. In contrast, the number of oligodendrocytes (GalC positive) was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) lower in CDV-infected dogs and was much lower in chronic cases (p &lt; 0.05). Approximately 41% of astrocytes and 17% of oligodendrocytes were immunoreactive for CDV. The ratio of CDV-infected oligodendrocytes and astrocytes remained almost constant during the progression of the disease (P ≯ 0.05). In conclusion, CDV infects both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The gradual loss of oligodendrocytes is most likely responsible for the progressive demyelination in CDV infection. Astrocytosis in CDV infection should be further investigated if it occurs to stimulate oligodendrocytes for myelin production to compensate for the loss or to induce oligodendrocyte degeneration.",

Aujeszky's disease free status was successfully achieved on a farrow-to-finish type farm characterised by three difficulties interfering with the success of eradication: (i) weaned (30-day-old) piglets remained in the farrowing house until 65 days of age; (ii) the farm did not use nursery rearing; (iii) fatteners were kept together with the breeding gilts. Thus, the immunisation programme had to be adjusted to the management technology used on the farm, and by regular serological monitoring it had to be periodically modified to make it suitable for attaining the goals. This meant that breeding animal candidates of a wide age range and kept in the same air space had to be provided with a continuously high-level immunity by regular vaccination sufficient even for rectifying potential human errors. The immunisation programme was designed by taking into consideration the disappearance of maternal immunity, and a strict vaccination programme was applied during the rearing of breeding gilts kept together with the fattening pigs. Frequent immunisation applied during the rearing of the own breeding animal replacements proved to be of decisive importance for the eradication of Aujeszky's disease from the entire herd. In addition to the accurate implementation of the vaccination programme, regular serological monitoring also made a major contribution to the success of eradication.",

The individual oils were incubated in nylon bags in the rumen on perlite carrier (40% oil, 60% carrier) over a period of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h for all treatments. During the incubation of each oil primarily the formation of the cis-9, trans-11 isomer of CLA could be observed. Both sunflower and soybean oils showed similar changes in the rumen. After the incubation of these two vegetable oils the proportion of linoleic acid decreased significantly as the duration of incubation increased in the rumen. These changes were accompanied by a significant increase in the amount of cis-9, trans-11 CLA. However, in the case of sunflower oil the rate of formation of the cis-9, trans-11 CLA isomer was significantly higher after the different incubation times as compared to soybean oil. Much lower amounts of CLA were formed when fish oil was incubated in the rumen. The level of cis-9, trans-11 isomer produced during these treatments was 10% less than the amount obtained with the other two oils of vegetable origin. Besides the cis-9, trans-11isomer, trans-10, cis-12 CLA could also be detected during the incubation of the different oils in the rumen. However, the level of this isomer was low and did not show consistent differences among the treatments. The results of this experiment indicate that the fatty acid composition of the oils and the duration of incubation collectively determine the amount of CLA produced in the first compartment of the forestomach of ruminants.",

VN tests, however, are labour-intensive and time-consuming, require tissue culture facilities, and generally do not provide same-day results. In this study, a protocol for the high-level expression and purification of recombinant virion protein 1 (rVP1) was established using metal-chelate affinity chromatography under denaturing condition. When used as a coating antigen in a prototype enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), denatured rVP1 was recognised by ERBV1 antibody present in horse serum.

A luteolytic dose of prostaglandin was administered to each mare one day after the end of MGA treatment. The presence and duration of oestrus, follicular growth, uterine oedema and presence of ovulation were monitored by ultrasonography and the cervical tone was evaluated by rectal palpation. Ovulation was detected in 87.5% of the mares treated with 150 mg MGA/mare/day for 10 days, and in 62.5% of the mares receiving 100 mg MGA/mare/day for 10 days. This was statistically different (P = 0.03) from the untreated control mares having an ovulation rate of 20%. Mares that received 150 mg MGA/day for 10 days had a mean treatment to ovulation interval of 13.1 ± 5.97 days after the end of treatment, while mares that received 100 mg MGA/day for 10 days had a mean of 25.6 ± 10.50 days (P = 0.01) to ovulation.

The prevalence of Q fever is highly variable by country. The main reservoirs of the disease are the same domestic ruminant species everywhere, but the epidemiological profile depends on the features of the specific reservoir. The aim of this large-scale study was to demonstrate the importance of Q fever in different species as a possible source for human infection in most regions of Hungary. A total of 851 serum samples from 44 dairy farms, 16 sheep flocks, 4 goat farms and 3 zoos located in different parts of Hungary were tested. The presence of antibodies to Coxiella burnetii was surveyed in dairy cattle ( n = 547), goats ( n = 71), sheep ( n = 200) and zoo animals ( n = 33). The animal species tested in Hungary showed different seroprevalence values of C. burnetii infection. Seropositivity by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was found in 258 out of 547 (47.2%) cows and in 69 out of 271 (25.5%) small ruminants, among them in 47 out of 200 (23.5%) sheep and in 22 out of 71 (31.0%) goats. Antibodies to C. burnetii were not detected in zoo animals. Seropositivity was demonstrated in 44 out of 44 (100%) dairy cattle farms, with at least one serum sample found to be positive on each farm.

    "abstract": "Abstract The control of Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection relies mainly on antimicrobial therapy. However, the antibiotic susceptibility testing of the bacteria is usually not performed before applying the treatment, and thus therapeutic failures are not uncommon. In the case of M. hyorhinis , several antibiotic-resistance-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known but assays for their detection have not been described yet. The aims of the present study were to investigate macrolide- and lincomycin-resistance-related SNPs in Hungarian M. hyorhinis isolates and to develop mismatch amplification mutation assays (MAMA) to detect the identified resistance markers. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of different drugs and whole genome sequences of 37 M. hyorhinis isolates were used to find the resistance-related mutations. One MAMA assay was designed to detect the mutation of the 23S rRNA gene at nucleotide position 2058 ( Escherichia coli numbering). For further evaluation, the assay was challenged with 17 additional isolates with available MIC data and 15 DNA samples from clinical specimens. The genotypes of the samples were in line with the MIC test results. The developed assay supports the practice of targeted antibiotic usage; hence it may indirectly reduce some bacterial resistance-related public health concerns.",

Five-year medical records from cats presenting to the internal medicine unit of a veterinary teaching hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Cats were considered for inclusion based on complete medical records. ADVIA 120 was used for the complete blood counts; the NLR and LMR were calculated by dividing the absolute numbers of the respective leucocytes. Two hundred and nineteen sick and 20 healthy cats were included in the study. The median NLR and LMR were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated and decreased, respectively, in cats with infectious, neoplastic and chronic kidney diseases compared to controls. Additionally, cats with neoplasia had significantly higher median NLR compared to cats with urinary tract and gastrointestinal diseases. Non-survivors had significantly higher NLR and lower LMR compared to survivors. Both ratios had suboptimal prognostic performance for the outcome of sick cats (NLR sensitivity: 37.9%, specificity: 86.4%; LMR sensitivity: 69.0%, specificity: 61.0%). Many different disease categories were associated with increased NLR and decreased LMR compared to controls, but the overall prognostic performance of the two leucocyte ratios was suboptimal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, the prevalence of Avian orthoavulavirus-1 (AOAV-1) (also commonly known as Newcastle disease virus) was investigated in caged birds kept in bird markets in the Lahore district of Pakistan. A total of 354 swab samples were obtained from 14 different species of clinically healthy birds. The overall virus prevalence was 12.7% in 9 out of the 14 species. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete fusion protein (F) gene showed that 23 isolates from different avian species belonged to sub-genotype VII.2 while three isolates of pigeon origin clustered with sub-genotype XXI.1.2. The VII.2 viruses isolated had a high nucleotide identity to viruses repeatedly isolated from poultry in Pakistan from 2011 to 2018. To date, sub-genotype XXI.1.2 viruses have only been identified in Pakistan. These findings suggest that the Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks occurring in Pakistan involve multiple hosts and environments. The study emphasises the importance of continuing to monitor multiple avian species for the presence of AOAV-1s and implementing effective ND control strategies.",

The objective of our study was to vitrify Day-3 cleavage stage mouse embryos (n = 229) with the cryoloop technology using a new composition of vitrification media. Embryos were exposed to a 2-step loading of CPA, ethylene glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG), before being placed on the surface of a thin filmy layer formed from the vitrification solution in a small nylon loop, then they were rapidly submerged into liquid nitrogen. After warming, the CPA was diluted out from the embryos by a 3-step procedure. Survival of embryos was based on morphological appearance after thawing and continued development to expanded blastocysts upon subsequent 48-hour culture. Embryos of the two control groups were either treated likewise except that they were not vitrified, or cultured in vitro without any treatment. Our data show that a high percentage of embryos survived (92.7%) vitrification in the mixture of EG and PG combined with cryoloop carrier and developed normally (89.1%) in vitro after thawing. To our knowledge this is the first report of the successful vitrification of cleavage stage mouse embryos using VitroLoop vitrification procedure.",

    "abstract": "The influence of passage time of the transfer gun through the uterine cervix and body to the embryo insertion site on pregnancy rate was analysed in 248 recipient heifers (mean age: 15-17 months). Embryos (90 fresh and/or 88 and 70 frozen in glycerol and ethylene glycol, respectively, grades 4 and 5, stage 1 or 2) were transferred to the ipsilateral uterine horn on day 7. Two different transfer guns were used in this experiment: a sterilisable steel transfer instrument to be used without sheaths with a removable tip made of gold-plated stainless steel (Wörrlein Minitüb) or a transfer stylet with sheaths with a metal tip and a side opening (Cassou gun, IMV Technologies). The time of passage of the instruments through the uterine cervix and body to the site of embryo deposition in the uterine horn was measured in the study. In order to randomise the risk of errors, all manipulations were carried out by the same experienced operator. The average time needed for the insertion of embryos into the uterus was 50.6 seconds (s) and it was longer for the transfer gun with sheaths than for the metal-tipped transfer gun (60.1 and 40.8 s, respectively) (P < 0.001). The average conception rate was 45.6%. If the time needed to insert embryos into the uterus was 10-60 s, the conception rate was 53.4% (up to 20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50 and 51-60 s - 57.7, 52.5, 50, 51.5 and 50%, respectively). In contrast, if the time needed to insert the embryo in the uterine horn was longer than 60 s, the conception rate was 20.4% (61-80, 80.1-120 and > 120 s - 28.0, 6.0 and 24.9%, respectively). Thus, it cannot be excluded that the type of the applied transfer gun may influence pregnancy rate in recipient cows due to its effect on cervical passage time.",

Thirty-one dogs with clinically and echocardiographically proven cardiac diseases were randomly selected. The left atrial right-to-left diameter ( La r−l ) and the diameter of the left atrium just above the mitral annulus ( La ama ) as well as the ratio of left atrial to aortic diameter ( La/Ao ) were measured by 2DE. The La r−l / La ama ratio was independent of body weight (R 2 = 0.0006) and age (R 2 = 0.0012), respectively. A significant linear relationship was found between La ama and La/Ao (the ratio that expresses the severity of atrial enlargement): La ama = 1.2238 La/Ao + 1.1608 (R 2 = 021; P &lt; 0.01). There was also a positive linear relationship between La r−l and La/Ao : La r−l = 1.6876 La/Ao + 1.2648 (R 2 = 0.27; P &lt; 0.005). In our dogs with cardiac disease, the La r−l / La ama ratio showed no significant relation to the La/Ao index (R 2 = 0.028). Thus, La r−l / La ama proved to be independent of the severity of atrial enlargement. Based on the strong relationship stated in the equation between La ama and La r−l [ La r−l / La ama = 1.31159 (95% confidence interval)], La ama can also be used for the assessment of left atrial size even in dogs with cardiac disease.",

Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors [nonselective: L-NAME and inducible NOS (iNOS) selective: 1400W] were used to determine the source of NO. Spin-trap only and untreated mice were included as controls. Within 2.5 hours (h) of a single oral inoculation with E. coli half of the animals had increased NO levels in all investigated organs. Thereafter the signals dropped before increasing again to reach maximal median values by 25 h in all organs of all inoculated mice. The most intense response occurred in livers, followed by aorta and lungs. Early (2.5 h) inhibition of the signal was achieved using both NOS inhibitors. L-NAME was also effective at 25 h, while 1400W-treated mice had increased NO levels beyond 7 h. The generalised increase in NO production in the short and longer term indicates a host response to E. coli administered by the oral route of infection.",

    "abstract": "Dermacentor reticulatus is a tick species of high medical and veterinary importance, emerging in several parts of Europe. Up to now most studies focusing on zoonotic rickettsiae in D. reticulatus were based on ticks collected in a limited part of the questing period, and did not take into account the potential seasonal variations in the rate of infection with tick-borne rickettsiae. The aim of the present study was to investigate the latter phenomenon, i.e. to screen D. reticulatus adults, collected monthly in two urban habitats of Budapest, for the presence of three zoonotic Rickettsia spp. Altogether 852 D. reticulatus adults were collected, which showed significantly similar seasonal activity in the two evaluated habitats. Among the 413 molecularly analysed ticks, R. helvetica-infected D. reticulatus were only collected during autumn in habitat-1, in contrast to habitat-2. The overall prevalence of R. raoultii in D. reticulatus adults was significantly higher in habitat-1 than in habitat-2. In addition, the seasonal distribution of R. raoultii-infected ticks was different between the two habitats (in habitat-2 significantly more R. raoultii-infected ticks were collected in the autumn, in comparison with winter and spring). Rickettsia slovaca was not detected in any of the molecularly analysed ticks. The results clearly indicate that a single-time or seasonally biased collection of D. reticulatus adults and their subsequent molecular analysis may not be informative on the real prevalence of rickettsiae. This is because the availability/ activity of infected ticks shows significant seasonal fluctuations, both within and between habitats. Instead, for screening D. reticulatus-borne rickettsiae, it is important to collect monthly samples and then to assess seasonal prevalence and actual habitat-associated eco-epidemiological risks.",

In the nursery units, H. nana eggs were detected in 10.5% of the tested mice by the flotation and in 24.6% by the sedimentation method. A colony of mice was treated against the tapeworm H. nana with praziquantel and emodepside in doses of 2.574 mg praziquantel/100 g body mass and of 0.642 mg emodepside/100 g body mass. The content of the original pipettes (Profender ® ) was applied as a spot-on on the back of the neck in the area between the shoulders. The application was repeated three times at 14-day intervals. Seven days after the third therapy no H. nana was found in any of the tested mice in the reproductive or the nursery units. After the treatment, cannibalism was no longer observed. This treatment represented one of the steps aimed at improving animal welfare and preventing potential zoonotic disease.

In this model, 36 piglets were equally assigned to a negative control, a positive control, and two trial groups receiving tulathromycin 7 or 4 days prior to challenge. The piglets of three groups were challenged intratracheally with H. parasuis serovar 5. As a result, four pigs in each challenged group died or had to be euthanised within 10 days post challenge. The remaining 15 pigs of these challenged groups survived until termination of the experiment (days 14-15). All pigs were necropsied and collective swabs of serosal surfaces were tested by bacterial culture and PCR. Samples of tarsal synovial fluid and joint capsule, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain swabs were tested by PCR. A total of 22 out of the 27 challenged animals had macroscopically detectable polyserositis and all of them tested positive in the collective swab samples. Haemophilus parasuis was more frequently detected in pigs that died within the first 10 days compared to those surviving until days 14-15 (P < 0.001), and those that succumbed within 10 days showed higher positivity rates in the brain and CSF. All pigs which were positive in the CSF had detectable meningitis. At days 14-15, joint samples from 5 of the remaining 15 pigs tested positive for H. parasuis. Four of these five animals did not show any macroscopic or histological lesions in the joints. In conclusion, collective swabs were the best sample material in acute cases, whereas samples from the joints gave the best results in chronic cases.

Positive expression was demonstrated for all examined antigens, but their level of expression differed depending on the grades of tumour malignancy. Statistical analysis of the results documented a pronounced positive correlation between the markers studied and the grade of tumour malignancy (P < 0.001). It was shown that each of the cell markers examined represents a useful prognostic indicator for patients with mast cell tumours. The calculated correlation coefficients demonstrate a strong association between the expressions of CD117, FVIII and p16, and the histological malignancy of a tumour.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to compare Coxiella burnetii antibody dynamics in heifers born to vaccinated or non-vaccinated dams in a single high-producing dairy herd chronically infected with the bacterium. Antibody dynamics were examined from birth to the postpartum period in replacement heifers (n = 14) born to non-vaccinated dams (n = 7) or to dams that had been vaccinated on gestation days 171–177 (n = 7) and 192–198. Samples of blood, milk, faeces, vaginal fluid, colostrum and cotyledons (the latter two only at parturition) were obtained in the dams over the period from gestation days 171–177 to postpartum days 91–97. Blood samples were used to detect antibodies against C. burnetii and remaining samples for PCR identification of the bacterium. In their calves/heifers, blood samples for antibody determinations were collected from birth to postpartum at the time points 1–7 and 22–28 days and 3, 6 and 12 months of age; 90–96 and 210–216 days of gestation; and 22–28 days postpartum. All calves were born seronegative for C. burnetii . Irrespective of the shedding status of their mothers (7 were C. burnetii shedders), seroconversion occurred after colostrum intake in all calves born to seropositive cows (n = 9) and in two of three vaccinated seronegative dams. Thereafter antibody titres gradually declined and by 6 months of age all calves were seronegative. Seronegativity persisted until their first postpartum period. These findings indicate that cows vaccinated during advanced pregnancy transfer immunity to their calves via the colostrum. Maternal C. burnetii antibodies in calves persisted for three months in calves born both to seronegative vaccinated and seropositive dams.",

Nectin-4 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry. By microscopy, tubular, papillary, and mixed patterns of ENA were diagnosed in the cases. Immunohistochemically, the tumours showed moderate nectin-4 expression (++) in 14 cases (58.3%), strong expression (+++) in five cases (20.8%), and weak expression (+) in three cases (12.5%), while two cases (8.3%) were negative.

The leakage of the chemotherapeutic agent may result in soft tissue damage leading to ulceration and necrosis. Studies have shown that platelet-rich plasma consists of growth factors and cytokines, thus plays a crucial role in wound healing. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of autologous platelet-rich plasma and antimicrobial wound dressing for the treatment of VS extravasation-related acute full-thickness skin wounds. A male Aksaray Malakli shepherd dog (3 years old) was brought to our clinic with a wound on the left forelimb which appeared two days after intravenous injection of VS. Extravasation was suspected. A total of 3.5 mL autologous platelet-rich plasma was injected into the wound margins and an antimicrobial dressing containing chlorhexidine acetate was used weekly to close the wound. The wound healed without any complications in 6 weeks. It was concluded that autologous platelet-rich plasma treatment is a simple and cost-effective method for the treatment of VS extravasation-related acute full-thickness skin wounds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to estimate the occurrence of bacterial infection and contamination in two ostrich-producing farms. Compared to other poultry species, the hatchability of ostrich eggs is especially low. In a quest to identify factors that may affect hatchability, we collected faecal samples from adult birds, as well as eggs with dead-in-shell embryos, dead chicks and swab samples from the surface of the eggs and from the environment. The samples were screened for the presence of bacteria by routine bacteriological culture methods. The most prevalent bacteria, detected in the samples, were Escherichia coli, Bacillus spp. and coliform bacteria, whereas Pseudomonas spp. were less frequently found. The intensity and species compositon of the bacterial contamination was comparable in the two farms. Our results revealed that the bacteria, present in the environment, may likely be transmitted to the surface of the eggs. If they are able to penetrate the shell then the embryos and chicks become infected easily. These findings draw the attention to the special importance of enforcing efficient decontamination and disinfection measures to keep the environment and egg surface free from germs. Besides the appropriate egg treatment procedure, the incubation and hatching technology should also be kept under control.",

    "abstract": "A 16-year-old castrated male Persian cat was presented with weight loss, anorexia and dyspnoea. Tachycardia and tachypnoea were observed upon presentation. The cat was previously diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and left ventricular hypertrophy and received methimazole, but was subsequently not followed up and treated appropriately. Thoracic radiography revealed mild pleural effusion, interstitial lung pattern, moderate cardiomegaly and moderate-to-severe dilation of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein. On echocardiography, the left ventricular hypertrophy, identified earlier, shoed partial regression. Therefore, the previous myocardial hypertrophy was diagnosed as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype related to hyperthyroidism. ST-segment elevation was identified on electrocardiography, and the thyroid profile examination revealed increased total thyroxine and free thyroxine and decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, suggesting myocardial injury and uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, respectively. In addition, normal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high cardiac troponin I levels were found. Based on these findings, the observed congestive heart failure was considered as a sequel of myocardial injury caused by uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. Clinical signs resolved after intravenous administration of furosemide and butorphanol, oxygen supply and thoracocentesis. Furosemide and pimobendan were additionally administered, and the cat was discharged. This case demonstrates that myocardial damage due to chronic uncontrolled hyperthyroidism may cause heart failure in cats.",

After quality control, the average length of sRNA of camel milk exosomes was 18-24 nucleotides. A total of 2,659 miRNAs were identified, including 2,458 known, and 201 new miRNAs. Among the known miRNAs, miR-148a and let-7i had the highest expression levels. The results of gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that the target genes of camel milk exosome miRNAs were involved in multicellular organismal, catabolic and other biological processes. They play role in the extracellular region, in the cytoskeleton and other cell components, in protein binding, but also have structural molecule activity and other molecular functions. According to the results of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis, the target genes of camel milk exosome miRNAs are involved in Alzheimer's disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Staphylococcus aureus infection and other pathological pathways. We speculate that the reported beneficial effect of camel milk in various pathologic conditions may be closely related to the regulatory function of the exosomal miRNAs exerted on target genes of the diseases.",

    "abstract": "An experiment was carried out with young male New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits to establish live body weight changes, body measurements, body composition and sexual maturity as a function of feeding intensity. Animals in Group 1 ('AL', n = 10) were fed ad libitum , while those in Group 2 ('RS', n = 10) received restricted feeding corresponding to 70% of the ad libitum level. The starting liveweights were practically the same (0.907 ± 0.146 and 0.911 ± 0.147 kg in Group AL and Group RS, respectively). The feeding trial lasted from 6 to 22 weeks of age. The average body weight was significantly higher in Group AL from 7 to 22 weeks of age. At 22 weeks of age the body weight of RS rabbits was 85.64% of the weight of AL animals (3.22 ± 0.52 kg and 3.76 ± 0.33 kg, respectively). Average body weights of RS males at 8, 9, 11, 19 and 21 weeks of age were similar to those of ad libitum fed (AL) animals at 7, 8, 10, 15 and 16 weeks of age, respectively. The growth of bucks fed restricted tended to be allometric. The most significant difference was found at 16 and 18 weeks of age, while the lowest difference occurred at 6, 12, 15 and 19 weeks of age. It can be stated that low-intensity feeding up to slaughtering weight causes backwardness in rear cannon length and this backwardness remains also after the 15th week, which is well over the optimal slaughtering age. Based on the present data, the 70% restricted feeding cannot be recommended either for the future breeding bucks or for broiler males reared for slaughter. To determine the major chemical components of the body, rabbits were euthanised. Original dry matter and crude fat content of the body significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased under restricted feeding (41.42%; 32.48% and 16.73%; 7.35%) while the percentage of protein within the dry matter increased (49.6%; 65.0%) and fat decreased (40.17%; 22.1%) significantly. Libido unambiguously decreases as a consequence of feed deprivation. The most conspicuous difference was found in the level of blood testosterone. Although a few RS bucks produced semen but only much later than the rabbits fed ad libitum . On the other hand, there was no difference in the motility of spermatozoa and ejaculate volume in comparison with AL animals. There was no relationship between the body fat content and the reproductive status of bucks in the present trial.",

Use of donor interponates are common, but results are controversial because of necrosis or thrombosis after rejection. Reperfusion injury, hypoxia and free radical production determinate the survival. The aim of the study was to create an 'ideal' arterial interponate. Autologous, tubular graft lined with mesothelial cells, prepared from the posterior rectus fascia sheath, was used for iliac artery replacement in eight mongrel dogs for six months under immunosuppression. Patency rate was followed by Doppler ultrasound. Eight grafts remained patent and another two are patent after one year. The patency rate was good (median Doppler flow: 370 cm/sec) and there was no necrosis, thrombosis or aneurysmatic formation. The grafts showed viable morphology with neoangiogenesis, appearance of elastin, smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Electron microscopy showed intact mitochondrial structures without signs of hypoxia. Tissue oxygenation was good in all cases with normal (&lt; 30 ng/ml) myeloperoxidase production. In conclusion, this autologous graft presents good long-term patency rate. Viability, arterialisation and low thrombogenicity are prognostic factors indicating usability of the graft in the clinical practice without the risk of rejection. Further investigations such as cell cultures and standardisation are necessary.",

At days 4 and 10 the number of pigs positive to E2 antibodies was higher in the group that received the subunit vaccine and ORF virus than in pigs vaccinated with the subunit vaccine only. A higher percentage of memory cells (CD45RC + ) as well as T h and T c lymphocytes in pigs that received the ORF virus and the subunit vaccine could be ascribed to a nonspecific influence of the ORF virus on the development (through cognate interactions between T and B cells) and the duration (presumed according to the finding of the clonal expression of memory cells) of humoral immunity (assessed by a higher number of seropositive pigs in this group). This seems likely since the proportion of these cells was found to be lower in the pigs that received E2 vaccine only.",

Nitric oxide (NO) has an important mediating role against fungal, bacterial, protozoal, viral pathogens and tumours. BHV-1 induced apoptosis between 0.5-3 h postinfection (PI) in MDBK cells; however, between 3 and 6 h PI the PCD response was found to be decreased. It was interesting to see that BHV-I inhibited staurosporin-induced PCD after 1 h. These results showed similarities with those obtained from herpes simplex type I infections in human epithelial cells. PCD response decreased 1 h following caspase-3 inhibitor applications, whereas NO response increased 3 h following infection in the presence of caspase-8 and -9 inhibitory peptides. In conclusion, BHV-1 inhibited the staurosporin-induced apoptotic response and also the NO response. We propose that this inhibition is caspase-3 dependent.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic mortality is a significant problem plaguing the hatching success. Its early forms are especially hardly distinguishable from true infertility. Propidium iodide (PI) staining of the germinal disc combined with outer perivitelline layer (OPVL) sperm counting was used for the determination of 'true' fertility of duck eggs in two different experiments: fertility investigation on fresh, unincubated eggs of Hungarian ducks and on incubated eggs of a crossbred, selected as 'infertile' at the 7th day of incubation. Examination of the relationship between OPVL sperm count and fertility seems to be an adequate tool for checking the effectiveness of insemination programmes and the fertilising capacity of poultry spermatozoa. The proportion of fertile eggs was around 50% when the number of OPVL sperm was between 0.1 and 0.2 spermatozoa/mm 2 . Ninety-nine percent of the eggs containing ? 0.3 OPVL sperm/mm 2 were fertile and all of the eggs containing &lt; 0.05 sperm/mm 2 were infertile. To assure the accuracy of fertility prediction by OPVL sperm counting, PI staining of the germinal disc was used to determine fertility in uncertain cases. Identification of very early embryonic mortality, i.e. that occurring before oviposition, is very difficult. The use of a dissecting microscope for the assessment of real fertility is suitable in most of the cases, while PI staining of the germinal discs proved to be more reliable for detecting very early embryonic death. The combination of the two methods proved to be a useful tool for detecting the 'true' fertility of duck eggs of different breeds.",

Eight-cell embryos were obtained from superovulated female mice and divided into three experimental and one control group. Embryos from the experimental groups were cryopreserved by the vitrification method using ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant. The vitrification protocols used in the study differed in the rate of cooling of the cryoprotectant solution. Embryos from the first group were frozen in conventional 0.25-ml plastic straws, those from the second group in pipetting 'tips', and embryos from the third group, placed in vitrification solution, were introduced dropwise directly into liquid nitrogen. The control group of embryos was cultured in vitro without freezing in a culturing medium in an environment consisting of 95% air and 5% CO 2 . The developmental capacity of thawed embryos was assessed on the basis of their ability to leave the zona pellucida ('hatching') after three days of in vitro culturing. In the control group 95.1% of embryos 'hatched'. A significantly higher number of embryos that 'hatched' after thawing was observed in the group introduced dropwise directly into liquid nitrogen (60.0%) compared to the group frozen in pipetting 'tips' (37.9%). The group frozen in straws yielded significantly the lowest proportion of 'hatching' embryos (8.1%).

An autologous, tubular graft prepared from the posterior rectus fascia sheath was used for iliac artery replacement in dogs for 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Forty-one grafts were implanted and immunosuppression was used in separate groups. The patency rate was followed by Doppler ultrasound. Thirty-seven grafts remained patent, 2 cases with thrombosis and 2 cases with stenosis occurred. There was no evidence of necrosis or aneurysmatic formation. The histological analysis included conventional light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations for CD34 and factor VIII. The explanted grafts showed signs of arterialisation, appearance of elastin fibres, and smooth muscle cells after 6 months. Electron microscopy showed intact mitochondrial structures without signs of hypoxia. In conclusion, the autologous graft presents acceptable long-term patency rate. It is easy to handle and the concept of beneficial presence of the anti-clot mesothelium until endothelialisation seems to work.

Three-mm-long arterial segments collected during the luteal phase of the oestrous cycle were mounted in an organ bath for isometric tension recording. After 30 min of equilibration in optimal passive tone, one part of the vessels was treated with 10 ng/ml of LH in PBS (experimental), while a second part of the arterial segments was treated with 10 ng/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (control). After 30 min of equilibration, NE was given to each organ bath in a cumulative concentration manner, ranging between 1 x 10(-8) mol/l to 3 x 10(-4) mol/l. NE caused a dose-dependent contraction of all experimental and control arteries. The addition of LH caused a rightward shift of the dose-response curve to NE. The corresponding EC50 values were 2.17 (+/- 0.39) micromol/l in PBS-pretreated vessels and 3.35 (+/- 0.41) micromol/l in LH-pretreated vessels (P < 0.05). The results of the present study demonstrate that LH attenuates the vascular response to NE in third-order branches of the uterine artery. Therefore, it can be suggested that besides the known effect of LH-hCG on the formation of vasoactive eicosanoids, an additional mechanism is involved in the direct action of LH on blood flow in the uterine arteries in pigs.",

Although the risks of exposure to exogenous oestrogens (ExEs) are subject to scientific debate, the question of how ExE exposure affects the central nervous system remains to be answered. We attempt to summarise the mechanisms of oestrogenic effects in the central nervous tissue with the purpose to highlight the avenues potentially used by ExEs. The genomic and rapid, non-genomic cellular pathways activated by oestrogen are listed and discussed together with the best known interneuronal mechanisms of oestrogenic effects. Because the effects of oestrogen on the brain seem to be age dependent, we also found it necessary to put the age-dependent oestrogenic effects in parallel to their intra- and intercellular mechanisms of action. Finally, considering the practical risks of human ExE exposure, we briefly discuss the human significance of this matter. We believe this short review of the topic became necessary because recent data suggest new fields and pathways for endogenous oestrogen actions and have generated the concern that the hidden exposure of humans and domestic animal species to ExEs may also exert its beneficial and/or adverse effects through these avenues.",

    "abstract": "The early detection of pregnancy and the determination of fetal numbers have economic benefits in sheep production because of the seasonal breeding patterns where missing a breeding opportunity means the loss of one productive year. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the B6-HRP ELISA for ovine pregnancy-specific protein B (oPSPB) measurement in the detection of pregnancy and estimation of fetal numbers in different sheep breeds. BioPRYN® ELISA assay kit was used for the detection of pregnancy in the experimental animals. Ninety-three ewes of three breeds (British Milksheep - BM, Lacaune - L and Transylvanian Racka - TR), each from three farms in Hungary, were included in the study. BM and L ewes were artificially inseminated (AI). Thirty-five days after AI, all ewes were examined by transabdominal ultrasound. The TR flock was mated naturally over a six-week period. At the end of the mating period, the ewes were similarly examined by ultrasound. Blood samples were taken from all pregnant ewes twice (35 and 65 days after AI), and serum samples were assayed by the BioPRYN test. It can be concluded that the detection of serum PSPB by ELISA is a much easier, safer, less expensive and highly accurate method for the detection of ovine pregnancy. Although some breed-related differences were detectable at 35 and 65 days post breeding, no differences in oPSPB levels were found in pregnant ewes carrying different numbers of fetuses.",

Animals in the treated group received cyfluthrin three times, on days 0, 28 and 56 of the experiment. Hair samples were collected from all cows on days 0, 21, 42, 63, and 84 of the experiment for the determination of cortisol and corticosterone concentrations using immunoassays. The respective hair cortisol concentrations in the treated group averaged 209.78, 165.10, 260.78, 177.44 and 183.11 ng/g, while in the non-treated group hair cortisol concentrations averaged 172.58, 243.58, 309.73, 199.75 and 207.09 ng/g. These results indicate that the control of ectoparasites reduced hair cortisol levels in dairy cows. The respective hair corticosterone concentrations in the treated group averaged 19.06, 22.95, 21.95, 21.60 and 24.84 ng/g and in the non-treated group the hair corticosterone concentrations averaged 17.28, 21.94, 34.05, 26.27 and 26.91 ng/g. The results suggest that longterm stress can be estimated better by the determination of hair cortisol rather than corticosterone concentrations.",

    "abstract": "While testing for uterine bacterial infection is usually performed prior to artificial insemination (AI), samples taken during or after embryo flushing are generally not assessed either in subfertile and old mares or in fertile mares, even though knowledge of the status of the uterine environment in which the embryo is to develop would help to predict the outcome of embryo transfer programmes. The presence of bacteria and inflammatory cells in the liquid retained in the filter after uterine flushing in donors was determined at the moment of embryo recovery. Primarily, a group of mares (n = 8) displaying evident clinical signs of endometritis was selected to evaluate the cytological and bacteriological findings in filters after uterine flushing and in uterine cotton swabs. Two uterine samples (for cytological and bacterial evaluation) were taken with cotton swabs and, subsequently, the uterus was flushed and the efflux was also subjected to bacteriological and cytological analysis. Later, a group of donors (n = 20) was also involved to evaluate the presence of bacteria and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). After embryo flushing and collection, the efflux retained in the filter was evaluated by cytology and bacteriology. A sterile cotton swab was then scrubbed on the filter mesh, and a bacterial culture was performed. The embryo recovery rate was 30% (n = 6); Escherichia coli was isolated in one efflux sample collected from embryo-productive flushings, while the other five samples were negative by culture. Bacterial growth (not considered as contamination) was observed in a total of three samples, although no inflammatory cells were detected. Bacteria were isolated in endometrial samples collected after embryo flushing in donor mares, although inflammatory cells were never present in the uterus of mares from which embryos were recovered. In the absence of clinical signs, cytological and/or bacteriological samplings are not very useful for estimating the success of embryo recovery in donor mares, but evaluation of the filter and efflux after uterine flushing in donors may provide valuable information regarding uterine status at embryo collection.",

The aim of this study was to establish non-invasive methods for ECG sample collection in different species of non-anaesthetised chelonians, focusing on adhesive and clamp electrodes. A total of 72 turtles and tortoises from 20 species and various sizes were used for the study. Body weight ranged from 32 g to 65 kg. From the aspect of specimen fixation, dorsal recumbency proved to be the most useful. Both adhesive and clamp electrodes yielded results when applied to the plastron and skin folds. Pre-emptive results suggest an indirect correlation with plastron thickness, the presence of a hinge, habitat and measurable ECG wave amplitude. ECG wave recordings are more likely in aquatic chelonians and species with a hinge. With size the plastron also thickens, making wave detection impossible. ECG waves were detected in 41 of the 72 specimens, complete PQRST complexes in 19 animals, with the rest showing absent P waves in all leads. ECG amplitudes were below 1 mV, with an average of 0.15 mV R wave amplitude.",

    "abstract": "Additional geographical distribution of the Central European populations of Schistosoma turkestanicum and the detectability of their eggs in droppings were investigated in red deer samples, because this rare species had previously been shown only in a single Hungarian habitat. Samples from visceral organs, intestinal contents, and droppings on the ground from 11 hunting areas of Hungary were investigated to find a new presence of this fluke. Close to the first site of detection in the Gemenc forest another habitat along the southern border of the country was found where the parasite lives in red deer. Therefore, it is possible that the worm also occurs in neighbouring Serbia or Croatia. Schistosoma turkestanicum causes a low-intensity infection in red deer and this host sheds low amounts of eggs, therefore the eggs are difficult to detect. Droppings were cleared by sedimentation, filtered by sieve screening and then the eggs were flotated using solutions with an increasing density of 1200 g/L, 1300 g/L, 1350 g/L, and 1400 g/L while they were being stained red with acid fuchsin. Eggs in fresh faeces can be most efficiently separated from plant fibres using a flotation solution of 1350 g/L density, but in some cases eggs in old dung can be detected using a solution of a specific gravity lower or higher than that. By combining the advantages of the three concentration processes, eggs of S. turkestanicum , which are more recognisable by the red stain, can be found in samples in which they are present at a density lower than 1/g.",

The test substances were given to the chickens in the recommended dose or in tenfold dose. The administration of 5 mg/kg body weight (bw) β-glucan and 0.1 ml/kg bw DWA for five days decreased the relative gene expression of CYP1A4 and CYP2C23a.

Avoidance of CYP1A-mediated feed-drug interactions requires accurate dosing of β-glucan, DWA and fulvic acid. According to our results, no treatment resulted in excessive or less CYP2C and CYP3A protein formation, which reduces the risk of potential feed additive-drug interactions in chickens. However, the administration of feed additive SN containing a plant alkaloid should be avoided concomitantly with CYP1A-metabolised medicines.",

The animals from the first locality that was situated in a tourist area, were collected for four consecutive years (2014–2017). We found persistent incidence of infection from year to year ranging from 6.67% to 78.57%. The average frequency of infected animals was 33.3% with the highest frequency in 2014, the year characterised by a very high number of flooding days. All animals proved to be infected with pathogenic Leptospira species that were collected from the second locality situated in an agricultural area in a single year, 2014. The findings show a variable but constant presence of pathogenic Leptospira species in populations of small wild mammals in the studied areas, which indicates the need for constant monitoring.",

Seven pregnant mares aborted and 74 foals were born. Out of the 22 mares inseminated with frozen semen, 17 mares got pregnant.

The comparison of medians for the number of insemination cycles did not show significant differences. However, a significant difference (Kruskal–Wallis test, P = 0.014) was found in the number of the inseminations per conception in favour of frozen semen (2.5 vs. 1.8 with fresh chilled and frozen semen, respectively). The Cox regression revealed that the type of semen has a significant impact ( P &lt; 0.001) on the service period (duration of the insemination period): the use of frozen semen prolonged the insemination period. This could be due to management issues, since re-insemination with frozen semen took place after only one/a few missed oestrous cycles not used for AI.",

One dog had moderate and two dogs had severe congenital hydrocephalus, one was presented with intracranial pressure elevation due to meningoencephalitis of unknown origin (MUO) associated with congenital hydrocephalus, and two with quadrigeminal cysts (QC). VPS procedures were done in four and CPS in two dogs, using low-pressure valve systems. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 6 months and control MRI scans were also made. Significant improvement was detected in five cases during the short-term follow-up period (1 month) and in four cases in the medium-term follow-up (2–6 months). Major complications were found in two cases: one dog with acute-hypertensive hydrocephalus died one week after surgery, and in another case development of a chronic subdural haematoma and hygroma caused death 3 months after the surgery. Minor complications (e.g. subdural hygroma) were found in two cases. In cases of severe hydrocephalus a higher-pressure valve system is recommended in order to prevent subdural hygroma. In cases of intracranial cyst a low-pressure valve is used because the cyst is an altered area inside the skull and its complete reduction is recommended. Transient postoperative clinical signs usually resolve within one week after the surgery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic arbovirus transmitted by mosquitoes between wild birds (natural hosts) and other vertebrates. Horses and humans are incidental, dead-end hosts, but can develop severe neurological disorders. Owing to the close contact of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with the extracellular fluid of the brain, the analysis of CSF composition can reflect central nervous system (CNS) impairments enabling the diagnosis and understanding of various neurodegenerative CNS disorders. Our objective was to compare the findings from the CSF samples of horses with neuroinvasive WNV infection with those of healthy controls. We compared findings from fifteen CSF samples of 13 horses with acute WNV encephalomyelitis with those of 20 healthy controls. Protein, particular enzymes and ions, glucose and lactate showed abnormal levels in a significant number of WNV cases. None of the six horses with elevated glucose concentrations survived. Rather neutrophilic than mononuclear pleocytosis was identified with WNV infection. Neutrophils probably play a role in the development of inflammatory response and brain damage. Although elevated glucose levels reliably predicted the outcome, they might be the consequence of increased plasma levels and reflect general stress rather than CNS pathophysiology. The CSF findings of WNV encephalomyelitis patients are non-specific and variable but facilitate the differential diagnosis.",

Earlier, based on the phylogenetic analysis of the sequence of a PCR-amplified fragment from the DNA polymerase gene, the pygmy marmoset AdV (PMAdV) has been reported to cluster closest to certain chiropteran AdVs. In the following years similar AdVs were discovered in additional mammalian hosts, including a skunk ( Mephitis mephitis ), African pygmy hedgehogs ( Atelerix albiventris ), North American porcupines ( Erethizon dorsatum ) and grey fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ). After the full genome analysis of the skunk adenovirus (SkAdV-1), a novel species Skunk mastadenovirus A (SkAdV-A) has been established. The AdVs, originating from the African pygmy hedgehogs, have been found to belong to virus species SkAdV-A. Partial gene sequences from the porcupine AdVs have also implied their very close genetic relatedness to SkAdV-A. The complete genomic sequence of PMAdV, examined in this study, was found to share 99.83% nucleotide identity with SkAdV-1, thus unequivocally represents a genomic variant of SkAdV-1. The observation that viruses classifiable as SkAdV-A are able to infect and cause diseases in several, distantly related mammals seems to deserve further studies to elucidate the infection biology of this intriguing AdV.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The goal of this study was to evaluate the suitability of a commercially available D-dimer assay as a diagnostic tool for testing dogs. This assay is an immunoturbidimetric diagnostic test, capable of determining the D-dimer levels in human plasma by using 2B9 monoclonal antibody. Plasma samples of clinically healthy ( n = 20) and tumour-bearing ( n = 50) dogs were measured. The tumours were grouped on the basis of histological type and aggressiveness, and then the measured D-dimer concentrations of these groups were compared to those of the control group. The differences were analysed statistically. For benign tumours, we did not find alterations in the D-dimer levels. However, in the case of malignant tumours (lymphoma, sarcoma, and carcinoma) and in the presence of metastases, significantly elevated D-dimer levels were measured. The assay proved to be suitable for measuring the D-dimer levels in plasma samples of dogs. The calculated reference range for dogs was confirmed to be between 0.06 and 0.69 µg/mL fibrinogen equivalent unit.",

Two experiments were conducted: in Experiment 1, ES were recovered within 6–8 h after castration; selected samples were diluted with a Tris-citrate egg-yolk glycerolated buffer and frozen. In Experiment 2, epididymides were stored for 24 h at 4 °C before RF and semen samples were frozen after dilution with a Tris-lactose egg-yolk glycerolated extender with and without 15% SP. In Experiment 1, eight semen samples were obtained from ten epididymides with a mean of 500 × 10 6 total spermatozoa recovered, per flushed epididymis. Mean post-thaw motility and progressive motility were 75 and 17%, respectively. In Experiment 2, 15 samples were collected, out of the 18 epididymides (mean number of collected spermatozoa: 700 × 10 6 ), and 13 of these samples were of excellent quality. Post-thaw parameters were not satisfactory but the supplementation of the freezing medium with 15% SP improved the progressive motility and kinematic parameters of the spermatozoa.",

The authors describe the use of intraoperative echocardiography and successful surgical treatment of a case of traumatic pericarditis. A seven-year-old Hungarian Simmental dairy cow in late pregnancy showed severe oedema of the throat region and brisket, as well as jugular distension. Cardiac auscultation demonstrated tachycardia with a normal cardiac rhythm. The heart sounds were muffled, but no cardiac murmur or splashing sounds were heard. A large amount of echogenic fluid with some strands of fibrin was seen in the pericardial and right pleural cavities by ultrasonography. Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis demonstrated the presence of a thick, fetid and purulent exudate. Pericardiotomy was performed in standing position with sedation and local anaesthesia. After costal resection, intraoperative echocardiography was performed. It showed an echogenic tract between the caudal pericardium and diaphragm, but no foreign body was seen. Two weeks after the surgery, the cow delivered a healthy bull-calf. Intraoperative echocardiography — not reported earlier — can be applied to evaluate the entire bovine pericardial sac and heart. The report also demonstrates that surgical treatment of traumatic pericarditis can be successful in carefully selected cases.",

A strict seasonal cycle with a very long intrapiscine development was recorded for M. elegans and M. intimus . Developing plasmodia of the latter Myxobolus spp. occurred from early summer to next spring, and spore formation took place only in April. No seasonality associated with M. feisti infections was found. Developing plasmodia and mature spores of this species occurred simultaneously in different seasons of the year.

All cows (n = 378) received the Ovsynch protocol (GnRH-7d-PGF2α-56h-GnRH-18h-TAI). The 'OVS' group (n = 105) received only the Ovsynch protocol.

The lymph nodes were normal in size and shape. Histochemical tests performed on tissues allowed us to identify and differentiate the pigment. Immunohistochemical staining for macrophage markers showed macrophages containing a variable amount of melanin-like granules. Our data, and the well-known steps of melanin formation, confirm that swine enzymes could act on phenolic substances found in acorns.",

    "abstract": "Since early fertility decline is a permanent problem of broiler breeders, the aim of this study was to test the effects of various sex ratios, spiking strategies and additional artificial inseminations (AI) on their breeding efficiency. Six breeder flocks were analysed during the whole reproduction cycle. In Flock A the sex ratio was maintained at 10% during the whole cycle (control), while in Flock B the number of males was increased to a final ratio of 16%. In Flocks C (technological control), D, E and F the ratio of males was gradually decreased from 10% to 6.5% until the end of the cycle. Moreover, at the age of 44 weeks in Flocks D and E 50 and 100% of cockerels were replaced by young ones, respectively, while in Flock F additional artificial inseminations were applied in the second half of the reproduction cycle. The increase of sperm transport was successful only in Groups B (increase in male numbers) and D (50% replacement of old cockerels with young ones); however, it was not sufficient for increasing the fertility rates in either group. Nor did additional artificial inseminations (Flock F) have an effect on fertility. As a conclusion, it can be established that increasing the sperm count in the hens’ oviducts in any way could not improve fertility in the last third of the production cycle. The results also suggest that the expensive and labour-intensive spiking technique used in broiler breeder management is useless. The prime factor responsible for the shortened persistence of fertility may be the reduced ability of the female oviduct to accept and store sperm.",

After primary infection the virus becomes latent predominantly in the respiratory tract lymph nodes and the genome can also be detected in the peripheral nervous system. The role of mouse as a feasible model for the establishment of latency and reactivation of EHV-1 was investigated. Intracerebral and intranasal infections of 3- and 17-day-old mice were made and virus replication was confirmed by virus isolation and detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) in brain. For reactivation studies, the mice were killed 8 weeks post infection and tissues were collected for cocultivation. In mice from both age groups, infectious virus was not detected by cocultivation. Following attempts to reactivate virus in vivo with corticosteroids, the viral antigen was detected at low levels by IIF and the expression of the gB gene by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in brain, trigeminal ganglia, olfactory lobe, lung and spleen. Virus was also detected by IIF following incubation of tissue explants in the growth medium containing pokeweed mitogen (PWM). These results show the limitations of the mouse model for investigating EHV-1 latency and highlights the issue of 'ineffective reactivation' of virus.",

Forty-three out of 44 streptomycin- and/or ampicillin-resistant DT104 and related phage type strains were found to carry a 1 kb and/or 1.2 kb long integron. The other resistance markers did not affect the number and size of integrons; no integron-free multidrug-resistant (MDR) DT104 strains were found. The two large groups of DT104 strains (Felix-Callow's phage types 2 and 2c) proved to be identical in respect of integron patterns (IPs), supporting the views of those authors who consider DT104 a single clone. Strains of human and animal origin did not differ from each other in their IPs. Within the non-DT104 phage types, ampicillin- and/or streptomycin-resistant, integron-free MDR strains were also found. Based on amplicons varying between 290 and 3500 bp an IP system was suggested. The commonest amplicon sizes in non-DT104 strains were 1450 and 2050 bp. The IPs of DT104 strains and of non-DT104 strains containing an integron of 1 and 1.2 kb size were stable. In contrast, the IPs of other non-DT104 strains showed a varying degree of instability. Integron loss was frequently associated with spontaneous plasmid elimination and changes of R-type among the descendants of a given strain.",

By agar dilution, MIC 50 values in the range of 0.05-3.125µg/ml were determined for penicillin, ampicillin, ceftiofur, doxycycline, tylosin, pleuromutilins, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, enrofloxacin and lincomycin. The MIC 50 value of oxytetracycline and spectinomycin was 6.25 and 12.5µg/ml, respectively. For ofloxacin, flumequine, neomycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin and sulphamethoxazole + trimethoprim MIC 50 values were in the range of 25-100µg/ml. With the disc diffusion method, all strains were sensitive to penicillin, cephalosporins examined, chloramphenicol and florfenicol, tetracyclines examined, pleuromutilins, lincomycin and tylosin. Variable sensitivity was observed for fluoroquinolones (flumequine, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin), most of the strains were susceptible to marbofloxacin. Almost all strains were resistant to aminoglycosides but most of them were sensitive to spectinomycin. A strong correlation was determined for disc diffusion and MIC results (Spearman's rho 0.789, p&lt;0001). MIC values of the type strain and MIC 50 values of other tested strains did not differ significantly. Few strains showed a partially distinct resistance pattern for erythromycin, lincomycin and ampicillin in both methods.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal absorption of trivalent and hexavalent chromium (Cr) given orally (experiment I) or infused in the intestine (experiment II) was investigated in rats. The nonabsorbable form of chromium (51Cr2O3) and water-soluble and more absorbable Na251CrO4 (the hexavalent form of Cr) were compared. Total retention of chromium given orally ranged around 15 percent of the dose, regardless of the chromium compounds applied. The absorption rate of chromic oxide, which is considered a nonabsorbable compound, was 14.4 as a percentage of chromium intake. This result indicates that some loss of chromium has to be taken into account in metabolic trials made by the indicator method. In isolated rat intestine, from the injected Cr 2.5% of chromic oxide and 43.2% of sodium chromate were absorbed during an hour (experiment II). The absorbed chromium was transferred to the liver where the liver tissue retained 10.9% of chromic oxide and 51.1% of sodium chromate. Radioactivity of v. cava caudalis following intestinal injection of Na2CrO4 was thirtyfold greater than after Na2CrO4 dosing. This phenomenon can be explained by the lower blood clearance of chromate. Different absorption rate of chromate depending on the route of administration could be due to the fact that the hexavalent form given orally was reduced to Cr3+ in the acidic environment of the stomach. When Na2CrO4 was infused directly in the intestine of rats, such reduction could not occur. This means that the acidic gastric juice might play a role in inhibiting the intestinal absorption of Na2CrO4 when this compound is given orally.",

The data of the study presented here show that (1) laser assisted hatching (AH) is a fast, very accurate and safe procedure without any harmful effect on embryo development and it can support very effectively the implantation of embryos, (2) the use of polscope facilitates the evaluation of oocyte quality and the selection of oocytes with spindle, (3) by monitoring the spindle position during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), we can reduce spindle damage and increase the chance of fertilisation. Further studies are underway to test the hypothesised connection between spindle birefringence and developmental capacity of oocytes/embryos.",

Pharmacokinetic variables were defined for doses of 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg, utilising a quantitative bacteriological analysis. Values for half-life (T½ß) at 10 mg/kg were 0.8, 1.48 and 1.52 h for the i.v., s.c. and i.m. routes, respectively. Corresponding values for the 20 mg/kg dose for the same routes were 0.8, 1.49 and 1.53 h, respectively. Relatively fast clearance (ranging from 0.58 to 0.64 L/kg/h) allowed a maximum dose interval of 12 h. The above-stated doses of cefotaxime were administered i.v. to 40 cases of septicaemia, clinically divided into 20 moderately severe cases treated with 10 mg/kg i.v., of cefotaxime bid , and 20 severe ones, treated with 20 mg/kgi.v. of cefotaxime bid . Injections continued until a previously defined criterion of 'clinically recovered' was obtained. Thereafter, a follow-up treatment was established using the same dose and dose-interval but through the s.c. route. Due to the apparent volumes of distribution obtained (ranging from 0.48 to 0.51 L/kg), considering the overall clinical efficacy obtained (90% for the 10 mg/kg dose and 75% for the 20 mg/kg dose), and due to the rapid improvement observed after a few doses of the drug (1.8 to 2.5 doses to 'clinical improvement'), it is safe to postulate such doses of cefotaxime as excellent choices for the treatment of septicaemia in dogs.",

There was a close correlation between serum P4 concentration and the number of corpora lutea (CL; 13.3 ± 9.5) at the recovery (P &lt; 0.0001). After the embryo collection, cows returned to cycle in different ways: ( i ) group of donors returning to cycle after 2.2 ± 0.8 days, ( ii ) group with a delay of 11.0 ± 1.9 days; and ( iii ) animals having a long (28.8 ± 2.2 days) acyclic period, which is significant (P &lt; 0.001). The remaining animals (30%) showed cystic ovarian malformations. P4 level at the time of embryo recovery does not influence the oestrous cycle changes. The results suggest that Holstein-Friesian donor cows may suffer from cystic ovarian degeneration and may have a long acyclic period after superovulatory treatment in a tropical climate.",

Recent reports associate the expression of the PPARβ/δ gene (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta) with the downregulation of WT1 in human melanoma and murine melanoma cell lines. The aim of this work was to analyse the expression of WT1 and its association with PPARβ/δ in samples of healthy and melanoma-affected skin of horses by immunohistochemistry. WT1 protein expression was detected in healthy skin, mainly in the epidermis, hair follicle, sebaceous gland and sweat gland, while no expression was observed in equine melanoma tissues. Moreover, it was observed that PPARβ/δ has a basal expression in healthy skin and that it is overexpressed in melanoma. These results were confirmed by a densitometric analysis, where a significant increase of the WT1-positive area was observed in healthy skin (128.66 ± 19.84 pixels 106) compared with that observed in melanoma (1.94 ± 0.04 pixels 106). On the other hand, a positive area with an expression of PPARβ/δ in healthy skin (214.94 ± 11.85 pixels 106) was significantly decreased compared to melanoma (624.86 ± 181.93 pixels 106).

For that purpose, the turtles were anaesthetised with ketamine–medetomidine or propofol, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by spectrophotometry. The possible genotoxic effects of the anaesthetic agents were estimated by comet assay. A total of 24 turtles were included in this study. The animals were divided into four groups according to the anaesthetic protocol and according to whether endoscopy would be performed. Significantly decreased activities of CAT were found only in the propofol group and in turtles undergoing coelioscopy. Both anaesthetic protocols induced significantly increased MDA levels, while no differences were observed after the intervention. A significant increase in GST activity was detected in turtles after both anaesthetic protocols, but after coelioscopy significant changes in GST activity were found only in the propofol group. However, no differences in SOD activity and no DNA damages were detected in either group. These findings suggest that ketamine–medetomidine may be more suitable anaesthetic agents in red-eared sliders than propofol.",

Pathomorphological examinations were carried out on 10 pigs that had been found dead. The gross lesions ranged from mild, superficial dermatitis to severe, deep inflammation with exudation, ulceration and necrosis. Histopathological examination revealed erosive and ulcerative dermatitis of the pinna with neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration and bacterial colonies in the crusts. Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA strain), Staphylococcus hyicus and Streptococcus group C were cultivated from eight, S. hyicus from two ear tissue scraping samples. All 10 samples were positive for treponemes and phylogenetic analysis of two polymerase chain reaction products confirmed the relationship to Treponema (T.) medium/vincentii and Treponema pedis. Treponemes were also detected in seven oral swabs that were analysed to obtain evidence of the transmission of this bacterium by ear biting. The contribution of non-infectious factors to this misbehaviour could not be ruled out as the crude protein concentration of the feed was inappropriate and the climate of the pig house was suboptimal. The concentrations of selected mycotoxins in the feed were not elevated. However, the contribution of both infectious and non-infectious factors to the onset of disease was most probable.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of CCK-octapeptide (CCK-OP) on small-intestinal myoelectric activity in rams in the course of chronic experiments. Five rams underwent implantation of bipolar platinum electrodes to the duodenal bulb, distal duodenum, and jejunum as well as a strain gauge force transducer attached near the duodenal electrode. During continuous myoelectric recordings, 0.15 M NaCl or CCK-OP were injected slowly into the jugular vein. Injections of CCK-OP at doses of 20 (over 30 s), 200 (over 30 or 60 s) and 2000 (over 30, 60 or 120 s) ng/kg of body weight were each administered 5 or 30-40 min after the onset of the duodenal phase 1 or phase 2 of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC), respectively. Most of these CCK doses were considered physiological. Injections of the smallest dose of CCK-OP exerted a slight and mostly insignificant inhibitory effect on the duodenal bulb and the duodenal myoelectric activity index (MAI) values. In the duodenal bulb, the effects of CCK-OP on myoelectric activity were dose dependent and closely related to the phase of the MMC. In the duodenum, the high dose of the hormone evoked short stimulatory and longer inhibitory biphasic effects on the MAI. These effects were inversely related to the duration of the hormone injection. It is concluded that CCK evokes a physiological stimulatory and inhibitory (biphasic) effect on the duodenal bulb and duodenal motility in sheep, with the inhibitory effect of the hormone being more pronounced in the duodenal bulb than in the duodenum. These effects were related to the CCK dose and the MMC phase. Therefore, CCK is an important regulator of upper small bowel motility in sheep.",

Clearance analyses were carried out on 16 pregnant White Improved goats (8 in single and 8 in twin gestation). Blood plasma and urine samples were analysed for the concentration of inulin, endogenous creatinine, sodium, potassium, and chlorides. It has been demonstrated that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the goat kidney does not change significantly during gestation. GFR recorded from the 1st week until the 20th week of gestation in twin-pregnant goats was only slightly higher compared to those observed in single-pregnant does. Blood plasma concentrations of major electrolytes, i.e. sodium, potassium and chloride ions, did not differ significantly in pregnant and non-pregnant goats, and remained within the reference values. From the very beginning of gestation, the single-pregnant goats showed increased renal potassium clearance; however, the level of sodium clearance remained stable. On the other hand, sodium clearance increased from the 2nd month of gestation in the twin-pregnant goats, while the load of excreted potassium did not change. These changes had probably resulted from varied levels of aldosterone and progesterone and their mutual proportions differing between the groups.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate differences between the progesterone profiles of Beagle bitches with (multiparous) and without (nulliparous) the whelping experience and to examine whether the selection of bitches by progesterone analyses before the programmed mating improved the whelping rates. In the first experiment, the progesterone profiles of nulliparous and multiparous bitches were evaluated from Days 1 to 13 (onset of prooestrus = Day 0). The mean duration of the elevation in progesterone levels (> 2 ng/mL) after the onset of prooestrus tended to be approximately 1 day shorter in nulliparous bitches (7.7 days) than in multiparous bitches (8.5 days). In the second experiment, progesterone analyses in the bitches were carried out once on Days 4, 5 or 6. Bitches with progesterone levels of > 10 ng/mL were excluded from mating because it was unclear when the progesterone levels reached > 10 ng/mL considering the optimal date for mating. No significant differences were observed in the percentages of bitches excluded from mating and in the whelping rates of the mated bitches between the groups, irrespective of the day of progesterone analysis and the type of bitch. In conclusion, the initial elevation of progesterone levels was of shorter duration in nulliparous bitches. The selection of bitches by the measurement of progesterone levels once before mating was not effective for the programmed mating.",

    "abstract": "A short alternative open reading frame named ORF7a has recently been discovered within the nucleocapsid gene of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) genome. Proteins (7ap) translated from the ORF7a of two divergent strains - a type I and a type II - are able to completely reduce the motility of nucleic acids at relatively high molar charge ratios in gel retardation assays indicating strong dsDNA- and ssRNA-binding capability. Conserved RNA- and DNA-binding properties suggest that nucleic acid binding is a functional property of the divergent 7aps, and not an arbitrary consequence of their net positive charge. Sera from Hu7ap-immunised pigs and mice did not react with Hu7ap or Hu7ap-GFP; however, antinuclear antibodies were detected in the sera of the immunised animals, suggesting an ability of Hu7ap to interact with or mimic autoantigenic macromolecules.",

In order to investigate disorders of intestinal immunity in piglets infected by PCV2 during the fetal period, 9 PCV2b-infected piglets and 6 non-infected piglets at one day of age were selected and euthanised prior to suckling. Samples of mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and duodena were collected to investigate factors related to intestinal immunity and to detect lymphocytic apoptosis. The results indicated that there were no significant changes in the levels of IL-2, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the PCV2b-infected piglets but IFN-γ levels were significantly lower (P < 0.01) and IL-4 levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in infected piglets than in the controls. Furthermore, lymphocytic apoptosis increased in PCV2b-infected piglets and CD4+ to CD8+ ratios were lower in these piglets than in the controls. These findings suggest vertical transmission of PCV2b to fetuses, leading to an imbalance of intestinal immune function in piglets.",

The physicochemical, microbiological and microelement analyses of the water samples from each region were conducted by standard methods. The highest red blood cell, white blood cell and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration values were seen in the samples from Gökçeada. The highest haemoglobin value was found in the samples originating from Bozcaada, whereas the highest haematocrit and mean corpuscular volume values were found in the animals from Dardanos. Based on the microbiological analysis of the water samples, the most polluted site was Gökçeada. The microelement contents of the water and blood samples were different at the three sites, the lowest being in the Gökçeada area. It was revealed that the percentage of red blood cell micronuclei and other nucleus abnormalities in the M. rivulata blood samples was the lowest also in the animals living in the region of Gökçeada.",

Eighty-one small rural family farms were included, and blood and heart samples were taken from 150 clinically healthy, adult, free-range chickens. Serum samples were processed by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test considering a dilution of 1:16 as a positive reaction, while the DNA detection was done by PCR. The correlation between the presence of antibodies and the potential risk factors was estimated with logistic regression. The overall seroprevalence in the examined populations was 67%, with a range from 33% to 100% among municipalities, and 78% of the farms having at least one seropositive bird. The PCR test identified the presence of parasite DNA for one case only. Among the variables, the presence of cats and the presence of other animal species on the farm were the ones that had the highest values, while the presence of feral cats and the presence of noxious fauna were also identified as potential risk factors. The results indicate high soil contamination by T. gondii oocysts, which implies the active role of cats living on the farms.",

The sequence analysis of the 463-bp PCR product from the viral DNA polymerase gene indicated the presence of a hitherto unknown virus, a putative member of the family Alloherpesviridae in the sample. Another PCR, targeting the terminase gene of fish HVs, provided an additional genomic fragment of over 1,000 bp. Surprisingly, the sequence of a co-amplified, off-target PCR product revealed its origin from a putative gene homologous to ORF87 and ORF45 of cyprinid HVs and anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1), respectively. With specific primers, designed according to the genomic maps of the cyprinid and anguillid HVs, a genomic fragment of 15 kb was also amplified and sequenced by primer walking. In phylogeny inferences, based on several genes, the putative wels catfish HV clustered closest to various cyprinid HVs or to AngHV-1. The novel virus, named as silurid herpesvirus 2, represents a distinct species in the genus Cyprinivirus. However, its association with the skin disease remains unclear.",

To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of naturally occurring goitre in geese, which is not related to the feeding of rapeseed meal. The major pathological findings included retarded growth and plumage development, significantly (300%) increased relative thyroid weight, fat accumulation in the mesenteric and abdominal region, and lipid infiltration of liver and kidney cells. Subsequent hormone analysis showed undetectable thyroxine (T 4 ) levels and a dramatic drop in triiodothyronine (T 3 ) plasma levels of the diseased geese. Thy- roidal histology displayed the typical signs of struma parenchymatosa. In order to get more information about the possible causes of the goitre, 10 geese from the affected farm were transferred into the laboratories of the Central Veterinary Institute. The geese were allotted into two groups. Group I received iodine supplementation for 55 days, while the other group served as sick control (Group S). Iodine treatment caused a dramatic improvement in the birds clinical condition except in plumage growth in Group I, while the clinical and main pathological signs of goitre remained unchanged or worsened in the untreated Group S. Contrary to this, the serum levels of thyroid hormones and responsiveness to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) improved not only in Group I but also in Group S. Almost euthyroid biochemical parameters were found after 55 days of iodine treatment in Group I and, surprisingly, a considerable improvement (especially in serum T 3 levels) occurred also in Group S. These findings confirm the diagnosis of goitre but also call attention to the fact that iodine deficiency was not the only factor eliciting the disorder. The underlying possible goitrogenic substance could not be traced down.",

The RH50/RH51 primer pair described by Collis and Hall (1992) proved to be suitable for rapid discrimination between the aadA1 and aadA2 genes on the basis that the RH51 primer bound exclusively to the aadA2 gene.",

Pituitary glands were obtained from mature gilts, which were ovariectomised (OVX) one month before slaughter. Ovariectomised gilts, assigned to four groups, were primed with: (1) vehicle (OVX); (2) and (3) oestradiol benzoate (EB; 2.5 mg/100 kg b.w.) at 30-36 h (OVX+EB I) and 60-66 h (OVX+EB II) before slaughter, respectively; and (4) progesterone (P 4 ; 120 mg/100 kg b.w.) for 5 consecutive days before slaughter(OVX+P 4 ). Isolated anterior pituitary cells were submitted to 3.5 h incubation in the presence of GnRH, a- and ß-adrenergic agonists [phenylephrine (PHEN) and isoproterenol (ISOP), respectively], or a- and ß-adrenergic blockers [phentolamine (PHENT) and propranolol (PROP), respectively]. The culture media were assayed for PRL (exp. I) and ß-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (ß-END-LI) (experiment II). In experiment I, GnRH did not influence PRL release by pituitary cells in all experimental groups. Some of tested doses of adrenergic agonists, PHEN and ISOP, increased PRL release from pituitary cells of OVX gilts, but not from those of OVX+EB I animals. In the OVX+EB II group, PHEN alone, but ISOP with PROP, potentiated PRL secretion by the cells. In OVX+P 4 animals, PHEN alone or in combination with PHENT and also ISOP alone or with PROP enhanced PRL output from the cells. In experiment II, addition of GnRH increased ß-END-LI release from pituitary cells only in the OVX+EB II group. PHEN and PHENT potentiated ß-END-LI secretion by pituitary cells in OVX+EB II and OVX+P 4 groups, while ISOP and PROP increased ß-END-LI secretion by the cells of OVX and OVX+EB II animals. In turn, in the OVX+EB I group, effect of PHENT and PROP on PRL secretion by pituitary cells was inhibitory. In conclusion, our results suggest that adrenergic agents can modulate PRL and ß-END secretion by porcine pituitary cells in a manner dependent on the hormonal status of gilts.",

Subsequent controls demonstrated immune restoration in 4 representative FIV-FeLV negative cats, previously diagnosed with CFS associated with leukopenia, lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinaemia and thrombocytopenia. The main conclusion is that a CFS-like disease in dogs and cats, characterised by the common hallmarks of high CK levels, absence of known causes of chronic fatigue in animals and presence of micrococcus-like organisms in the blood, can be associated with humoral and/or cellular immune deficiencies in 9-22.5% of cases and with thrombocytopenia in 20-68% of cases.

    "abstract": "Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific POU-domain DNA binding factor, which binds to and trans-activates promoters of growth hormone- (GH), prolactin- (PRL) and thyroid stimulating hormone-beta- (TSHbeta) encoding genes. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is located in the hypothalamus and stimulates TSH, GH and PRL release from the pituitary gland. In the present study, we successfully used the cell aggregate culture system for chicken pituitary cells to study the effect of TRH administration on the ggPit-l* (chicken Pit-1), GH and TSHbeta mRNA expression in vitro. In pituitary cell aggregates of 11-day-old male broiler chicks the ggPit-l * mRNA expression was significantly increased following TRH administration, indicating that the stimulatory effects of TRH on several pituitary hormones are mediated via its effect on the ggPit-l* gene expression. Therefore, a semiquantitative RT-PCR method was used to detect possible changes in GH and TSHbeta mRNA levels. TRH affected both the GH and TSHbeta mRNA levels. The results of this in vitro study reveal that ggPit-1 * has a role in mediating the stimulatory effects of TRH on pituitary hormones like GH and TSHbeta in the chicken pituitary.",

In all organs studied, cholinergic innervation was more developed than noradrenergic innervation. Numerous VAChT-immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibres were found in the muscular layer and mucosa of the SV and BU as well as in the prostate. A similar abundance of noradrenergic nerve fibres (showing immunoreactivity both to TH and DβH) was also found in both layers of the SV and BU (but not in the prostate). In the prostate a moderate density of VIP-IR nerve fibres was present but only very scarce NPY-IR nerve fibres were shown. All the studied accessory sexual glands (ASG) of male sheep contained VIP-IR nerve fibres in a similar frequency. Double immunohistochemistry revealed that the vast majority of noradrenergic nerve fibres also contained NPY. None of the noradrenergic nerve fibres showed the presence of VAChT or VIP. The possible functional significance of these findings is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The physiological significance of thyroid hormones (TH) present in colostrum and milk is still under consideration. The present study was aimed at determining milk thyroxine (T 4 ) and triiodothyronine (T 3 ) levels in three lactation phases (early, mid- and late) of the goat, and to measure activity of the milk 5'-deiodinase (5'-MD) enzyme responsible for the intramammary conversion of pro-hormone T 4 to its metabolically highly active form T 3 . Thirty-two milk goats (Polish White breed) fed a standard diet were used for milk sampling. The highest TH levels in mammary secretion were recorded during the first 2-3 days post partum. Then the hormone levels decreased, and by about Day 7 fluctuated around the overall mean for the early-lactation phase (Days 1 to 24 of lactation), recording 0.134 ± 0.059 µg T 4 and 150.8 ± 2.80 ng T 3 in 100 ml of the milk. Such T 4 concentrations appeared to be comparable to those in the rabbit and human, whereas the concentration of T 3 was higher than in the cow, pig and mare's milk. Milk 5'-MD activity was higher (P &lt; 0.01) during early and late lactation, compared to the mid-lactation phase. It coincided with low T 4 and high T 3 milk levels during early lactation, and with high milk T 4 and low T 3 concentrations during late lactation. The quantity of T 4 and T 3 available to newborn kids in milk suggests that TH ingested with the colostrum may have a physiological role during the early postnatal life of suckling goats.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal transplantation is being increasingly performed to treat patients with irreversible intestinal failure. The major cause of intestinal graft failure is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that represents a life-threatening complication after small bowel transplantation (Itx). The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of skin biopsy histological changes for acute GVHD after Itx in pigs. Thirty-four Large White pigs were divided into three groups: Group 1 with Itx only, Group 2 with Itx and donor bone marrow infusion (Itx BM) and Group 3 (control group — before the operation). Animals received tacrolimus-based immunosuppression from day 0 to day 30 postoperatively. Skin and small bowel biopsies were histologically assessed, analysed and classified from grade 1 to 4 on postoperative days 15, 30, 45 and 60. There was a strong correlation between the histological grading values of skin biopsy changes and the histological grading values of small bowel biopsy changes (Kendall’s tau_b is 0.855 for the Itx group and 0.730 for the Itx BM group). The significant correlation found between skin and small bowel histological changes suggests the prognostic value of skin biopsies after Itx. In conclusion, our findings emphasise the diagnostic and prognostic value of skin biopsy analysis for acute GVHD after Itx.",

The trial presented here included 31 healthy warm-blooded horses. Percussion of the area of cardiac dullness and then echocardiographic imaging of the same region were performed. To obtain the relevant measurement points, the 4th and 5th intercostal spaces (ICS) were used on the left and the 4th ICS on the right side. On the left side, the dorsal border of cardiac dullness was determined in the 4th ICS (1st point). Then the ventral border of the cardiac dullness was determined at the same place (2nd point). This was followed by the examination of the same points in the 5th ICS (3rd and 4th points). The following step was to measure the distance of these points from the ventral border of the thorax, and also that between the 2nd and the 4th points. On the right side the same procedure was used in the 4th ICS only. Mean values/standard errors (in cm) of absolute values of differences between percussional and echocardiographic measurements were as follow. Left side, 4th ICS, dorsal border: 0.8/0.1; ventral border: 0.7/0.1; 5th ICS, dorsal border: 0.8/0.1, ventral border: 0.9/0.2; right side, 4th ICS, dorsal border: 0.8/0.2; ventral border: 0.7/0.1. Due to the close correlation between the results of the two techniques, it is reasonable to consider cardiac percussion as an integrated part of the physical examination.",

Thirty-five dogs were recruited in this study and their neoplastic lineages were determined by immunophenotyping with Pax5 and CD3. Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected prior to and during chemotherapy in weeks 4, 9 and 13 to detect MRD by hPARR. Twenty-eight dogs (80%) had B-cell lymphoma while seven dogs (20%) had T-cell lymphoma. A monoclonal band was detected in 11 cases that showed complete or partial remission before tumour relapse and no response to the current treatment without statistical difference in clinical outcomes; however, the treatment response had an association with the MRD result (P &lt; 0.05). Modified L-CHOP prolonged median progression-free survival as compared to modified L-COP (215 days vs. 93 days; P &lt; 0.05). Substage b had shorter progression-free survival than substage a (90 days vs. 215 days; P &lt; 0.05). Clinical stage III affected median overall survival time when compared to clinical stages IV and V (432, 173 and 118 days, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). hPARR could be used for screening refractory lymphoma together with lymph node measurement in routine clinical cases.",

The standard culturing method (ISO 10272-1:2006) involves a high time and labour demand. In this paper, we present a method that reduces the detection time of Campylobacter spp. to or below one third as compared to the ISO method, at a reduced cost per test. We used redox potential change of enrichment cultures (Bolton broth with Bolton selective supplement) for reliably selecting Campylobacter -contaminated raw milk and broiler meat samples. Identification of Campylobacter spp. in the contaminated samples was done by real-time PCR method. Culturing time to conclusive redox monitoring varied between 6 and 24 h for positive samples, depending on the contamination rate, in contrast to 136 h with the standard culturing process. However, now the Campylobacter -negative majority of food samples will not need to be tested by real-time PCR because redox potential monitoring can identify them in the selective enrichment phase. This method could be potentially used as a faster alternative to the current standard ISO 10272-1:2006, for nonregulatory monitoring purposes.",

All three ORFs were expressed with C-terminal eGFP and 3xFLAG tags in different cell lines and their localisation was determined. ORF 3a is predicted to contain DNA-binding and transcription activator domains, and it is localised in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. ORF 3b is also predicted to contain DNA-binding and activator domains, and was found to localise in the mitochondrion. Besides that, in some of the non-infected and FIPV-infected cells nucleolar, perinuclear or nuclear membrane accumulation of the eGFP-tagged 3b was observed. The exact compartmental localisation of ORF 3c is yet to be determined. However, based on our co-localisation studies 3c does not seem to be localised in the ER-Golgi network, ERGIC or peroxisomes. The expression of 3c-eGFP is clearly cell type dependent, it is more stable in MARC 145 cells than in Fcwf-4 or CrFK cells, which might reflect in vivo stability differences of 3c in natural target cells (enterocytes vs. monocytes/macrophages).",

We could not detect a significant difference in the marker expression profile, but there was a remarkable difference between the proliferation rates of these PGC lines. We monitored the number of PGCs throughout a three-day period using a high-content screening cell imaging and analysing system (HCS). We compared three different initial cell concentrations in the wells: ~1000 cells (1×, ~4000 (4× and ~8000 (8×. For the GFPZW- 5ZP, FS-ZZ-101 and FS-ZW-111 PGC lines the lowest doubling time was observed at 4× concentration, while for GFP-ZZ-4ZP we found the lowest doubling time at 1× concentration. At 8× initial concentration, the growth rate was high during the first two days for all cell lines, but this was followed by the appearance of cell aggregates decreasing the cell growth rate. We could conclude that the difference in proliferation rate could mainly be attributed to genotypic variation in the established PGC lines, but external factors such as cell concentration and quality of the culture medium also affect the growth rate of PGCs.",

During the last decades, a continuous decay was registered in honey bee populations worldwide, including Hungary. In our study, we used metagenomic approaches and conventional PCR screening on healthy and winter mortality affected colonies from multiple sites in Hungary. The major goal was to discover presumed bee pathogens with viral metagenomic experiments and gain prevalence and distribution data by targeted PCR screening. We examined 664 honey bee samples that had been collected during winter mortality from three seemingly healthy colonies and from one colony infested heavily by the parasitic mite Varroa destructor in 2016 and 2017. The subsequent PCR screening of honey bee samples revealed the abundant presence of Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) for the first time in Central Europe. Based on phylogeny reconstruction, the newly-detected virus was found to be most closely related to a Chinese AmFV strain. More sequence data from multiple countries would be needed for studying the detailed phylogeographical patterns and worldwide spreading process of AmFV. Here we report the prevalent presence of this virus in Hungarian honey bee colonies.",

Heat shock protein 10 immunoregulates and promotes growth during early gestation in humans, while HSP70 is considered to regulate autophagy and apoptosis during pregnancy and parturition. Both HSPs are detectable in the serum and placentas of early pregnant women and considered to contribute to the establishment of pregnancy. Within this pilot study we aimed (1) to assess whether HSPs 10, 60 and 70 are measurable in the serum of healthy early pregnant and non-pregnant bitches, and (2) to explore whether measurable differences between groups indicate pregnancy. Blood was collected from 31 bitches on days 7, 14 and 21 after mating. At 21 days post mating, all bitches were examined for pregnancy by ultrasonography; 23 were pregnant, and the eight non-pregnant bitches served as controls. Pregnant bitches had normal parturitions and gave birth to healthy puppies. The serum concentrations of HSPs 10, 60 and 70 were measured by electrophoresis and western blot. Serum HSP10 was not detectable. Average serum HSP70 concentration was significantly (d7, P = 0.030; d14, P = 0.023; d21, P = 0.030) lower in pregnant animals at all days investigated, while serum HSP60 was significantly lower at day 21 of gestation (P = 0.024) when compared to the controls.

We conclude that in pregnant bitches, serum concentrations of HSP60 and HSP70 are significantly decreased between days 7 and 21 of gestation, in comparison to non-pregnant bitches in early dioestrus, raising the question about intrauterine functions during the peri-implantation period.",

Catfish were divided into two groups (each group containing 78 fish), then danofloxacin mesylate (10 mg/kg) was administered IV (into the caudal vein) in Group 1 and IM (into the right epaxial muscle) in Group 2, and blood was obtained from the caudal vein before (0 h) and after (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h) of drug administration. High-performance liquid chromatography was used for the determination of plasma concentration, and a non-compartmental model was used for the analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters. After IV administration, elimination half-life (t 1/2λz , 24.49 h), mean residence time (MRT, 30.14 h), volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss, 1.07 L/kg) and total body clearance (CL T , 0.035 L/h/kg) were determined. After IM administration, t 1/2λz , MRT, peak concentration (C max ), time to reach C max and bioavailability were 47.64 h, 61.06 h, 5.22 µg/mL, 1 h and 67.12%, respectively. After IM administration, danofloxacin showed good bioavailability and long t 1/2λz . The favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics after IM administration support the use of danofloxacin for the treatment of susceptible bacterial infections in catfish.",

The problem of differentiation of phenotypically similar Myxobolus species is addressed. During parasitological survey of common dace from the desalinated part of the Gulf of Finland at the city of Sestroretsk, Russia, numerous oval-shaped plasmodia, 0.2-0.4 mm in size, filled with Myxobolus spores were found on the gills. Pear-shaped myxospores were 15.4 (14.8-16.0) × 10.2 (9.6-10.9) µm in size with a rib on each valve. On the basis of spore morphology, the species appeared to be similar to M. elegans and Myxobolus hungaricus Jaczó, 1940. In order to identify the species, molecular genetic analysis was performed, and the species was identified on the basis of morphological characteristics and 18S rDNA data. The results obtained indicate that the Myxobolus species observed on the gills of dace is M. elegans. Thus, common dace is another valid host of M. elegans besides the type host, ide (Leuciscus idus).",

The aim of this study was to assess and compare the classic model, the value of the AG, AG corr , and Cl − /Na + in the diagnosis of ABB disorders in cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study group consisted of 80 cats with CKD, divided into four groups based on the guidelines of the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS). The control group (C) included 20 healthy cats. Metabolic acidosis – diagnosed based on the classic model (Hendersson–Hasselbalch equation) – was found in IRIS group IV. AG, AG corr , SID calculated for IRIS groups II, III and IV were lower than in group C, while the value of AG diff and Cl − /Na + in those groups was higher than in group C. We can conclude that ABB analysis using the classic model enabled the detection of ABB disorders in cats in stage IV CKD. However, the analysis of the AG, AG corr and Cl − /Na + values enabled the diagnosis of acid–base balance disorders in cats with IRIS stage II, III and IV CKD.",

In our study, semen quality was measured simultaneously by the portable device (Ongo) and a laboratory CASA system (Microptic) to compare TM and PM values obtained by these appliances at a concentration of 50 × 10 6 spermatozoa/mL. Agreement between measurements was evaluated with a Bland-Altman plot. Strong correlation was found between the investigated instruments for all the three parameters, i.e. sperm concentration, TM and PM.

    "abstract": "Abstract Equine grass sickness (also known as dysautonomia) is a life-threatening polyneuropathic disease affecting horses with approx. 80% mortality. Since its first description over a century ago, several factors, such as the phenotype, intestinal microbiome, environment, management and climate, have been supposed to be associated with the increased risk of dysautonomia. In this retrospective study, we examined the possible involvement of genetic factors. Medical and pedigree datasets regarding 1,233 horses with 49 affected animals born during a 23-year period were used in the analysis. Among the descendants of some stallions, the proportion of animals diagnosed with dysautonomia was unexpectedly high. Among males, the odds of dysautonomia were found to be higher, albeit not significantly, than among females. Significant familial clustering (genealogical index of familiality, P = 0.001) was observed among the affected animals. Further subgroups were identified with significant ( P &lt; 0.001) aggregation among close relatives using kinship-based methods. Our analysis, along with the slightly higher disease frequency in males, suggests that dysautonomia may have a genetic causal factor with an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. This is the first study providing ancestry data and suggesting a heritable component in the likely multifactorial aetiology of the disease.",

In this study, 10 benign and 10 malignant mammary tumours from the archives of the Department of Pathology were used, and five normal breast tissues were used as controls. It was observed that the expression of IGF-I and IGF-II was low to absent in benign tumours and increased in malignant tumours. The expression of IGF-II was higher than that of IGF-I. This study showed that IGF-I and IGF-II can be used as criteria for malignancy in canine mammary tumours. The results also indicate that IGF-I and IGF-II may be used as early diagnostic markers, and their inhibition may be used for the treatment of canine and human mammary tumours in the future.",

The observations were performed in a flock of 55,000 commercial layers (50,000 Lohmann White and 5,000 Lohmann Brown). At the age of 30 weeks, Lohmann White layers exhibited a number of growths (at an average of 60 hens per week, representing 0.1% of the flock) in the region of leg toes on a daily basis over 28 weeks that regressed during the remaining flock production period. Gross and histological investigations identified the lesions as keratoacanthomas. PCR analysis was negative for avian leukosis virus (ALV) and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). The present investigations have revealed an unusual case: this is the first report on an enzootic outbreak of multiple keratoacanthomas in commercial layers. The results of the aetiological investigations do not show a relation to any infectious agent or a chemical-toxic cause. The abnormal invasion of keratinocytes from the stratum corneum leading to neoplasms in this case coincides with the phase of peak laying capacity which is in fact a stress factor and might be regarded as a provocative moment.",

Four purpose-bred Beagle dogs were utilised to create eight arterial internal rectus fascia sheath (ARFS) grafts implanted between bisected ends of the external iliac arteries. Four out of the eight ARFS grafts were patent after three months. Haematoxylin-eosin and Azan staining verified that the grafts gained a vessel-like layered structure with the presence of large amounts of collagen fibres. Although the inner surface of the intact IRFS was originally covered with claudin-5-negative and pancytokeratin-positive mesothelial cells in control samples, the internal cells of the ARFS grafts became claudin-5 positive and pancytokeratin negative like in intact arteries. Spindle-shaped cells of the wall of ARFS grafts were α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive just like the smooth muscle cells of intact arteries, but α-SMA immunoreactivity was negative in the intact IRFS. According to these findings, the fibroblast cells of the ARFS graft have changed into myofibroblast cells. The study has proved that ARFS grafts may be used as an alternative in arterial replacement, since the graft becomes morphologically and functionally similar to the host vessel via arterialisation.",

    "abstract": "Francisella tularensis is a Gram-negative bacterium, the causative agent of the zoonotic disease tularaemia. The bacterium has developed several extracellular and intracellular strategies to evade the hosts' innate and adaptive immune responses. The aims of the study were to examine complement sensitivity of wild and attenuated F. tularensis ssp. holarctica strains in animal hosts of distinct sensitivity to the bacterium, to compare the complement-evading ability of wild strains of different phylogeographic background, and to examine the role of factor H in the host-pathogen interactions. Complement sensitivity assays were carried out on various F. tularensis ssp. holarctica wild strains and on the attenuated live vaccine strain (LVS) with sera of the highly sensitive house mouse (Mus musculus), the moderately sensitive European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) and the relatively resistant cattle (Bos taurus). Specific binding of complement regulator factor H to bacterial membrane proteins was examined by Western blot assays. All wild strains interacted with the hosts' complement system and showed no significant differences in their survivability. The attenuated LVS was resistant to serum killing in mouse, but was lysed in the sera of hare and cattle. Direct binding of factor H to F. tularensis membrane proteins was not detected.",

    "abstract": "Sex steroid levels increase during sexual maturation and cause alterations in many physiological and morphological traits. Some of these changes may be connected with age-dependent and intersexual differences in the immune system. This topic is still insufficiently understood, especially in avian species, partially due to methodological limitations. In this study we measured the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18) and chemokines [K60 (IL-8-like chicken chemokine - CXCLi1), CAF (IL-8-like chicken chemokine - CXCLi2), and K203] in mononuclear cells isolated from blood and spleen after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Samples were collected from chickens at two ages (from pullets before sexual maturity and from sexually mature egglaying hens). After LPS stimulation, a substantial increase was recorded in the gene expression of IL-6 and K203. All other measured genes were expressed at low levels in mononuclear cells irrespective of cell sources. We found a trend toward intersexual differences in K203 expression, but the expression of other cytokines and chemokines did not differ between the two sexes. The effect of stimulation was more pronounced in monocytes than in spleen macrophages, mainly in IL-6, IL-1β and K203 gene expression. Our findings represent a basis for further studies on the effects exerted by sexual hormones on the immune phenotype of birds.",

The dog was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Iwate University for further evaluation, and a splenic tumour was suspected on the basis of ultrasonography and computed tomography. Surgery identified a large, solid, light-pink mass on the greater omentum with blood-coloured ascites in the abdominal cavity, and resection was performed. Microscopically, the mass comprised spindle-shaped tumour cells and scattered osteoclast-like giant cells. Most spindle-shaped cells were positive for vimentin, desmin, and smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), whereas osteoclast-like giant cells were positive only for vimentin. On the basis of histopathological and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was made. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of leiomyosarcoma associated with osteoclast-like giant cells developing from the greater omentum in a dog.",

The gills of the affected fish specimens were infected by 50 to 800 monogenean parasites. Severe pathological changes were found in areas where the worms attached to the gills. At the attachment sites the haptoral discs of the worms formed a deep depression in the epithelium of the filaments, and the anchors pierced into and fixed themselves to the connective tissue of the cartilaginous gill rays. At these attachment sites red blood cells released from injured capillaries were found among the damaged epithelial cells. Around the hooks, anchors and body sections coming into contact with the gill filaments a proliferative tissue developed in which only a remnant of the damaged lamellae was found. Due to the damage caused by the worms the tips of the heavily infected gill filaments fused, formed clubs and were composed of epitheloid-type regeneration tissue lacking respiratory lamellae. In the basal parts of the filaments, where most of the worms attached to the gill, only denuded filaments deprived of lamellae were observed among the cross-sectioned worms in histological sections.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-two serum samples of healthy bitches were tested with the frozen and lyophilised version of the same ELISA kit (Quanticheck, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Budapest, Hungary). Samples were chosen on the basis of their progesterone (P4) concentrations, which were between 1.00 and 20.00 ng/mL. As it is well known, this range has the highest clinical relevance in ovulation diagnosis. Both types of microplates were read at 15-min intervals from the 15th until the 90th minute (min) of incubation, and the results were compared with those of frozen plates at 60 min of incubation as 100 percent. Lyophilised microplates gave on average 18 percent higher results than the frozen version at equal incubation times. The highest difference between lyophilised and frozen samples was observed at 45 and 60 min of incubation. Ninety-four percent of the reaction in the frozen microplate occurred in the first 15 min, and during the subsequent 30 min the reaction seemingly stopped. After the 45th min of incubation, this 94 percent increased to 108 percent in the subsequent 30 min, which remained the final approximate result at the end of the 90 min of incubation. In contrast to the frozen microplate, the measured concentration increased continuously in the lyophilised version and reached the highest level at the 60th min. The results of the lyophilised microplate reached the same level at 30 min of incubation as those of the frozen version at 60 min. In conclusion, a mechanical increase or decrease of the incubation time does not generate a linear change in the test results. This study demonstrated that the results of a series of samples collected from the same bitch cannot be compared if they are measured with different laboratory methods or different ELISA kits.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-six 6-week old female New Zealand White rabbits were divided into two groups: ad libitum (AL) and 70% restricted (RS) feeding. At the beginning of the experiment the liveweights were practically the same: 0.99 ± 0.08 vs. 1.01 ± 0.08 kg in group AL and RS, respectively. At 18 weeks of age the body weight of Group RS rabbits was 84.7% (3.14 ± 0.24 kg) of the group AL (3.71 ± 0.31 kg). The apparent digestibility of crude protein was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher in Group RS than in Group AL (76.5 ± 1.4 vs. 73.0 ± 2.7%). The daily water consumption was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher (3.5 ml/g DM intake) in Group RS as compared to Group AL (1.9 ml/g DM). Since the average body weight in Group RS at 18 weeks was the same as that of Group AL at 14 weeks of age (3.14 kg), the comparison of the live body measures and indices was based on these ages. Animals fed ad libitum or restricted show no differences at the defined age in most live body measurements except in heart girth and rump width, which were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) shorter in Group AL than in Group RS (29.3 ± 0.8, 5.7 ± 0.5 and 30.7 ± 1.0, 6.2 ± 0.3 cm, respectively). Body capacity was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) smaller in Group AL, as the head capacity-body capacity proportion was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in Group AL than in Group RS (1653.1 ± 134.5, 22.0 ± 2.5 and 1913.7 ± 168.7, 17.7 ± 1.9, respectively). Due to restricted feeding the growth of the head proved to be less intensive than that of the body at the same body weight. The body in these does tended to be wider. Since the head in comparison to length or capacity of the body was smaller in does fed 70% of ad libitum , it could be concluded that the development of body parts of restricted-fed does was unequal (allometric growth). The effect of feed restriction reflected in lower dry matter and fat, and a higher ash and protein content both in total body and in dry matter composition of rabbits at 18 weeks of age. Restricted feeding delayed sexual maturity (69 vs. 92% of rabbits) with later starting ovarian activity, weaker ovarian responsiveness, and a smaller number of tertiary follicles on the ovarian surface.",

At the same time, an evaluation of different measurement methods (weight of epididymal fat pad, adipocyte morphometry, total body electrical conductivity) was performed. Outbred Wistar rats of 30 days of age were fed diets of different (0, 10 and 20%) protein level. The diets were supplemented with 4 mg/kg Cr as chromium nicotinate, and 100 mg/kg L-carnitine. The experimental feeding lasted 15 days, after a 5-day-long adjustment period. It was found that Cr addition increased feed intake. Both treatments caused changes in body composition, increasing fat and protein deposition. Organic chromium had no effect at either protein level, while L-carnitine improved the protein retention only at an optimum (20%) protein supply. No statistically significant correlation was found between total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) and body composition, which could be attributed to the great individual differences. A close correlation was found among total body fat percentage, weight of epididymal fat pad and the adipocyte surface. The data suggest that there is an interaction between dietary protein supply and the effect of repartitioning agents.",

Using Id1F cells (an epsilon-COP thermosensitive mutant CHO cell line) the reduction of epsilon-COP level also had partial inhibitory effect. Based on these results and comparing them to existing models of the adenovirus entry, we propose a refined model in which there are two pathways of adenoviral entry: the first one involves the epsilon-COP as the downstream effector of the acidification and can be blocked by bafilomycin A1 and the second one is a pH-independent pathway.",

Five mature wethers (body weight 75 kg) were fed five diets in a 5 x 5 Latin square experiment. The control diet consisted of 50% meadow hay and 50% concentrate with no added fat. The control diet was supplemented with CS, HESA, BSA, or SO. Fat was added at 3.5% of dietary dry matter (DM). The final ether extract content of the ration was near 6%. Each period lasted 20 days. Fat supplements, except HESA, consistently decreased the in vitro DM disappearance of soybean meal as compared to control. In contrast to the effect of other treatments, crude protein degradation was greatest in the test tubes with inocula obtained from sheep fed diet with HESA. Fat supplements equally inhibited the DM and fibre breakdown of alfalfa pellet. CS and HESA seemed to be less detrimental to in vitro fermentation of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) than BSA and SO. All fat supplements increased blood plasma triglyceride, cholesterol and total lipid content. Plasma concentration of cholesterol and total lipid was highest with SO. The inclusion of CS in the diet increased 16:0, while all fat supplements increased plasma 18:0 and decreased 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acid content. Plasma 18:2n-6 was not changed by feeding CS and SO. However, compared to the control diet, 18:2n-6 increased with 12 and 41% in plasma fatty acids when sheep were fed HESA and BSA, respectively. The results showed that plasma concentration of linoleic acid was enhanced more when the amide was synthesised from butylamine than when from ethanolamine.",

The present study examines the content and distribution of retinol and retinyl esters in the blood plasma, liver, kidney, ovary and oviduct (infundibulum, magnum, isthmus and uterus) of the laying Japanese quail. (1) The results show that the stage of egg laying had no influence on the level of vitamin A (retinol or retinyl esters) in plasma, kidney and liver. (2) The results further indicate that in the oviduct there are quantitative and qualitative differences in the concentration of retinol and retinyl esters, but that these differences are not altered by the stage of egg formation. (3) The highest levels of vitamin A in the isthmus and uterus were associated with a predominance of retinyl esters (palmitate and stearate); sections with lower total levels of vitamin A (infundibulum, magnum) had retinol as the more dominant form of vitamin A. (4) Changes in the ratio of retinol to retinyl esters in the various sections of the avian oviduct might point to metabolic differences. The storage of vitamin A might therefore be the predominant function of the uterus and isthmus; in the infundibulum and magnum, where vitamin A is predominantly present as retinol, vitamin A serves rather as a precursor for the modulation of the cellular metabolism of these structures.",

The importance of adenoviruses, however, is constantly growing as there is a possibility of developing them into viral vector vaccines against more significant swine pathogens. A short summary of the well-established facts of porcine adenoviruses is given and recent developments of the genetic analysis of these viruses are discussed in detail. The possibilities of vector development and examples of vector vaccines already reported in the literature are mentioned.",

We constructed plasmid vectors expressing the full-length Vnukovo-32 rabies virus glycoprotein G under the control of CMV IE promoter and enhancer, adenovirus tripartite leader sequences and poly A signal of SV40. The gene vaccines were evaluated for the ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect BALB/c mice against lethal rabies virus challenge. First, mice were injected intramuscularly (i.m.) into the left hind leg and by the intradermoplantar (i.d.p.) route with equal amounts of plasmid DNA (0.25-0.1 mg). Two weeks later, immunization was boosted with an additional dose of the DNA. The immunized mice were challenged by intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation of CVS-27 (10-50 LD50) rabies virus. All mice produced anti-rabies virus neutralizing antibodies with a titre of > or = 1:45 after immunization with 0.1-0.4 mg of DNA. In challenge experiments, 83 to 91.6% protection was observed. These results confirm that a DNA vaccine could be a simple and effective solution for preventing the spread of rabies.",

Little is known about gallbladder motility during the interdigestive phase and in response to enteral feeding. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of enteral feeding on gallbladder function in dogs. The cholagogue meal (Lipofundin infusion) was applied in four anatomical positions (jejunum, duodenojejunal junction, descending duodenum, stomach) in five healthy Beagle dogs. Gallbladder volume (GBV) was monitored by ultrasonography. Lipofundin infusion given through the feeding tube caused a maximal gallbladder contraction of 9.2% (range 3.7–13.9%) in the jejunum, 16.5% (9.1–22.1%) at the duodenojejunal junction and 26.3% (22.8–29.5%) in the descending duodenum. When the cholagogue meal was given through the mouth, it caused a mean 33.8% (28.6–46.5%) maximum gallbladder contraction in the same animals. In conclusion, we can establish that the ultrasound-guided gallbladder emptying method proved to be a useful technique for monitoring the cholagogue effect of Lipofundin meal applied in different anatomical positions of the intestine. The deeper the position of application, the smaller and shorter gallbladder contraction was evoked.",

It plays a role as a transcriptional factor in the wingless/Wnt signalling pathway. Beta-catenin has been associated with oncogenic activity in human benign and malignant pilomatrix neoplasms where the immunohistochemical profile of β-catenin expression displayed both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in basaloid cells. In this study, an 8-year-old female Irish setter dog was examined because of the presence of skin nodules. Tissue biopsies from different nodules were obtained and histological examination suggested a diagnosis of pilomatrix carcinoma. The dog spontaneously died after 2 months and necropsy showed multiple metastases in the nasal cavity, lungs, heart, kidney, liver and colon. Routine histopathology of metastatic sites showed features consistent with the pattern of primary neoplastic nodules. Immunohistochemical detection of β-catenin was performed in both the primary tumour and the metastases. Beta-catenin expression was located in the nuclei, cytoplasm and membrane of squamoid cells and in the cytoplasm of basaloid cells, while shadow cells were completely negative. To the best of our knowledge, these data represent the first report on the immunohistochemical expression profile of β-catenin in canine pilomatrix carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "The phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein had been found to affect the function of some tissues via oestrogen receptors (ER). In addition, genistein, but not daidzein, is considered to be a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor. Thus, the involvement of oestrogen receptors and PTK in phytoestrogen action on adrenocortical porcine steroidogenesis was examined in this study. The aims of the experiment were to test the effects of (i) ICI 182, 780 (ICI), an ER antagonist, on genistein- and daidzein-modulated cortisol and androstenedione (A4) secretion by adrenocortical cells isolated during the luteal and follicular phases of the porcine oestrous cycle; (ii) tyrphostin AG 957 (TAG), a nonsteroidal PTK inhibitor, on cortisol and A4 secretion by the cells and (iii) the phase of the porcine oestrous cycle on the mechanism of phytoestrogen action. Adrenals were harvested during the luteal (n = 5 animals) and follicular (n = 5 animals) phases of the oestrous cycle from locally slaughtered crossbred gilts. The isolated adrenocortical cells were incubated for 8 h (37 °C, 95% air, 5% CO2) with genistein (5 or 10 μM) or daidzein (5 or 10 μM) in the presence or absence of ICI (0.5 μM) or TAG (5 or 10 μM). Genistein and daidzein inhibited cortisol secretion and stimulated A4 secretion by porcine adrenocortical cells harvested during both the luteal and follicular phases of the oestrous cycle. The ER antagonist ICI did not eliminate phytoestrogen-induced changes in steroidogenesis. In contrast to genistein, TAG reduced the secretion of A4 and did not affect cortisol secretion. There was no observable effect due to the phase of the cycle. It is suggested that the mechanism of genistein and daidzein action in the adrenocortical cells of pigs is independent of ER and PTK. It is possible that PTK are involved in A4 secretion by porcine adrenocortical cells.",

Five chickens of Group P died or were euthanised due to moribund condition following the development of neoplastic lesions between days 53 and 91. On histopathological examination, these lesions were characterised by the proliferation of lymphoid cells of variable size. On analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the MDV meq gene was detected in Group P from day 21, and it was continuously identified in five chickens until they died or were euthanised. Abnormal signs and histopathological changes were not observed in chickens of Group A. The MDV meq gene was temporarily detected in some chickens of Group A, but it remained almost undetectable throughout the experimental period. In older chickens inoculated with vMDV, the onset of MD lymphoma development tended to be delayed as compared with the young chicks. The relationship between MD lymphoma development and virus replication in older chickens has been suggested. Our data might indicate the underlying existence of an age-related resistance to vMDV challenge.",

At 28 and 42 days of age, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters were assessed. There were significant reductions of R wave amplitude (leads II and aVR) in the Ca-deficient group II at 42 day of age as compared to the control. S wave amplitudes were decreased in most leads but the decrease was significant (P < 0.05) only at 28 days (lead aVL, Ca-deficient group I) and 42 days (leads III, aVR, aVF, Ca-deficient groups I and II). T wave amplitudes were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased at 42 days (leads II, aVR and aVF) in the Ca-deficient group II compared to the control group. Variations in QT, ST and RR intervals were insignificant in the Ca-deficient groups compared with the control. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in left ventricular diameter at end-systole and a reduction of left ventricular fractional shortening in the Ca-deficient group II at 28 and 42 days as compared to the controls. Right ventricular fractional shortening was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased only in the Ca-deficient group II at 42 days of age. These results suggest that dose-dependent dietary calcium deficiency alters variations in electro- and echocardiographic parameters which could reflect decreased cardiac function in growing broiler chickens.",

There was no significant difference between the ovarian stimulation protocols in the ratio of donor ewes responding to superovulation nor in the average number of corpora lutea. However, the number of transferable embryos recovered per donor ewe was higher in the PMSG+FSH group. The proportion of transferable embryos, unfertilised oocytes and degenerated embryos did not differ between the treatment protocols. The total pregnancy rate was 53.4% (179/335). Neither the developmental stage of the embryo nor the number of transferred embryos affect the implantation of embryos. However, the increased number of transferred embryos positively influenced the pregnancy rate. No difference was found in the pregnancy rate between synchronised and nonsynchronised groups of recipients. Thirty-six out of 45 donor ewes (80%) became pregnant within one year after the ET programme, indicating that ovarian stimulation and surgical ER did not affect adversely their reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-six 6-week old female New Zealand White rabbits were divided into two groups: ad libitum (AL) and 70% restricted (RS) feeding.At the beginning of the experiment the liveweights were practically the same: 0.99 ± 0.08 vs. 1.01 ± 0.08 kg in group AL and RS, respectively.At 18 weeks of age the body weight of Group RS rabbits was 84.7% (3.14 ± 0.24 kg) of the group AL (3.71 ± 0.31 kg).The apparent digestibility of crude protein was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in Group RS than in Group AL (76.5 ± 1.4 vs. 73.0± 2.7%).The daily water consumption was significantly (p < 0.05) higher (3.5 ml/g DM intake) in Group RS as compared to Group AL (1.9 ml/g DM).Since the average body weight in Group RS at 18 weeks was the same as that of Group AL at 14 weeks of age (3.14 kg), the comparison of the live body measures and indices was based on these ages.Animals fed ad libitum or restricted show no differences at the defined age in most live body measurements except in heart girth and rump width, which were significantly (p < 0.05) shorter in Group AL than in Group RS (29.3 ± 0.8, 5.7 ± 0.5 and 30.7 ± 1.0, 6.2 ± 0.3 cm, respectively).Body capacity was significantly (p < 0.05) smaller in Group AL, as the head capacity-body capacity proportion was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in Group AL than in Group RS (1653.1 ± 134.5, 22.0 ± 2.5 and 1913.7 ± 168.7, 17.7 ± 1.9, respectively).Due to restricted feeding the growth of the head proved to be less intensive than that of the body at the same body weight.The body in these does tended to be wider.Since the head in comparison to length or capacity of the body was smaller in does fed 70% of ad libitum, it could be concluded that the development of body parts of restricted-fed does was unequal (allometric growth).The effect of feed restriction reflected in lower dry matter and fat, and a higher ash and protein content both in total body and in dry matter composition of rabbits at 18 weeks of age.Restricted feeding delayed sexual maturity (69 vs. 92% of rabbits) with later starting ovarian activity, weaker ovarian responsiveness, and a smaller number of tertiary follicles on the ovarian surface.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of retinoid and carotenoid metabolism with caecotrophy was studied in adult female New Zealand White rabbits kept in individual metabolic cages. Caecotrophy was prevented by the use of plastic collars. The dry matter, crude protein, fibre, fat and ash contents of hard and soft faecal samples were determined. The retinoid (retinol and retinyl palmitate) and carotenoid (canthaxanthin, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin) levels of the blood, liver, kidney, caecal content and faeces were also measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The prevention of caecotrophy resulted in a significant decrease of blood retinol (P < 0.001) and retinyl palmitate (P < 0.01) concentration but it did not cause any significant change in the retinol and retinyl palmitate contents of the liver and kidney. The caecal content (25.78 +/- 6.87 microg/g) and the soft faeces (34.52 +/- 10.48 microg/g) contained the retinoids in similar amounts. Various carotenoids were found in considerable amounts in different types of faeces, while in the tissues (blood, liver and kidney) these pigments did not occur in substantial amounts. Total carotenoid concentration was similar in the caecal content (11.23 microg/g) and in the caecotroph (13.85 microg/g). On the basis of the results it can be assumed that the retinoid content of rabbit feed could be lowered in the presence of adequate caecal function and caecotrophy.",

An ostrich with clinical signs of gastric stasis was brought to our clinic in a state of impending death that could not be reversed with emergency medical care. At necropsy, the koilin layer of the gizzard was uneven without ulcerations. The proventriculus was distended with food items without impaction and mucosal lesions. None of the most typical aetiological factors including foreign objects, Macrorhabdus ornithogaster and parasitic infection with Libyostrongylus douglassii was present. Histologically, the proventriculus was characterised by hyperplastic mucosa with luminal buds and necrotic cells in the lumen. Immunochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealed a high rate of proliferation in epithelial cells of the glandular and mucosal lining in the proventriculus neighbouring the affected gizzard: approximately 88.6% of the cells were immunoreactive as compared to 34.4% of the cells in control ostriches used for comparison. In conclusion, in the absence of gizzard contraction, the mucosal lining of the proventriculus is hyperplastic with a high rate of proliferation that may help compensate the distension due to the accumulation of food items.",

In the genome of strain H4956, a Jiv-like insertion was found similar to those described in reference strain NADL and in other BVDV 1, BVDV 2 and border disease virus (BDV) strains. The 133 amino acid Jiv-like sequence is inserted at nucleotide position 4984 (amino acid position 1533), 9 nucleotides upstream of that of strain NADL. The insertion showed 96% amino acid sequence identity with the cellular Jiv protein. In the genome of cp BVDV strain H115/PCR, an ubiquitin-containing duplication was found. The duplicated sequence started at nucleotide position 7978 (amino acid 2531) in the NS4B gene. The duplication contained a complete ubiquitin monomer of 76 amino acids and the complete NS3 gene starting at nucleotide position 5153 (amino acid 1589), which corresponds to the first N-terminal amino acid of NS3. The duplication was located further downstream of the known ubiquitin-containing genomic regions of cp BVDV strains, and it consisted of the shortest inserted nucleotide sequence. The insertions and duplication of strains H4956 and H115/PCR further confirmed that recombinations occurring at positions A and B are the most common mechanisms leading to the development of BVDV cytopathogenicity.",

Follicles were classified as growing and regressing follicles using ultrasonography. Altogether 48 follicles with a diameter from 20 to 56 mm were aspirated by transvaginal ultrasound guided follicular aspiration. Follicular concentration of oestradiol and progesterone in relation to the diameter of growing follicles showed correlations of r = 0.64 and r = 0.57, respectively. The redox potential derived index D2 varied from -448 to +431 in the collected fluids of the follicles. The accordance of the judgement of all follicles using both complexes of methods - endocrinological and ultrasonographic parameters vs. analysis of oxidation and reduction levels - reached 72.5%. This finding has shown that parameters of redox reactions do not correlate closely with the stage of follicular growth or regression as determined by in vivo scanning of ovaries or by assessment of follicular steroid concentrations. However, the measurement of redox potentials offers an opportunity to examine the whole process of metabolism in follicular cells and to forecast impairments of cellular performances. Changes of redox parameters in growing follicles enable an earlier prediction of their further development. The data demonstrate that growing and regressing follicles do not represent nonatretic, early atretic and atretic follicles, respectively.",

We aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism and investigated whether gintonin affects the concentration of the extracellular matrix remodelling factor matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in tears during rabbit corneal wound healing in vivo. Twelve eyes (six rabbits) were divided equally into three groups. All eyes underwent corneal de-epithelialisation. The control group received Tearin Free sodium hyaluronate 0.1%, the solcoseryl group received solcoseryl-120 concentrate, and the gintonin group received 2.5 mg gintonin in sodium hyaluronate 0.1%. All preparations were administered for 5 days and the concentration of MMP-9 was measured in tears via ELISA on days 0, 1, and 5. MMP-9 concentrations in all groups were increased at day 1 and reduced at day 5. Of note, we found a significant change over the time frame for the gintonin group (P < 0.05) but not for the control or solcoseryl groups (P > 0.05) Moreover, increased MMP-9 levels between days 0 and 1, and their reduction between days 1 and 5, were significant in the gintonin group compared to those in the other groups (P < 0.05); however, and once more, these changes were not significant between the control and solcoseryl groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, gintonin increases the concentration of MMP-9 rapidly within a day of injury, and decreasing it thereafter.",

The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of Streptococcus equi subspecies equi in horses resident in Croatia, in order to estimate the geographic distribution of infection. The study included 291 horse sera from the eight counties where the majority of Croatian horses are kept. Sera were tested by indirect ELISA (iELISA) for the presence of serum antibodies against S. equi protein A (SEQ_2190) and protein C (SeM). Positive horses were detected in all counties. Overall seroprevalence was 16.5 per cent (48/291), ranging from 7.1 to 29.6 per cent. A positive association was observed between the population size of the horses in the counties and the seropositivity rates: the larger the population, the higher the seropositivity. The results of this study suggest that S. equi infection is widespread in Croatia. Further investigation of the clinical manifestations, circulating strains and other characteristics of the disease in Croatia and raising awareness of the disease among horse owners are now required.",

The dog presented with abdominal pain, lack of appetite, tenesmus and without signs of defecation in the last 4 days. No important alterations were observed in the complete blood count and biochemistry. A substantial obstruction caused by a faecaloma and a prostate with increased size was observed on X-rays. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was confirmed by ultrasonography (size: 48.29 cm 3 ) and by testing the serum canine prostate-specific arginine esterase concentration (105.97 ng/mL). Colon impaction was resolved with rectal enemas within two days. BPH was treated with osaterone acetate. Ultrasonographic checks were performed after 60 and 180 days from the demission and a concrete constant reduction of prostatic volume and of the clinical signs was established. Faecaloma is an uncommon finding in male dogs, and it occurs especially as a consequence of BPH. Colon impaction in patients with BPH is usually subclinical, but it is important to underline how, in severe cases, perforation of the colon and faecal peritonitis can occur, leading to fatal conditions for the animal. In conclusion, prostatic enlargement should always be considered in male dogs suffering from colonic impaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) is a pathogen of great concern in free-ranging cetaceans. Confirmation and staging of morbillivirus infections rely on histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC), following molecular detection. As at the present time no specific antibodies (Abs) against DMV are available, two heterologous Abs have been used worldwide for the examinations of morbillivirus infections of cetaceans. One is a monoclonal Ab (MoAb) prepared against the N protein of canine distemper virus (CDV), whereas the other is a polyclonal Ab raised in rabbits against rinderpest virus (RPV). Both Abs are known to show cross-reactivity with DMV. In this study we compared the labelling quality and the neuroanatomical distribution of staining with these two Abs by means of IHC analysis. To this end, serial sections of the target organs from ten free-ranging stranded cetaceans, previously diagnosed as being infected with DMV by PCR and/or serology, were subjected to IHC. The brain, lungs and lymph nodes of one animal were found to be positive with both Abs. From two other animals, the brain and the spleen, respectively, tested positive only with the polyclonal Ab. In the positive brain tissues, multifocal immunostaining was observed, with similar staining location and extent, with the two antibodies tested. Our results suggest that the polyclonal anti-RPV Ab might have a stronger binding activity to DMV than the anti-CDV MoAb. Nevertheless, the elaboration and use of specific anti-DMV Abs might be essential to guarantee conclusive results in diagnostic and pathogenetic investigations.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of enterobacteria in the operating room of a veterinary hospital, the potential cross-contamination of samples, and to characterise the susceptibility profile of the isolates to antimicrobials. Sixty-five samples were collected from five different surgical procedures. These samples came from the hands and cell phones of the surgical team and pet owners, operating tables, and patients. Species detection was performed through polymerase chain reaction, genetic diversity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and susceptibility to antimicrobials through an antibiogram. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis isolates were obtained from eight samples, from the hands of the anaesthesiologist, the pet owner, and the surgeon; the surgeon's, the nurse's and the anaesthesiologist's cell phones, and two surgical tables. Furthermore, PFGE showed high genetic diversity among the isolates, which showed multidrug resistance. The identification of multidrug-resistant E. coli and P. mirabilis on cell phones of the surgical team is a major concern and, although no direct correlation was found, the isolation of these bacteria inside the clean area of the operating room shows the possibility of nosocomial transmission from cell phones to susceptible patients.",

Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels were assessed from 5 weeks before to 14 weeks after parturition. IGF-I concentrations were affected by parity (P < 0.05) and by the interaction of time and DP length (P < 0.01). NEFA levels were affected only by time (P < 0.01). S DP cows showed a shorter interval between calving and ovarian cyclicity resumption (P < 0.01) and a higher milk yield (P < 0.01) and fat and protein corrected milk (P < 0.01) compared with T DP cows. Decreased milk protein content was found in the SPS group compared to the SPT (P < 0.05) and the TPS (P < 0.05) group. In conclusion, a short DP length does not affect reproductive performances, except for hastening the resumption of ovarian cyclicity. A short DP appears to increase milk production and is associated with higher IGF-I levels both in the prepartum and the postpartum period.",

Rats in the different groups were fed diets containing meat-and-bone meal at an inclusion rate of 19 to 22%, low or high in peroxides and high in organic acids, with or without antioxidant.

At the end of the trial detailed gross and histopathological examinations were performed. Feeding high-peroxide feed mixtures for 21 days significantly (P < 0.05) decreased feed intake and liveweight gain, while high organic acid concentration had only slight negative effects. Antioxidant supplementation alleviated the harmful effects, especially in the high-peroxide group. The ingestion of rancid feed mixtures and the subsequent decreased feed intake caused a decrease of glycogen content in the hepatocytes, accompanied by a slight centrolobular fatty infiltration. Peroxides caused lymphocyte depletion in the spleen, decreased the size of Malpighian bodies and the number of lymphoblasts, and altered the spermatogenesis.

    "abstract": "In the regulation of energy metabolism, the liver plays an important role in the reinforcement of energy production. In periparturient cows the energy homeostasis turns into a negative energy balance that may shift the physiological regulation of energy balance towards pathological processes. Propylene glycol (PG), as a complementary source of energy used in the nutrition of dairy cows, alters systemic thyroid hormone economy; however, the exact mechanism through which highly glycogenic feed supplements impact liver metabolism is little known. Previous studies showed that only leptin receptors are expressed in the liver of cows, and now we report that leptin mRNA is expressed in the liver of cows as well. The present results show that the mRNA of leptin and its receptors are differentially modulated by the increased energy content of the feed consumed. Simultaneous changes in hepatic type I deiodinase activity suggest that hepatic modulation of the leptin system by PG supplementation may be mediated by an increased local thyroxine-triiodothyronine conversion. Since PG supplementation with simultaneous T4–T3 turnover and increased hepatic leptin- and short-form leptin receptor mRNA were not associated with a significant change in hepatic total lipid levels, it is suggested that the leptin system, directly or indirectly modulated by thyroid hormones, may represent a local defence mechanism to prevent fatty liver formation.",

In this study, the effects of a traditional, slightly modified vitrification method and vitrification using supercooled liquid nitrogen (VitMaster) applied for rabbit morula-stage embryos were compared. Embryos were equilibrated in a solution containing 1,2-propanediol (2.72 M) and glycerol (1.36 M) for 7 min and vitrified in 0.25-ml insemination straws after 1-min exposure to a vitrification solution containing additionally 1.0 M sucrose. Cooling was performed in ‘normal’ or supercooled liquid nitrogen. Regardless of the cooling method applied, high in vitro survival and development rates of vitrified embryos were obtained. All embryos were intact after warming, and 61 out of 65 (93.8%) and 23 out of 24 (95.8%) embryos developed to the blastocyst stage after 48-h in vitro culture of embryos vitrified in ‘normal’ or supercooled liquid nitrogen, respectively. The results suggest higher developmental ability of embryos vitrified in supercooled liquid nitrogen (91.7% vs . 83.1% of embryos vitrified traditionally developed to more advanced, expanding and/or hatching blastocyst stages). In vivo survival rate, tested for the traditional vitrification system only, revealed that 36.8% of embryos developed to term. The results show promise for establishing a fully successful method for rabbit embryo vitrification.",

First the cardiac output (CO) values (6.89 ± 1.27 L/min) were estimated by ECG-gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify the heart performance of the boars (n = 30), then total body skeletal muscle volume (MVTB; 48.7 ± 5.17 dm 3 ) was determined applying spiral computerised tomography (CT). The relative cardiac output value (RCO) was developed, expressing the relationship between CO and MVTB. Four superior [RCO value below 6.7 dm 3 / (L * min −1 )] and one minus variant [(8.97 dm 3 / (L * min −1 )] boars were taken into breeding. The best fifteen percentage of the first generation males (n = 30) was characterised according to their RCO values.

Comparing the existing five progeny groups, all of the ‘HP+’ groups differed significantly from the ‘HP-’ one, where the largest heart performance contrast found was 3.2 dm 3 / (L * min −1 ).

The measurements were performed at three different slaughterhouses on 9 different days under routine slaughtering conditions. The data of 405 pigs were analysed. The effectiveness of stunning was measured by the number of parameters at two (adequate and acceptable) levels. Current intensity had a predominant effect on the effectiveness of stunning and on the maintenance of unconsciousness. The duration of stunning played a role only as part of the electric work, which manifested itself in the maintenance of unconsciousness. Stunning proved acceptable in 99% of the cases, provided that the minimum current intensity of 1.02 Amp was secured. In 99% of the cases unconsciousness could be maintained at an acceptable level beyond bloodletting when the electric work was at least 8,089.38 Joules. Recovery of consciousness depends on the stun-to-stick period: the best time of bloodletting is less than 32 seconds from the end of stunning.",

Antibodies to M. bovis were detected in sera collected on all farms, and no farms negative for M. bovis were found. In 88.38% of the herds more than 50% of the sampled animals were infected by M. bovis . A total of 82.91% of the animals had antibodies to M. bovis . The proportion of seropositive animals was higher in the older age groups, and a significant difference was seen in the level of seropositivity between young and older age groups. The results show that M. bovis infection is widespread on Hungarian dairy farms, and its prevalence has increased in the recent decade. The high infection rate of Hungarian cattle herds with M. bovis shows that special attention should be paid to evaluating the aetiological role of M. bovis in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) cases because M. bovis has an immunosuppressive effect and can predispose cattle to other respiratory infections, too.",

In this study, we evaluated the possible role of deracoxib against the toxicity of doxorubicin on normal canine mammary epithelial cells. The effect of deracoxib and doxorubicin combination on cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Apoptosis was characterised by flow cytometry. Cell nitrite concentrations were measured with the Griess reaction. Deracoxib (50 and 100 μM) treatment decreased the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin at 0.9 μM in the cells, from 33.63% to 13.4% and 25.82%, respectively. Our results also showed that the reverse effect of deracoxib on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxic activity in the cells was associated with a marked (3.04- to 3.57-fold) decrease in apoptosis. In additional studies identifying the mechanism of the observed effect, deracoxib exhibited an activity to prevent doxorubicin-mediated overproduction of nitric oxide in the cells. Our in vitro study results indicate that deracoxib (50 and 100 μM) can be beneficial in protecting normal cells from the toxic effect of doxorubicin in conjunction with apoptosis by the modulation of nitric oxide production.",

Three hundred and seventy-five serum samples were collected from 132 Slovenian small, one-site pig farms. Samples were tested for PEDV antibodies utilising three different serological methods: commercially-available indirect ELISA, in-house blocking ELISA test and Immunoperoxidase Monolayer Assay (IPMA) test. One hundred and seventy (45.33%) tested samples were found positive by the commercially-available ELISA test kit, and 10 (5.68%) of these 170 samples found positive were positive by the in-house blocking ELISA. Only these 10 samples were collected from a farm where clinical signs of PED infection had been observed and PEDV was confirmed by RT-PCR methodology; the other 160 samples were collected randomly. Thirty-two samples with the highest S/P value obtained with the commercial ELISA were all negative with IPMA. Reasons for the high variance in the results obtained remain unclear; more research is required to ensure higher sensitivity and specificity in terms of PEDV antibody tests and other PED diagnostic methods.",

Supporting the urinalysis data, the histological findings of FSGS (glomerulomegaly and sclerotic glomeruli) were observed in renal cortex sections of Venus TG rabbits. Taken together, Venus TG bucks were diagnosed with FSGS; thus, this type of glomerulopathy could be a common disease in TG animals overexpressing GFP.",

At the age of 23, 30, 37 and 44 days, 8 young per treatment were euthanised. Double suckling and the subsequent higher level of solid feed intake after weaning were found to exert a stronger influence on the weight of the entire gastrointestinal tract and that of its individual parts (the stomach, small intestine, caecum and colon) than on its length. The quantity of the gastric content was found to rise with advancing age in both groups (from 36 to 70g and from 37.5 to 79g). In both groups the pH of the stomach was higher during the suckling period (4.5-5.3) than subsequent to weaning (1.6-2.4). The quantity of the caecal content also increased with age (from 4 or 8g), but on the 37th day significantly higher quantities of caecal content were recorded in DD rabbits (50.5g compared with 35g). The pH of the caecal content decreased more slowly from an initial high value (6.0 and 6.5 in SS and DD rabbits, respectively), and by the 37th day had settled at a low value (5.7-5.8) in both groups. The dry matter content of the caecal content decreased from 270-273g to 188-207g in both groups. Total volatile fatty acid (tVFA) and acetic acid (C2) concentration, which amounted to 66-88% of tVFA, rose; in SS rabbits they were at higher levels by the 30th day (53.6 and 42.2mmol/L, respectively), and remained at an increased level until the 44th day (P&lt;0.05). The ratio of C3:C4 was high on the 23rd day (2.5 and 2.4), but dropped at the age of 30 days (0.5 in SS and 1.7 in DD, P&lt;0.05) and, further, by the 37th day (0.2 in SS). In SS rabbits coliform count proved significantly lower (10 5 ) on the 23rd day than in DD rabbits (10 6 ). By the 37th day this count had decreased in both groups and subsequently remained at a low level (&lt;10 4 ).

These studies provide evidence that oPL is luteotropic and supports progesterone production in swine. The fact that oPL acted directly on ovarian steroidogenesis suggests that it may also play some role under non-pregnant physiological conditions.

Compared to the other groups, the LK415-treated chickens showed a significantly higher antibody response to IBDV on days 14 and 28 p.i. (P < 0.01) as measured by commercial ELISA. The present study indicates some potent immunostimulatory effects of the MDP analogue LK415 on the chicken immune system.",

After oestrus synchronisation and detection, transrectal ovarian ultrasonography was performed daily during two complete oestrous cycles.

The interovulatory interval of 14 oestrous cycles with double ovulations was 21.1 ± 0.3 days. The onset of ovulatory follicular wave occurred 4 days (−3.9 ± 0.3 days, n = 14) prior to the ovulation day (day 0) with a POF size of 6.9 ± 0.2 mm (n = 28). In goats with ovulations in both ovaries (78.6%), the emergence of the first POF occurred earlier (−4.1 ± 0.3 days) than the second POF (−3.3 ± 0.2 days, n = 11, P &lt; 0.05). No differences in the total number of follicles ≥ 2 mm were found between the day of POF emergence (4.3 ± 0.4) and the day before ovulation (3.5 ± 0.3, P &gt; 0.05). These results showed the existence of a delay between the emergence of first and second POF and suggest a weak dominance effect in goats with double ovulations.",

Bilateral arteriovenous fistulas were created between the common femoral arteries and the femoral veins, and the animals were serially studied with transthoracic echocardiography for a period of 12 weeks after the operation. Compared to the measurements obtained before the operation (week 0), the data obtained at the end of the experimental period showed significantly increased left ventricular volume measured by 2D-echocardiography (from 25.1 cm 3 to 43.8 cm 3 , p &lt; 0.0001 in diastole and from 8.6 cm 3 to 16.8 cm 3 , p &lt; 0.001 in systole), and left ventricular diameter measured by M-mode echocardiography (from 26.2 mm to 32.6 mm, p &lt; 0.0001 in diastole and from 17.1 mm to 20.6 mm, p &lt; 0.001 in systole). The size of the left atrium also increased in transversal (from 29.2 mm to 33.6 mm, p &lt; 0.01) but not in longitudinal diameter. In spite of a significant cardiac chamber dilatation over the 12-week period, left ventricular systolic functional variables (fractional shortening, FS % and ejection fraction, EF %), and also the left ventricular systolic and diastolic free wall thickness remained unchanged. In this study we demonstrated that chronic progressive volume overload resulted in gradual dilatation of the canine heart, and that the pathological process can be monitored successfully by serial echocardiography. We found that left atrial dilatation occurred without the development of mitral regurgitation and/or detectable left ventricular dysfunction.",

One-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were experimentally infected with six QX field isolates and the H120 vaccine strain. In the negative control birds, the spleen was MBL negative, while the CT showed scattered MBL-positive cells in close proximity and within the surface epithelium and germinal centre (GC)-like cell clusters. MBL was detectable in the ellipsoid-associated cells (EACs) and cell clusters in the periarterial lymphoid sheath (PALS) by 7 days post infection (dpi). In both organs, the MBL-positive cells occupy antigen-exposed areas, indicating that GC formation depends on resident precursors of dendritic cells. The majority of MBL-positive EACs express the CD83 antigen, providing evidence that coronavirus infection facilitated the maturation of dendritic cell precursors. Surprisingly, co-localisation of MBL and CD83 was not detectable in the CT. In the spleen (associated with circulation), the EACs producing MBL and expressing CD83 are a common precursor of both follicular (FDC) and interdigitating dendritic cells (IDC). In the CT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT) the precursors of FDC and IDC are MBL-producing cells and CD83-positive cells, respectively. In the CT the two separate precursors of lymphoid dendritic cells provide some 'autonomy' for the GALT.",

Among the six A. pleuropneumoniae reference strains the Biolog system identified one strain as A. pleuropneumoniae , four as A. lignieresii and one as H. paraphrohaemolyticus. There was no correlation between biotypes and serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae and the carbon source utilisation pattern and species identification by the Biolog system. our data indicate that the efficacy of the Biolog system used here could be improved by including phenotypes of more A. pleuropneumoniae strains representing a wider geographical occurrence into the database.",

Different drug combinations significantly decreased one-leg standing time. Induction of arthritis significantly increased TNF-α and IL-6 levels in synovial fluid and serum corticosterone and epinephrine in the PC group. Administration of drugs to birds of Groups T1 and T5 did not significantly change corticosterone concentration, while all different drug combinations decreased epinephrine level. Drug combinations that demonstrated better analgesic effect more strongly reduced serum epinephrine concentration.

Progesterone and cortisol compete with aldosterone for mineralocorticoid receptors, which results in increased Na + reabsorption during the postovulatory period. The purpose of the current research was to analyse the relationship of oestradiol-17β, progesterone and cortisol with RAAS in 23 mares during an oestrous cycle. During the preovulatory period, significant positive correlations of oestradiol-17β with renin and aldosterone concentrations and negative correlations of progesterone with renin and aldosterone concentrations were found. In contrast, during the postovulatory period, oestradiol-17β concentrations were positively correlated with angiotensin concentrations and progesterone was negatively correlated with this component of the RAAS. Cortisol concentrations were not correlated with the hormones of the RAAS, neither before nor after ovulation. This research demonstrates that, as occurs in other species, changes in the RAAS during the periovulatory period in mares may be modulated by variations in the concentrations of steroid hormones.",

The amplification of DNA fragments surrounding rare restriction sites analysis demonstrated high heterogeneity of genotypic profiles correlating with phenotypic resistance profiles. Multilocus sequence typing analysis classified the methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius strains as ST71, ST890, and the totally new ST1047.

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to its difficult diagnosis and complicated treatment, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in dogs is a challenge for the veterinarian. Several aspects connected with pathological changes during IBD still remain unknown. Since one of these aspects is the participation of intestinal innervation in the evolution of the disease, the aim of this study was to demonstrate changes in the number and distribution of intramucosal colonic nerve fibres immunoreactive to substance P (SP) arising as the disease progresses. SP is one of the most important neuronal factors in intestinal innervation which, among other tasks, takes part in the conduction of pain stimuli. Using routine immunofluorescence technique, the density of nerve fibres containing SP was evaluated within mucosal biopsy specimens collected from the descending colon of healthy dogs and animals suffering from IBD of varying severity. The results of the study indicate that during severe IBD the number of nerve fibres containing SP located in the colonic mucosal layer increases in comparison to control animals. The number of SP-positive intramucosal nerves amounted to 10.99 ± 2.11 nerves per observation field in healthy dogs, 14.62 ± 2.86 in dogs with mild IBD, 14.80 ± 0.91 in dogs with moderate IBD and 19.03 ± 6.11 in animals with severe IBD. The observed changes were directly proportional to the intensity of the disease process. These observations may suggest a role of this neuronal substance in pathological processes occurring during IBD. Although the exact mechanism of the observed changes has not been completely explained, the results obtained in this investigation may contribute to improving the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, as well as the staging of canine IBD in veterinary practice.",

    "abstract": "Despite the use of wide-scale vaccination programmes against the H9N2 virus, enzootic outbreaks of H9N2 avian influenza (AI) have often occurred and caused serious nationwide economic losses, particularly in broiler chickens. In this study, the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of nine recent H9N2s and a common vaccine strain were fully sequenced and compared with other representative Iranian viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Iranian viruses were grouped into the G1 sub-lineage with different clusters in which recent isolates (2014-2017) formed a distinct cluster compared to the vaccine group (1998-2004). All Iranian H9N2s exhibited low pathogenicity AI connecting peptide feature with an R/KSSR motif. Amino acid 226, located in the 220 loop of the receptor binding site, was leucine among the recent Iranian viruses, a characteristic of human influenza viruses. With an overall gradual increase in the genetic diversity of H9N2s, Bayesian skyline plots of Iranian HA and NA genes depicted a fluctuation and a relative stable situation, respectively. It is recommended to apply constant surveillance to assess any increase in viral human adaptation and evolutionary changes in circulating field H9N2s. Moreover, antigenic characterisation of the prevailing H9N2 viruses seems to be necessary for evaluating the possible antigenic drift from the vaccine strain.",

Two additional approaches, the ventral transpalpebral approach (VTA) and dorsal caudal transmuscular approach (DCTA) along with the DTOLA and DSTA were used in clinical patients. The most technically demanding approach was DTOLA; however, it provided the best visualisation of different anterior and posterior orbital structures. Visualisation of primarily the dorsal orbital wall, dorsal portion of the eye globe, and dorsal extraconal space also was achieved by DSTA. The VSTA enabled good visualisation of the ventral orbital floor and the ventral extraconal and intraconal space. In contrast, the TOA provided relatively poor visualisation of orbital structures, limited to the ventral orbital quadrant. Meanwhile, the VTA provided visualisation similar to the VSTA, while DCTA visualisation was limited to the dorsal and caudal orbital space. Orbital endoscopy is an effective and minimally invasive procedure that can be used for diagnostic and surgical orbital procedures.",

Although the mortality rate is low, economic losses may occur due to the clinical signs. Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) infection is known to cause respiratory and reproductive disorders mainly in cattle; however, it has been found to circulate among goats and sheep as well. In contrast to orf virus (ORFV), BoHV-1 does not induce clinical disease in goats. In this study, we aimed to detect the presence of ORFV by molecular methods and to uncover eventual simultaneous herpesvirus infections masked by orf disease signs. To this end, 82 goats, housed near to a cattle herd, were tested. By polymerase chain reaction (PCR), three goats (3.7%) were found to harbour both viruses, while an additional goat was positive for ORFV only. The PCR products were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed. This study revealed that ORFV and BoHV-1 may be present simultaneously in an animal causing a concurrent infection. These data should be taken into consideration when looking for secondary pathogens in diseased goats, and the prevention methods should be developed accordingly.",

The most efficient, fastest but at the same time the most expensive eradication method is depopulation-repopulation. In order to reduce costs, a number of farms prefer to perform their eradication process with continuous production using modified live vaccine (MLV) immunisation. However, the commercial PRRSV RT-PCR kits do not have the capacity to discriminate infected from vaccinated animals. In this paper, we describe a simple discriminatory duplex TaqMan RT-PCR assay based on common forward and reverse primers, as well as two differently labelled MLV- and wild-type PRRSV-specific probes. The discriminatory PCR test we designed is a fast and efficacious method for processing large quantities of samples. The assay is cheap, flexible, easy to apply in different herds using different MLVs, but should be checked, and can be modified based on the sequence data obtained during the permanent monitoring examinations. Owing to its simplicity the test can serve as a significant complementary assay for PRRS control and elimination/eradication.",

    "abstract": "During plant cultivation, the pesticides can get into the tissue of vegetables due to crop protection processes, and thus into the food chain. Therefore, they constitute a potential risk to the consumer's health. Depletion of pesticides [spirotetramat (Movento), azoxystrobin and difenoconazole (Amistar Top)] was monitored by testing tomatoes treated individually or simultaneously and tomato juices prepared from the treated tomatoes. The investigations aimed to reveal any kinetic interaction between the compounds tested and changes in their elimination, and thus to assess their compliance with the official Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). The co-presence of pesticides prolonged the elimination of the individual compounds which reached significantly higher residue levels (P < 0.0001) in tomato, especially difenoconazole (45%) and azoxystrobin (50%) on day 8 after treatment that can cause food safety issues to the human consumers. However, the concentrations of pesticides applied alone or simultaneously were found to be below the corresponding MRL values after the withdrawal period in all investigated tomato and tomato juice samples. Accordingly, the investigated pesticides can be safely used simultaneously, their concentrations are in compliance with the legal regulations and thus their concomitant presence does not pose any risk to the consumers' health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This retrospective study was undertaken on the records of intraluminal diameter of the trachea in 185 dogs, in which hypoplasia of the trachea had been suspected. The relative size of the trachea was measured using the tracheal diameter (TD), thoracic inlet distance (TI), thoracic tracheal diameter (TT) and the width of the third rib (3R), expressed as ratios TD:TI and TT:3R. Thirty-five dogs were diagnosed as having tracheal hypoplasia. Bulldogs and non-bulldog brachycephalic dogs had significantly smaller measured trachea diameters compared to the predicted values calculated on the basis of their body weight. Radiographs of each dog were investigated by four observers. Inter- and intra-observer reliability (ICC inter , ICC intra ) was based on the measurements taken by four observers to evaluate the reproducibility of the protocol. There was a good ICC inter (0.8) and ICC intra (0.89) agreement. Craniocaudal tangential radiographs, centred on the cranial thoracic aperture, did not show a significant difference in tracheal diameter measurements compared to the right lateral radiographs. In conclusion, our findings indicate that bulldogs and non-bulldog brachycephalic dogs have smaller tracheal diameters than non-brachycephalic dogs.",

Hsp70 concentration decreased with the increase in the grade of histological malignancy. A strong positive correlation was found between the concentrations of Hsp70 and NO in the benign tumours as well as in grade I and grade II malignant tumours. The results indicate that the process of neoplastic transformation in the canine mammary gland is related to a significant increase in Hsp70 and NO concentration in tumour tissues, and an interdependence between Hsp70 and nitrite ion production can be observed.",

Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay (SCSA) is the flow cytometric method most often used for the detection of DNA lesions; however, some studies using that method reached confusing conclusions. The aim of this pilot study was to adjust and compare two alternative tests, namely the TUNEL test and the Nicoletti assay. The above-mentioned two flow cytometric methods capable of detecting the fragmented DNA of sperm were tested on 12 frozen-thawed stallion semen samples. The TUNEL test demonstrated much higher DNA fragmentation ratio than the Nicoletti assay (mean ± SD: 30.77 ± 13.03% vs. 1.93 ± 0.89%, respectively). A fluorescent microscopic check of the samples showed that TUNEL labelled the plasma membrane and the mitochondria in a nonspecific way, rather than detecting only the fragmented DNA, thus eventually resulting in a false positive sign. The Nicoletti assay is simpler, quicker and does not detect nonspecific binding; however, further analyses are required to determine its diagnostic value.",

The PapA-specific sIgA and IgG responses were significantly enhanced after immunisation with the Salmonella-PapA vaccine in the presence of CTB or LTB. The group immunised with the Salmonella-LTB strain promoted Th1-type immunity, whereas that immunised with the Salmonella-CTB strain produced Th2-type immunity. We concluded that both Salmonella-CTB and -LTB strains can enhance the immune response to PapA, and that the LTB strain may be a more effective adjuvant for APEC vaccination, which requires higher Th1-type immunity for protection. Thus, our findings provide evidence that immunisation with an adjuvant, LTB, is one of the strategies of developing effective vaccines against P-fimbriated APEC.",

Surgical intervention was performed in both stifles of nine horses (n = 18). The joints were randomly assigned to operated and sham-operated groups. Grafts 8.5 mm in diameter were harvested from the femoropatellar (FP) joint under arthroscopic control and the medial femorotibial (MFT) joints had AOT using mosaicplasty (MP) instrumentation, while the sham FP and sham MFT joints underwent arthroscopy and miniarthrotomy without transplantation, respectively. Synovial fluid (SF) parameters were evaluated at days 4, 14, 60 and 180. Data were analysed by two-way repeated- measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. During the first 10–14 days after surgery, lameness of degree 2–3/5 [American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) scores] was present, which disappeared after 60 days. Joints with transplantation showed significant increases in synovial white blood cell count (WBC), total protein (TP), substance P, C1,2C and CS846 epitope concentration at day 3 compared to baseline and shamoperated joints (P &lt; 0.05). These parameters returned to the baseline values by two months after surgery and remained within normal levels at 6 months postoperatively.",

In none of the lavages did the neutrophil count vary between five and 25 per cent or exceed 25 per cent, which are the borderlines for being termed ‘reactive’ or ‘pathological’, respectively. Epithelial cells were the most commonly represented cell type in all lavages. Bacteriological culture was positive in 16 out of 38 lavages, but specific pathogenic bacteria were not cultivated in any of them, and only transient microflora was present. Although the relationship between the presence of specific bacteria, neutrophil count and total cell count could not be statistically evaluated due to the absence of ‘reactive’ and ‘pathological’ lavages, transendoscopic lavage appears to be a reliable method for obtaining a sample for bacteriological culture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cytochrome P450 (CYP) oxidases are among the main metabolizing enzymes that are responsible for the transformation of xenobiotics, including clinically important drugs. Their activity can be influenced by several compounds leading to decreased efficacy or increased toxicity of co-administered medicines. Flavonoids exert various beneficial effects on human and animal health; therefore they are used as food and feed supplements. However, they are also well-known for their CYP modulating potential. Since the amount of CYP enzymes is highest in the liver, interaction studies are mainly conducted in hepatocytes, however, CYP activity in the gastrointestinal tract is also remarkable. In this study, effects of apigenin (API), quercetin (QUE) and their methylated derivatives trimethylapigenin (TM-API), 3-O-methylquercetin (3M-QUE) and 3′,7-di-O-methylquercetin (3′7DM-QUE) on the CYP enzyme activity was examined in IPEC-J2 porcine intestinal epithelial cells. Potential food-drug interactions were studied using flavonoid treatment in combination with inducer and inhibitor compounds. API, TM-API, QUE and 3M-QUE significantly inhibited the CYP3A29 enzyme, while 3′7DM-QUE did not alter its activity. Enzyme inhibition has also been observed in case of some food-drug combinations. Our results support previous findings about CYP modulating effects of flavonoids and highlights the possibility of interactions when flavonoid-containing supplements are consumed during drug treatments.",

Whereas earlier the ratio of individuals showing an OR ≥ 4 was only 32%, that of the group checked in 1996 was 59%. This increase could be attributed to 40 ewes, both of whose parents had proven to be homozygous carriers of the prolific gene. To develop the Prolific Merino breed, 21 Booroola Merino rams were imported from New Zealand, and mostly their frozen semen was used. Of these rams, one was not a prolific gene carrier, 8 were homozygous carriers, 10 were heterozygous carriers and two had not been identified yet. Of the 36 home-bred rams, 9 proved to be homozygous by parents, 11 heterozygous, 8 homozygous, one proved to be a non-carrier, and 7 rams and their frozen semen were to be progeny tested. Six thousand doses of frozen semen from a total of 33 animals (16 imported rams and their 17 home-bred offspring) are stored in plastic straws. Sixty-three % of this is semen reserve from rams of the FecBFecBgenotype, belonging to 10 ram lines. The remaining 37% is gene reserve intended for creating homozygous ram lines. Only one ram (no. 3244) was bought for the nucleus herd, the other ram lines were introduced into the herd by assortative mating, using intrauterine insemination.

RA feeding resulted in high RP concentration in the genital organs (testicles and ovarian follicles), indicating subclinical hypervitaminosis, while the BC content of genital organs decreased considerably. The retinoid and BC concentration of ovarian follicles (F1-F5) was in the same range, indicating continuous retinoid and carotene transport during the fast maturation period. Retinoid content of the genital organs was higher in layers than in roosters.

Gross and histopathological findings were dominated by widening of the hypertrophic and ossification layers of the physes of long bones as well as by thickening, unevenness and defective calcification of the cartilage trabeculae. In the parathyroid gland, vacuolar degeneration of the cytoplasm of glandular epithelial cells, connective tissue proliferation and, here and there, cyst formation were seen. Additional findings included severe cerebellar oedema and neuronal degeneration. The pancreatic, myocardial and intestinal changes typical of infectious stunting syndrome (ISS) occurred only in a mild form. Four-week-old chickens exhibiting 'leg weakness' had significantly lower blood inorganic phosphate concentration and tibial ash content as compared to healthy chickens. The disease was successfully transmitted by oral administration of small intestinal homogenate from affected chickens. In a second experiment, however, the disease could not be transmitted with intestinal homogenate sterilized by irradiation. Large doses of vitamin D3 reduced the rate of growth retardation and defective calcification of bones. The digestive enzyme activities of the pancreas and small intestinal mucosa of 'infected' chickens were decreased as is typical of ISS.",

    "abstract": "Two indirect ELISAs for the detection of antibodies against glycoprotein E (gE) of Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) in sera have been developed. The rec-gE-ELISA is based on theE. coli-expressed recombinant protein containing the N-terminal sequences of gE (aa 1-125) fused with the glutathione S-transferase fromSchistosoma japonicum. The affi-gE-ELISA is based on native gE, which was purified from virions by affinity chromatography. The tests were optimised and compared with each other, as well as with the recently developed blocking gE-ELISA (Morenkov et al., 1997b), with respect to specificity and sensitivity. The rec-gE-ELISA was less sensitive in detecting ADV-infected animals than the affi-gE-ELISA (sensitivity 80% and 97%, respectively), which is probably due to the lack of conformation-dependent immunodominant epitopes on the recombinant protein expressed inE. coli. The specificity of the rec-gE-ELISA and affi-gE-ELISA was rather moderate (90% and 94%, respectively) because it was necessary to set such cut-off values in the tests that provided a maximum level of sensitivity, which obviously increased the incidence of false positive reactions. Though the indirect ELISAs detect antibodies against many epitopes of gE, the blocking gE-ELISA, which detects antibodies against only one immunodominant epitope of gE, showed a better test performance (specificity 99% and sensitivity 98%). This is most probably due to rather high dilutions of the sera used in the indirect gE-ELISAs (1:30) as compared to the serum dilution in the blocking gE-ELISA (1:2). We conclude that the indirect gE-ELISAs are sufficiently specific and sensitive to distinguish ADV-infected swine from those vaccinated with gE-negative vaccine and can be useful, in particularly affi-gE-ELISA, as additional tests for the detection of antibodies to gE.",

The diet was formulated to meet the requirements for protein and net energy. RPMet supplementation had no significant effect on DMI (kg/cow/day), milk dry mass, milk lactose and milk urea contents. Responses for mean daily milk yield, mean milk fat and milk protein yields were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in cows supplied with RPMet than in controls. Mean daily milk yield, milk protein and milk fat yields increased by 2.4 kg, 108 g and 124 g, respectively. The mean daily milk protein and casein contents were increased by 1.8 g and 0.9 g and milk fat content by 1.2 g in 1 kg of milk, respectively. The results suggest that in cows fed grass silage and a grain compound mixture milk production is limited by methionine insufficiency, but milk production performance can be increased significantly by the addition of RPMet to the diet.",

Significant changes (p < 0.05) were observed in the time course of all parameters. Tissue TBARS concentration was higher in the brain than in the liver at hatching, while the latter organ was found to have more effective antioxidant defence during embryonic life. The concentration of TBARS increased up to the 10th day in the liver but only up to the 21st day in the brain, and the former was accompanied by an approximately 50% decrease of plasma antioxidant capacity. This suggests that the liver plays an important role in forming the antioxidant defence mechanisms of the blood plasma in broiler chicks.",

In order to investigate the efficacy of an experimental purine-free diet moderately low in protein, its effect on urinary uric acid excretion was compared with that of a commercial dog food and a commercial low-protein anti-uric acid diet. The experimental diet, commercial dog food and commercial anti-uric acid diet contained 10.0, 12.8 and 5.0 g crude protein/MJ metabolizable energy, respectively. Twelve Dalmatian dogs were subjected to a 3 × 3 Latin square study. Although the plasma uric acid concentration was significantly lower when the dogs were fed either the commercial anti-uric acid diet (18.7 ± 6.0 µmol/l, mean ± SD, n = 12) or the experimental diet (19.2 ± 8.3 µmol/l), when compared to the commercial dog food (29.2 ± 11.1 µmol/l), no significant decrease of uric acid concentration in urine collected before the morning meal was seen. The average concentration of urinary uric acid was 60 µmol/l. There was a significant increase in the urea:creatinine ratio in urine when the dogs were fed the experimental diet compared to the commercial anti-uric acid diet, confirming that the experimental diet contained more protein. The experimental diet lowered plasma uric acid and was relatively high in protein and thus may be suitable for use in growing and lactating dogs to prevent ammonium urate urolithiasis.",

    "abstract": "The actinospore consumption of copepods (Cyclops spp. ) was demonstrated by laboratory observations. It was observed that in experimental dishes the number of actinospores floating in the water decreased, or such actinospores were completely eliminated, in the presence of copepods. The ingestion of actinospores by copepods and their further fate were monitored by fluorescent staining and by conventional histological techniques. The actinospores were observed to have got caught on the filters of Cyclops spp. Two and a half hours after the copepods had been placed into water containing actinospores, their digestive tract was found to contain spores that had extruded their filaments from the polar capsules. After copepods having ingested the actinospores of the species Myxobolus pseudodispar had been fed to roaches, no muscle infection developed in the fish host. It is likely that Cyclops spp. can filter out actinospores floating in the water also from natural waters, thus decreasing the chance of development of myxosporean infections.",

To better understand the role of the ovarian nerves in the formation of cystic status, the morphology and steroidogenic activity of the ovaries of DXM-treated gilts after denervation of the gonads were investigated in this study. Ovarian denervation was performed on day 3 of the first studied oestrous cycle and then, on days 7-21 of the cycle, DXM was administered. Following neurectomy and DXM treatment, cysts, medium-sized follicles and corpora lutea were not present, while the number of small-sized follicles increased. Denervation and DXM application led to a reduction in the number of dopamine-β-hydroxylase- and/or neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerve fibres. The concentrations of progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone and oestradiol-17β in the follicular fluid and/or in the wall of small-sized follicles of the experimental gilts were lower than in the controls. A similar result was demonstrated for P450scc, 3β-HSD and P450arom protein contents in the small follicles. Our data showed that DXM was not able to stimulate the formation of cysts in denervated porcine ovaries, indicating that the ovarian peripheral nerves might participate in the aetiopathogenesis of polycystic status.",

In this study, indirect fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate the heparin binding site distribution upon capacitation of sperm from eight boars arbitrarily distributed into Groups I and II according to differential farrowing rates (Group I: ≥ 70%, Group II: < 70%). Additionally, the ability of sperm to bind to solubilised zona pellucida (ZP) was assayed in the presence or absence of heparin. Samples of two individuals of Group II showed lower percentage of B pattern in relation to other individuals (P < 0.001). The number of spermatozoa attached to ZP after 2 h of incubation in capacitating conditions with heparin was significantly lower than in its absence (P < 0.0001). These results suggest that heparin binding site distribution concerning capacitation may be indicative of the availability of proteins involved in the fertilisation process, specifically at the initial sperm-oocyte recognition. Differences in heparin binding site dynamics during capacitation may help identify a subpopulation of individuals with lower fertilising capacity and normal spermiogram, which is particularly useful at high-production establishments.",

The tumours were identified during necropsy, following euthanasia.

The primary liver cancer emerged in the left lateral lobe without evidence of any distant metastases. Histopathological and immunohistochemical investigations revealed a well-differentiated, trabecular, claudin-7-, claudin-5- and pancytokeratin-negative hepatocellular carcinoma. The Ki-67 proliferation index was 33%. During necropsy, a synchronously occurring benign, grade I type aortic body chemodectoma was also detected in the dog. This neuroendocrine tumour showed chromogranin-, synaptophysin-, neuron-specific enolase- and S100 protein-positivity, and the Ki-67 proliferation index was 2%.

    "abstract": "Decline in semen quality in humans and increased incidence of male reproductive problems could be caused by different factors, including pesticides that could mimic or block the action of endogenous hormones. If the decline in semen quality is real, and environmental chemicals are at least partially responsible for this decline, similar changes should be observed in animals that live in close connection with humans and are exposed to similar levels of pollutants. In the present study, the semen quality of bulls in the last 30 years was examined with respect to the year of birth. Furthermore, semen quality results were correlated to the total pesticide use in a limited geographical area. The results indicate a notable decrease in both ejaculate volume and total number of spermatozoa in ejaculates of bulls born in the late 1970s, while after that (until 2006) there was no obvious downward or upward trend either in ejaculate volume or in the total number of sperm cells. The amount of pesticides released into the environment increased about twofold in the given period, and linear regression analysis revealed a strong and statistically significant correlation between the amount of pesticides used and the total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate.",

The analysis of the PA gene of one isolate from 2010 suggests that it is closely related to several HPAI H5N1 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.2 and that, therefore, a reassortment event has occurred recently between low pathogenic and H5N1 highly pathogenic AIV.",

In 24 icteric dogs, gallbladder contraction was evoked by different cholagogues: the maximum reduction in gallbladder volume (%) for the three non-obstructive icteric dogs was 43.9% (range, 39.0-46.5%). The average gallbladder contraction of the 21 dogs with biliary obstruction was less than 5%. In conclusion, the stimulation of gallbladder contraction with orally applied magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) or Lipofundin can be well demonstrated by ultrasound in dogs.

The ruminal microflora hydrolyses a good part of NSPs, however, recently there have been attempts to enhance the rate of utilisation by using external polysaccharidase enzymes. In the present study the effects of an enzyme preparation (Rumino-Zyme) high in xylanase activity were studied on ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, parameters of energy and protein metabolism, milk yield, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and body condition score of high-yielding dairy cows. A lignolytic enzyme preparation produced by the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus was applied in the present experiment and fed to dairy cows at 34 g/day dosage in the period between calving and the 110th day of lactation. This preparation increased VFA concentration in the rumen from about 32 days after calving and onward. Increased VFA concentration was followed by an about 5 to 10% increase in milk production and an almost 0.1% increase in butterfat production. Increased VFA concentration produced more balanced energy metabolism in the experimental cows as indicated by the lower incidence rate of hyperketonaemia, and lower acetoacetic acid and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration in the blood of the experimental cows. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity was tendentiously higher in the control group and the proportion of cows that had AST activity higher than 100U/l was also higher in the control group. Both control and experimental cows showed balanced protein and acid-base metabolism throughout the experiment. Enhanced VFA concentration contributed to an improvement in energy balance in the experimental cows with a resultant improvement of feed intake and feed utilisation. Due to the more balanced energy metabolism postparturient body condition loss of the treated cows was reduced.",

With the advancement of pregnancy, the body weight (BW) of does significantly (P < 0.05) increased (control: 3255 g, day 28: 3938 g), while the dry matter, DM (control: 43.02%, day 28: 40.94%), ether extract, EE (control: 20.15%, day 28: 18.13%), crude protein, CP (control: 20.15%, day 28: 18.13%), and energy concentration decreased (control: 12.41 MJ/kg BW, day 28: 11.81 MJ/kg BW).

According to the equations created from the CT pictures, body fat (R2 = 0.871) and energy (R2 = 0.926) content can be predicted with high accuracy. The accuracy of predicting body protein content is much lower (R2 = 0.356), which can be improved by introducing the body weight as a new dependent variable (R2 = 0.797). It can also be concluded that, in contrast to other animal species, rabbit fetuses show considerable development not only in the last trimester of gestation but already from the second half of pregnancy.",

In this study, apoptosis was selectively induced in HEp-2 cells in the early stage [1-3 h postinfection (PI)] of BHV-1 multiplication, and this apoptotic process was realised through the caspase-8, and partially through the caspase-3, pathway. BHV-1 infection inhibited staurosporine- (SS-) induced apoptosis only if the SS was added at 6 h PI. The results of this study showed that the 'NO-apoptosis' relation was realised through the caspase-8 pathway ('outer membrane receptor' pathway) at a later stage of infection in apoptosis induced by BHV-1 + SS. Our previous report (Yazici et al., 2004) and this study together showed that BHV-1 might induce and inhibit cell-type-specific pathways of apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "The biological properties of an infectious bursal disease (IBD) virus isolated from bursas collected during an outbreak in a village chicken flock in Macedonia are described. The mortality rate was 50%. Two viruses coexisted in the bursas of infected chickens (IBDVwt and IBDVtc). The virus termed IBDVtc grows on chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells from the first passage. Specific pathogen free chickens inoculated with IBDVtc at passage level 4 did not develop any clinical signs of disease. Some discrete bleeding on the leg muscles was seen and the bursa of Fabricius revealed pathological lesions similar to those caused by classical strains. However, the bursa recovered quickly (bursa lesion score 2) by 14 days post infection (PI). We also found evidence of bursal repopulation by means of perinuclear antigen staining. Strong CD3 influx was evident at 4 days PI, and at 33 days PI the CD3+ cell finding was comparable to the control. The mean antibody titre was 9.2 log 2 at 14 days PI. The amino acid composition of VP2 in IBDVwt (222 Ala, 242 Ile, 253 Gln, 256 Ile, 279 Asp, 284 Ala, 294 Ile and 299 Ser) is described. The same sequence was found in IBDVtc, except for two point mutations, at Gln253→His and Ala284→Thr. Such amino acid substitution is responsible for partial attenuation and the ability of the strain to replicate in cell culture. None of the commercial vaccine viruses has a similar arrangement of amino acids in the variable domain of IBDV. This strongly suggests that IBDVtc originates from a very virulent strain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a concomitant infection of chickens with highly pathogenic IBDV and its mutant counterpart.",

In this study, the effects of OT on in vitro progesterone (P 4 ) secretion, phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and intracellular mobilisation of Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] i ) were investigated in porcine luteal cells during the early (days 3–5), mid-(days 8–10) and late luteal phases (days 12–14) of the oestrous cycle. Basal concentrations of P 4 and accumulation of inositol phosphates (IPs) were higher (P &lt; 0.05) on days 3–5 and 8–10 of the oestrous cycle than on days 12–14. Basal [Ca 2+ ] i mobilisation did not differ among studied periods of the oestrous cycle. Oxytocin (10 −7 M) enhanced P4 secretion and PI hydrolysis (P &lt; 0.05) by luteal cells harvested on days 8–10 of the oestrous cycle. Moreover, OT started to increase mobilisation of [Ca 2+ ] i at the 15th (days 3–5 and 8–10) or 30th second (days 12–14) in porcine luteal cells. It was concluded that in pigs OT acts as a regulator of steroidogenesis, stimulating P 4 secretion in mature CL. This OT action may be mediated by changes in PI hydrolysis and [Ca 2+ ] i mobilisation.",

To study the effect of these latter cercariae on fish fry, a few days old common carp fry (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to cohorts of xiphidiocercariae or echinocercariae shed by one or two snails acting as intermediate hosts. The observed pathogenicity of these cercariae was compared to the well-known pathogenic effect ofDiplostomumcercariae. AlthoughDiplostomumcercariae proved to be the most pathogenic, occasionally also the other two types of cercariae could kill the common carp fry by invading their body. Xiphidiocercariae ingested by the fish penetrated the intestinal wall and developed into metacercariae within the body of the fry. They could also get into the musculature through the skin. The much larger echinocercariae invaded the gill cavity where they became encapsulated, thus hampering gill function and leading to fish mortality due to oxygen deficiency.Diplostomumcercariae were more pathogenic than the cercariae of the other two flukes in that they were shed by the intermediate host in very large numbers. Although much less xiphidiocercariae and echinocercariae emerged from the intermediate host snails thanDiplostomumcercariae, the former could kill the fish fry already in lower numbers. These findings prove that fluke cercariae nonspecific to fish may exert pathogenic effects on fish, and presumably contribute to the early mortality of young fry placed out into fish ponds.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and antibiotic susceptibility of Enterococcus , Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas strains at four small animal clinics of Hungary in 2018, as these bacteria can reliably represent the level of antimicrobial resistance in the investigated environment. A total of 177 Staphylococcus colonies were found, including 22 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and 13 Staphylococcus aureus . As regards enterococci, 9 Enterococcus faecium , 2 E. faecalis and further 286 Enterococcus strains were isolated. The number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates ( n = 34) was considered too low for relevant susceptibility testing. Among staphylococci, the highest resistance was found to sulphamethoxazole (82.9%), penicillin (65.7%) and erythromycin (54.3%), while in the case of enterococci, resistance to norfloxacin and rifampicin was the most common, with 25.5% of the strains being resistant to both antibiotics. Ten methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and six vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains could be identified. Only 5.7% of the Staphylococcus isolates were susceptible to all tested agents, while this ratio was 36.2% among enterococci. The results of this study have revealed a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in Hungarian small animal clinics, which highlights the importance of regular disinfection processes and stringent hygiene measures in veterinary clinics.",

The samples were submitted for histopathological examination and the presence of the nucleic acid and antigens of RABV was tested by RT-PCR and indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT), respectively. Sixteen samples were found positive by all the three examinations. Three samples were selected for further study from animals in which the highest virus loads were detected. The partial sequence of the RABV N gene was determined and analysed from the samples of a buffalo, a cow and a donkey. The viruses in the samples were found to share 95-98% and 95-97% nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities, respectively. In comparison to reference sequences, a few amino acid substitutions occurred in the N protein antigenic sites I and IV in the immunodominant epitopes of the viruses detected in the cow and the donkey but not in the one from the buffalo. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RABVs sequenced from the samples belonged to genotype 1, Africa-4 clade, and formed two distinct sub-clades within the Egyptian clade. These findings indicate the circulation of RABV among livestock animals in the southern part of Egypt and raise public health concerns. The amino acid changes detected in this work may contribute to the antigenic diversification of RABVs.",

This casts doubt on the strict host specificity of this parasite. The largest subunit RNA polymerase II (rpb1) was used as a genetic marker of the parasite isolated from six host species of Perciformes (G. cernua from the Baltic Sea), Atheriniformes (Atherina boyeri from the Azov Sea) and Gobiiformes (Neogobius spp. and Zosterisessor ophiocephalus from the Black Sea and Ponticola kessleri from the Caspian Sea basin).

These findings confirm the broad distribution and host range of L. acerinae, but also indicate that certain patterns of host-driven intraspecific polymorphism may exist. Furthermore, the study revealed low similarity between the ribosomal RNA gene sequences of L. acerinae and the type species, Loma morhua (as well as other species of the genus). This suggests loose genetic association within the genus, and may raise the need for the taxonomic revision of L. acerinae.",

We found that the bovine IFITM3 gene showed a significantly different length and homology relative to other species, including primates, rodents and birds. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the bovine IFITM3 gene and IFITM3 protein showed closer evolutionary distance with primates than with rodents. However, cattle showed an independent clade among primates, rodents and birds. Multiple sequence alignment of the IFITM3 protein indicated that the bovine IFITM3 protein contains 36 bovine-specific amino acids. Notably, the bovine IFITM3 protein was predicted to prefer inside-to-outside topology of intramembrane domain 1 (IMD1) and inside-to-outside topology of transmembrane domain 2 by TMpred and three membrane embedding domains according to the SOSUI system.",

A total of 320 seven-day-old female pheasants were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (n = 40 in each), fed with a diet artificially contaminated with OTA [control (<0.02 mg/kg), 0.88 mg/kg, 1.14 mg/kg and 1.51 mg/kg] for 21 days (up to 28 days of age). The pheasant chicks were sacrificed at early (12, 24 and 72 h) and late (7, 14 and 21 days) stages of mycotoxin exposure to check the effect of OTA. Minimal feed refusal was found in the medium- and high-dose toxin groups (-9.8 and -7.9%, respectively), and body weight gain was nearly the same in all groups. The glutathione redox system was activated mainly in the liver, confirmed by significantly increased reduced glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activity during the late phase of mycotoxin exposure and at a high-dose treatment. The results suggest that pheasants have low susceptibility to OTA, and activation of the glutathione redox system has importance in this tolerance.",

Secondly, the physical, endocrine, and steroidogenic findings of this pharmaceutical protocol are also reported. Twelve postnatal littermate male kittens were administered acyline in a dose of 2.2 mg/100 g SC weekly for 2 weeks (ACY; n = 6), or placebo (PL; n = 6). All the animals were followed up until puberty when they were castrated. Serial faecal samples were collected until the age of 10 weeks for testosterone (T) measurement. The kittens achieved puberty without either age (236.5 ± 19.7 vs. 221.7 ± 23.7 days) or body weight (3.05 ± 0.15 vs. 2.78 ± 0.28 kg, P &gt; 0.05) differences between ACY and PL, respectively. Acyline suppressed faecal T concentrations for 3 weeks ( P &lt; 0.01). From the fourth week on, both groups had low concentrations up to the end of the follow-up period ( P &gt; 0.05). Histological assessment of the testes showed that ACY cats presented a reduced height of the epithelium ( P &lt; 0.01) due to the diminished number of germinal cells accompanied by an enlarged luminal area ( P &lt; 0.01) with cellular debris ( P &lt; 0.01). The immunostaining of P450c17 also appeared partially diminished in ACY testes.",

CDV antigens, immunopositive astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and granular neurons were seen in both the white and grey matter of the infected dogs. In the controls, alphaB-c immunopositive glial cells were seen in the white matter and around the Purkinje cells. In dogs with distemper, alphaB-c immunoreactivity was not observed in some of the glial cells around the Purkinje cells. A significant negative correlation of P < 0.01 level was found between areas of severe demyelination and the number of alphaB-c immunopositive cells in dogs infected with CDV.

The alphaB-crystallin/ total number of cells ratio was found to be significant in severely affected demyelinating areas (P < 0.05). These data indicate that there was a relationship between the degrees of CDV associated with demyelination and the level of alphaB-c expression in the glial cells.",

In this study, instead of using whole virus, recombinant protein of hexahistidine tag (His 6 tag) and VPX protein of IBDV expressed in E. coli was used as an alternative antigen to coat the ELISA plates. There was a good correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.972) between the results of the ELISA using plates coated with monoclonal antibody against His 6 tag and those of the commercial IBDV ELISA kit.

The fish were divided into three groups (I, II and III; 14 fish per group), those in Groups I and II were under food deprivation (0.40% of body weight), while Group III fish were fed to satiety. The study showed that the attenuated strain of C. salmositica did not cause anaemia and disease, and the fish were protected from clinical disease when they were challenged with virulent parasites. Parasitaemia in all fish vaccinated and challenged with virulent C. salmositica fluctuated and was relatively low; however, fish in Group III had higher parasitaemia than those in Groups I and II between weeks 8 and 14. The numbers of activated neutrophils increased [nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay] after immunisation with both Cryptobia and Aeromonas vaccines and they remained high throughout the experiment. Antibody production (ELISA values) increased after vaccination and were slightly higher in Group III. ELISA titres against A. salmonicida increased after vaccination and decreased after 5 weeks. The titres increased again after the vaccinated fish were given booster, and they were higher than those in the first vaccinated fish.",

In this work we have demonstrated the presence of PSCs in the peripheral blood of pigs, a species frequently used in transplantation studies as an animal model for human diseases. Differentiation into haematopoietic colonies (granulomacrophagic colonies, erythroid colonies and mixed colonies) has been carried out with the peripheral blood of adult and newborn pigs, using solely human commercial media. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were cultured in semisolid methylcellulose based media enriched with recombinant human cytokines, achieving granulomacrophagic-colony forming unit (GM-CFU) and mixed-colony forming unit (Mix-CFU) growth with erythroblastic lineage proliferation in the presence of erythropoietin (Epo). In all the samples CFU growth was associated with the presence of recombinant human cytokine. No evidence of proliferation in control plates without cytokines was found. From liquid medium culture, a population of macrophages and CD34+ fibroblast like cells were retrieved 21 days after sowing. These findings allow us to think about the direct application of this simple and standardised method in several work fields such as the study of pharmacological effects of many drugs over the haematopoietic line and in the study of new strategies in cellular therapy for some human diseases.",

Its diagnosis is based on vision testing, fundoscopy, electroretinography (ERG) and, for some breeds, on genetic tests. Typical signs of the disease are day blindness and cone dysfunction during ERG while fundoscopy does not show any abnormalities. The aim of this study was to compare behavioural findings, fundoscopic lesions and electroretinographic alterations in 12 cd-affected dogs (Alaskan Malamute, Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd, Dachshund, Yorkshire Terrier, Shih Tzu, Siberian Husky and crossbreeds) examined at our clinic. None of the examined dogs had any fundoscopic lesions, and all of them had normal scotopic vision with strongly impaired or absent photopic vision. Light-adapted transient, cone-mediated and steady-state, 31-Hz cone flicker ERGs were much below the 5th percentile limits of normality or even unrecordable, while the rod-driven ERGs were within normal values. Vision test and ERG results corresponded to each other and, combined with the results of fundoscopy, were typical of cd. To date, our research is one of the few studies in the world presenting ERG alterations compared with vision test findings and fundoscopic results in the course of cd.",

The aim of this study was to develop a mathematical model to calculate the required blood for transfusion, using parameters which could be easily determined on the spot. Twenty Holstein calves were assigned to two groups depending on body weight (100.1 ± 3.1 kg and 151.1 ± 3.0 kg, respectively). All animals were subjected to an anaemia induction protocol in isovolaemic conditions in order to reduce the packed cell volume (PCV) by more than one third. Twenty-four hours later, each group received an auto-transfusion therapy. In order to find a valid constant for specific weight categories with high confidence interval in cattle, we calculated the value of constant 'CC' for each individual, using a formula described for carnivores as a basis. The value of the constant for the 100.1 ± 3.1 kg and 151.1 ± 3.0 kg groups was 80.6315 ± 1.1069 and 76.5294 ± 2.5640, respectively. The comparison between the two groups demonstrated significantly different mean values (P = 0.0002, by t-test) and, furthermore, significantly different values of the constant distributions (P = 0.0001, by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).",

Overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in dogs with low-grade than with high-grade lymphoma (median OS of 6.8 and 4.7 months, respectively; P = 0.024). OS was not influenced by WHO clinical stage, WHO clinical substage, presence of splenomegaly, early administration of glucocorticoids or the time from the first presentation to the beginning of chemotherapy. There are no significant differences in clinical and laboratory parameters between low-grade and high-grade lymphomas. Boxer dogs are predisposed to T-cell lymphoma, with a predominance of high-grade tumour, especially pleomorphic, mixed small and large T-cell subtype. It is possible that Boxer dogs may respond less favourably to chemotherapy than patients of other breeds.",

Rat primary hepatocytes were cultivated for 72 h and were treated with 50, 200, 1000 ng/ml S1P. Cell-free supernatants were collected every 24 h. Cell viability was tested by a colorimetric method using tetrazolium compound (MTS).

In order to estimate the extent of S1P-generated oxidative stress, extracellular H 2 O 2 measurements were performed by the use of fluorescent dye. Based on the findings, S1P treatment did not cause cell death for 72 h at concentrations up to 1000 ng/ml. S1P did not influence the extracellular H 2 O 2 production for 72 h. The hepcidin levels were significantly suppressed in hepatocytes exposed to S1P treatment. Further studies would be needed to explore the exact mechanism of action of S1P.",

Adventitious placentation, or diffuse semi-placenta, is determined by the development of areas of accessory placentation between the cotyledons due to the abnormal growth of placentomes.After a full-term pregnancy, a 3-year-old Jersey heifer was referred for dystocia which resulted in the delivery of a dead calf. The cause of dystocia was found to be foetal malposition, while the placenta was physiologically expelled after dystocia resolution.Grossly, cotyledons appeared reduced in size and number in one placental horn, while the surface of the other horn was covered with microplacentomes. Numerous villous structures without trophoblastic coating were highlighted after histopathology. The dominant sign was an inflammatory reaction. The findings were consistent with inter-cotyledonal placentitis, which led to adventitial placentation.Diffuse semi-placenta compensates for the inadequate development of placentomes and may occur as a congenital or acquired defect. The outcome depends on its severity: in the worst scenario, pregnancy may not proceed beyond midterm and may be complicated by hydrallantois. In the case under examination, the dimensions of the cotyledons (from 2 to 10 cm) allowed for the natural course of pregnancy.",

Crickets were either housed individually or in groups, and larvae were group-housed. Six isonitrogenous feeds composed of 3.52% nitrogen were designed for all four insect species using four independent replicates with micellar casein: urea proportions of 100–0%, 75–25%, 50–50%, 25–75%, 0–100% and 100% extracted soybean meal. All selected insect species were able to utilise urea. However, urea as the only nitrogen source resulted in low final BW. In the HC, the JFC, and the YM on nitrogen basis urea can replace 25% of micellar casein without having any negative effects on BW and SR in comparison to the 100% micellar casein group. In the SW, a 25% urea level did not have a significant effect on final BW, but SR decreased significantly.",

Experiment I revealed no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the LN2 and -80 °C freezing methods, indicating similar effects on the analyzed parameters. Experiment II aimed to examine the influence of Spirulina platensis (SP) and Salvia verbenaca (SV) extracts added to egg yolk extender on cryopreserved sperm quality, utilizing the -80 °C freezing method. Various concentrations (1.25, 3.75, 6.25 and 8.75 µg*mL-1) of acetone (Ac-SP and Ac-SV) and hexanoic (Hex-SP), as well as methanolic (MeOH-SV) extracts, were added into the extender. A thorough assessment of post-thawed sperm quality parameters, encompassing motility, velocity parameters, viability, membrane integrity, abnormality and lipid peroxidation was conducted. The outcomes demonstrated that 1.25 and 3.75 g*mL-1 of Ac-SP and Hex-SP and 1.25 µg*mL-1 of AC-SV and MeOH-SV increased the post-thawed ram sperm quality.

After 8 days of treatment, no detectable signs of microscopic changes or oxidative stress in kidney tissue were observed. We detected a moderate increase in urea and creatinine levels in the blood as a sign of a slight decrease in kidney function. The most notable changes in our study were morphometric alterations in proximal tubules and glomeruli, both of which were considerably enlarged. The short-term application of inorganic Se to rats in a supratherapeutic dose induced mild functional and ultrastructural changes in the kidneys. The dose of inorganic Se used could be considered relatively safe for short-term application in situations where Se could be beneficial to the organism, such as the usage of known nephrotoxicants or high levels of oxidative stress in the body.",

The results revealed that ewes reared in fluorosis-free areas exhibited significantly lower plasma fluoride and significantly higher haemoglobin levels compared to endemic fluorosis areas (P < 0.0001). However, supplementation with 500 mg*kg-1 BW*day-1 of S. platensis significantly improved these two parameters compared to Group II (P < 0.0001). Ewes in the endemic area also displayed increased oxidative stress (P < 0.05), characterized by decreased ascorbic acid levels and catalase activity, as well as elevated levels of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde. Supplementation with 500 mg*kg-1 BW*day-1 of S. platensis enhanced the antioxidant status (P < 0.05) by increasing ascorbic acid levels and catalase activity and decreasing levels of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde. Moreover, this dose yielded similar average daily gains compared to lambs of ewes living in fluorosis-free area. In conclusion, S. platensis may serve as a promising solution for addressing endemic fluorosis in pregnant and lactating ewes.",

Antibiotic resistance was detected according to the EUCAST and CLSI in E. coli isolates. 2 isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics, one isolate was resistant to one antibiotic, one isolate was resistant to 2 antibiotics, and 11 E. coli isolates (73.3%) had multidrug resistance. Most frequent antibiotic resistances were detected against ampicillin (80%), tetracycline (66.6%), and chloramphenicol (66.6%). A double-disc confirmation test was used to detect ESBL production, and bla TEM , bla SHV , bla CTX-M and bla OXA genes were searched by PCR. The bla TEM (100%) gene was found in all resistant E. coli isolates, and the bla CTX-M gene was detected in only 3 (20%) E. coli isolates. None of the E. coli isolates contained the genes responsible for carbapenem and colistin resistance. Our results show that multi-drug antibiotic resistance and the bla TEM gene are frequent in E. coli from table eggs in Istanbul. This is the first preliminary study on ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in table eggs in Türkiye.",

The diatom test followed established guidelines for diatoms in water from the Bosna River. Microscopic examination revealed diatoms in the lungs of rats in L3 and L4 groups. Pathohistological findings showed varying degrees of changes including consolidation and inflammatory cell infiltration, dominated by lymphocytes and macrophages, with some samples also showing eosinophilic leukocytes.Significant differences were observed between animals whose cause of death was mechanical asphyxia (suffocatio) and those that were submersed for1 hour versus those that were submersed for 72 hours after death. Diatoms identified in group L4 samples 3, 4, and 5 included Navicula sp.

To minimize stress associated with blood sample collection, we used urine samples Sex hormone levels were measured over six months in pregnant and nonpregnant red pandas, to help understand changes in oestrogen concentrations during oestrus, post-mating progesterone concentrations and differences in ceruloplasmin concentrations. The results of the study revealed that female red pandas are polyoestrous, with a second oestrogen peak after mating. Progesterone changed in a cascading fashion, peaking and then gradually declining. Successfully mated females showed higher levels of progesterone than unsuccessfully mated females, which had no peak in progesterone after mating. Ceruloplasmin was measured to confirm pregnancy, but its value as a pregnancy diagnostic factor was not confirmed. These results provide significant insights into the reproductive physiology of red pandas and lay the foundation for additional research towards improving the management and breeding strategies for this threatened species.",

The blastomere for genetic analysis can be separated from a precompacted mouse embryo after a partial zona digestion with the use of a holding pipette. For the micromanipulation only two microcapillaries and micromanipulators are needed. The development of the biopsied embryos was studied during in vitro culture and in utero following embryo transfer. There was no significant difference between the treated and the control groups in the ratio of embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage, although the biopsied embryos were delayed in their development because they contained significantly fewer cells compared to the control ones at the same stage. Although there was no difference in the ratio of implantation, the development of the biopsied embryos in utero was also delayed 12-24 hours on the 9th day of pregnancy. No difference in development was visible from the 13th day of pregnancy. Statistically, no differences were found in the developmental ratio (number of developed fetuses/transferred embryos) of the control and treated embryos during gastrulation (9th day of pregnancy), at the beginning of organogenesis (13th day of pregnancy) and before birth (19th day of pregnancy). The embryo biopsy method presented here can be a new and useful tool for preimplantation genetic diagnosis.",

Cells were dissociated with trypsin and collagenase and maintained in a static culture system. For the estimation of LH release, the cells were incubated with various concentrations of mammalian GnRH (Lutrelef) for 6h. To determine the action of Antarelix (GnRH antagonist), the cells were preincubated for 1 h with concentrations of 10 -5 or 10 -4 M Antarelix followed by 10 -6 M GnRH coincubation for a further 6h. At the end of each incubation, the medium was collected for LH analysis. Parallel, intracellular LH was qualitatively detected by immunocytochemistry. Changes in the intensity of LH staining within the cells in dependence of different GnRH concentrations were not observed, but a significant increase LH secretion in pituitary cells was measured at 10 -6 M GnRH. Antarelix had no effect on basal LH secretion at concentrations of 10 -4 and 10 -5 M. After coincubation of pituitary cells with Antarelix and GnRH, Antarelix blocked the GnRH-stimulated LH secretion with a maximal effect of 10 -4 M, but the staining of immunoreactive intracellular LH was detected at approximately the same level compared to the pituitary cells treated with exogenous GnRH alone. These data demonstrate that Antarelix is effective in influencing the GnRH-stimulated LH secretion of pituitary cells in vitro. After administration of Antarelix in vivo, the GnRH-stimulated LH secretion of cultured pituitary cells was not inhibited.",

The distribution of treated quarters was compared with mathematical expectations based upon a random distribution in the case of Farm A. Results on mastitis incidences for different lactation stage groups showed an increasing incidence within subsequent lactation stage groups in Farm A. In contrast, in Farm B the mastitis incidence for lactation stage group between 35 and 100 days was the highest, but beyond 100 days the incidence decreased and reached the lowest value. Results gave strong evidence that the four quarters within the udder are not distributed randomly with respect to naturally occurring episodes of treated mastitis. More episodes than expected occurred in which only one or all four quarters were treated. Fewer episodes than expected with two or three treated quarters were observed. In both farms, the mastitis rate for rear quarters was higher than for front quarters, and the incidence of right quarter mastitis episodes was higher than that of left quarter mastitis episodes.",

Studies have suggested that greater availability, and therefore improved anthelmintic activity, is possible through temporary feed restriction. It is also recommended that anthelmintic drugs should not be given to animals whilst they are maintained on large feed intakes, particularly of lush pasture that promotes rapid gastric transit, as this may reduce drug availability and anthelmintic efficacy. Generally, feeding animals low-quality fibrous diets reduces the passage rate of digesta and allows more time for absorption of several anthelmintic drugs and their metabolites from the gut. Some kinetic data of drugs given to animals on such diets may be slightly different, but this does not necessarily indicate alteration of the dosages of the anthelmintic drug. Nonetheless, due consideration should be given to anthelmintic dosages under various dietary regimes if optimum efficacy is to be achieved at all times.",

Cefquinome concentrations were measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A non-compartmental pharmacokinetic model was used to fit the time–concentration curve and estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. The peak serum concentration (C max ) was 28.4 μg/mL at the time of maximum concentration (T max ) of 25 min. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 17.4 h. The area under the concentration–time curve (AUC 0–∞ ) was 103.7 μg/ml −1 h and the mean residence time (MRT 0–∞ ) was 21.3 h. In comparison with other animal species, the pharmacokinetics of cefquinome in Arabian camel calves showed faster absorption from the site of injection and slower elimination. Since cefquinome, as other beta-lactams, is a time-dependent antimicrobial agent, a single dose of 2 mg/kg b. w. might be sufficient against the most sensitive organisms in camel calves owing to its prolonged elimination phase. However, dose readjustment is required for cases needing concentrations above 2 µg/mL for 12 h or above 1 µg/mL for 24 h.",

Eleven Holstein–Friesian 6- to 8-month pregnant cows (4–10 years old) were used for this study. Gestational age on the day of surgery varied from approximately 180 days ( n = 1) to 240 days (minimum: 232 days, maximum 252 days; n = 10). The fetal medial tarsal artery was catheterised in pregnant cows with a polyvinyl catheter in dorsal recumbency under general anaesthesia. Although 5 out of 11 operations (45.5%) performed between 232 and 252 days of gestation were lost due to different causes mainly associated with peritonitis and septicaemia, the mean interval between operations and calvings was 42.5 days (between 27 and 95 days). It is important to emphasise that a well-trained surgical team is needed for bovine fetal cannulation in order to be able to decrease the risk factors during the operations. Due to the fact that after 5 unsuccessful cases none of the pregnancies were lost, this skill can be reached, and our technique can enable bovine fetal blood sampling for long-term endocrinological and physiological investigations before and during parturition.",

A thyroid gland enlargement was noticed, baseline serum thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations were low, and a low response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone administration was observed. Hypothyroidism was suspected. The horse was treated with levothyroxine for 1 year. TH concentrations returned to the normal range by week 4 of treatment. Thirty weeks after the initiation of levothyroxine therapy, the gait abnormality improved. Our findings suggest that the assessment of thyroid status and especially of the subclinical thyroid gland disorders in horses affected with shivering, as well as evaluation of the effects of levothyroxine on the improvement of clinical signs could be promising in establishing the aetiopathogenesis and/or treatment of shivering in horses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A 10-year-old, spayed female Shih Tzu dog presented with a history of progressive erythema and multiple crusts developing 85 days previously. The dog had been diagnosed with hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) 55 days prior to presentation and was treated with oral trilostane (2.86 mg/kg, once daily) that was discontinued due to a poor response. In addition to generalised alopecia, erythematous plaques and crusts were noted on the trunk, head and footpads. Lesional impression smears revealed numerous acantholytic cells and non-degenerated neutrophils. Histopathological findings demonstrated subcorneal pustules with acantholytic cells and intact neutrophils. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed pemphigus foliaceus (PF) with concurrent HAC. We wished to avoid glucocorticoids and, therefore, prescribed oral, once-daily azathioprine (2 mg/kg), modified cyclosporine (7 mg/kg) and ketoconazole (5 mg/kg). By day 71 post-treatment, the erythematous crusts had almost disappeared and the alopecia had improved considerably. However, by the subsequent follow-up examination on day 99, the clinical signs had reappeared due to the tapering of cyclosporine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report describing concurrent PF and HAC in a dog. Combination therapy with azathioprine, modified cyclosporine and ketoconazole was effective, and should be considered for dogs diagnosed with concurrent autoimmune diseases and HAC.",

The study was designed as a two-stage trial. In the first stage, blood asprosin and β-hydroxybutyric acid levels of 20 healthy Simmental cows aged 3–4 years were measured at the time of calving, and on days 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 postpartum. In the second stage, 200 cows were divided into two groups: (1) healthy ( n = 100) and (2) diseased (placental retention, hypocalcaemia, metritis, lameness, abomasal displacement, mastitis; n = 100); asprosin and β-hydroxybutyric acid concentrations of the blood were assessed on day 15 postpartum. In conclusion, the asprosin level was found to be at measurable levels in cows, and a negative correlation with β-hydroxybutyric acid was found. According to these findings, the data obtained from this study could be used for the prevention, control and treatment of some postpartum disorders associated with ketosis and for developing novel hypotheses concerning the actions of this hormone. It was concluded that further studies are required to reveal the associations between asprosin and postpartum disorders.",

The number of collected ticks varied considerably among the different sampling sites and years. Also, a statistically significant difference was found between months and observed number of ticks for each stadium. By statistical analysis of tick activity depending on microclimatic conditions, a positive and statistically significant relationship between temperature and the number of ticks for each life stage was established, but not for humidity. Dew had a statistically significant impact only on nymphs but not on adults. The infection rate of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. was the highest in March (46.5-51.2%) and the lowest in May (32.9-34.8%). The highest prevalence was detected in males and the lowest in nymphs. Since there is a positive and statistically significant correlation between tick number and prevalence, the ability to provide weather-based predictions of the seasonal patterns of current tick activity is important for the risk assessment of TBDs such as Lyme borreliosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Yersiniosis, caused by the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri , is a serious bacterial septicaemia affecting mainly salmonids worldwide. The acute infection may result in high mortality without apparent external disease signs, while the chronic one causes moderate to considerable mortality. Survivors of yersiniosis outbreaks become carriers. Y. ruckeri is able to adhere to, and to invade, phagocytic and non-phagocytic fish cells by using unknown molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to describe the kinetics of cell invasion by Y. ruckeri serotype O1 biotype 1 in a fish cell line (RTG-2) originating from rainbow trout gonads. The efficiency of invasion by Y. ruckeri was found to be temperature dependent, having a maximum at 20 °C. The bacterium was able to survive up to 96 h postinfection. The incubation of the cells at 4 °C and the pre-incubation of the bacteria with sugars or heat-inactivated antiserum significantly decreased the efficiency of invasion or even completely prevented the invasion of RTG-2 cells. These findings indicate that Y. ruckeri is capable of adhering to, entering and surviving within non-phagocytic cells, and that the intracellular environment may constitute a suitable niche for this pathogen that can favour the spread of infection and/or the maintenance of a carrier state of fish.",

Understanding the client's affective state may enhance the veterinarian's empathic response and effective communication. To understand better the unmet needs of clients, we collected data on service requests at the clinic and emotions that caregivers felt in the veterinarian setting. Understanding these difficulties may represent a first step to initiate the development of a psychological intervention targeting problems experienced by the caregivers. Assuming these difficulties according to the service requested for the pet, the owners might be interested in psychological support provided directly by the veterinary hospital. Our survey showed that a large percentage of owners expressed feelings related to caregiving in the veterinary setting, irrespective of the type of assistance needed, including apparently easy procedures. At the same time, they expressed a strong intention to receive a professional support. However, the crucial role of the psychological support is still difficult to accept even when it can be perceived as a right choice.",

In this study, 72 whole blood and 54 plasma samples from cats of different ages and sex were collected at three veterinary offices in the Czech Republic, and the copper (Cu), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that Cu was significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher in both plasma and whole blood of males (980 and 958 μg L −1 in plasma and whole blood, respectively) than in females (741 and 766 μg L −1 in plasma and whole blood, respectively), whereas no significant differences between males and females were found for Se and Zn. Similarly, no significant differences were recorded for any of the three elements according to age, although animals older than 7 years tended to have lower plasma concentrations of all three elements. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most prevalent diseases of domestic cats. The potential relationship between the essential microelement status in the blood of cats with HCM vs. cats with no clinical signs of HCM was taken into account, but the limited number of HCM-positive individuals did not allow any clear conclusion. Thus, the potential relationships between micronutrient status in cats and the incidence of HCM should be elucidated in further research.",

The most effective antibiotics against pasteurellosis were ceftiofur, tetracycline, doxycycline, florfenicol and tilmicosin. Of the strains, 12 proved to be multi-drug resistant (MDR). To combat antibiotic resistance, it is important to establish a pre-treatment antibiotic susceptibility profile. A well-chosen antibiotic would not only make the treatment more successful but may also slow down the spread of resistance and the evolution of MDR strains.",

Treatment efficacy was assessed using a murine model of kidney adenocarcinoma.Renca cells (renal cortical cells with adenocarcinoma) were subcutaneously engrafted in 30 BALB/c mice, then animals were allocated into three treatment groups: Group 1: CpG+anti-OX40, Group 2: CpG+3p-hpRNA, Group 3: untreated control. Treatment efficacy was evaluated based on tumour growth, the occurrence of metastases and overall survival.On day 28 post-implantation, experiments had to be terminated due to tumour progression. Although comparisons of survival times and primary tumour sizes thus became inconsequential, histological examinations provided valuable insights. We observed distinct variations in primary tumour characteristics among the different groups: Groups 1 and 2 displayed demarcations, while Group 3 exhibited diffuse tumours with necrosis. Lung metastases were evident in 70% of untreated mice, whereas none were observed in either of the treated groups.Our findings instil confidence in the potential efficacy of the treatments, thereby laying a solid foundation for future investigations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The establishment of a well-adapted and accurate feeding regimen is a fundamental determining factor in the maintenance of shark species in captivity. Replicating the natural diet in captivity is commonly accepted and recommended. Given the diverse nutritional composition of prey, supplementation may become necessary. The captive environment poses unique challenges, making sharks susceptible to an array of health issues, including numerous diseases. Mitigating these risks demands detailed husbandry practices, an appropriate physical environment and a balanced diet. Supplementation, encompassing vitamins and minerals, becomes imperative for the provision of essential nutrients. This complexity has rendered the formulation of an adapted feeding plan for aquarists exceptionally challenging. The scarcity of information in these species adds to the issue, mandating extrapolation from various shark groups and to species with analogous characteristics. This literature review concentrates predominantly on benthic and pelagic shark species prevalent in contemporary aquariums. The central argument posits that dietary choices in captivity rely on factors such as availability, quality and consistency of supply. The advocated approach highlights the importance of a balanced, diverse feeding that closely mirrors natural diets. It is then crucial to emphasize that these are general guidelines, and the specific dietary requisites may diverge between shark species. Collaborating with experts in marine biology, shark husbandry and veterinary care is imperative for the formulation and perpetuation of an adapted diet for captive sharks.",

    "abstract": "The work describes the effects of cimetidine on stress-induced gizzard erosions (Experiment A) and the influence of the long-term application (42 days) of the same drug on weight gain and feed consumption during broiler fattening (Experiment B). For Experiment A, 60 male, three-day-old chicks were divided into two groups: C (n = 30) - control chicks treated with 0.5 ml saline; CIM (n = 30) - chicks treated with cimetidine in a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight (b. w.) in-tragastrically. All chicks were stressed using a modified water-immersion stress method according to which the chicks, after 24 h of feed deprivation, were immersed in tap water (17 °C) for a few seconds. Under chloroform anaesthesia ten chicks from each group were killed 1, 2 and 3 h after the stressing. The morphometric analysis of gizzard erosion (GE) and histopathological examinations of gizzards were performed for each chick. In Experiment B, 32 one-day-old broilers of both sexes were used. The control group was untreated (n = 16) while the CIM group (n = 16) was fed the same diet supplemented with 10 mg of cimetidine per kilogram of feed throughout the fattening period (42 days). The results of Experiment A showed decreased mean length of the GE in the cimetidine-treated birds as compared with the GE lesions of the controls. In Experiment B, the treated chicks had reduced liveweight (1835.1 g), carcass weight (1474.6 g) and increased feed consumption (2115 g of feed per kilogram of weight gain) compared to the controls in which the same parameters were 1898.5 g, 1574.2 g and 1797 g, respectively. The results show that while stress-induced GE of chicks can be medicated pharmacologically, long-term application of the same substance impairs the results of fattening.",

    "abstract": "The biofragmentable Anastomosis Ring (BAR) is a mechanical device composed of absorbable material and creates an inverting, atraumatic compressive anastomosis with no foreign material at the anastomotic site after healing. The aim of the present experimental study was to assess the safety of oesophagoscopy in early days after oesophageal anastomoses performed with the BAR and to follow-up the healing of BAR anastomoses by in vivo endoscopy and autopsy examination. Thirty mongrel dogs divided into subgroups according to the time-points of endoscopy and autopsy (4th, 7th, 14th, 28th day) were used. There was no significant difference in the healing of anastomoses performed under or above the tracheal bifurcation. Pleural adhesions helped to cover and seal small subclinical leaks. The mortality was 13.3% (4 dogs) and the overall leakage rate 14.3%. We looked for bleeding, haematoma, erosion, ulceration and granulation tissue in the anastomosis. Due to the high mechanical strength of these anastomoses, oesophagoscopy was a safe, easy and feasible method for follow-up BAR intrathoracic anastomoses, with no significant difference between the number of lesions found with endoscopy as compared to the autopsy data. The overall sensitivity of oesophagoscopy to discover mucosal lesions was 73.1%. Endoscopy had no complications, therefore it is a useful method of follow-up and may help predict the normal or compromised healing of oesophageal anastomoses.",

    "abstract": "For lack of relevant data of the literature, the tetanus immunisation results obtained in the two sexes were compared in an animal model. Complete immunisation series of weaned, adult and aged guinea-pigs (20–25 animals/group) were performed with aluminium phosphate (AlPO 4 ) adsorbed purified tetanus toxoid (PTAP) as well as with typhoid-tetanus vaccine (TY-TE) containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both vaccines contained 5.0 Lf (limes flocculans, Ramon) per single dose of tetanus toxoid, purity degree: 1500 Lf/mg protein nitrogen (PN). Tetanus antitoxin titres (TAT) were measured after the first shot, and subsequently before and after booster. Compared to TAT of male animals, significantly lower titres were found in female animals after basic immunisation with PTAP in all the three age groups: 1.03 vs. 0.57, 8.75 vs. 5.64, and 0.27 vs. 0.15 IU (international units, related to the Copenhagen International Standard) per ml (sex-chromosome-dependent differences?), as well as in adult animals immunised with TY-TE, before booster: 0.07 vs. 0.02 IU/ml (hormone-dependent differences?). In the latter case the TAT results after booster were 14.49 vs. 12.89 IU/ml. Thus, the lower female prebooster titres were counterbalanced by a quick and effective increase of titres following booster. These results are in accordance with our previous observations in humans (Réthy and Réthy, 1986). From our observations with tetanus immunisation series on guinea-pigs it can be concluded that TAT may be influenced by the effects of sex chromosomes as well as of sexual hormones. During active anti-tetanus immunisation with LPS-containing vaccine (TY-TE) the lower adult female prebooster titres are presumably counterbalanced by the better functionality of the female immune memory.",

    "abstract": "The healing process of telescopic anastomoses was found in an animal experiment with 12 mongrel dogs. After the division of vessels an ileal segment of different length was invaginated into the lumen of the colon using single-layer interrupted sutures. The following four groups were used: Group A (n = 3): end-to-side ileocolostomy, single-layer interrupted suture (invagination length: 0 mm), survival time: 21 days. Group B (n = 3): invagination length: 20 mm, survival time: 7 days. Group C (n = 3): invagination length: 10 mm, survival time: 21 days. Group D (n = 3): invagination length: 20 mm, survival time: 21 days. At the end of the above survival times the anastomosis area was removed. The bursting pressure was measured and morphological as well as histological examinations were performed. In each case the 0-day look-alikes of anastomoses were performed using the remnant bowels, and bursting pressure measurements were done on these models as well. Anastomosis leakage did not occur. The serosal layer of the intracolonic part of the ileum disappeared during the healing process. The free surface of the intracolonic ileal segment became covered by the sliding mucosa of the colon and the prolapsing mucosa of the ileum. The following could be concluded after the experiments: The inner pressure tolerance of a telescopic ileocolostomy promptly after preparation is better than in case of another single-layer anastomosis. This fact results in increased safety against leakage on the first postoperative days. The inner pressure tolerance of the telescopic ileocolostomy increases during the healing process and it does not depend on the length of the invaginated part (0 day-20 mm: 56 mmHg ± 6, Group A: 252 ± 39, Group B: 154 ± 19, Group C: 249 ± 20, Group D: 298 ± 2). There is no difference in pressure tolerance between the telescopic and the end-to-side single-layer interrupted anastomoses after the healing process. The invaginated section within the lumen of the large intestine does not suffer ischaemic or any other kind of damage. This inexpensive and simple anastomosis technique could be useful in the veterinary surgical practice as well.",

The mitogenic activity of sheep amniotic fluid after chromatography on Sephadex G-50 was separated into two peaks. The peak having lower molecular mass corresponded to an elution profile of 125I-IGF-I. The first peak, having higher molecular mass, was eluted immediately after the void volume of column.

At the same time, an evaluation of different measurement methods (weight of epididymal fat pad, adipocyte morphometry, total body electrical conductivity) was performed. Outbred Wistar rats of 30 days of age were fed diets of different (0, 10 and 20%) protein level. The diets were supplemented with 4 mg/kg Cr as chromium nicotinate, and 100 mg/kg L-carnitine. The experimental feeding lasted 15 days, after a 5-day-long adjustment period. It was found that Cr addition increased feed intake. Both treatments caused changes in body composition, increasing fat and protein deposition. Organic chromium had no effect at either protein level, while L-carnitine improved the protein retention only at an optimum (20%) protein supply. No statistically significant correlation was found between total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) and body composition, which could be attributed to the great individual differences. A close correlation was found among total body fat percentage, weight of epididymal fat pad and the adipocyte surface. The data suggest that there is an interaction between dietary protein supply and the effect of repartitioning agents.",

Arterial blood gas analysis indicated arterial hypoxaemia and restrictive pneumopathy. In addition to the palliative treatment, fenbendazole was administered (50 mg/kg/24 h per os) for 14 days. The respiratory signs subsided within a short time clinically, but serial arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated an ongoing ventilation disorder. Repeated haematology, thoracic radiography, bronchoscopy and blood gas analysis were performed to follow the course of the disease. The most severe eosinophilia was detected after the beginning of the anthelmintic therapy, and the arterial pO2 level was permanently low. Arterial blood gas analysis provided the most adequate information about the course of the pneumopathy and it greatly facilitated the patient's medical management.",

It is not known, however, whether DMSO can enhance the permeation of gentamicin through biological membranes, leading to oto- and nephrotoxic side effects. A simple and reliable high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was applied for the quantitative determination of gentamicin collected from the apical and basolateral compartments of the porcine intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 cell monolayer using fluorometric derivatisation of the analyte with fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride (FMOC) prior to chromatographic run in the presence and absence of 1% DMSO. The lack of change in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) demonstrated that gentamicin and 1% DMSO did not affect IPEC-J2 cell monolayer integrity via the disruption of cell membranes. Chromatographic data also ascertained that gentamicin penetration across the cell monolayer even in the presence of 1% DMSO was negligible at 6 h after the beginning of apical gentamicin administration. This study further indicates that the addition of this organic solvent does not increase the incidence of toxic effects related to gentamicin permeation.",

Fortythree R. equi strains out of 44 previously nontypable ones isolated in Hungary could be allocated into one of the three new serotypes using the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test. The three new suggested serotypes are serotype 8 (proposed reference strain: HNCMB-138003), serotype 9 (proposed reference strain: HNCMB-138004) and serotype 10 (proposed reference strain: HNCMB-138005). Hyperimmune sera produced in rabbits against the new serotypes and reference strains gave precipitation only with their homologous antigens, and no crossreactions were observed. All of the previously nontypable isolates from clinical samples of horses (lung abscesses, intestinal lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes) proved to be serotype 8, while strains of serotypes 8, 9 and 10 could be isolated from nasal and rectal swabs of horses and from the soil. Serotype 9 dominated among the previously nontypable strains of swine origin. One of the previously nontypable human strains was serotype 10. This serotype was also isolated from pigs, horses and the soil. The description of the three new serotypes can help us reveal new correlations between the host species, geographical origin and serotype of R. equi isolates.",

Supplementation with dbcAMP increased the mean diameter of AFLSs during days 4-8 of culture compared with that of control COCs, irrespective of the concentration of dbcAMP used (0.5-2.0 mM). When the embedded COCs were cultured for 8 days with hCG, the diameters of AFLSs after 4 days of culture tended to be lower in the supplemented COCs than in the control COCs without hCG, irrespective of the concentration used (1-100 IU/mL). Supplementation with 10 IU/mL hCG increased the concentrations of anti-Müllerian hormone but not progesterone and oestradiol in the culture medium after 4 days of culture. Almost all oocytes collected from AFLSs had resumed meiosis by the end of culture, irrespective of supplementation of dbcAMP and hCG. These results indicate that although dbcAMP had a positive effect on AFLS formation and development, supplementation with hCG was detrimental. Moreover, hCG supplementation did not influence the luteinisation of granulosa cells in the AFLS for 4 days after the start of culture.",

Total volatile fatty acid (VFA) content rose in response to increasing NSC content. The molar ratio of acetate to propionate was the narrowest for Diet 1. Ruminal concentrations of ammonia and urea increased in response to the rising level of RDP. Flow of organic matter (OM) to the duodenum was increased for Diet 3, which resulted in the lowest apparent and true ruminal digestion of OM. Duodenal flow of total nitrogen (N) increased as RDP content decreased. The highest quantity of undegraded feed protein in duodenal digesta was measured in sheep fed Diet 3. Microbial N flow and microbial efficiency were unaffected by the diets. These results indicate that an NSC level lower than 25% and an RDP content lower than 50% did not exert any negative effect on microbial N production. This phenomenon supports the theory that if the level of RDP is lowered with a concomitant decrease in NSC, uncoupled fermentation cannot be observed.",

It could be established that the ratio of CD6+ cells decreased until p.i. day 6, but afterwards it started to increase and reached different values. The CD4+CD8+, the CD8+ and the CD6- cells were obviously higher virus positive than the CD4+ and the CD4-CD8-subsets, but essentially all subsets could be infected. The ratio of CD8+ cells increased during the disease, while the number of double positive cells decreased, and that of the CD4+ cells was variable. The viral antigen could be detected in a lower percentage of the CD4+CD8+, CD8+, CD6+ and CD6- cells of the pigs affected with the chronic form of the disease than in those with the acute form. During the experiments no viral antigen could be detected in the leukocytes of the pig that became convalescent, though the changes in its leukocyte subsets were very similar to those seen in pigs in which the viral antigen could be detected. The studies have revealed that essentially all leukocyte subsets can be infected with the CSF virus, but in very different amounts.",

A study was planned to evaluate the feasibility of this procedure in the management of abdominal cysts in sheep and goat. Adult ewes (n = 5) and one doe (n = 1) found to have abdominal cysts (one cyst/animal) on repeated survey ultrasonography (USG) were included in the study. The animals were restrained in standing position. A hypodermic needle (G-18) securely attached to a 10-mL Dispovan syringe was carefully passed under ultrasound guidance into the abdominal cyst in all these animals. Depending on the size of the cyst, 1.0-5.5 mL fluid was aspirated, and 0.5-2.0 mL of 20% hypertonic saline solution infused. The needle was thereafter kept in situ for 10 min. The maximum possible volume of the cyst content was reaspirated and the needle withdrawn. On day 7, sclerotherapy was repeated in five animals showing no appreciable reduction in cyst size by USG. USG was repeated on days 30 and 90. All the cysts except one responded to PAIR during this period. From this study it can be concluded that sclerotherapy using hypertonic saline (20%) is a minimally invasive, inexpensive, effective and safe interventional ultrasonographic technique for the treatment of abdominal cysts in sheep and goats. However, the procedure needs further evaluation after using different sclerotic agents of varying concentrations and duration of their retention in the cysts in a sufficient number of animals with cysts.",

The relative gene expression of transcription factors KEAP1 and NRF2 was not modified by the absorbent either. Still, the expression of GSS, GSR and GPX4 genes increased significantly due to the aluminosilicate supplementation. The results suggest that zeolite reduced lipid peroxidation in the blood plasma but not in the red blood cell haemolysate or the kidney.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the suitability of the polymorphism of STAT5A as a marker for milk traits in Ongole, crossbred cattle and Murrah buffaloes from Southern India. Blood samples ( n = 502) for DNA isolation and milk samples ( n = 222) from different genetic groups were collected from various farms. The gene variants upon polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) on the exon 7 region of STAT5A were subjected to GLM analysis to evaluate their association with milk production traits. The frequencies of C and T alleles at the STAT5A/ AvaI locus were 0.98 and 0.02 (Jersey crossbred), 0.94 and 0.06 [Holstein-Friesian (HF) crossbred], 0.97 and 0.03 (Ongole). T allele was not observed in Murrah buffaloes. The least squares mean lactation milk yield of CC and CT genotypes of STAT5A were 2,096.90 ± 48.63 and 2,294.41 ± 215.85 kg in Jersey crossbred, 2,312.92 ± 91.01 and 2,392.82 ± 207.66 kg in HF crossbred and 528.40 ± 22.10 and 396.37 ± 76.17 kg in Ongole cattle, respectively. The milk fat content of the CC genotype was higher ( P &gt; 0.05) in Jersey crossbred cattle. The CT genotypes of Ongole and HF crossbred cattle recorded a higher fat per cent than the CC genotypes. Significant associations were not observed in support of STAT5A as a marker for milk production traits in either Ongole or crossbred cattle of indicine admixture and no reason could be found to consider this locus as universal markers for milk production traits in indicine cattle and buffaloes. Considering the monomorphic nature of the gene in buffaloes and their higher milk fat content as compared to bovine milk, much remains to be explored regarding the underlying differences across the bovine and the bubaline species.",

Fertilisation success (pre-maturation, penetration, monospermy and efficiency) and nuclear maturation were evaluated. There were no differences among prematuration rates between groups (P = 0.221). Penetration rates were higher (P < 0.001) in the presence of progestagens (75.0%) as compared to the control (51.7%). However, no differences were observed in monospermy percentages (P = 0.246). The results indicated that supplementation with progestagens increased the efficiency of the in vitro fertilisation system (P < 0.001). An additional beneficial effect was observed in nuclear maturation with progestagens (P = 0.035). In summary, progestagen supplementation is an important factor to improve the in vitro fertilisation procedure.",

At the time of the clinical consultation the animal presented weight loss, anorexia and generalised lymphadenomegaly. After careful clinical observation and a detailed laboratory workup, the diagnosis of small cleaved cell lymphoma was established. It was classified as a stage III b multicentric lymphoma. Chemotherapy was initiated according to a classical COP protocol to which atorvastatin was added. After 34 months, the cat continues to enjoy an excellent quality of life with no clinical or haematological signs of lymphoma. This is the first report in clinical veterinary medicine about a new effective adjuvant therapy in feline multicentric lymphoma. Further studies are needed to confirm that the addition of atorvastatin can provide a regular, safe and improved treatment in feline lymphoma cases.",

The entire group of animals (n = 12) had a transverse resection of 5 mm length at the middle part of the right ulnar diaphysis. In Group A (eight beagles), the fracture was treated with XCB and metal bone screw. In Group B (four beagles), the fracture was treated with metal bone plate and screw. Radiological, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histological examination and mechanical testing were employed to evaluate bone healing and reaction of XCB in the host bone. In Group A, bone union was noticed in 6 out of 8 dogs (75%), starting from the 4th week onwards. Micro-CT and histological examinations showed that the XCB was absorbed and incorporated into the host bone. Incorporation of XCB was observed in 7 cases (88%); it started from the 10th week onwards and continued to week 32 after surgery. Biomechanical strength of the bone fracture site was higher in Group A than in Group B, and was similar to that of normal bone. XCB enhances the bone healing process and can be used as absorbable internal fixation for the management of long bone fractures in dogs.",

The three treatment groups received, in addition to the above doses of lead acetate, 4,500 mg/kg Dithane M-45 in the diet. The method was based on the OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals No. 415 (1981). Clinical symptoms and mortality were not found in the parent generation. The body weight of female animals decreased significantly before the pregnancy period. This tendency was also seen in males after the combination treatment. At the two high dose levels a remarkable body weight increase was seen in the female animals during the lactation period. As a result of treatment, decreased body weight of offspring was measured during the lactation period. No gross pathological changes were seen. Histological examination showed general tubulonephrosis in the experimental animals. It can be established that the administration of Dithane M-45 did not enhance the reproductive toxicity of lead acetate.",

    "abstract": "Somatotrophic and thyroid hormones were determined around the onset of reproduction in broiler breeders reared in two different housing systems [dark, close-sided house (CH) and conventional, open-sided house (OH)]. In both groups age-related changes were obvious for thyroxine (T 4 ), growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1); levels of T 4 decreased, especially between 24 and 28 weeks in both groups; concomitantly GH sharply increased over the same period. A transient peak in triiodothyronine (T 3 ) occurred between 25 and 27 weeks. The effect of housing was only present after the onset of lay. Between weeks 27-28 and the end of the period studied, the CH group showed higher levels of GH and T 3 but lower T 4 levels as compared to the OH group. A significant increase in GH after onset of lay, without any significant rise in T 3 or in IGF-I, could point to a relative insensitivity to high plasma GH levels. Changes at GH receptor level, together with an increased pituitary GH secretion and/or decreased GH turnover may be expected. This may indicate that hypothalamo-pituitary changes at the onset of lay not only imply changes of gonadotrophic cell function, but also other hormonal axes. The relatively decrease in T 4 without changes in T 3, may point to a decrease in the activity of the thyrotropic axis.",

Lesions of the sciatic nerves in chickens diagnosed as having MD lymphoma were various. No neoplastic and/or inflammatory cells were noted in the peripheral nerves of chickens diagnosed as having LL and ML. These results indicated that MD lymphoma could also develop in older chickens; thus, microscopic examination is needed to identify MD in older chickens showing lymphocyte-derived tumours.",

The histopathological changes were analysed by a semiquantitative method according to the scoring system of Lee et al. (1993). After evaluation of the five main degenerative parameters (muscle atrophy, internalisation of muscle nuclei, degeneration of the muscle fibre, perimysial and endomysial fibrosis, haematomas), it is evident that rabbits subjected to limb lengthening at a rate of 3.2 mm/day showed more degenerative changes than those limb-lengthened at 0.8 or 1.6 mm/day. Our study showed that the regenerative mechanisms were not endless. If the daily lengthening rate reached the 3.2 mm/day limit, the regenerating ability of the muscle decreased, and signs of degeneration increased significantly.",

Slow freezing methods result in acceptable survival rates; however, there are apparently no reports regarding the use of vitrification. The aim of the study was to establish methods for chicken embryonic cell vitrification, including development of a container which supported cryopreservation of large numbers of cells (to increase the probability of chimera production). Based on a preliminary study, vitrification seemed to be practical for avian blastodermal cell preservation. Pieces of mosquito net as carrier increased live cell rates compared to pellet form in media containing two macromolecules. Furthermore, we concluded that fetal calf serum in the vitrification medium could be replaced by polyvinylpyrrolidone, a chemically defined substance free of unwanted growth factors and potential pathogens.",

In 25 liver biopsy samples taken from dogs with portal vein hypoperfusion, an increased number of arterioles was detected in the portal areas (PAs) by the use of humanised anti-claudin-5 antibody. The increased number of hyperplastic hepatic arterioles per PA was 5-6, 8-12 and 15-20 in the case of small, medium-sized and large PAs, respectively.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by DNA sequencing were used to identify SNPs and variations in octapeptide repeats. Altogether three single nucleotide polymorphisms ( g 234 a , c 339 t and c 576 t ) and variations in the number of octapeptide repeat units (5 or 6) were found in the analysed part of the prion protein gene. All single nucleotide polymorphisms were silent, causing no amino acid changes. Significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in the genotype distribution of g 234 a polymorphism were observed when the homozygous genotype with a mutated allele ( caa/caa ) was compared to the heterozygous genotype -/ cag among healthy and BSE-affected cattle. The homozygous genotype caa/caa was characteristic of the group of BSE-affected cattle. Additionally, the homozygous genotype caa/caa was significant for the group of Simmental crossbreeds among healthy cattle. The allele and genotype distribution of the other polymorphisms was not significantly different among groups of healthy and BSE-affected cattle. The possible influence of a silent mutation on expression of the gene is not clearly determined and needs further investigations.",

In this study, maturation and development of the regulation of microcirculation were followed in the callus of rabbits.

In the second series, the same parameters were measured in the femur and in the developing callus 10 and 15 days following gap osteotomy of the tibia. There were no significant differences between the microcirculatory reactions of the intact femur and tibia. Basal blood flow could be verified in the callus on the 10th postoperative day. No vascular reactions could be elicited. Basal blood flow velocity was higher on the 15th day, when compared to the measurements on the 10th day. The substances elicited statistically significant differences in flow velocity, resistance and 50% recovery time in the callus on the 15th day. Blood flow reactions of the ipsilateral femoral and tibial bone marrow are identical, thus the femur can serve as a reference site for blood flow measurements in the callus. Regulation and maturation of callus microcirculation develop rapidly between the 10th and 15th days.",

The height of epithelial cells of the uterine and vaginal mucous membranes increased in intact female rats from 80 to 365 days of age, whereas in oestrogen-treated females the height of epithelium decreased. From 80 up to 365 days of age, the height of epithelial cells of uterine and vaginal mucous membranes of rats neonatally treated with repeated doses of hCG was similar to that in the corresponding control animals.",

Muscle tone and muscle mass were increased in both animals. Muscle stiffness was worsened by stress so that the animals fell into lateral recumbency. Blood chemistry revealed mildly increased serum creatine kinase activity. Abnormal potentials typical of myotonic discharges were recorded by electromyography. Cataract, first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and inhomogeneous myocardial texture by ultrasound suggested extramuscular involvement. Myopathology demonstrated dystrophic signs in the muscle biopsy specimen. The presumptive diagnosis based on the in vivo findings was myotonic dystrophy. Immunochemistry of the striated muscles revealed focal absence of dystrophin 1 and beta-dystroglycan in both cases. Cardiac and ophthalmologic involvement suggested a disorder very similar to a human form of myotonic dystrophy. This is the first description of myotonic dystrophy in wolves.",

Thirteen Klebsiella isolates (26.5%) were ESBL producers, nine isolates from the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (69.2%), and four (30.8%) Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. All carried the blaCTX-M-15 gene, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed them as multidrug resistant. All were resistant to all tested cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and aztreonam, 92.3% showed resistance to tetracycline, 84.6% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 69.2% to nitrofurantoin. No isolate showed resistance to imipenem and meropenem.

The tumour was surgically excised and sent for histopathology. Histopathological examination showed that the tumour was composed of homogeneous fusiform cells with low mitotic count, crowded within the perisinusoidal, portal and interlobular spaces, and entrapment of hepatocytes and bile ducts. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumour cells expressed vimentin and α-SMA, and were negative to desmin and cytokeratins. Based on the histological and immunohistochemical features, as well as some similarities with analogous entities in humans and animals, the tumour was classified as a myofibroblastic neoplasm originating from the liver.",

The aim of our study was to assess the effect of PACAP treatment during embryo vitrification on the developmental rate and the expression of the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor gene (Hbegf). Mouse embryos, obtained from superovulated females were allocated into the four treatment groups. In EM1 and EM2, the embryos were prepared for vitrification in an Equilibration Solution that was supplemented with 1 or 2 μM PACAP1-38, respectively. The embyos in groups CM1 and CM2 were not treated prior to vitrification but were cultured in a medium supplemented with 1 or 2 μM PACAP1-38 after thawing. The Vitrified Control group consisted of embryos vitrified and thawed then cultured without PACAP1-38 treatment. A non-vitrified, non-treated Fresh Control group was also used. After 24 h of culture, the developmental rate of the embryos, as well as the relative expression level of the Hbegf gene, as determined by qPCR, were compared among groups. Higher developmental rate and Hbegf gene expression level were found in the embryos treated with a higher concentration of PACAP. These results indicate that PACAP treatment has a beneficial effect on the survival and development of vitrified/thawed mouse embryos.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Malignant canine mammary tumours (CMTs) are subdivided as carcinomas (C), sarcomas (S) and carcinosarcomas (CS) according to their histological type. Due to the varying responses to different treatments, novel therapeutic approaches are required. Sodium butyrate (NaBu) is the first histone deacetylase inhibitor and exhibits anti-cancer activity in different types of human cancers. However, no study is available in the literature evaluating the effects of NaBu on CMT cells. Therefore, for the first time, we aimed to investigate the in vitro efficacy of NaBu on three subtypes of CMT cells. Primary cells were isolated from neoplastic tissues of three dogs with CMT. Cell viability, apoptotic percentage and changes in the cell morphology, apoptosis-associated gene and protein expression levels were evaluated. Our findings showed that NaBu decreased the growth of the cells and increased the percentage of apoptosis in three subtypes of CMT cells. Additionally, NaBu treatment affected the expression levels of genes and proteins associated with apoptosis, especially in S cells. Our preliminary results, for the first time, revealed the efficacy of NaBu in CMT cells and the importance of the histological subtype in NaBu response. However, the molecular classification of CMT and the underlying mechanisms of the different NaBu responses should be further investigated.",

Fresh blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein between 10:00 and 12:00 AM in the winter; serum chemistry and haematologic profiles were assessed. Serum chemistry and CBC differed significantly by age. Age-related differences were observed for albumin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine phosphokinase, creatinine, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, total protein, triglyceride, blood-urea nitrogen, non-esterified fatty acid, and beta-hydroxybutyric acid levels. Age differences in creatinine and C-reactive protein were not noticeable. Among CBC parameters, age-related differences were observed for white-blood-cell, lymphocyte, red-blood-cell, and platelet counts; hemoglobin level; haematocrit; mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular-hemoglobin concentration. Therefore, age-dependent variations should be considered when interpreting cattle laboratory results.",

Medical records of 24 female Holstein cows that underwent dehorning surgery were used in this study. In four groups, the sedation of animals was carried out by one of the four intravenous treatments: 0.1 mg kg −1 xylazine (Xyl group, n = 6), 5.0 μg kg −1 medetomidine (5.0 Med group, n = 6), 10.0 μg kg −1 medetomidine (10.0 Med group, n = 6) or 20.0 μg kg −1 medetomidine (20.0 Med group, n = 6). The clinical sedation score (CSS) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. The CSSs after intravenous administration of each α 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist increased rapidly and peaked at 12.5 (10.0–16.0) at t = 20 min in the Xyl group, 11.5 (10.0–15.0) at t = 10 min in the 5.0 Med group, 16.0 (14.0–16.0) at t = 20 min in the 10.0 Med group and 16.0 (14.0 – 16.0) at t = 20 min in the 20.0 Med group. A similar degree of bradycardia was observed after every sedative treatment. We conclude that the intravenous administration of 10.0–20.0 μg kg −1 medetomidine is appropriate for sedation of young cows without severe side effects.",

Drenching decreased the plasma concentrations of total protein, urea and creatinine and increased the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and chloride. Low rumination time prepartum resulted in higher concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, total protein and activities of alkaline phosphatase and GGT, while it decreased the activity of ALT and the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium.

The authenticity of the PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sensitivity of the semi-nested PCR was tested on serial dilution of bacterial cultures and extracted DNA. We found our new method more sensitive than the previous PCRs. We also screened ectoparasite samples, collected from a poultry farm in Hungary, and three out of the eight samples were positive for S. Enteritidis. This novel PCR seems suitable for the detection of S. enterica strains in poultry ectoparasites without the need of sample pre-enrichment.",

The material was collected from bitches with pyometra and from healthy ones. Blood was taken from the cephalic and uterine veins. APPs levels were quantified by ELISA. In the peripheral circulation, the Hp was higher in animals with open-cervix pyometra (OCP) than in the closed-cervix pyometra (CCP) and the control group. The Hp concentration was not correlated with age, with the presence of SIRS or with the type of bacteria (Gram-negative, Gram-positive or mixed flora). The ITIH4 concentrations in the peripheral blood did not differ significantly in the cases of pyometra. The Hp concentration in the local circulation increased in the OCP but not in the CCP groups, although the histopathological changes in the endometrium were similar. Peripheral Hp concentrations may be a useful tool in differentiating between the types of pyometra.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Canine cutaneous mast cell tumours (CCMCTs) are common in dogs and exhibit many unpredictable behaviors. This study aimed to encourage pathology laboratories in developing countries to routinely assess prognosis by applying commonly used histopathological grading systems and immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers. We performed histological grading according to both the Patnaik and Kiupel systems, determined the mitotic count (MC) and carried out IHC for the detection of Ki67, Bax, Bcl-2 and KIT in 54 CCMCT cases. MC was associated with both grading systems in terms of survival following diagnosis and prognostic factors differed among cases categorized by the cut-off value of 5. KIT patterns were associated with grading systems and MC. The cohort with pattern II had a lower survival rate than those with patterns I and III. Ki67 was associated with survival when evaluated over the cut-off value of 0.018. Bax expression was associated with both grading systems. Median survival time was longer in patients with lower Bax expression level. Immunohistochemical detection of KIT, Ki67 and Bax improves histopathology in predicting the prognosis. If IHC is unavailable, reports regarding MC and values from both grading systems are the most effective, convenient and cost-effective way to provide the most reliable prognostic data and guidance for the clinicians.",

Duodenal phases I-III and the duration of the migrating motor complex (MMC) were measured by an IMP catheter, which was introduced non-invasively into the proximal duodenum via the PEG by endoscopy, or through surgical placement in an invasive manner via duodenotomy. There were no significant differences in the length of interdigestive phases I-III between the groups. In tendency, pigs after laparotomy and duodenotomy demonstrated slightly prolonged median duration of phase I (P = 0.1) and phase III (P= 0.7), while phase II (P= 0.1) and the MMC cycle length (P= 0.6) seemed to be shortened as compared to pigs of the PEG group. In conclusion, simple laparotomy with duodenotomy did not affect the proximal duodenal motility activity measured by the impedance technique.",

The vaccines contained attenuated Winterfield 2512 and VMG-91 strains, respectively. The activities of enzymes were determined on postvaccination days 0, 2, 5 and 7. At the same time, post-mitochondrial supernatant, cytosolic and microsomal pellet protein concentrations were determined. As expected, the antibody titres against infectious bursal disease virus in the serum were increased in both tested groups in relation to each administered vaccine. Using RT-PCR, the presence of the VP2 gene fragment of virus in the liver of chicken was demonstrated 4 and 6 h after vaccination. The results of this study suggest that the two commercial vaccines modulate the activities of five enzymes tested, and that the two attenuated vaccines applied triggered induction and/or inhibition of phases I and II of biotransformation enzyme activities.",

    "abstract": "The effects of gastric feeding on intestinal motility are still under debate. In order to better define the character of the contractile activity in fed and fasting states, we used the impedance technique to investigate the duodenal time periods of the migrating motor complex (MMC) and the interdigestive phases I-III. During general anaesthesia, pigs (32-40 kg) were instrumented with a luminal impedance catheter into the proximal duodenum in fasting (n = 6) and fed states (n = 6, Muskator, 400 g, Muskator-Werk, Düsseldorf, Germany). Duodenal motility was recorded continuously for 4 h, which made it possible to determine the length of interdigestive phases I-III and the MMC cycle. Differences between the groups were compared by using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Feeding patterns were only found in pigs in the fed state. The subsequent MMC cycle length was shortened by 34% (p = 0.007) which was due to a shortened phase I of the MMC cycle (p = 0.014). While phase II seemed to be unaffected, phase III was prolonged by 31% after feeding had occurred (p = 0.012). The present study suggests that a standard maintenance diet disrupts the spontaneous MMC cycles by turning into fed pattern with the subsequent MMC cycle length being shortened. This was mainly due to a shortened phase I.",

Some protozoa have been reported to have a lectin activity involved in their attachment to the cell surface. The ligand-receptor interaction involved in Theileria annulata infection is unclear at present, in spite of the fact that some aspects of the process have been investigated. To this end, T. annulata piroplasms have been screened for lectin activity. Blood taken from infected cattle was first depleted of leukocytes and then subjected to ammonium chloride lysis in order to isolate the piroplasms. The piroplasms were homogenised and a crude membrane extract was prepared by centrifugation. To investigate lectin activity in piroplasm proteins, a simple screening procedure was employed for analysing piroplasm proteins binding to various lectin ligands. Numerous immobilised lectin ligands (L-fucose-sepharose, N-acetyl-neuraminic acid-sepharose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-agarose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-agarose, D-mannose-agarose, beta-D-glucose-agarose, alpha-methyl-D-mannoside-agarose) were incubated with T. annulata piroplasm crude membrane extract. The ligand-bound proteins were eluted and separated by a brief centrifugation and determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The present study suggests that a 32 kDa protein of piroplasm binds to D-galactosyl residues of the agarose matrix and that the binding is inhibited by galactose and not by the other monosaccharides tested.",

None of the four methods used allowed us to correctly identify the D. nodosus strains (neither the strains isolated from cases of ovine footrot nor those originating from type collection). Because of the difficulties encountered in obtaining a correct identification of D. nodosus , we propose a simple, rapid and effective way to achieve this task.

The observed distribution of all genotypes was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Anaemia was more common in younger piglets with RNASE1 GA genotype but in the blood of older GA piglets a higher count and percentage of granulocytes were noted. This could be related to the destruction of erythrocytes in younger piglets and enhanced host defence in older ones. ANG gene polymorphism was associated with the severity of iron deficiency in younger piglets. This is supposed to be linked with the different ability to protect immune cells against suppression and degradation during iron deficiency. in older piglets, this mutation differentiated the reactivity of the immune system. Varying levels of iron status and red blood cell indices in RNASE6 genotypes presumably resulted from the coupling of genes involved in iron metabolism and expressed in an age-dependent manner.",

The present report describes, for the first time, the main clinical and pathological features of congenital lung displacement in an English bulldog puppy. The defect involved the entire left lung, which was normally developed but rotated and shifted to the right hemithorax. The pathogenesis of congenital anomalies is largely unknown. characterisation of the genetic bases of these malformations is crucial for a reform of the breeding selection which is also aimed at correcting phenotypic abnormalities with a strong impact on individual health.",

Sixty ovaries were taken after slaughter from 30 clinically healthy mares. Regarding their size, the follicles were classified into three different categories, i.e. small (20–30 mm), medium-sized (31–40 mm) and large (≥41 mm), and follicular fluid (FF) was sampled from each single follicle. Intrafollicular PlGF concentrations were significantly increased in larger and medium-sized follicles compared to small follicles, and their values were 1.48 and 1.36 times higher than the systemic values, respectively. On the other hand, systemic PlGF concentrations were 1.3 times higher than those in the FF of follicles of small size. Intrafollicular P 4 concentrations were significantly higher in larger follicles than in small ones, and their concentrations were 6.74 and 3.42 times higher than the systemic values, respectively. Intrafollicular E 2 concentrations were significantly higher in large and medium-sized follicles than in follicles of small size, and their concentrations were 21.1, 15.4 and 8.35 times higher than the systemic values, respectively. Intrafollicular and systemic PlGF concentrations were strongly and positively correlated; nevertheless, no correlations between intrafollicular and systemic steroid hormones, PlGF and follicle diameters, PlGF and E 2 , or PlGF and P 4 were observed. This represents the first study to characterise systemic and intrafollicular PlGF concentrations in cycling normal mares, providing evidence that the bioavailability of this factor in follicles of medium and large sizes was higher than in small follicles, independently of steroid hormone concentrations. Further studies are needed to assess the presumable implications of PlGF in follicular angiogenesis in mares, similar to those already observed in women and primates.",

Multilocus sequence analysis was performed on the 16S rRNA and three housekeeping ( recN , rpoB , infB ) gene sequences obtained by PCR. In accordance with the results of phenotypic tests, the phylogenetic analyses confirmed the relatedness of the new strain (6036) to the family Pasteurellaceae . On the phylogenetic trees, strain 6036 appeared in a separate branch, closest to that of the type species ( Frederiksenia canicola ) of the genus Frederiksenia . These two bacteria shared 95.14 and 76.88% identity in their partial 16S rRNA and recN gene sequences, respectively. The rpoB - and infB -based phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain 6036 is most closely related to Bibersteinia trehalosi (with 90.58% identity) and [ Haemophilus ] felis ATCC 49733 (89.50% identity), respectively. The predicted genome identity values, based on the recN gene sequences, suggested that strain 6036 can be classified into the genus Frederiksenia as a novel species. A PCR method, specific to strain 6036, was developed to allow its rapid and accurate identification and differentiation from F. canicola and other species of Pasteurellaceae . The minimal inhibitory concentrations of 18 antimicrobial agents for strain 6036 were also determined.",

The Norberg angle (NA) was used to quantify the femoral subluxation on hip-extended radiographs. Archived standard ventrodorsal hip radiographs and lateral lumbosacral radiographs of the same dogs were retrieved and a single observer measured the SPA and the NA in each case. A total of 180 dogs from six different breeds were sampled. The SPA varied between 40° and 71.5° and the NA between 71.2° and 113.9°. The findings indicated that there are significant individual and interbreed variations in the slope of the pelvis.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common zoonosis prevalent in many countries with grave economic consequences. Most developed and developing countries have implemented the test-and-slaughter policy to protect public health and reduce economic losses in the cattle industry. The official diagnosis of bTB is based on assays dependent on cell-mediated immunity (CMI). CMI-based diagnosis demonstrates diagnostic incapability at late stages of infection, which could be overcome by diagnosis based on humoral immunity (HI). Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify and define the B cell antigenome of Mycobacterium bovis . In this study, the B cell antigenome of culture filtrate proteins (CFP) was defined by mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology. Four spots were detected on 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) against M. bovis- positive serum in an immunoblotting experiment. Twenty-one proteins were identified in four spots by proteomic tools, such as Mb2900, Mb2898, Mb0448, Mb3834c, Mb1918c, Mb0134c, Mb0358 and Mb1868c, which are known B cell antigens, including 13 new proteins, i.e. Mb3751, Mb2006c, Mb3276c, Mb2244, Mb1164c, Mb2553c, Mb2946c, Mb1849c, Mb1511c, Mb1034c, Mb2616c, Mb0854c and Mb2267. These new proteins identified by 2-DE and immunoblotting were the B cell antigens used in developing serological diagnostic methods based on HI to bTB.",

Four bilaterally symmetrical cerebellar nuclei were determined as nucleus lateralis cerebelli, nucleus interpositus lateralis cerebelli, and nucleus interpositus medialis cerebelli and nucleus fastigii from lateral to medial side. It has been previously confirmed that vascularisation of the cerebellar nuclei is carried out by intermediary branches of the rostral cerebellar artery and the caudal cerebellar artery. However, this study has confirmed that the caudal cerebellar artery has no contribution in the vascularisation of the cerebellar nuclei.",

EHV-1 gene63 mutant virus ( g63mut ) along with EHV-1 (Ab4) was used for intracerebral and intranasal infection of 3 and 17-day-old mice. Both viruses were recovered at the same frequency from tissues after infection. Two Welsh ponies were infected via the intranasal route with each of the viruses. Acute infection was monitored by virus isolation from nasal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes. Six weeks post infection, peripheral blood leukocytes were taken from ponies and in vitro reactivation was positive for both viruses. At autopsy, both viruses were isolated by co-cultivation from bronchial and submandibular lymph nodes. These findings indicate that the mutation of EHV-1 gene63 does not play a role in the establishment and reactivation from latency.",

The evident complexity and long-term programming of events in gametes and early embryos explain part of the difficulties encountered during the development of in vitro and in vivo methods such as multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), oestrus synchronisation, ovulation induction, superovulation, in vitro maturation and fertilisation, cryopreservation, transgenesis, nuclear transfer and cloning) and the occurrence of unexpected alterations of development, e.g. embryonic or fetal mortality, large-weight newborn syndrome and other dysregulations in imprinting or DNA transmission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) contributes to the acquisition of oocyte competence by modulating signalling pathways in cumulus cells (CCs), albeit much less is known about transcription factors (TFs) that orchestrate the downstream transcriptional changes. This work allowed to prospect TFs involved in FSH-mediated signalling during oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM). Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes underwent IVM with FSH (FSH+) or without FSH (control/CTL) for 22 h, and CCs were subjected to gene expression profiling. Five software identified reference genes for RT-qPCR (ATP1A1, UBB, and YWHAZ). The transcript levels of FSH-responsive genes HAS2 and PTGS2 (COX2) validated the experimental design. Among candidate TFs, MYC was down-regulated (0.35-fold; P &lt; 0.0001), and THAP11 (RONIN) was up-regulated (1.47-fold; P = 0.016) under FSH+ conditions. In silico analyses predicted binding motifs at MYC and THAP11 genes for previously known FSH-responsive TFs. Signalling pathways (EGFR, ERK, GSK3, PKA, and P38) may execute post-translational regulation due to potential phosphorylation sites in MYC and THAP11 proteins. Prediction of protein–protein interaction networks showed MYC as a core component of FSH signalling, albeit THAP11 acts independently. Hence, MYC integrates FSH signalling networks and may assist in exploring genome-wide transcriptional changes associated with the acquisition of oocyte competence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aino virus infection is responsible for epizootic and/or sporadic outbreaks of abortions, stillbirths and premature delivery among pregnant ruminants. The epizootiology of Aino virus infection is poorly defined in South Korea, therefore our aim was to assess its seroprevalence among sheep and goats. We also wanted to evaluate management and regional risk factors that might influence the frequency of infection. Between 2012 and 2013, 26 of 331 flocks (7.9%) and 139 of 915 heads (15.2%) were found serologically positive. In 2018, when samples were again collected in the same regions, 35 of 308 flocks (11.4%) and 89 of 735 heads (12.1%) showed serum-neutralising antibodies against Aino virus. Our results revealed that the age class and history of reproductive problems in the flocks are connected to an increased risk of being positive. The management risk factor attributes showed that preventive measures, such as the routine application of insecticide in farms, decreased the odds for seropositivity to Aino virus (OR = 0.453, P = 0.001). We observed a significant difference in the individual likelihood of being positive in the southern and western provinces with respect to that in the northern and eastern provinces, respectively (OR = 2.199, P &lt; 0.001 and OR = 2.177, P &lt; 0.001). The results of this study may serve as a basis for future epizootic studies on Aino virus infection in South Korea.",

Recent studies have reported that the chicken IFITM3 gene also plays a pivotal role in blocking viral replication, but these studies are considerably limited due to being conducted at the RNA level only. Thus, the development of a chicken IFITM3 protein-specific antibody is needed to validate the function of IFITM3 at the protein level. Epitope prediction was performed with the immune epitope database analysis resource (IEDB-AR) program. The epitope was validated by four in silico programs, Jped4, Clustal Omega, TMpred and SOSUI. Chicken IFITM3 protein-specific monoclonal antibodies were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay through affinity between recombinant IFITM3 protein and phage-displayed candidate antibodies. Validation of the reactivity of the chicken IFITM3 protein-specific antibody to chicken tissues was carried out using western blotting. We developed a chicken IFITM3 protein-specific monoclonal antibody using phage display. The reactivity of the antibody with peripheral chicken tissues was confirmed using western blotting. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first development of a chicken IFITM3 protein-specific monoclonal antibody using phage display.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The population and distribution of the European brown bear ( Ursus arctos ) in Slovakia are expanding as bears were observed beyond the southern border of the country in Hungary. This study presents the authors' experience with field anaesthesia of wild brown bears trapped in a custom-made container trap and of free-ranging individuals. A total of 25 bears were captured and translocated using a specially designed metal cage trap. The study compared the effectiveness of three anaesthetic protocols in managing both free-ranging and trapped bears. For juveniles, or small adults up to 70 kg body weight (BW), ketamine-xylazine mixture was used at doses of 3.0–4.0 mg kg −1 ketamine and 1.0–1.5 mg kg −1 xylazine BW. The immobilisation of free-ranging bears, which are usually attracted by municipal solid garbage, was performed remotely using PneuDart darts with 2–3 ml of anaesthetics. For this purpose, tiletamine-zolazepam-detomidine (T-Z-D) was preferred at a dose of 1.7–2.5 (T) mg kg −1 , 1.7–2.5 (Z) mg kg −1 , and 0.1–0.2 (D) mg kg −1 BW. Induction time was from 7 to 18 min post darting with the average of 12.04 min. The same combination was applied to bears trapped in a container trap, with anaesthesia lasting from 40 to 150 min. If T-Z-D was used, no further anaesthetic was needed. In all cases, anaesthesia was antagonised by atipamezole at a dose of 0.15–0.225 mg kg −1 BW. Atipamezole was injected at a half dose intramuscularly and a half dose subcutaneously at the time when the palpebral reflex reappeared and the bear was able to move his tongue. It was shown that the T-Z-D mixture is a safe, low-volume anaesthetic darting protocol that is reversible, has minimal adverse effects on physiological parameters, and has a sufficient duration. The results can be used to manage large carnivore populations in the Carpathian region.",

Six pairs of tibiae of dogs between 15 and 35 kg body weight were used in a cadaver study. Three groups were created with four tibiae in each group; intact (Group 1), osteotomy of the tibial tuberosity and tibial crest (Group 2) and TTA-rapid (Group 3). The tibiae were put under static axial compressive load, applied until failure. The force required to break the tibiae was termed maximal force (F max). The mean of F max was 8193.25 ± 2082.84 N in Group 1, 6868.58 ± 1950.44 N in Group 2 and 7169.71 ± 4450.39 N in Group 3. The sample size was small for a statistical analysis but as a preliminary result, we have determined the force (F max) required to break canine tibiae. Furthermore, we hypothesise that osteotomies result in weakening of the tibial structure.",

Clinoptilolite was added to the feed at a dose of 200 mg kg −1 body weight in the clinoptilolite-treated group ( n = 14), but was not added to the feed in the control group ( n = 7). In the milk samples ( n = 21) collected before the experiment, the Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and Fe values were 0.021 ± 0.020, 0.104 ± 0.01, 3.42 ± 0.32, &lt;0.000, 0.56 ± 0.34 ppm, respectively. At the end of the experiment (30th day), among the elements measured in milk samples collected from the clinoptilolite-treated group, only the Pb value (0.076 ± 0.01) was lower than the 0-day value of the clinoptilolite-treated group (0.104 ± 0.01) and the 30th-day value of the control group (0.105 ± 0.01) was found to be statistically lower. Changes determined at the end of clinoptilolite application in serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), albumin, glucose, urea and urine creatinine/urine total protein (uCr/uTP) values, which were interpreted as the effect of lead exposure before the trial, were evaluated as the positive effect of clinoptilolite. It was concluded that the addition of clinoptilolite to the feed in dairy cows caused a significant decrease in the amount of Pb in milk, and positive changes in the parameters related to oxidative stress in serum and in parameters related to renal function.",

In order to distinguish between benign and malignant canine mammary tumours, this study looked at the immunohistochemical expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in tumour and microenvironmental cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and BMP-2 in canine mammary tumours and their relationship with malignancy. In this investigation, 10 normal breast tissues were used as controls, and 28 benign and 46 malignant mammary tumours were taken from the archives of the Department of Pathology. The findings showed that malignant tumours expressed more Na+/K+-ATPase and BMP-2 than did normal breast tissue. Both markers had a negative or slight expression in benign tumours, whereas they considerably increased in malignant tumours. Both tumour parenchymal and microenvironmental cells in malignancies expressed Na+/K+-ATPase and BMP-2. Na+/K+-ATPase expression was observed to be more prominent in cells when compared to BMP-2. These findings also suggest that Na+/K+-ATPase and BMP-2 could be employed in the future to help diagnose canine and possibly human breast cancers earlier or as possible targets for treatment.",

Our research was based on 30 procedures in each group. All dogs were client-owned. Data were collected only for the study of cases that had a minimum follow-up period of 3 months. Intraoperative (IO) and postoperative (PO) complications were assessed, with the latter divided into two subgroups: major and minor. Results obtained for the TTA-rapid group: IO complications 23.3% (7/30), major PO complications 13.3% (4/30), minor PO complications 16.7% (5/30). Results of the mcTTA group: IO complications 0% (0/30), major PO complications 3.3% (1/30), minor PO complications 20% (6/30). Comparing the complication rates, we found that there was a significant difference between the two groups in the occurrence of IO complications (P = 0.01054); however, there was no significant difference in the incidence of major (P = 0.3533) and minor (P > 0.9999) PO complications between groups. Our results are consistent with the findings reported in the literature and suggest that both techniques are efficient and carry a relatively low complication rate.",

    "abstract": "Melarsomine is used intramuscularly to destroy adult heartworms when treating canine heartworm disease (HWD). This drug is highly irritative and can elicit local complications. Therefore, melarsomine should be injected into the paralumbar muscles by strictly adhering to the manufacturers' prescriptions. However, it is not known how to determine the optimal location of the needle during the injection process. Ultrasonography (US) of the epaxial (paralumbar) musculature was used as a new method to measure the cross-sectional diameter of the paralumbar musculature, to determine the required location of the injection needle, and to study the local side effects in two dogs with HWD. The macroscopic appearance of the melarsomine solution during injection was demonstrated by video imaging. Melarsomine was not fully gravitating, but its majority was spreading along the thickest fascia of the musculature. Three minutes thereafter, no ultrasound signs of the melarsomine solution were seen, suggesting a full absorption at least ultrasonographically. This procedure was simulated in vitro with methylene blue solution having the same appearance. Removing the injection needle only after 5 min post-injection could prevent undesirable leakage of the drug through the injection channel into the subcutaneous tissue. Ultrasonography can be a useful aid during the treatment of HWD with melarsomine according to this preliminary study.",

    "abstract": "The effects of cAMP-elevating compounds IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methyl­xanthine) and isoproterenol, and that of rutin (an effective superoxide scavenger) were studied on orthovanadate- (a putative protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) induced nitric oxide (NO) production in J774A.1 mouse macrophage cells. As we previously reported (Koncz and Horváth, 2000), rutin and sodium orthovanadate act synergistically to induce production of high amount of NO in J774A.1 cells. IBMX, an agent that can elevate cAMP level in the cells, can reduce the production of both the LPS- and rutin + orthovanadate-induced NO in macrophages. In contrast, isoproterenol, a non-selective ß-adrenergic receptor agonist, that reduced the LPS-induced NO production in macrophage cells, was unable to reduce the rutin + orthovanadate-induced NO production without negatively affecting cell viability. Moreover, isoproterenol dramatically enhanced the orthovanadate-induced NO synthesis in J774A.1 cells. Our previous study clarified that rutin and orthovanadate, in a specific concentration ratio of both, were able to produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate as a marker for H 2 O 2 , isoproterenol alone induced its oxidation but the rutin plus orthovanadate-induced H 2 O 2 production was reduced by isoproterenol. These observations have revealed that, in some cases, H 2 O 2 and superoxide (O 2 - ) scavengers can act in a reverse mode on macrophage cells depending on the presence or absence of orthovanadate.",

The applied model tests enable the assessment of toxicological consequences with particular regard to the life and nutrition of wild animals in the ploughed field among plants treated with pesticides. The application of different pesticide formulations on plough-land may pose a simultaneous chemical burden to wild birds. In this model study, manifestations of the interaction between an insecticide and a herbicide were studied in pheasants. The birds were placed on lucerne in cages (48 m 2 ) and sprayed once. The applied doses were: Sumithion 50 EC 1 litre/ha + Fusilade S 6 litres/ha (practical doses) and Sumithion 50 EC 5 litres/ha + Fusilade S 30 litres/ha. The analytically determined pesticide concentration of the lucerne was taken as a basis in the further treatment of fodder. The fodder of pheasants contained the following chemicals: 85 mg/kg Sumithion 50 EC + 510 mg/kg Fusilade S and 425 mg/kg Sumithion 50 EC + 2250 mg/kg Fusilade S. Sporadic deaths observed among the pheasants were of traumatic origin and not due to a toxic effect. The decrease of body weight was significant only at the higher dose levels. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of the blood decreased significantly in both dose groups. On the basis of the results obtained it can be established that at the dose level used in the practice the pesticides studied do not give rise to a toxic interaction in pheasants.",

Young breeding bulls from three Charolais, Limousin and Hungarian Fleckvieh breeding farms (farm A: n = 40; farm B: n = 9; farm C: n = 11) were used. The young bulls were kept in loose housing system, in small groups, and fed a diet based on maize silage and concentrate. The scrotal circumference of young bulls was measured at the widest part of the scrotum at the beginning and at the end of the test. Significant growth was observed (+13.6 cm; +8.9 cm; +10.5 cm, P &lt; 0.001) in scrotal circumference (SC) for all breeds except the Hungarian Fleckvieh (ASC2-ASC3: 37.5 vs. 37.6 cm). All differences among the means of the measured and adjusted SCs were statistically confirmed at the P &lt; 0.05 level of significance. A moderate to close positive correlation (r = 0.49-0.99) was calculated among the measured SC and the three types of ASC. The results suggest that method I (ASC1) and method II (ASC2) should be used by the breeders for adjusting scrotal circumferences in the practice.",

The study included seven dogs with early babesiosis (Group 1), seven dogs with cerebral babesiosis (Group 2) and seven healthy dogs (Group 3). Haematological and biochemical blood tests were performed in all dogs, and the results were analysed statistically. The Mann-Whitney rank test was used to demonstrate the differences in Mn concentrations, as well as other haematological and biochemical parameters between groups. In dogs in Group 2 with cerebral babesiosis, as compared to dogs in Groups 1 and 3, a statistically significant increase in serum Mn concentration was shown (P = 0.002 and P = 0.029) that may have been associated with the development of anaemia and/or impairment of liver function. Given the well-established neurotoxic effects of Mn in humans, experimental rodents and primates, additional studies on the role of Mn in the pathogenesis of the cerebral form of canine babesiosis are warranted.",

In previous studies, a heterogeneous infection in Cervidae and Caprinae was reported. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been frequently reported as the only prion disease in Korea that occurs in livestock. Thus, there is a possibility of transmission of CWD to Korean native black goats. However, PrP res has not been investigated thus far in Korean native black goats. We found strong linkage disequilibrium between c.126G&gt;A and c.414T&gt;C ( r 2 = 1) and between c.718C&gt;T and c.126G&gt;A ( r 2 = 0.638). In addition, the haplotype GTGTAAAC (representing codons 42, 102, 127, 138, 143, 146, 218 and 240) showed the highest frequency with 45.1%. Among 41 Korean native black goats, 20 animals (48.78%) were homozygous for the susceptible haplotypes (histidine at codon 143, asparagine at codon 146 and arginine at codon 154). Interestingly, we did not detect PrP res bands in any of the tested animals, including the 20 animals carrying potential scrapie susceptible haplotypes.",

The number of IGF-2 immunopositive interstitial cells was significantly higher in Group 1, whereas in Group 2 there were only two cases in which a few cells were IGF-2 immunopositive. IGF-2 immunopositivity was observed in the endometrial glandular epithelium in both groups. Additionally, interstitial fibroblasts and macrophages in the endometrium were also positive in Group 1. The concentration of plasma IGF-2 was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P < 0.05). The concentration was positively correlated with IGF-2 expression in the endometrial glands (r = 0.926; P < 0.001) in Group 1. However, a negative correlation was present between plasma IGF-2 concentration and IGF-2 expression in the interstitial endocrine cells of the ovary in Group 1 (r = -0.652; P < 0.05).

    "abstract": "Abstract Haemangioma (HA) and haemangiosarcoma (HSA) are among the most common splenic neoplasms in dogs. The survival time in splenic HSA is short, probably due to the lack of proper biological markers allowing early detection. We investigated the serum angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) concentrations in 9 healthy dogs and 40 dogs with abnormal splenic masses. The Ang-2 concentration differences were further compared in healthy dogs, dogs with splenitis, splenic HA and HSA. The results showed that the Ang-2 level in healthy dogs was significantly lower than in the splenitis and splenic HA cases. Moreover, the Ang-2 level was significantly higher in splenic HA than in splenic HSA. Conversely, no significant differences in Ang-2 level were recorded between healthy and splenic HSA dogs, and between splenitis and splenic neoplasms (HA and HSA). No significant correlations were observed between the Ang-2 level and (i) the clinical stage, (ii) histological growth pattern, and (iii) median survival time of splenic HSA dogs. In conclusion, serum Ang-2 concentration is a potentially useful biological marker for the discrimination of dogs with splenitis and splenic HA, as well as for the differentiation of splenic HA from its malignant form, HSA.",

These tumours are characterised by variable behaviour and clinical presentation that make prognosis an important and challenging task in the veterinary practice. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is known to influence several biological processes that are important in the cancer context and has been described as a prognostic marker for several human cancers. The aim of the present work was to characterise Gal-3 immunolabelling in canine cutaneous MCTs and to investigate its value as a prognostic marker for the disease. Thirty-four random cases of canine cutaneous MCT that were surgically treated with wide margins were included in this study. Gal-3 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and the results were compared with the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, Ki67 index, histopathological grades, mortality due to the disease and post-surgical survival. The majority of the MCTs (65.8%) were positive for Gal-3. Gal-3 immunolabelling was variable among the samples (2.7%-86.8% of the neoplastic cells). The protein was located in the cytoplasm or in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Gal-3 positivity was correlated with BCL2 expression (P < 0.001; r = 0.604), but not with Ki67 and BAX. No significant differences were detected between histological grades or in the survival analysis. Gal-3 expression correlates with BCL2 expression in MCTs. Although an efficient marker for several human neoplasms, the results presented herein suggest that Gal-3 immunolabelling is not an independent prognostic indicator for this disease.",

A 640-bp-long fragment of the mtDNA D-loop region was amplified and sequenced. The results showed that the investigated breeds have different genetic profiles although they share some common characteristics. We identified nine of the 17 haplogroups described in modern horses. Most of the obtained sequences fall into the M, L, G, and O'P lineages, which is indicative of the genetic profile of the ancestral mares that had probably been used at the initial stages of the formation of the breeds. The population of the Danubian Horse is characterised by a high prevalence of the Anatolian specific haplogroup G (45%), followed by the Western Eurasian specific haplogroups L and M (both about 21%). In the Hungarian Nonius breed we found the highest frequency of the Western Eurasian haplogroup M (44%), followed by the Middle Eastern O'P (26%) and the Central Asian specific E (13%) and G (13%). The Serbian Nonius showed a distinct genetic profile, characterised by a high prevalence of the rare European haplogroup D (67%), followed by the Central Asian specific haplogroup G (17%). The high percentage of haplogroups shared especially between the Danubian and the Hungarian Nonius indicates the possibility of a common origin of the two breeds. In contrast, the Serbian Nonius showed a specific genetic profile, which can be explained by a different and independent origin.",

The database of the largest dairy camel herds (Dubai, United Arab Emirates) was used in this study. The data of 4,084 camels included in the assessment were classified into six ecotypes (Emirati, Emirati cross, Black, Pakistani, Saudi-Sudanese and Saudi cross). The aim of the study was to describe the heritability of GL of camels and the breeding value (BV) of sires for this trait. The genetic parameters of GL were estimated by the General Linear Model method and two Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) animal models as well. The mean (±SE) of GL of camels was 384.3 ± 0.2 days. The direct heritability of GL (0.26 ± 0.06–0.36 ± 0.08) was higher than the maternal heritability (0.00 ± 0.05–0.13 ± 0.06) obtained. The maternal permanent environmental effect (0.15 ± 0.05) was similar to the results estimated previously in dromedary camel, but higher than the data reported by relevant sources in other species. Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that the GL of dromedary camels is a species-specific value similar to that in cattle, which is less affected by the maternal influence. Considerable differences (16 days) exist among male dromedaries in their BV for the GL trait.",

At the highest lying two settlements (more than 800 m above sea level), the prevalence of equine rhabdomyolysis is between 17 and 23%, while in the neighbouring villages in the valley it is less than 2%. The objective of our study was to clarify the role of selenium and vitamin E in the high prevalence of rhabdomyolysis in that region. Soil and hay samples were collected from each area to evaluate mineral content. Ten horses from the non-affected and 20 horses from the affected area were tested for serum selenium, vitamin E, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), muscle enzymes, lactate and electrolytes. Hay samples collected from the affected area had lower selenium content. Horses in the affected regions had significantly lower serum selenium (P = 0.006) and GSH-Px levels than animals living in the non-affected regions. A good correlation between erythrocyte GSH-Px and serum selenium concentration could be demonstrated (r = 0.777, P < 0.001). Serum vitamin E levels were low independently of the origin of the horse. Based on our results, selenium deficiency possibly has a role in the Transylvanian enzootic equine recurrent rhabdomyolysis syndrome.",

In the present study, we evaluated natural bacterial and parasitic infections in brown trout ( Salmo trutta m. fario ) collected from the Černá Opava river (Czech Republic) as a potential source of infections for rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) reared in a flow-through farm system fed by the same river. The prevalence of bacterial and protozoan infections in farmed fish was comparable, or higher, than for riverine fish. Despite this, none of the infected farmed fish showed any signs of severe diseases. Substantial differences in metazoan parasite infections were observed between wild and farmed fish regarding monogeneans, adult trematodes, nematodes, the myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae found in riverine fish only, and larval eye-fluke trematodes sporadically found in farmed fish. The different distribution of metazoan parasites between brown and rainbow trout most probably reflects the availability of infected intermediate hosts in the two habitats. Despite the river being the main water source for the farm, there was no significant threat of parasite infection to the farmed fish from naturally infected riverine fish.",

There were no differences in sperm motility ( P = 0.3372) or morphology between the groups, although the progressive motility was higher in thawed semen ( P = 0.0151), while the sperm vitality was higher in diluted-stored semen ( P = 0.00517).

    "abstract": "The duration and type of sleep and activity were monitored in a group of 9 Duroc piglets weaned at 7 weeks of age and placed into a cage of 1.2 x 1.2 m. Average air temperature in the cage ranged between 20 and 23 degrees C and relative humidity was around 70%. The piglets were fed and watered ad libitum. The measurements were performed one week after the pigs had been transferred to the cages, in the period between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. Approximately half of the 5-hour period of observation was occupied by sleep. There were, however, marked individual differences (ranges: 66 and 24%). Non-REM sleep occupied 79% while REM sleep 21% of the whole sleep time. REM episodes lasted, on the average, 3.8 + 0.58 min. The other half of the period studied was occupied by wakefulness which was devoted to movement, lying and, also, massaging and sucking each other. In some animals this activity was high and was the cause of unrest in the whole group. Differences in respiratory rate between non-REM and REM sleep recorded in heavier animals were the result of their heat load.",
