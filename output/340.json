While the focus of the authors might have been on biogeography and taxonomy, and this is emphasized in the title, the species descriptions include information on echolocation and feeding ecology, roosting sites and reproduction. This is far from a dry and difficult to read synthesis of the taxonomy of bats but rather an easy to read consolidation of much of what we know about the bats of southern and Central Africa. In many ways it is an atlas of adaptation and diversity within a single mammalian order. While diversity within the ungulates and carnivores of the region is widely appreciated (because of the size and activity patterns of members of these groups) the same cannot be said for the bats. Their nocturnal activity, small size and habit of roosting in hard to reach places means that they are easily overlooked and even when seen are little more than a blur in the night sky. Bats of Southern and Central Africa: A Biogeographic and Taxonomic Synthesis will go a long way towards rectifying this by providing an easily accessible synthesis of bat diversity.",

Developing effective human–wildlife conflict mitigation strategies requires an understanding of the conflict patterns, species involved and attitudes of local people living along protected area boundaries. We hypothesised that (1) there was a high level of human–wildlife conflict and (2) the local people would have less favourable attitudes towards problematic wild animals. We assessed patterns of human–wildlife conflict and attitudes of local people along the boundary of Chebera Churchura National Park, Ethiopia from 2012 to 2014. A total of 354 households were selected randomly for interview. A questionnaire survey, focus group discussions and direct field observations were carried out in the selected villages. The major types of human−wildlife conflict in the area include crop raiding, livestock predation, increased risk of livestock diseases and direct threats to human life. A majority of the respondents (68.1%) faced crop damage and domestic animal loss, 12.3% reported threat to humans and 0.3% reported that the wildlife might cause diseases. Close proximity of the villages to the park and seasons influenced livestock predation intensity with highest predation in the wet season (56.0%). To mitigate these problems, the local people utilised various traditional methods, including guarding. Most respondents had positive attitudes towards the conservation of wildlife. However, as the frequency of conflicts increased in the last five years, the attitudes of local people might change. Active measures are to be implemented to mitigate the problem and safeguard the future of the wildlife around the park. The park has enormous potential to benefit more local people by implementing a participatory management approach to conservation.",

A 75 km stretch of the Arusha Highway that passes adjacent to Manyara Ranch and Lake Manyara National Park was studied for 10 consecutive days in November 2013 (the rainy season). Wildlife species killed on the road, roadkill frequency and road characteristics were determined. A total of 101 roadkill were recorded (0.13 roadkill km−1) comprising 37 species from all terrestrial vertebrate groups, of which two species, house cat (Felis catus) and domestic dog (Canis lupus), were domesticated species. Birds were the most frequently killed taxon (50%), followed by mammals (30%), reptiles (17%) and amphibians (3%). Excluding birds, roadkill primarily consisted of nocturnal species (65%) versus diurnal species (35%). Most roadkill (77.3%) were encountered on road stretches adjacent to protected areas of Manyara Ranch and Lake Manyara National Park compared with 22.7% on the road stretches adjacent to non-protected areas. These findings highlight that roads are a potential threat to wildlife in East Africa and serve as a baseline for future comparisons.",

Estuarine type, by virtue of mouth state and prevailing physico chemical conditions, played a defining role in the structure of these fish assemblages. Clupeidae and Gobiidae were the dominant fish families in both estuarine types. Permanently open estuaries were characterized by the predominance of larvae and early juveniles of estuary dependent marine fish species while estuary resident fishes dominated intermittently open estuaries. Seasonal changes were observed in species density and diversity in both estuarine types. Species richness and diversity were highest in the permanently open Swartkops Estuary that is characterized by large nursery habitat availability. Species diversity was high in estuaries with a good supply of freshwater, that results in good recruitment of estuary dependent marine species. Similarly, freshwater deprived estuaries also displayed high species diversity and this was due to the higher incidence of marine straggler species in these systems. Salinity zones appeared to play a significant role in both species density and the presence or absence of species in both estuarine types. Mesohaline zones were found to be the most productive in terms of accumulator regions for larval stages.",

However, a large number of smaller isolated reserves offer the potential for metapopulation conservation management of this species through continued translocations among reserves. Wild dogs were released into the Pilanesberg National Park (500 km2), South Africa, in June 1999 from a combination of wild captured and captive bred individuals. The reserve has lions but no spotted hyaenas. We document post release spatial use, prey selection and breeding biology. Dogs used a very small area (13.4 km2) for their first denning period, and then ranged more widely, but avoided the central parts of the park. Movement patters and den site locations suggested that dogs avoided the presence of lions. Major prey species were kudu (50 %), impala (32 %) and waterbuck (14 %). Large prey, including adult male kudu (250 kg) and waterbuck (260 kg) were taken regularly through use of the boundary fence as an aid to capture. Wild dogs have bred three times since introduction, indicating that reserves as small as 200 km2 may be suitable for intro duction of wild dogs, and metapopulation management strategies may be a viable option as long as sympatric large predator populations are absent or managed appropriately.",

Botswana's Savuti lions, however, switch to preying on elephants during the late dry season (August-November), and the frequency of this has increased in the last two decades (1985–2005). An opportunity to document this phenomenon was made possible with infrared viewing and filming equipment. A pride of 30 lions killed one elephant every three days. Seven of eight elephants killed were between four and 11 years old, as deduced from molar teeth ageing, and this age group represented over half the kills recorded by Joubert (2006). It is suggested that this weaned, maternally less dependent age class, may be more vulnerable to lion predation. Lions prey on elephants since the density of conventional ungulate prey is reduced as a result of an annual migration, and artificial water provisioning has prompted an increasingly sedentary population of elephants. Notes are presented on the lion's behaviour in hunting elephants and the evolutionary significance of this.",

    "abstract": "Geophagy, the ingestion of earth varying in particle size from stones to soils rich in clay, is a relatively widespread behaviour across avian taxa. We reviewed its occurrence in birds and its hypothesised adaptive functions in birds. Of the ∼30 avian orders, 23 exhibit geophagy. However, it has only been documented in ∼260 species (∼2% of birds) and therefor is relatively uncommon. Ingestion of stones and other large particles (grit) is recorded in 54 extant families across the avian phylogeny and appears to be ancient in birds and has evolved several times. Clay ingestion is recorded in 14 phylogenetically scattered families and might have evolved repeatedly. Furthermore, at least nine families exhibit both clay and grit ingestion. Six hypothesised functions of avian geophagy involve digestion and nutrition. Ingested grit might provide (1) essential minerals, particularly sodium or calcium, but it appears to primarily (2) improve mechanical digestion of food in the gizzard, where ingested stones and sand particles are known as gastroliths. Consistent with this gastrolith hypothesis, ∼86% of species ingesting grit consume \"hard\" food: seeds, leaves, insects or other animals. In contrast, ingested clay appears to be for sodium or other nutrient intake and/or protecting birds from ingested plant secondary compounds, by (3) protecting the digestive tract and (4) adsorbing these compounds. Consistent with this, ∼88% of species ingesting clay eat fruit that is often rich in secondary compounds and low in sodium, and clay ingestion is associated with frugivory in a representative sample of genera of which many have been shown to source sodium. The other two hypotheses are buffering gastric pH (5) and acquiring antidiarrheal agents (6), but no documentation of this in birds was found. We suggest additional tests of these hypotheses and additional investigation of these proposed benefits of geophagy in birds.",

No summer dispersal was observed. Distinct seasonal home ranges were exhibited for all groups, with the summer (wet season) ranges being smaller than the winter (dry season) ranges. Home range size was much smaller than in other locations. The dam and surrounding high density of patches of vegetation of high nutritional quality are thought to be the reasons. Habitat selection was strongly evident with all of the elephant groups selecting River Line habitats in the dry season. In the wet season the cow herd and orphans selected the more open Acacia habitats and the bulls exhibited no significant habitat preference.Key words: elephantseasonal rangehabitat selectionrange use",

Minimum convex polygon (MCP) and the fixed kernel density estimation (FKDE) methods were used to analyse home ranges. The collared elephants showed defined home and seasonal ranges. In the eastern section of the research area, the elephants generally had smaller home ranges that were at their least during the hot and cold dry seasons, expanding during the wet season. In the western areas, the elephants moved between the Hoanib and Hoarusib Rivers in response to available vegetation that did not necessarily correspond to rainfall. The length of movement of collared elephants varied from 54.5 to 473 km in the eastern section of the research area to between 251 to 625 km in the west, over periods of up to five months.Key words: desert-dwelling elephantshome rangeseasonal movementsGPS radio-satellite tracking",

Correlations were found between abundance of rodent species and habitat variables, particularly vegetation structure and the cover of rock and bare soil. Rodent species diversity was negatively correlated with the proportion of total foliage at low to mid heights (40 - 80 cm). Factors controlling apparent habitat preferences are discussed together with modes of rodent niche separation.

Acoustic niche analysis of the 14 species producing airborne advertisement calls integrated the spatial dimension, i.e. the microhabitat used for calling, the temporal dimension, i.e. the time of day when calling takes place, and the call structure dimension, i.e. the physical features of the advertisement call. Average standardized acoustic niche breadth was narrow (measured: 0.08, predicted: 0.07) and showed low variability (0.04–0.16) among species, which means that empirical data are in full agreement with the predictions of stochastic niche theory for species-saturated communities. Niche segregation was mainly based on advertisement call features, whereas spatial and temporal niche dimension contributed less. Measured average niche overlap (0.30) was intermediate between random overlap (0.51) and minimum possible overlap (0.11), indicating significant acoustic resource partitioning.

Conservancies areusually areas where indigenous flora and fauna are protected and aliens excluded or managed. The University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Howard College campus (HCC) is an urban conservancy containing feral cats that are presently not managed, and little is known about their ecology and behaviour. Consequently a feral cat population census was conducted, and their home range investigated. Estimates of the overall campus feral cat population numbers ranged between 23.4–40.0 cats/km2 with a minimum of 55 identified as resident. They were not randomly distributed in the study area, with spacing patterns being related to resource availability. Home range area and core distribution of eight radio-collared cats were determined over 13 months. Total home range areas were relatively small, with considerable overlap between them. Home ranges were clustered in areas with permanent feeding stations and these were also within the cats’ core ranges. Supplemental food resources appear to have a major influence on numbers, home and core range area, and behavior of cats. It is clear that cat densities grow to high levels with reliable and abundant food supply and only ad hoc sterilization. This has implications for their management in the HCC urban conservancy.",

Five competing factors that could be responsible for these changes were investigated. (i) Rainfall increased slightly over 25 years and (ii) no obvious outbreaks of disease were witnessed, suggesting that populations are not suffering food shortages or disease. (iii) Large predators live at low densities and are not increasing, and estimates suggest that that predation is unlikely to impact larger prey species. (iv) Some assessments of illegal hunting indicate little influence on herbivore populations but one measure points to giraffe, hippopotamus, warthog and perhaps other species being adversely affected. (v) Tourist hunting quotas of lions and greater kudu in hunting blocks appear high and there are indications that both may be declining. Preliminary data, approximate calculations and elimination of hypotheses point to anthropogenic factors being partly responsible for changes in this ecosystem and constructive recommendations are made to alter these.

    "abstract": "AbstractIn South Africa, fishes in headwater streams are increasingly being threatened by non-native fish invasions. These invasions originate primarily from source populations in mainstream rivers and impoundments. In the Blindekloof stream, a Swartkops River headwater tributary, the non-native Micropterus salmoides was eradicated from the stream by conservation authorities in 1989. As a result of this eradication subsequent occurrences of non-native fishes are most likely a result of upstream invasions from the mainstream Swartkops River. The Blindekloof stream therefore provided a unique opportunity to investigate whether M. salmoides would reinvade after its removal in 1989 and if the more recently introduced Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia sparrmanii would invade the Blindekloof stream. During snorkel and electrofishing surveys four non-native species were recorded (M. salmoides, M. dolomieu, T. sparrmanii, C. gariepinus ). The large predators, M. salmoides, M. dolomieu and C. gariepinus were neither abundant nor widespread and T. sparrmanii was the only non-native species that had successfully established in the Blindekloof stream. Where M. salmoides and M. dolomieu were observed, all other fish species were absent. By contrast, the native species were present at all sites where C. gariepinus and T. sparrmanii were found. The Pseudobarbus afer population was predominantly limited to a 1.7 km section of the stream that was not invaded and is located above a waterfall. The limited distribution range of this Endangered species makes it particularly vulnerable to predation by non-native fishes. The results of this study indicate that these non-native fishes rapidly invaded the Blindekloof stream following their introduction into the mainstream.Key words: endangeredinvasivenon-nativeClarias gariepinusMicropterus dolomieuMicropterus salmoidesPseudobarbus aferTilapia sparrmanii",

Botswana's Savuti lions, however, switch to preying on elephants during the late dry season (August–November), and the frequency of this has increased in the last two decades (1985–2005). An opportunity to document this phenomenon was made possible with infrared viewing and filming equipment. A pride of 30 lions killed one elephant every three days. Seven of eight elephants killed were between four and 11 years old, as deduced from molar teeth ageing, and this age group represented over half the kills recorded by Joubert (2006). It is suggested that this weaned, maternally less dependent age class, may be more vulnerable to lion predation. Lions prey on elephants since the density of conventional ungulate prey is reduced as a result of an annual migration, and artificial water provisioning has prompted an increasingly sedentary population of elephants. Notes are presented on the lion's behaviour in hunting elephants and the evolutionary significance of this.",

Finally, higher individual baseline 11,17-DOA concentrations were found in samples defecated overnight, indicating a possible diurnal effect in excretion of FGMs in African buffalo.",

Queens were recaptured up to 8.5 years after initial capture (X = 6.2 years); significantly longer than non-reproductive females (X = 1.3 years), suggesting that a colony queen lives longer than her non-reproductive subordinates.

Such attitudes are particularly prevalent in South Africa, where fear, superstitions and myths associated with frogs are pervasive in some cultures.

This study aimed to investigate attitudes to frogs throughout South Africa across multiple age and ethnic groups. We used a multi-language survey in both hard-copy and online versions. Respondents (n = 2 295) comprised both genders across six age groups and five ethnic groups. A functionalist approach using structural equation modelling was used to assess how liking of frogs and cultural beliefs varied with socio-demographic factors. Attitudes varied significantly between groups, with males more likely to like frogs than females and age and level of education also significantly linked to liking. The influence of cultural beliefs and lack of knowledge also directly influenced negative attitudes towards frogs. More than 60% of respondents expressed an interest in learning more about frogs, indicating an opportunity for improving attitudes through educational outreach. The findings of this study can be used to inform current efforts to protect amphibians in South Africa through social interventions.",

We induced tail autotomy in free ranging male Cordylus m. melanotus and measured potential shifts in behaviour (movements, foraging behaviour, time exposed and average distance to a potential refuge), and responses to an approaching human compared to marked individuals with complete tails. Tailed and tailless lizards behaved in a similar fashionfor all measured variables although power tests could not rule out the possibility of falsely accepting the null hypothesis in some cases. We also measured locomotory performance (maximum sprint speed) for tailed and tailless lizards in the lab. Locomotory performance was also not compromised by tail loss. Finally, we measured the energetic content of tails as a proportion of total energetic content using bomb calorimetry. The cost of tail autotomy was approximately 12 % of the totalbody energy (wet weight). Our results suggest that the major cost of tail loss in Cordylus m. melanotus is energetic.",

During the study 151 animals belonging to 12 species were reported killed. The majority, 76%, of prey species were migratory herbivores. Night hunting with dogs was the most common hunting method for medium-sized prey (biomass ≤40 kg), while the majority of the large herbivores were killed by snares. When actively stalking, hunters killed more males of most of the species recorded, as well as more immatures than adults. Passive hunting also generally had a male-bias. This suggests that the male-bias in kills probably is more a result of behavioural factors among the animals, combined with poor hunting technology, than deliberate choice of the hunters.Key words: bushmeathuntingconservationSerengetisex ratioTanzania",

Studies of arthropod assemblage structure at fine (1 × 1 km) scales are rare, but important, because these are the spatial levels at which real world applications are viable. Here we investigate fine-scale variation in spider assemblages, comparing five representative vegetation types in the western Soutpansberg, Limpopo Province, South Africa. We assess these vegetation types in terms of their family and species composition, as well as levels of endemicity, relating these differences with vegetation structure. We inventoried 297 species (49 families) in an area less than 450 ha, as part of South African National Survey of Arachnida. Analysis of the results suggests that endemic taxa are associated with Tall Forest and, to a lesser extent, Woodland. The Woodland had the highest species diversity, and much of the variation observed in spider assemblage structure is explained by these two vegetation types. Based on vegetation structure variables that explained significant variation in spider assemblages, human influence through bush encroachment will result in a change of spider assemblages to that of Short Forest and Mosaic Woodland vegetation types, with implications for biodiversity maintenance and heterogeneity.",

This relationship is well known in social insects, and it has recently come to light that reproductive females of certain social mole-rat species also exhibit extended lifespans relative to non-breeders. We analysed mark-recapture data over 13 years in 12 colonies of Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) to assess if colony queens lived longer than non-reproductive adult females. Queens were recaptured up to 8.5 years after initial capture (X = 6.2 years); significantly longer than non-reproductive females (X = 1.3 years), suggesting that a colony queen lives longer than her non-reproductive subordinates.

    "abstract": "The early detection and correct identification of polydorid polychaete species is essential as they are often encountered as invasive alien pests in aquaculture facilities or the intertidal where they may modify the ecosystem. Accurate identification is, however, often hampered by high levels of morphological similarity among species. This taxon will therefore benefit from the development of a library of sequences, such as COI barcodes, to aid identification. However, the universal primers for the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) DNA barcoding marker has failed to consistently amplify this gene for polydorids, greatly hampering the development of such a library. We describe the development of unique PCR primers for the COI gene that work across four genera and nine species of polydorids. We also compared its efficacy with sequence data for mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear 18S rRNA, and a concatenated dataset consisting of all three markers. The nuclear 18S rRNA gene showed the least variation both intra- (0.0–1.2%) and interspecifically (0.6–4.3%), and was the most accurate for species identifications among the three markers. Although COI was characterised by higher intraspecific variation compared with Cyt b (0.0–14.5% and 0.0–4.2%, respectively), Cyt b showed considerably higher levels of interspecific variation (16.6–30.2%) compared with COI (2.2–20.7%). Of the two mitochondrial DNA markers, COI was actually less accurate for species identifications, having suggested two species within Boccardia pseudonatrix that was not supported by the other markers. Overall, the concatenated dataset yielded the most consistent intraspecific groupings, suggesting that this is the most accurate means of identifying polydorids using DNA sequence data. Thus, there may not be a quick and easy way to identify these species accurately using only molecular data.",

We examined home range size, activity periods, habitat selectivity and refuge site selection of 13 individuals over three years in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa, near the western edge of the species' range. Kernel home ranges of adults averaged 6.5 ± 5.9 km2, while juveniles had average home ranges of 6.1 ± 4.0 km2. Reliable prediction of 95% of the Kernel home range required 88 ± 67.7 tracking days. No significant habitat selectivity was observed. Earthen burrows were the most frequently used refuge type. The time at which activity commenced varied seasonally as well as among individuals, with an increase in diurnal activity during winter. Young pangolins also displayed more diurnal activity compared to adults. Individuals spent 5.7 ± 2.0 hours per 24-hour cycle outside of refuges, with no significant seasonal variation. Juvenile dispersal peaked during mid-summer, with individuals travelling up to 49 km from their natal areas. We estimate a breeding density of 0.16 individuals/km2 and a total density of 0.31 individuals/km2 for our study area. Our data suggest that activity patterns, movements and refuge selection is similar across the species’ southern African range, but that densities may be higher in the Kalahari compared to populations in more mesic eastern areas.",

Software applications on these devices have become diverse in their functionality and easy to use. Citizen science projects that try to mobilise data collection from people from diverse backgrounds are ideally placed to benefit from the acceptance of easy-to-use technology. This article describes the development of the mobile BirdLasser app and its integrated gamification network, with emphasis on how its unique features contributed to increased participation and submission of data to the current Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP2) and associated BirdMap projects across Africa. The app has experienced a high adoption rate by contributors to SABAP2 (atlassers), birdwatchers and conservationists, contributing to causes, creating life lists and taking part in events. The app has been associated with the recruitment of new participants, but this has also seen a change in atlassing patterns, suggesting caution when using traditional measures of abundance comparisons, especially reporting rate, before and after the adoption of BirdLasser as the data submission pathway. We show that a well-designed mobile app that facilitates the flow of information from observers to databases is essential for maintaining long-term citizen science based, monitoring projects, especially if the platform is fun, well-supported, and free to use; but the introduction of an app may also introduce subtle changes to the data itself and so data submission pathways to citizen science projects is a field that requires additional research.",

However, remnant populations of indigenous fishes persist in lagoons and satellite lakes separated from the main lakes by extensive areas of swamp, while other indigenous species find refuge in ecotonal areas at edges of marginal swamps in the main lakes. Low-oxygen conditions in these wetlands may physiologically stress Nile perch and therefore minimize its interaction with prey species. This study examined the low-oxygen tolerance of Nile perch collected from Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, by documenting behavioural and physiological strategies that relate to oxygen uptake. In response to hypoxia, Nile perch used aquatic surface respiration (ASR) at the air–water interface, ventilating their gills with water from the surface. However, several lines of evidence suggest that Nile perch in Lake Nabugabo are inefficient at ASR and relatively intolerant of low oxygen conditions. These include high thresholds for ASR relative to other indigenous fishes of the Lake Victoria basin, no decrease in gill ventilation rate with the onset of ASR, a faster time to loss of equilibrium in hypoxic conditions than other species from the region, and a high critical oxygen tension (24 mm Hg).Key words: oxygen tolerancerespirationgill ventilation",

The Addo elephants' ranging behaviour was studied in order to determine whether natural patterns of male and female ranging behaviour can be maintained within a confined area. Radio tracking was used to facilitate measurements of hourly distances travelled, larger scale directional movements, home range sizes, centres of activity and associations. Female home ranges overlap, and interactions between family groups are frequently observed. Females and non musth males travel similar distances and speeds on an hourly basis, but female core range sizes are larger, presumably because bigger areas are needed to satisfy the nutritional requirements of their young. Contrary to expectations, Addo males do not travel further and faster on an hourly basis when they are in musth in comparison to when they are not in musth. However, the movement of males in musth is more directional, so that they cover a greater area of the park. Males associate more frequently with females when in musth than when non musth. Unlike in other populations, non musth 'male retirement areas' in AENP are not exclusive, as there is spatial and temporal overlap with female ranges, and hence with the ranges of males in musth. It is suggested that the resulting increased frequency of contact between musth and non musth males may result in elevated mate competition, and this could contribute to the high levels of aggression observed between Addo bulls.",

Only concentrations above 0.6 ppm Cd affected the hatching of the embryos. All metals affected the survival of tadpoles over the seven days of exposure, with Zn and Cu showing a steady linear toxicity and Pb and Cd a threshold toxicity effect. Metals affected the growth of the tadpoles by reducing body length with increasing concentrations. An increase in the concentration of each metal resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of malformations among the tadpoles. The percentage of malformed tadpoles was dependent on the metal and concentration to which they were exposed. Our data describe the relationships among hatching success, survival, growth rate and the frequency of malforma tions of tadpoles in relation to different concentrations of the four metals.

There were significant seasonal and inter annual differences in rodent numbers, breeding intensity and community structure. Mastomys natalensis was numerically dominant throughout most of the study period, but its numbers fluctuated widely and without a seasonal basis. Numbers of Lemniscomys rosalia and Mus minutoides also fluctuated widely, but both species tended to be more numerous in the dry winter months. A large proportion of the adult M. natalensis, L. rosalia and Steatomys pratensis were reproductively active in the first breeding season of the study, but breeding intensity decreased sharply in the second and third breeding seasons. Species richness and diversity also fluctuated widely throughout the study. In general, species richness was highest in winter months, while species diversity increased with decrease in numbers of M. natalensis. Fire had a severe impact on the small mammal community; densities of M. natalensis increased markedly following the fire, while those of other species declined. Total biomass of small mammals increased, but species diversity and evenness declined as the community became dominated by a single species. Few long term population studies of small mammals have been conducted in southern Africa. In light of the large inter annual variability potentially present in most small mammal communities of southern Africa, such studies are essential.Key words: RodentiaInsectivorareproductionAfricaecologyfire",

Edge Analysis of asteriscii validated an annual deposition rate of one growth increment per year and sampled fish were aged at between 0 and 10 years old. Combined sex length-at-age (Lt ) was described by Lt = 650(l - e -066(t 4.22)) mm FL for GMR and Lt = 498(l - e -0.23(t -0.373)) mm FL for GFRI. Natural mortality rate was estimated at 0.56/yr in GFRI and 0.96/yr in GMR. Condition factor was significantly higher in the GFRI than in GMR. In comparison with other populations, the GFRI population had reproductive and growth traits that were similar to those in its natural riverine range. Reproductive assessment showed ripe male and female fish in October to December in the GFRI, while in the GMR, ripe male fish but few ripe female fish were recorded. This was attributed to the lack of spawning cues in the reservoir. As a result, L. aeneus were considered established in the GFRI, but were not established and likely dependent on introductions in the GMR.",

    "abstract": "A semi-quantitative inventory of spider diversity was done in the Blouberg Nature Reserve (BNR) and Western Soutpansberg Conservancy (WSC) situated in the Savanna Biome of the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Two hundred and ninety-six samples of one person-hour work each, comprised of five methods (vegetation beating, sweep netting, aerial hand collecting, ground hand collecting and leaf litter sifting) were divided between four relatively homogenous sites (plant communities) within a vegetation type of the BNR and WSC, respectively, an average of 37 per site. In addition, 25 pitfall traps were left open for a total of 20 days in each of the eight plant communities, 200 in total. We collected 1328 adult spiders representing 186 species of which 31% were singletons in the BNR vegetation type and 909 spiders in 222 species of which 41% were singletons in the WSC vegetation type. The number of species present was estimated using six estimators. The estimates varied between 233 and 307 for the BNR and 302 and 386 for the WSC. Inventory completeness was more than 70%. However, the fit to a lognormal distribution suggests that there are 370 species (750 000 individuals) and 445 (850 000 individuals) species in the universes (16 ha) sampled within the two vegetation types. Collector experience had no effect on the results of the inventory, whereas time of day had a very small yet significant effect. Seasonality only affected abundance and richness, but not assemblage composition. Sampling methods used had the biggest effect on our results. These results are used to design an optimized sampling protocol for standardized inventories in the Savanna Biome.",

Sequences from the nuclear marker RAG-1 (1149 bp), two novel rapidly-evolving nuclear markers KIF24 and EXPH5 (554 bp and 941 bp respectively), and the mitochondrial gene ND2 (1056 bp) were analysed from 84 individuals of T. s. sulcata and two individuals of T. s. nigra. Additionally, the range of T. s. nigra was estimated using museum records, and correlations between environmental variables and the occurrence of melanism were explored. Molecular analyses depict T. s. nigra as nested within a strongly monophyletic T. s. sulcata, suggesting this population is not genetically isolated or distinct. We therefore recommend T. s. nigra be synonymized with T. s. sulcata. The best predictor of melanism along the coastline in this population is a high number of fog days per year, a finding consistent with studies of melanism in cordylid lizards in southern Africa. Further sampling may determine gene flow levels occurring across the contact zone of melanistic and non-melanistic phenotypes and provide insight into selective forces maintaining this trait.",

However, bats that feed on these insects may also accumulate metal pollutants such as cadmium and copper in their tissues, with acute or chronic effects on their health. Using a time expansion bat detector, the activity (number of passes and feeding buzzes) of Neoromicia nana (family Vespertilionidae) was quantified at threeWWTWpoints – upstream, the point of wastewater effluent discharge, and downstream – along three urban rivers in South Africa. In addition, metal concentrations in the kidney, liver and muscle tissue of N. nana caught at the sites were quantified. The diversity of aerial insects, sampled over the same period as the bat surveys, was measured using a black light trap and sweep-netting. Relative abundance and feeding activity of N. nana were higher at wastewater-polluted sites than at upstream sites. The most abundant insect order at wastewater-polluted sites and in the diet of resident bats was Diptera. Essential metals (copper, zinc and iron) were detected in all N. nana tissue samples, but the toxic metals cadmium, chromium and nickel were mostly present in tissue of bats at wastewater-polluted sites. Thus, although WWTWs provide an optimal food resource to bats in the short-term, it may pose serious long-term health risks for these top predators.",

The results confirmed that both of these species selected to forage over sugarcane fields instead of over the other habitats available in the area: savanna, riparian forest and urban areas. Foraging ranges were relatively large with C. pumilus travelling on average a maximum of 4.2 km from the roost and M. condylurus covering 4.8 km.

We hypothesised that cranial size should vary in space and time within species according to Bergmann's Rule, which predicts an inverse relationship between body size and temperature. We used the greatest length of the skull (GLS) as a robust indicator of body size. Cranial size of both O. auratus and O. angoniensis decreased significantly over the past 100 years, as expected given historical evidence of warming across northern South Africa since the 1950s. In terms of geographical patterns, GLS was inversely correlated with both latitude and longitude in O. auratus but these trends were correlated with annual rainfall rather than mean annual temperature. Conversely, cranial size of O. angoniensis was weakly positively correlated with longitude but with no climatic variables. Our results demonstrate rapid morphological changes in two herbivorous South African rodents over the past 100 years. Whilst the general decline in size with time in relation to increased temperature is consistent with Bergmann's Rule, multiple drivers may underlie geographical trends in the two species.",

Although various haemogregarines have been described from southern African terrapins and tortoises, including species from the genus Haemogregarina and one from the genus Hepatozoon, no species of Hemolivia have been identified previously from southern Africa. Since its morphological redescription, the taxonomic placement of one of these species, Haemogregarina parvula Dias, 1953, was in doubt. Hence, research was undertaken to resolve the true taxonomic position of this haemogregarine. Blood smears from nine wild tortoises of two species, Stigmochelys pardalis and Kinixys zombensis, from South Africa were screened, with the focus on H. parvula. Parasite DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved blood samples, and fragments of the 18S rDNA gene were amplified by PCR using the primer sets HepF300/HepR900 and 4558/2733. Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses of 18S rDNA sequences showed that Haemogregarina parvula formed a monophyletic clade with species of Hemolivia within the Hepatozoon clade, not with species of Haemogregarina. It is thus recommended that this haemogregarine be reassigned to the genus Hemolivia, rendering Hemolivia parvula (Dias, 1953) the first species of the genus recorded from southern African tortoises.",

The impacts of burning on invertebrates in South Africa remain poorly understood. A study was initiated in spring 2005 to determine the impact of a fast hot burn on ground-dwelling spider assemblages in a grassland habitat in the central Free State. Pitfall traps were set out at six sites in the reserve, with three sites each in the burnt and unburnt areas, to sample spiders over a 12-month period. A total of 5 253 spiders were collected, representing 33 families and 120 species. Spider abundance was significantly lower in the burnt (n = 1 956) than unburnt sites (n = 3 297), and burnt sites had, on average, considerably fewer species than unburnt sites. The dominant families in the burnt sites were Lycosidae (29.5%), Gnaphosidae (16.9%), Ammoxenidae (9.6%) and Zodariidae (5.7%), whereas Ammoxenidae (22.7%), Lycosidae (20.6%), Gnaphosidae (15.3%) and Amaurobiidae (10.2%) dominated the unburnt sites. Of the nine most abundant families collected, only Caponiidae were more abundant in the burnt than unburnt sites. Our data suggest that fast-burning hot spring fires cause a considerable initial post-fire decline in spider abundance, and have a negative influence on the abundance as well as the resistance of assemblages to disturbances other than fire (e.g. rain). However, most of the dominant families had abundances comparable to unburnt areas within a year post-burn.",

Although protected areas are important for leopard conservation, the majority of suitable leopard habitat lies beyond protected area boundaries exposing individuals to different environmental, physiological and psychosocial stressors. This study aimed to examine the suitability of five different enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring adrenocortical function in the leopard based on faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) analysis. After performing an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test and investigating the stability of fGCM post-defaecation, faeces from free-ranging leopards in a peri-urban and a conservation area were collected to investigate the potential impact of habitat variability on glucocorticoid output. An EIA measuring fGCM with a 5α-3β-11β-diol structure performed best, demonstrating a ∼200%–330% increase in fGCM concentrations approximately 40 h post-ACTH administration. Concentrations of fGCM remained quite stable for up to six days post-defaecation and showed a maximum increase of 8% and a maximum decrease of 9%. Although not significantly different, overall median fGCM concentrations were 68% higher in individuals utilising the peri-urban area compared with leopards utilising the conservation area. The ranges of fGCM concentrations between sites, however, were similar. Individual median fGCM concentrations differed distinctly between free-ranging males and females, possibly linked to female reproductive status. The established method can now assist in addressing some of the issues facing local wildlife managers, conservationists and researchers tackling various aspects related to leopard conservation and management under different land-use practices.",

A total of 31 animals were caught from five different colonies and their burrow systems were excavated in their entirety. The mean and SD colony size was 6 ± 3.3, with a range of 2–10 mole-rats. The sex ratio tended to be male biased 1.21:1. Males had a body mass of 80.5 ± 33.8 g, but were not significantly different to those of females, which had a mean body mass of 83.4 ± 24.9 g. The burrow system of the Damaraland mole-rats follows the same general architectural plan as recorded for other species of mole-rat with either one or two more centrally based, deeper, more permanent burrows that often connect to a nest area, which is used for resting and rearing offspring. The burrow systems contained several more superficial secondary tunnels at a shallower depth. The secondary tunnels accounted for up to 80% of the total burrow system. The mean length of the burrow system was 130 m and covered an area of 1 403 m2. The mean number of secondary branches in a burrow system was 10. The mean fractal dimension was 1.15, which implies the mole-rats do not explore their surrounding environment particularly efficiently when compared with that of other mole-rat species, but this may relate to the size of the main food resource, the Eland bean (Elephantorrhiza elephantina), which is randomly distributed and fed on in situ. Our study showed that colony size influences the size and complexity of the burrow system, with larger colonies having a longer burrow system covering a greater area with more secondary tunnels than that of smaller colonies.",

Groups of up to 30 individuals are regularly encountered and, if this species is a sit-and-wait forager like other members of its family, competition for food among group members could be high. Three criteria were used to infer foraging mode in this species: 1) the number and duration of movements related to foraging, quantified as movements per minute (MPM) and percentage of time spent moving (PTM); 2) the amount of tongue-flicking directed at cotton applicators labelled with prey chemicals as a measure of prey chemical discrimination; and 3) the stomach contents of individuals as an indication of the natural diet. We selected a study site in the Graafwater district in theWestern Cape Province, South Africa, and 15 individuals were observed in the field for 10 min periods to determine MPM and PTM. Low MPM and PTM values of 0.23 ± 0.08 and 2.20 ± 0.71, respectively, were recorded indicating that this species is a sit-and-wait forager like other members of the family Cordylidae. In the laboratory, nine lizards were tested for their ability to discriminate among three different odours, including a prey odour, by counting the number of tongue-flicks directed at the odours presented to them on cotton applicators. Only one lizard tongue-flicked once and there was no indication that C. cataphractus can discriminate prey chemicals. Most of the invertebrate prey species identified in the stomach contents were diurnal species. The stomach contents included a wide range of food items, from plant material to scorpions and millipedes. The southern harvester termite, Microhodotermes viator, is possibly the most important prey species of this lizard. An analysis of the stomach contents of 122 C. cataphractus specimens revealed a significantly higher proportion with empty stomachs among group-living than among solitary ones.",

Once a carcass had been stripped of soft tissue by Gyps vultures, bearded vultures disarticulated sections or individual bones (depending on the size of the dead animal) in the order: limbs, ribs, vertebrae, and skull. Their overall diet was estimated as 70% bone with marrow, 25% meat and 5% skin. This diet is about 15% higher in energy than an equivalent mass of meat. Of 683 identified prey items from five sources of data, over 80% consisted of domestic livestock; about 60% of this was sheep and goats. Even birds nesting within conservation areas derived more than half of their food from domestic stock which they found by foraging over adjacent commercial and subsistence farming areas. Bearded vultures obtain all their food by scavenging, and reports of attacks on live animals and even humans are rejected.",

Leopard scats from both areas were analysed for prey items. A total of 18 prey taxa was identified, including small to medium-sized ungulates, rodents, birds and a felid. The mountain reedbuck was the most frequently utilized prey, followed by vlei rat, bushbuck, rock hyrax and grysbok. Baboons, although abundant throughout the study area, were not utilized by these leopards. There was a significant difference in the frequency of prey items between the reserve and the rangeland samples in terms of the relative contribution of the prey taxa. Medium-sized and small ungulates were heavily utilized in the reserve, whilst the diet in rangelands was composed largely of small mammals (including small ungulates). Only two scats contained the remains of domestic animals, indicating that <5% of the diet comprised this prey category, and suggesting that leopards in the study area do not preferentially prey on livestock.Key words: leopardsdietscat analysislivestock predationrangelandsconservation areas",

Five competing factors that could be responsible for these changes were investigated. (i) Rainfall increased slightly over 25 years and (ii) no obvious outbreaks of disease were witnessed, suggesting that populations are not suffering food shortages or disease. (iii) Large predators live at low densities and are not increasing, and estimates suggest that that predation is unlikely to impact larger prey species. (iv) Some assessments of illegal hunting indicate little influence on herbivore populations but one measure points to giraffe, hippopotamus, warthog and perhaps other species being adversely affected. (v) Tourist hunting quotas of lions and greater kudu in hunting blocks appear high and there are indications that both may be declining. Preliminary data, approximate calculations and elimination of hypotheses point to anthropogenic factors being partly responsible for changes in this ecosystem and constructive recommendations are made to alter these.

Conservancies areusually areas where indigenous flora and fauna are protected and aliens excluded or managed. The University of KwaZulu-Natal's Howard College campus (HCC) is an urban conservancy containing feral cats that are presently not managed, and little is known about their ecology and behaviour. Consequently a feral cat population census was conducted, and their home range investigated. Estimates of the overall campus feral cat population numbers ranged between 23.4–40.0 cats/km2 with a minimum of 55 identified as resident. They were not randomly distributed in the study area, with spacing patterns being related to resource availability. Home range area and core distribution of eight radio-collared cats were determined over 13 months. Total home range areas were relatively small, with considerable overlap between them. Home ranges were clustered in areas with permanent feeding stations and these were also within the cats' core ranges. Supplemental food resources appear to have a major influence on numbers, home and core range area, and behavior of cats. It is clear that cat densities grow to high levels with reliable and abundant food supply and only ad hoc sterilization. This has implications for their management in the HCC urban conservancy.",

Although the identification of species complexes is relatively easy, the distinction within some groups is difficult due to a high variability of the external morphology. Partial mitochondrial (12S and 16S rRNA) sequences (371 and 499 base pairs, respectively) were analysed from 32 specimens of the A. pardalis group from northern Africa including the described species A. busacki, A. maculatus, A. mechriguensis and A. pardalis. Several highly distinct genetic units were resolved, but with little support for relationships between them. These units did not coincide with current taxonomic units, but showed geographic structuring. Although the A. pardalis group displays significant variation, the present taxonomy of the group must be considered unsatisfactory since it is not supported by genetic evidence. For some forms, such as A. mechriguensis there is no support and it is suggested that it should be synonymized with A. maculatus. More data are clearly needed for other forms. Complex microevolutionary patterns due to the recent contraction/ expansion phases of the Sahara Desert probably are related with the phylogenetic patterns observed.Key words: Acanthodactylus pardalisphylogenyNorth Africamitochondrial DNA",

    "abstract": "Marine species have been introduced continuously into South Africa for more than 400 years, since the arrival of the first European explorers. Various waves of introduction can be identified over this period, each associated with a different mix of vectors. Early wooden vessels carried specialized wood-boring species, a rich external fouling community, plus semi-terrestrial species associated with dry ballast. Modern steel vessels continue to import fouling species, despite the use of anti-fouling paints, and may ply new routes, bringing additional introductions from novel locations. More modern waves of introduction are associated with use of ballast water and with marine aquaculture. Research on marine bio-invasions in South Africa has a short history, marked by a rapid rate of discovery of introductions. Some 86 marine species are currently regarded as introduced to the region, with a further 39 considered cryptogenic, but this number is increasing rapidly. Moreover, many taxa and regions still remain inadequately explored, indicating that the current list remains far from complete. The reasons for under-reporting of introduced populations are discussed and include lack of sample coverage, misidentification of aliens as native species and erroneous redescriptions of aliens as new, indigenous species. However, the lack of taxonomic expertise across large sections of the biota remains the greatest impediment to progress.",

Seven major dietary categories were identified from the scats, with mammal remains being most common for both species. Brown hyaena scats contained more large mammal remains, which together with the presence of invertebrates (in 50% of all brown hyaena scats), suggests that they mainly scavenged. Jackal scats contained a higher proportion of small mammal remains, suggesting that jackals actively hunted more often than brown hyaenas did. The diets differed significantly between the two species, even though diet overlap was fairly high (0.79). Further analysis, albeit based on small sample sizes, suggests that diet of these mesopredators differ between protected reserves with apex predators and unprotected areas without apex predators, thus confounding generalizations. Further studies are therefore required to investigate possible mesopredator release when apex predators are absent.",

The most common gastrointestinal parasites found were Isospora spp., Spirometra sp., Taeniidae and Sarcosystis spp. Twenty-eight per cent of all samples were co-infected with Spirometra sp. and Taeniidae, with co-infection rates highest among lions (67%). Thirty-three per cent (3/9) of spotted hyaenas were infected with Isospora sp. Ninety-two per cent (12/13) of wild dog were infected with Sarcocystis, similar to results from studies in South Africa. One lion was infected with a parasite whose morphology suggested Strongyloides sp., not previously been reported in lions. Samples from one lion and two spotted hyaenas yielded no gastrointestinal parasites. Overall, parasite species were consistent with those found from studies in other regions of Africa and are likely a result of ingesting infected prey.

    "abstract": "In South Africa, fishes in headwater streams are increasingly being threatened by non-native fish invasions. These invasions originate primarily from source populations in mainstream rivers and impoundments. In the Blindekloof stream, a Swartkops River headwater tributary, the non-native Micropterus salmoides was eradicated from the stream by conservation authorities in 1989. As a result of this eradication subsequent occurrences of non-native fishes are most likely a result of upstream invasions from the mainstream Swartkops River. The Blindekloof stream therefore provided a unique opportunity to investigate whether M. salmoides would reinvade after its removal in 1989 and if the more recently introduced Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia sparrmanii would invade the Blindekloof stream. During snorkel and electrofishing surveys four non-native species were recorded (M. salmoides, M. dolomieu, T. sparrmanii, C. gariepinus ). The large predators, M. salmoides, M. dolomieu and C. gariepinus were neither abundant nor widespread and T. sparrmanii was the only non-native species that had successfully established in the Blindekloof stream. Where M. salmoides and M. dolomieu were observed, all other fish species were absent. By contrast, the native species were present at all sites where C. gariepinus and T. sparrmanii were found. The Pseudobarbus afer population was predominantly limited to a 1.7 km section of the stream that was not invaded and is located above a waterfall. The limited distribution range of this Endangered species makes it particularly vulnerable to predation by non-native fishes. The results of this study indicate that these non-native fishes rapidly invaded the Blindekloof stream following their introduction into the mainstream.",

    "abstract": "Globally small mammals are important hosts of ectoparasite vectors of pathogens of medical, veterinary and economic importance. Insectivores are currently understudied as hosts of pathogen vectors. However, data are needed on the diversity of such vectors before we can investigate the underlying factors affecting ectoparasite distribution. Abiotic (e.g. temperature and rainfall) and biotic (e.g. host sex) factors have been identified as the main determinants of host–parasite interactions. The present study describes the ectoparasite community of insectivorous eastern rock sengis (Elephantulus myurus) in a nature reserve in the Gauteng province, South Africa, and how it varies with season and host sex. A total of 81 sengis were examined for the presence of ticks, mites, fleas and lice between April 2010 and April 2011. The ectoparasite assemblage comprised 11 groups of tick species, a single mite family, one louse and two flea species, with ticks and mites being the most numerous ectoparasites recovered. The prevalence and/or abundance of two commonly collected ticks (Ixodes spp. and Rhipicephalus warburtoni/arnoldi) and chigger varied with season. In addition, female-biased tick burdens were apparent for one ectoparasite species possibly due to reproductive investment. The mechanisms causing the observed patterns should be addressed in future studies.",

Few studies have investigated the biota of pans in this area, which is seriously threatened by mining and agricultural development. Nineteen pan sites within a 20 kmradius covering a wide range of water chemistries were sampled once for zooplankton, epiphytic diatoms and water physico-chemical data in 2009. Collected zooplankton and diatom samples were identified to species or genus level. Many of the zooplankton taxa reported in this study were not recorded in similar pan studies in South Africa and southern Africa. The study revealed a difference among the compositions of zooplankton and diatom communities between temporary pans and permanent pans. Zooplankton found exclusively in freshwater temporary pans included cladocerans (Megafenestra aurita and Scapholeberis kingi), calanoids (Mesocyclops major and Thermodiaptomus mixtus), a cyclopoid (Acanthocyclops vernalis) and a rotifer (Platyias quadricornis). Permanent pans were characterized by taxa such as cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia rigaudi and Dunhevedia crassa), a calanoid (Metadiaptomus transvaalensis), cyclopoids (Paracyclops fimbriatus and Eucyclops gibsoni) and rotifers (Brachionus dimidiatus and Brachionus plicatilis). The most commonly occurring diatom taxa in temporary pans included taxa indicative of slightly acidic to circumneutral, dystrophic and nutrient-poor waters such as Nitzschia acidoclinata, Gomphonema gracile and Eunotia bilunaris. Permanent pan assemblages were characterized by taxa typical of saline waters, including Nitzschia frustulum, Amphora veneta and Planothidium engelbrechtii. Species of the genera Pinnularia and Eunotia were almost totally absent from permanent pans.",

It is therefore an opportune time to look back, take stock of and reflect on the history of discovery within this field and, based on what we know, propose the future direction for research. The aim of this paper is hence to provide some background information on the growth in our knowledge and understanding of the major groups of marine fish parasites and to give an account of how pioneers, such as Barnard, Stebbing, Fantham and Kensley, led the age of discovery and exploration in marine fish parasitology in South Africa. The paper also presents a brief overview of the contributions made by internationally acclaimed parasitologists, such as Rodney Bray and Angela Davies, to our knowledge of marine fish parasites from this region and also to acknowledge the role played by the South African parasitologists, especially over the past 30 years. A rich base of fundamental knowledge is available in South Africa and this research field continues to grow. The prognosis for the future of marine parasitology in South Africa is good; however, as we continue to acquire and record new information about species, it is proposed that future research should be more focused on the lesser studied groups, such as monogeneans, protists and Myxozoa, as these have received uneven attention to date. In addition, it is proposed that the scope of research on marine fish parasitology be broadened to include ecological and applied aspects, using modern techniques.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFor over a decade, molecular short standardised DNA fragments, termed DNA barcodes, have been developed for species discrimination around the world. As of 2010, the vast majority of barcoding research was biased toward particular taxonomic groups and geographic regions largely because researchers in developed countries were the ones with the resources and capacity to carry out such work. To rectify this, the International Barcode of Life Project was launched with the intent to extend the geographic and taxonomic coverage of the barcode reference library. South Africa committed to this mission in an attempt to catalogue all of its known biodiversity and, possibly, help identify new species. To date, approximately 48 000 South African faunal barcodes are housed in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), which represent only 2.3% of all known South African animal species. Although insects are the best represented in absolute terms, with over 37 000 samples recorded, they are still grossly lacking with just over 1% representation. Much like the global trend, there is a general taxonomic bias, with fish, birds and mammals showing the greatest representation. Moreover, geographic bias is also present, with the Free State province particularly under-represented on BOLD, likely owing to limited human capacity. Although few studies have been published with respect to barcoding, the majority reveal that the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene, used in isolation or in conjunction with other molecular markers, can greatly benefit South African biodiversity research. Several limitations of DNA barcoding are discussed and recommendations specific to South Africa provided.Keywords: animalsbiodiversityCO1 geneconservationtaxonomy",

    "abstract": "To facilitate development of tailored management strategies for bait species within Knysna Estuary (South Africa), demand for bait, harvesting activity and perceptions around conservation among recreational and subsistence bait fishers were investigated. In 2015 and 2016, bait collectors were interviewed (n = 84) and observed (n = 167) during low tides at six sites during peak and off-peak holiday periods. Significant associations among subsistence and recreational fishers and their favoured bait species, collecting spots and method, frequency of collection, views on regulations and desired daily limit for mudprawns suggest differences that may warrant different management strategies. Furthermore, observed methods and duration of bait collecting differed according to site, suggesting spatial variation in baiting pressures. Subsistence fishers potentially collect more mudprawns more frequently than do recreational fishers and consequently have a greater impact on mudprawn populations. By contrast, recreational fishers collect more polychaete worms, but because they are mainly active during holidays, their impact on these species may be localised and not yet critical. Most subsistence fishers would like increased daily bag limits, to sell bait and would welcome a rotational zonation scheme to replace the current permanent exclusion zone. The merits and disadvantages of these management options and suggestions are discussed.",

South Africa's commercial shark fisheries have increased over the last decade and there is a need to ensure sustainable utilisation and conservation of this fisheries resource. Here, we give an overview of the molecular techniques that are used to assist in the identification of species, cryptic speciation and possible interspecific hybridisation, as well as the assessment of population structure and reproductive behaviour of endemic and commercially important chondrichthyan species of southern Africa. We discuss the potential application of these techniques for management and conservation of several species affected by South African fisheries. Acquiring baseline barcode data of all chondrichthyans in southern African waters and assessing the population structure of exploited species on a local and greater regional scale are recommended as research priorities. Future prospects should also include high-throughput molecular marker development and investigation of intraspecies functional variation using next generation sequencing technology.",

The 95% fixed kernel (95% FK) home range sizes were large, showing a marked seasonal variation in movement. One adult male dispersed 150 km over two seasons (winter and spring) and thereafter settled into a home range that it maintained. Transient home ranges of males and juveniles were larger than resident home ranges. The mean resident home ranges (95% FK) across seasons for adult males, adult female and juvenile males were 11.4 ± 4.3 km2, 5.6 ± 0.36 km2 and 2.15 ± 0.45 km2, respectively. The mean transient home ranges (95% FK) of all the seasons for adult and juvenile males were 1 181.93 ± 575.81 km2 and 104.27 ± 35.64 km2, respectively. Adult jackal preferred croplands in spring, summer and autumn but avoided croplands in winter.

Scoping surveys of literature and thematisation of common issues related to hippo ecology, human-hippo conflict and conservation were used for data collection. Hippos play integral ecological roles, such as habitat engineering through track creation in water systems, nutrient recycling by swirl spread of highly organic faeces, harbouring commensal water birds, parasites and leeches. Regardless, the hippo population is not well documented for the country with indications of sharp declines in freshwater systems during the period 1982 to 1992 and gradual recovery thereafter. Habitat degradation, water pollution, climate change, drought-induced extreme water level fluctuation, poaching and deliberate culling, as part of problem-hippo control (PHC), are key drivers of hippo population declines. However, it appears much of the attention is on human-hippo conflict and its consequences, resulting in negative perceptions among human communities. Commercial breeding of hippos for non-consumptive tourism, and export-orientated meat, and ethnomedical mimics of hippo sweat and milk products are new, potentially viable, but unexplored options for conserving and increasing the population of the species in Zimbabwe. Currently, it appears more anti-hippo poaching patrols and awareness campaigns especially in water systems outside protected areas may be key to sustaining the current hippo population. For the future, it is essential to increase the scope for hippo census data to include water systems inside and outside protected areas for sustainable conservation of the species in the country.",

In South Africa, many species of tarantula (Theraphosidae) are kept as pets. It is not known which species are traded, which are most popular, and whether their names are correctly applied. Online traders and physical pet stores were investigated between 2015 and 2016 to determine the extent or size of trade, species composition, most popular species, and their invasion history elsewhere. In total, 36 specimens, three individuals from 12 putative species, were also purchased for DNA barcoding targeting the COI gene region to quantify the accuracy of tarantula identification by traders. In total, 195 tarantula species were advertised for sale, and the most popular species were Brachypelma albopilosum Valerio, 1980 (n = 199), B. vagans Ausserer, 1875 (n = 132), and Grammostola rosea Walckenaer, 1837 (n = 120). The composition of shared species differed between the sources and most of the species were advertised online. Only one of the popular species, B. vagans, has been recorded as being invasive elsewhere. Only 36% of the barcoded specimens matched existing barcodes in online repositories that had the same species name. The three individuals from 12 putative species were not in the same terminal clade as those of conspecifics in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) and the NCBI GenBank reference sequences. A large proportion of the known tarantula species are traded in South Africa and must be included in management and risk assessments to avoid potential invasions.",

It is the most-farmed freshwater fish species in EAC and the second-most-farmed worldwide. Currently, in EAC, through direct stocking activities and likely indirectly via aquaculture escapees, Nile tilapia are present in waterbodies where it is not native and where it is thought to have contributed to the fish biodiversity loss observed in recent decades. Introduced Nile tilapia may hybridise with native, congeneric species, promoting genetic introgression that can be detrimental to the sustainability of biodiversity. Moreover, the translocation dynamics and escapes from aquaculture can contribute to artificial geneflow between Nile tilapia stocks, compromising their gene pool and the sustainability of the species as a fishery resource. In the current work, we review some examples of these phenomena in EAC. Additionally, we explore the importance of collecting genetic data to define baseline knowledge for native and non-native Nile tilapia populations that can be used in monitoring programmes for development, management and conservation of tilapia genetic resources.",

Terrestrial invertebrates were collected from three sites on the Kruis River in theWestern Cape Province, South Africa, using pitfall traps within the dry stream bed over summer months (Jan–Feb). 9848 individuals representing 19 different orders were collected. Taxa were separated and biomass determined for aerial and non-aerial invertebrates. Significantly greater (P < 0.05) numbers of aerial than non-aerial taxa and individuals suggest that most individuals could use flight to escape the onset of surface flows. The absence of significant differences between the biomass (wet weights) of aerial and non-aerial individuals (P>0.05) suggests, however, that a large proportion of the biomass isconfined to the main channel. The inability of a large portion of the biomass to escape the onset of flow through the use offlight suggests that periodically inundated areas of the stream channel constitute an ecologically significant componentof temporary stream ecosystems. The concept of the flood pulse should be expanded to include aseasonal and secular variations in flow which in temporary streams create lateral movements that provide the driving mechanism for the entrainment of organic material.",

The minimum estimate derived from direct enumeration of marked and unmarked individuals is between 100–103 individuals.

A clear seasonal pattern of occurrence with the main peak between October and December was evident. Most killer whales were observed within 5 m of the shore and adult males typically occurred further offshore than adult females. The distribution of killer whales around the island was not uniform and more than 80 % of all sightings occurred close to the base station. This was probably due to a concentration of search effort in the vicinity of the base station and to an uneven distribution of prey species. Killer whales occurred in groups with an average of 3.56 individuals and a maximum of 28 animals per group; females predominated throughout the study. Dawn-to-dusk surveys of killer whales in the near-shore waters during 1986, 1989 and 1990 showed small, statistically non-significant peaks of sightings in the early morning and late afternoon. Twenty-six killer whales were individually identified from photographs, eleven of which recurred at Marion Island.

    "abstract": "The insectivorous bat Chaerephon pumilus has a wide distribution in Africa and displays considerable variation in the colour of its wings and venter.We investigated whether variation is also evident in its morphology, echolocation and diet by comparing a population of this species in Amani Nature Reserve, Tanzania, with published data for these characters elsewhere in its range. Chaerephon pumilus in Amani is on average larger than individuals of this species elsewhere in its range. The Amani population has a longer mean forearm (39.1 ± 3.3mm)than populations in Ghana (36.4 ± 1.0 mm) and southern Africa (38 mm) and a higher wing loading (15.3 ± 2.2 N/m2) than populations in South Africa (mean = 12.6 N/m2). Its echolocation calls are of lower minimum, maximum and peak frequency but of a longer inter-pulse interval than in South Africa. As in other parts of its range, the Amani bats ate small insects ranging in body length from 3–8 mm. However, the most notable difference in the diet of the Amani population was the consumption of cockroaches (Blattodea: Blaberidae) which comprised more than 60% of the diet. These cockroaches shared the roost with the bats and the bats probably used vision to detect and capture the cockroaches by crawling on the rafters supporting the roof of the roost. Elsewhere in its range the diet of C. pumilus is dominated by Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Diptera.",

    "abstract": "Because of the inadequacy of existing biodiversity distribution data, surrogate measures for regional biodiversity have long been used in conservation area selection. These measures include species and environmental data. However, the assumed relationship between surrogate measures and regional biodiversity has seldom been demonstrated. This study uses species and environmental surrogates (vegetation and landtypes) in selecting areas for conservation in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The success of these measures in capturing known regional biodiversity is evaluated, as well as their success at identifying areas containing threatened, rare and endemic non-target biodiversity features. The effects of size, scale and quality of databases are also evaluated. There is a trade-off between representing non-target biodiversity features (especially rare, threatened and endemic features) and land-use efficiency. The trade-off between efficiency and representation suggests that many important conservation areas identified will rely on off-reserve management rather than formal protection. Furthermore, the results suggest that the IUCN-recommended national conservation targets of 10 % are inadequate.",

Male fish dominated the samples, possibly an effect of aggressive behaviour towards the sampling gear used. Ages, determined from sectioned sagittal otoliths, ranged from one to nine years with 94% of the sample being between one and four years of age. An annulus was deposited in late-winter/early spring. Female fish, despite being the largest fish sampled, were found to grow at a significantly slower rate than males. Growth was modelled with the von Bertalanffy model as L(t)=37.22(1–exp(–0.66t)) cm SL for males, and L(t) = 48.16(1–exp(–0.41t)) cm SL for females. All fish matured after one year, thereafter they spawned over a four-month period between July and October. Reproductive activity peaked in August. Largemouth bass has successfully colonized freshwater bodies in southern Africa where it has been introduced, causing significant ecological damage to the indigenous ichthyofauna. Given its ability to grow to a large size, and live to an old age and to breed successfully, further introductions should be viewed with extreme caution.",

Although most species exhibited wide tolerance ranges to both environmental variables, preference ranges could be identified in many cases. Among the fourteen species studied, three were found mostly at high salinities, two were confined to sandy substratum, and four showed a clear preference for muddy sediment. The crab Paratylodiplax algoense was identified as a euryhaline marine species and the larvae of chironomid midges, previously believed to be oligohaline species, were found to be tolerant to near seawater salinities.",

During the study 151 animals belonging to 12 species were reported killed. The majority, 76%, of prey species were migratory herbivores. Night hunting with dogs was the most common hunting method for medium-sized prey (biomass ≤40 kg), while the majority of the large herbivores were killed by snares. When actively stalking, hunters killed more males of most of the species recorded, as well as more immatures than adults. Passive hunting also generally had a male-bias. This suggests that the male-bias in kills probably is more a result of behavioural factors among the animals, combined with poor hunting technology, than deliberate choice of the hunters.",

Recent literature regarding North African phylogeographic studies of reptiles was compiled, and several surprising patterns emerged. The most interesting was the extensive movement of species across the Strait of Gibraltar during the Pleistocene. Another is the general pattern of deep genetic divergences between Tunisian and Moroccan populations, often at a level implying the existence of cryptic species. Natrix maura has three distinct lineages in North Africa, however, it apparently did not cross the Strait of Gibraltar during the Pleistocene, but probably did so during the Messinian salinity crisis.",

    "abstract": "The Molossidae bat Mops midas has a broad distribution across portions of Africa and is also known from Madagascar. The African populations have been referred to the subspecies M. m. midas and those from Madagascar to M. m. miarensis. The subspecific differences between these two forms have been called into question. However, largely due to the rarity of the Malagasy subspecies in collections, it has not been previously possible to address this point. Recent bat surveys on Madagascar have found that this species is relatively common in portions of the west and south; using these new collections, we address the question of the distinctiveness of miarensis. External measurements and soft-part anatomy, as well as cranial and dental measurements and structure, revealed few differences between the African and Malagasy populations. Further, molecular comparisons using 1080 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome b found a divergence of only 0.1% between South African and Malagasy populations, compared with a divergence of 13.3/13.5% between them and M. condylurus/M. leucostigma. Further, comparisons of 304 bp of the more variable mitochondrial d-loop revealed a divergence of only 1.2% between South African and Malagasy M. midas, compared with a divergence of 40.9/42.3% between them and M. condylurus/M. leucostigma. Consequently, we propose that no subspecific variation should be recognized in M. midas. A biogeographic analysis is presented with regards to movements of molossid bats between portions of eastern and southern Africa and Madagascar.",

An unidentified sample of 18 Biomphalaria specimens from Lake Albert were divided in three morphotypes according to aperture height and coiling rate and subsequently identified through molecular inferences and morphometry. The 18 specimens were identified as follows; six specimens were identified as B. sudanica, seven species as B. stanleyi, four as B. cf. choanomphala and a single specimen as B. pfeifferi. The latter was inferred with strong molecular support only, since it had similar shell morphology to typical B. stanleyi snails, thus it might be an ecophenotypic form of B. pfeifferi adapted to a lacustrine environment. Biomphalaria stanleyi exists in forms that resemble B. choanomphala, and B. choanomphala has further overlap in morphology with B. smithi. However, the results showed some disagreement between molecular and morphometric identification, hence making it difficult to rely on shell morphology alone in identification. Overall the morphometric analysis divided Biomphalaria in two possible ecophenotypes i.e. a lacustrine type with rapidly increasing whorls and relatively high apertures and a non-lacustrine type (including snails inhabiting lake edges) with slowly increasing whorls and low apertures.",

Deaths from entanglement have been documented in Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea and the Republic of the Congo. In Namibe Province, Angola, 4.8 artisanal fishing boats and two gillnets per km were observed in some areas within 1 km of the coast and gillnets are deployed regularly inside bays used by dolphins. Other concerns include the 'marine bushmeat' trade, habitat loss/degradation, overfishing, marine pollution, anthropogenic sound and climate change. Conservation challenges include a paucity of scientific data on the species, and widespread human poverty within most range states, resulting in high dependence on artisanal fisheries. Recommended conservation and research priorities include: (1) distribution and abundance surveys in known and potential range states, (2) bycatch monitoring programmes, (3) education/awareness schemes, and (4) protection of core areas via reduction/elimination of nearshore gillnetting.",

Two clades can be identified through maximum likelihood, bayesian and network analyses: the first one is limited to the Korup National Park, while the second one has a broad geographical distribution in west-Central Africa. The second clade can be further divided into three sub-clades. The results of neutrality tests and mismatch distributions indicate that a population expansion occurred in these sub-clades. During the middle or upper Pleistocene, the west-Central African populations of P. misonnei may have been isolated in four different forest refugia, followed by population expansion and secondary contact during more humid periods. High genetic diversity was observed in the region of the Bakossi highlands, and the Cameroon Volcanic Line limits the geographical distribution of clades. Thus it seems likely that this volcanic line has in the past constituted a barrier that prevented the east—west exchange between P. misonnei populations through the expansion of the montane forest habitat. Our results also highlight the role of the Sanaga and Ogooué-Ivindo rivers in shaping P. misonnei genetic structure.",

    "abstract": "The status of waterbirds breeding in protected areas in North Africa needs constant monitoring because of a naturally fluctuating environment and permissive attitudes towards illegal activities likely to negatively affect population dynamics of threatened species. We present the results of a study conducted at a protected site, Lake Tonga, north-eastern Algeria, on a breeding population of Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca, a Near-Threatened duck subjected to considerable pressure from egg-pilfering and illegal hunting. Two distinct habitats within the lake were used by Ferruginous Duck: an Alder carr (Alnus glutinosa) and floating islets across the lake. The mean clutch size was 9.51±1.84 eggs (N = 51 clutches) with hatching rate of 80.7% for successful clutches. Breeding success was low (37%) with predation (33%) and clutch desertion (17%) accounting for the majority of failed nests. The probabilities of nest failure and nest desertion increased with a delayed onset of egg laying. Predation was not significantly associated with egg laying date and vegetation cover, but late breeders nesting in dense vegetation seemed to suffer less predation. Conspecific brood parasitism was positively associated with nest size, whereas interspecific brood parasitism was marginally associated with water depth. We discuss different hypotheses concerning nest desertion, and argue that illegal hunting and disturbance may best explain why birds desert their nests.",

    "abstract": "It has long been presumed that waterbirds disperse the propagules of aquatic organisms. However, it is only in recent years that this claim has been empirically explored and little is still known about waterbird-mediated dispersal in southern Africa. Aquatic invertebrates are thought to be well adapted to dispersal by waterbirds because of their ability to produce hardy resting eggs. We explored the capacity of waterbirds to disperse the eggs of both cladocera and bryozoans via endo- and ectozoochory. We examined 283 faecal samples and 394 feather brushings from six waterbird species and two wetland sites in South Africa for the presence of diapausing eggs. A total of 108 intact diaspores were recovered, with intact eggs present in 16% and 7% of the faecal samples and feather brushings, respectively. Our results indicate that southern African waterbirds do take up the resting eggs of aquatic invertebrates and that these eggs can survive intact through the gut or remain attached to the feathers. These results provide evidence that waterbirds may be important vectors for aquatic invertebrates in southern Africa and imply that waterbirds may play a vital role in maintaining connectivity between invertebrate populations in isolated wetland patches.",

To date the majority of published data on metal monitoring has been on limited regions or once-off sampling events. In this paper, we present the first data on metal exposure at sites along the eastern seaboard of South Africa in resident brown mussels (Perna perna) from six harbour sites (Cape Town, Durban, East London, Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth and Richards Bay Harbours) over a two-year period (2008 and 2009). These data do not represent historical or the current metal exposure levels, but rather an indication of the degree of metal exposure fluctuations over two years at the same site. Metal accumulation of aluminium, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, selenium, strontium, uranium and zinc was determined by thermo-inductive coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry. The results showed marked fluctuations in metal concentrations between years and identified Cape Town, Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth Harbours as those sites where mussels had the highest metal levels. Statistically significant variations in metal concentrations were observed between the two sampling periods and the six harbours. Metal concentrations decreased from 2008 to 2009, which was largely attributed to changes in ambient metal concentrations, as a result of variable non-point discharges of metals into the harbours and larger-scale oceanographic changes in upwelling events. The results further emphasise the necessity for annual monitoring of the South African marine environment.",

    "abstract": "Climate and land use change are anticipated to alter the distribution of wildlife, due to their impact on the quantity and quality of forage availability, water cycle, as well as competition for key resources. Using an ensemble of species distribution models (SDMs), we sought to predict changes in the distribution of the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) in response to climatic and land cover change in Africa. We found that African elephant distribution is driven predominantly by changes in temperature followed by changes in precipitation and land cover. Our results show that 17.1% of the continent shows high suitability for L. africana under the current climatic conditions, while 56.6% is unsuitable under similar climatic conditions. The modelled current suitability shows that high and moderately suitable areas for L. africana are predicted to occur in the eastern, southern and part of western Africa. In 2050, unsuitable area for elephants under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 is projected to increase by 12.7% and 14.1%, respectively. In contrast, the highly suitable area for L. africana is projected to decrease by 51.3% and 67.6% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Compared to the current climatic conditions, in 2070 highly suitable areas for L. africana are projected to decrease by 74.5% and 85.9% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Climate change and land cover change are expected to worsen and become one of the major drivers for the loss of several wildlife species like the African elephant due to their impact on availability of water and forage. Therefore, conservation and management of elephant populations under global change calls for carefully designed migratory corridors and conservation of trans-frontier landscapes to enable dispersal of the elephants and other associated species to more conducive environments.",

All the above species showed considerable inter-annual variation in their respective contributions to annual catch.

Mean overall annual cpue by number and weight showed a non-significant increase over the period, while each of the investigated species showed a constant trend in mean annual weight.

    "abstract": "The Knysna seahorse, Hippocampus capensis, is an endangered teleost confined to three South African estuaries. Its abundance within these systems is low and distributions are patchy. Consequently, monitoring population sizes is labour-intensive. The aim of this study was to establish if Knynsa seahorses are associated with specific regions within the estuaries, on which conservation efforts could concentrate. The relationship of Knysna seahorses with aquatic vegetation was analysed in the Knysna Estuary (the largest of the three estuarine systems inhabited by H. capensis) to determine whether this species shows a preference for a particular plant species, vegetation density or vegetation height. Seahorses were associated with five dominant aquatic plants: Zostera capensis, Caulerpa filiformis, Codium extricatum, Halophila ovalis and Ruppia cirrhosa. Together, these comprised 96% of the submerged objects with which seahorses were associated. The relative abundance of plant species changed along the estuary, but seahorses were present throughout the system, except at the estuary mouth, which was characterized by low plant densities and strong currents. No significant difference was found between the proportion of plant species present in a particular region of the estuary and the proportion of plants that seahorses used as holdfasts. However, when Z. capensis and C. filiformis were present at the same sites, adult seahorses preferred C. filiformis as holdfast. Adult seahorse density (individuals/m2) was significantly correlated with percentage vegetation cover and with holdfast length, but juvenile seahorse density was not. Nonetheless, significantly more adult and juvenile seahorses were found at sites characterized by high vegetation cover (>75%) than at sites with lower cover. Our results indicate that although there is some evidence that Knynsa seahorses prefer certain plant species over others, they are likely to be encountered anywhere in the estuary where aquatic plants are present. Conservation efforts in the Knysna Estuary should thus concentrate on such vegetated areas, which comprise approximately 11% of the total submerged surface area.",

The influences of organic and conventional treatments were compared in two vineyard blocks, one previously organically and the other conventionally managed. In each block, experimental plots received either full chemical weed control or ‘organic’ treatment, as recommended by the Organic Standards of the British Soil Association. Pest and disease control practices followed in the conventionally treated vineyard block included the use of various pesticides. The bait-lamina test was used to assess feeding activity of soil organisms. The feeding activity in the previously organically managed block, subsequently receiving conventional surface chemical treatment, decreased over time as the soil moisture content decreased. A comparison of feeding activity and moisture content on the previously organically managed block after both types of treatments, indicated that the activity was substantially higher in the organically treated plots compared to the conventionally treated ones, while the soil moisture contents were very similar. This indicated that the organic treatment favoured soil biological activity directly or indirectly. The treatment contributed to the preservation of more favourable moisture conditions for soil biological activity. A microcosm study to determine feeding activity of fauna in soil from both vineyard blocks, each subjected to both a conventional and organic treatment under controlled conditions in the laboratory, showed a statistically significantly (P < 0.05) higher feeding activity in the soil that was organically treated and provided further indications that organic management practices, as used here, may result in higher soil faunal feeding activity over the short term compared to conventional practices.",

In this study, rock hyraxes did not reduce their body temperature substantially overnight and thus basking was not used for rewarming but rather to maintain constant body temperatures under low ambient conditions. Frequency of basking changed throughout the day as Tbb increased and decreased. Different basking postures (hunched or flat), orientations to the sun and basking bout lengths were modified depending on Tbb experienced.

There was a significant difference in the frequency of prey items between the reserve and the rangeland samples in terms of the relative contribution of the prey taxa. Medium-sized and small ungulates were heavily utilized in the reserve, whilst the diet in rangelands was composed largely of small mammals (including small ungulates).

Three undescribed mite species were also recovered and new locality records were obtained for six flea, two lice, two mite and one tick species. Several flea, mite and tick species were shared between R. pumilio and O. irroratus. Both the mean abundance of the total ectoparasite burdens and the mean tick abundance were significantly higher on R. pumilio individuals that were trapped in habitats preferred and occupied by large antelope species compared to habitats in which antelope were absent or rarely present.",

    "abstract": "Reptiles have an amazing diversity of life-history attributes ranging from the shortest- to longest-lived of vertebrate species. Estimating survival in wild populations is of key importance when understanding population dynamics and life-history evolution. However, data are lacking for a large and charismatic group of lizards, the chameleons. We conducted a Robust Design (RD) capture—mark—recapture (CMR) experiment on the Cape dwarf chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, at two nested sites within the Cape Town Metropolitan Area, South Africa, in order to estimate survival and movement of adults in and around an isolated 3.5 ha patch of suitable habitat. Over a nine-week period, 97 individuals were identified in 379 captures from five primary capture sessions with three secondary events each. Analysis of CMR data provided evidence that smaller chameleons have a substantially lower survival per 10-day period than larger chameleons. RD analysis showed that males were more prone to temporary emigration than females, while open multi-strata analysis revealed that smaller chameleons more readily moved between the sites than larger chameleons. Our findings offer first important insights into chameleon survival and life-history dynamics, which suggest a more vagile subadult population and the possibility of male biased dispersal. Our results have implications for managing the conservation of threatened chameleon populations in highly fragmented urban habitats.",

All host specimens were parasitized by one or more metazoan parasite species. The parasite species included five monogeneans (Gyrodactylus rysavyi, Macrogyrodactylus clarii, Macrogyrodactylus congolensis, Quadriacanthus clariadis and Q. aegypticus), four digeneans (Diplostomum type 3, Tetracotyle sp. metacercaria, Acanthostomum sp. and Glossidium pedatum), two nematodes (Contracaecum larvae and Paracamallanus cyathopharynx), two cestodes (Proteocephalus glanduligerus and Tetracampos ciliotheca), two branchiurans (Chonopeltis inermis and Dolops ranarum), one copepod (Lamproglena clariae) and one unidentified leech. Eleven parasites were satellite species, with low prevalence (<33%) and mean abundance (<12.9 parasites per host). The nematode larvae (L3) of Contracaecum sp. were the dominant species, constituting 56% of the total metazoans (100% prevalence, mean abundance and mean intensity 96.3). Infra- and component community species richness and diversity were high. The dominance of hostspecific parasite species in the sharptooth catfish confirms that its metazoan fauna has a considerable degree of specificity. This study indicates the importance of ecological determinants of richness in metazoan communities of the sharptooth catfish from dams in an oligotrophic state.",

We found a significant correlation between rank and females' mean self-scratching rates over the study period, with subordinates showing higher rates of self-scratching. Analysis of temporal variation in females' self-scratching rates indicated that while these rates were related to measures of both grooming and aggression, the relationship between rank and self-scratching remained significant even after controlling for these effects. Our data suggest that lower ranked female Barbary macaques suffer higher levels of anxiety than more dominant individuals, and hence that there is an emotional cost associated with having low social status in this species.",

During a 12-month field study involving the capture of 33 colonies of mole-rats, the number of occupants, breeding females and sex ratio within colonies were recorded. While thirty of these social groups contained a single breeding queen, three were found to exhibit plural breeding among females, having two queens present simultaneously. Mean ± S.E.M. colony size was 8.7 ± 2.2 (range 6–16, n = 33). The occurrence of plural breeding and small group size is consistent with the predictions of the aridity food distribution hypothesis for social species inhabiting mesic habitats. The sex ratio of the population was skewed towards females at 1.2:1. The mean mass of adult males was 63.0 ± 18.3 g (range 36.7–110.3, n = 87) while that for adult females was 52.9 ± 11.8 g (range 35.1–77.8, n = 86). Pregnant and lactating females were found throughout the study period from February 2009 to February 2010, indicating an aseasonal pattern of breeding in this species. Autopsy of individuals (n = 288) from the 33 colonies revealed a total of 19 pregnant females. Nine of these were in the latter stages of pregnancy and mean litter size was determined as 2.7 pups (range 1–4). Collectively, these new data reveal that Fukomys anselli share many similarities in life history and reproductive traits with the phylogentically closely related giant Zambian mole-rat, Fukomys mechowii.",

The House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) was chosen as a bio-indicator of metal pollution due to its abundance, non-migratory lifestyle and close association with humans. The aims were to determine the viability of using feathers as a non-lethal bio-indicator tissue compared with muscle. Plume feathers, flight feathers and muscle tissue were analysed using ICP-OES techniques. Analyses of tissue metal concentrations identified the following trend: plume feather > flight feather > muscle tissue. Within the Thohoyandou region, Magondi, which was affected by anthropogenic activities at the time of sampling, had significantly higher concentrations (p ≤ 0.05) for each of the metals, indicating potential metal contamination from various sources. Alternatively, Makonde had the lowest metal concentrations and may be an important reference site for future comparative studies. The results showed that the House Sparrow can be used as a bio-indicator organism in South African terrestrial environments. The plume feathers indicate that they are a good non-lethal tissue for determining metal pollution levels on a temporal scale, indicating recent metal exposure.",

Despite the fact that some African bat species seem to provide essential ecosystem services across landscapes, we only have a limited understanding of how intensive agricultural practices influence bat communities. This study investigated the effects of sugarcane monoculture on the composition of both bat species and functional groups across a conservation-agricultural matrix. Specifically, we wanted to understand changes in the bat communities within savannas and sugarcane plantations. We categorised bats into broad foraging (functional) groups based on their echolocation call structure: open-air; clutter-edge; and, clutter. To measure bat activity, we established twelve 25 ha grids randomly located in savanna and sugarcane vegetation. Within each grid we placed nine acoustic detectors, in 3 × 3 formation, 250 m apart; totalling 54 plots in each land use. We sampled each plot over four nights (two in the wet season and two in the dry season) during a one-year period. We did not observe a significant difference in species richness between savanna and sugarcane. However, there was a difference in functional group composition. Sugarcane negatively affected clutter foragers; this group was practically absent here despite occurring within neighbouring savannas. We observed distinct patterns of seasonality in bat activity, with activity of all functional groups being reduced in the dry season.",

However, bats that feed on these insects may also accumulate metal pollutants such as cadmium and copper in their tissues, with acute or chronic effects on their health. Using a time expansion bat detector, the activity (number of passes and feeding buzzes) of Neoromicia nana (family Vespertilionidae) was quantified at threeWWTWpoints – upstream, the point of wastewater effluent discharge, and downstream – along three urban rivers in South Africa. In addition, metal concentrations in the kidney, liver and muscle tissue of N. nana caught at the sites were quantified. The diversity of aerial insects, sampled over the same period as the bat surveys, was measured using a black light trap and sweep-netting. Relative abundance and feeding activity of N. nana were higher at wastewater-polluted sites than at upstream sites. The most abundant insect order at wastewater-polluted sites and in the diet of resident bats was Diptera. Essential metals (copper, zinc and iron) were detected in all N. nana tissue samples, but the toxic metals cadmium, chromium and nickel were mostly present in tissue of bats at wastewater-polluted sites. Thus, although WWTWs provide an optimal food resource to bats in the short-term, it may pose serious long-term health risks for these top predators.",

Previous research on seed predation and dispersal by rodents in the Fynbos Biome of South Africa has relied on indirect evidence, as methods for directly monitoring rodent–seed interactions were not available. The aims of the study were to determine which resident small mammals scatter-hoard nuts and the geographic, seasonal and taxonomic extent of scatter-hoarding in the Fynbos Biome. We used camera traps focused on seed stations at eight sites in the Fynbos Biome to determine the responses of small mammals to tagged nut-like fruits (nuts) of seven endemic plant species belonging to the Proteaceae (n = 3), Rosaceae (n = 2), Restionaceae (n = 1) and Cupressaceae (n = 1), as well as commercial sunflower seeds. We found Acomys subspinosus and Gerbilliscus paeba scatter-hoarded nuts, which they typically carried and buried individually. Rhabdomys pumilio and Micaelamys namaquensis only consumed nuts. Leucadendron pubescens and L. loranthifolium are added to the list of known plant species that are scatter-hoarded by rodents. Nuts of Cliffortia cuneata and C. phillipsii, and the critically endangered Widdringtonia cedarbergensis, were consumed but not dispersed by small mammals, whereas nuts of Ceratocaryum argenteum were neither consumed nor scatter-hoarded by rodents (within its native range). Gerbilliscus paeba and A. subspinosus scatter-hoarded nuts aseasonally, outside of seed-fall periods. Scatter-hoarding was widespread throughout the Fynbos Biome, although it was highly localised across and within sampled sites. The absence of scatter-hoarding rodents at sites with rodent-dispersed plants remains an important aspect for future investigation.",

The results revealed that gatherers and filterers dominated in the Kowie River, and together represented 50–83% of the invertebrate assemblages. There was a general paucity of shredders (relative abundance was <10% at all sites and times). The changes in relative abundances of the different FFGs did not always follow the predictions of the RCC, as there were no correlations of community structure with river width or canopy cover in some seasons; however, some predictions of the RCC were supported, as a dominance of filterers (with relatively small contributions from shredders and grazers) and a consistent presence of predators were recorded. The FFG abundances were correlated with water velocity and total dissolved solids. Broadly, shifts in relative abundances of FFGs along the river continuum could not be explained by physical attributes alone, and were probably influenced by the availability of food and the chemistry of the river. Our findings highlight the need for theoretical and field studies across a broad array of African systems to refine the applicability of the RCC and FFG classifications to further develop models of ecosystem function.",

Most of the existing research on these invaders has focused on the intertidal zone, with little attention paid to subtidal habitats. This study addresses this knowledge gap by quantifying the relative abundance and size of native and alien mussels from the high-shore down to the subtidal zone, while accounting for the effects of wave exposure. This was achieved through extensive surveys along the west coast of South Africa and the Cape Peninsula. At all shore zones, mussel abundance varied among species and wave exposures. In intertidal habitats, invasive species were recorded in greatest abundances at wave-exposed sites. Specifically, M. galloprovincialis was dominant in the high-shore, but this pattern changed down the shore. In the mid-shore, the invaders were equally dominant over native mussels, while in the low-shore S. algosus became the most abundant. Notably, the native Choromytilus meridionalis was absent intertidally. In the subtidal zone M. galloprovincialis was rarely present, whereas S. algosus maintained a strong presence. The maximum size of native Aulacomya atra and invasive S. algosus in the subtidal zone was roughly double that recorded in the intertidal zone. Importantly, these results highlight that observations made from intertidal studies of mussel invasions cannot be used to infer subtidal patterns.",

Data collected by the Oceanographic Research Institute's Cooperative Fish Tagging Project (ORI-CFTP) were used to describe the large-scale movement patterns of Lichia amia along the South African coastline. A total of 10 762 L. amia were tagged between 1984 and 2012, of which 744 (7%) were recaptured. Most tagging effort, mainly on juvenile and subadult individuals, took place along the south-eastern (i.e. Eastern Cape) and south-western (i.e. Western Cape) regions of the country during summer. Conversely, more L. amia were tagged and recaptured (mostly adults) during winter and spring (July to November) along the north-east coast (i.e. KwaZulu-Natal). Movements (dispersal distance in kilometres) by juveniles were restricted and largely confined to estuaries within the south-eastern and south-western regions of the country. There was a significant effect of fish size on distance moved (ANOVA: p<0.001), with evidence of a distinct seasonal (winter) longshore migration by adults to KwaZulu-Natal. The consequences of juvenile residency in estuarine habitats and high recapture rate of adults during a directed, seasonal spawning migration are discussed in light of improving current fisheries management.",

The analysis of larval, juvenile and mature instars of the new species revealed, for the first time in heterotardigrades, ontogenetic variability in the development of ventral armature.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:7EA21201-8C74-4BFD-8EAF-A131A78805F0",

    "abstract": "Fences are utilised throughout the world to restrict the movements of wildlife, protecting them from threats and reducing human–wildlife conflict. In South Africa the number of privately-owned fenced game reserves has greatly increased in recent years, but little is known about how fencing affects the distribution and movements of target and non-target mammals. We surveyed 2 m either side of the complete fence line of a recently established commercial game reserve in South Africa, identifying signs of animal presence (spoor, scat, foraging or other field signs) while also recording damage (holes) to the fence. Every 250 m we carried out 100 m perpendicular transects either side of the fence, recording vegetation cover and height at 10 m intervals along the transect. We found that livestock (largely cattle) were excluded from the reserve. However, 12% of records of large animal species were recorded outside of the fence line. These species had been introduced to the reserve, strongly suggesting that they had crossed the boundary into the surrounding farmland. Sixteen naturally present wild species were found on both sides of the fence, but we found more evidence of their presence inside the reserve. Observational evidence suggests that they were regularly crossing the boundary, particularly where the fence was damaged, with hole size affecting species recorded. We also found evidence that the construction of the fence had led to a difference in vegetation structure with plant richness and percentage of non-woody plant cover significantly higher inside the fence. While fencing was highly effective at preventing movement of livestock, introduced and wild animals were able to cross the boundary, via holes in the fence. This work shows that the efficacy of the most common approach to preventing animal movement around protected areas depends on the species being considered and fence condition.",

    "abstract": "The modification of natural habitats requires behavioural plasticity, which may be challenging for 'specialist' species. Quantifying habitat requirements and behavioural responses of specialists to landscape transformation is thus a priority for baseline data to inform conservation practices. Using camera-trap surveys of the forest-dependent Lemon Dove Aplopelia larvata in conjunction with detailed microhabitat-scale covariates, we assessed habitat use during two periods in the year: autumn–winter and spring–summer (which largely encompassed peak breeding). We used occupancy modelling of forest-structural covariates to produce models of the probability of occupancy and detection of Lemon Doves in patches of the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest of South Africa. The average occupancy and detection probability as indicated by the top-performing models was 0.39 ± 0.08 and 0.26 ± 0.05, respectively, during autumn–winter, and 0.37 ± 0.08 and 0.25 ± 0.04, respectively, during spring–summer. Although occupancy and probability of detection remained relatively constant between seasons, there was seasonal variation in the influence of individual covariates for both measures. The overall trend of positive influences on Lemon Dove occupancy was that of complex and diverse habitat structures and high plant species richness. The specific covariates that influenced occupancy positively during spring–summer may reflect the ecological requirements for nestling provisioning for both dietary needs and an avoidance of potential disturbance. Thus, while Lemon Doves may be less habitat-specific during autumn–winter, conservation management plans for safeguarding the breeding success of the species are advised to ensure adequate protection of large forest patches with complex and diverse interior structures and minimal disturbance.",

We conducted a comparative field study to investigate the impact of reserve protection on the diversity and community structure of aquatic macroinvertebrates of temporary wetlands (pans) in South Africa. Specifically, we compared the diversity and community composition of macroinvertebrates with a special focus on large branchiopod crustaceans in pans of a protected nature reserve (Ndumo Game Reserve) with that of pans in the surrounding anthropogenically disturbed area (Ndumo Communal Area). Our results show that reserve protection has a significant positive effect on the diversity and community structure of the aquatic macroinvertebrates. The taxon diversity for macroinvertebrates in general and large branchiopods in particular was significantly higher in the Ndumo Game Reserve, compared with the Ndumo Communal Area. Overall, our results illustrate the need for continued protection of reserve areas and pans in this tropical region in South Africa for the conservation of macroinvertebrate species.",

Here we report the positive identification of a third galago species within South Africa’s borders: the Mozambique dwarf galago or Grant’s galago, Galagoides granti (Thomas and Wroughton, 1907). The taxon was previously held to be restricted to Mozambique, eastern Zimbabwe, Malawi and Tanzania, but we have also observed it in the sand forest of Tembe Elephant Park and the Tshanini Community Reserve, near the Mozambique border. The species was formerly mistaken for Galago moholi, erroneously (we believe) extending the range of the latter species into northern KwaZulu-Natal. In South Africa the two small galagos are unlikely to have overlapping ranges: Galago moholi prefers dry savanna woodlands, whereas Galagoides granti is apparently confined to dry sand forest. However, both species may coexist with the larger and more widespread Otolemur crassicaudatus, an inhabitant of moist savanna, forest edge and thicket. The true South African ranges of both small galago species need to be ascertained.Keywords: dwarf galagosGalagoidessand forestTembeTshanini",

    "abstract": "Several national parks on the African continent have been fenced to mitigate human–wildlife conflict, but the effectiveness of different fencing strategies seems to vary between regions. Here, we assessed the effectiveness of electro-fencing for restricting movement patterns of several wild ungulates in Akagera National Park (NP), Rwanda. Following the turmoil of the Rwandan genocide and civil war (1991–1995), large numbers of returning war refugees brought about an increasing pressure on land use, after which considerable parts of the western Akagera NP and adjacent Mutara Game Reserve were degazetted, followed by the construction of an electric fence in 2013 and a helicopter-based game-drive of ungulates into the modern park. We conducted distance sampling of wildlife and domestic livestock in the Uruhita plain – now no longer part of Akagera NP but bordering the modern Akagera NP to the west – for extended periods of time (2010–2015) before and after fencing. For abundant species population densities could be calculated, whereas for other species encounter frequencies are reported. We report on continuously high cattle densities, and increasing encounter frequencies of sheep/goats in the Uruhita plain. We found decreasing densities of zebra (Equus quagga) and decreasing encounter frequencies of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), stagnant encounter frequencies in the case of topi (Damaliscus lunatus jimela) and stagnant densities of impala (Aepyceros melampus). The latter species can jump fences, and we argue that competitive release and reduced predation may be the prime factors leading impala to (temporarily) exploit grasslands outside the modern national park.",

Estimated density on a live-trapping grid in dense cover (woody plants, ferns, grass) near the coast was 224 mice/ha. Snap-trapping at high altitude, in open moorland and bog, indicated lower densities in exposed habitats. In overall size the mice were larger than Mus musculus from other localities, and larger than specimens collected on Gough Island during 1955-56. At the time of sampling 43% of adult females were pregnant or lactating and juveniles made up 14% of the trapped sample. The mean number of 9,2 foetuses per pregnant female suggests that litter size may be larger than those recorded in other feral mouse populations. Mice collected from high altitudes were smaller, and there were no juveniles in the sample. The inference is that breeding commences later at the cooler, high elevations.",

In addition, the size of the pygmy hippo population in the Tai Forest area was monitored between 1995 and 2001. At the time of the initial study, the common hippo inhabited the Sassandra, Bandama and Comoé rivers, but was abundant only in the Upper Comoé. The pygmy hippo was restricted to the Guinean Forest zone between 7°25'N (Tiapleu Forest Reserve (Forêts Classée)) in the north and 4°18'W (estuary of the Agnebi River) in the east, where it was abundant in undisturbed rainforest areas. Population data are presented from the Comoé, Tai and Azagny national parks where the ecology of both species was studied in greater detail. The total popu lation of the common hippopotamus was estimated at about 1100 animals in 1978 1984, of which at least 70% concentrated during the dry season in the Upper Comoé, Leraba and Iringou rivers. The average dry season population density in the Comoé varied at that time between three and four animals per river kilometre, in groups of five to six, but had dropped to one to two per kilometre in 2002. During the rainy season hippos disperse upstream into smaller tributaries and downstream as far as the coast. As the forest zone is modified by forestry and agriculture, small herds of common hippos have become resident and in some localities are sympatric with the pygmy hippo. Pygmy hippos are solitary animals, confined to home ranges of 50 150 ha. In optimal habitat their population density can be as high as seven animals/km2, averaging about three animals/km2 over larger areas of undisturbed rainforest. At present, however, hunting pressure has reduced population densities to 0.8 2.5 animals/km2 even in the most favourable ecological conditions of the Tai National Park. Extrapolation of these densities suggests that the total population of pygmy hippos in the Ivory Coast is greater than previously thought, but does not exceed 15 000 animals. Most of these inhabit the Tai National Park and its adjacent protected areas. The remainder occur mainly in various forest reserves (Forêts classées). Ecological factors, which influence population density or limit pop ulation growth of the two different hippo species, are discussed and recommendations made for their conservation.",

Consequently, locality data of positively identified (karyotyped and/or electrophoretically determined) specimens from South Africa were collated from museum records, the literature, and recently collected material in an attempt to: 1) delimit geographic distributions using positively identified specimens; 2) predict the most likely areas of occurrence of the two sibling species using a variety of selected eco geographic variables (EGVs) associated with verified locality data; and 3) assess both verified and predicted geographic distributions with reference to previously reported incidents of plague in South Africa. Both verified and predicted distributions are broadly similar and show a geographic separation along the eastern escarpment of South Africa that seems to be influenced by altitude and rainfall. M. natalensis occurs in the low altitude/high rainfall eastern coastal region, extending to northeastern South Africa, while M. coucha keeps to the high altitude/moderate rainfall central and northeastern South Africa. Although the two species were shown to be either sympatric or to occur in close proximity at four localities, additional research is needed to determine the zone of parapatry. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed statistically significant differences between eco geographic characteristics of collecting localities associated with each of the two species in South Africa. The derived distributions indicate previously reported cases of plague in South Africa, to some extent, coincide with the distributional range of M. coucha rather than M. natalensis.Key words: MastomysCryptic speciesGeographic distributionPlagueSouth Africa",

A land-use map of the study area was derived from a Landsat image, and land-use change information came from an earlier study by the author. Bird data were collected by observations along timed, standardized walks. Shannon (1948) indices of bird diversity for highlands, bushland and lowlands were 3.29, 2.99, and 2.62. The highland category was divided into two subcategories, homegarden and highland garden, as bird populations of the two were distinct. Highland garden had a higher diversity (3.15) than homegarden (3.07). The lower species diversity and number of individuals in homegardens was probably due to lower niche diversity and more human disturbance. Lowland fields had low diversity indices as they are dominated by large flocks of birds. The equitability indices for highlands, bushlands and lowlands were 0.82, 0.80 and 0.65, respectively. Each land-use type had many species that were not seen in the others. As bushland is disappearing, the species currently threatened are the 15 bushland species that are not found in other land-use types. Growing population pressure leading to deagrarianization of the homegarden area is likely to affect homegarden bird populations, though it is not clear whether the very high human population density will prevent it from supporting a highland garden type of a bird population.",

In this study, rock hyraxes did not reduce their body temperature substantially overnight and thus basking was not used for rewarming but rather to maintain constant body temperatures under low ambient conditions. Frequency of basking changed throughout the day as Tbb increased and decreased. Different basking postures (hunched or flat), orientations to the sun and basking bout lengths were modified depending on Tbb experienced. There was no difference in body temperature between the two basking postures at any Tbb.

Larval and early juvenile fishes were collected in seven small bays (30–50 m wide) between Port Alfred (33°36′S, 26°53′E) and Hamburg (33°17′S, 27°29′E), using a modified, beach seine net (500μm mesh). Four bays were sampled weekly during peak fish spawning (September-November 2004) to firstly assess whether larval fishes occur in these previously-unstudied habitats and secondly, to assess the extent of this utilization in terms of species occurrence, abundance and potential nursery function. An additional three replicate bays, situated > 50 km away near Bira were used for comparison. In total, 14 fish families represented by 26 taxa were recorded but the catch was dominated by a small suite of common species. Bays were extensively utilized by Sparidae (Diplodus capensis and Sarpa salpa), and to a lesser extent by Clinidae (Clinus superciliosus), Mugilidae (Liza spp.) and Kyphosidae (Neoscorpis lithophilus). Mean CPUE of larvae was high and exceeded 900 individuals per seine haul. Larval abundance peaked at 4000 larvae per haul and at these times, was dominated only by the two sparid species. Abundance of sparid larvae exceeds that recorded for these species in surf zones, estuaries or the shallow nearshore habitats sampled to date in temperate South Africa by an order of magnitude. Larval abundance was significantly higher during new moon sampling throughout the study period, but was not significantly different between repeated samples collected per site on each fieldtrip. The length-frequency of larvae utilizing the bays was dominated by postflexion stages ranging 7–14 mm SL. Length-frequency distribution of Diplodus, Sarpa, Clinus, Sparodon, Neoscorpis was indicative of grow-out and use of bays as interim nurseries. The nursery function of these bays is supported by gut analysis of a sub-sample of the dominant species, Diplodus capensis, which showed that these larvae were actively feeding in the area, predominantly on copepods. This work prompts further research on shallow habitats associated with rocky shores particularly the shelter and feeding role that these under-studied habitats are playing in the early life history of coastal fishes.",

Rectal temperatures of free-roosting bats were also measured during winter. During summer, the effect of clustering on the incidence of torpor under different climatic conditions was investigated. Mops condylurus were thermolabile and displayed daily bouts of torpor during winter and summer, with body temperatures closely conforming to ambient temperatures. Body temperatures as low as 12.0°C were recorded during winter. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation between body and ambient temperatures in winter and summer. There was no difference in the incidence of torpor between single and clustering bats, although single bats maintained slightly higher body temperatures. Results indicate that M. condylurus maintained an optimally small Tb–Ta differential by readily becoming torpid under roosting conditions, thereby minimizing energy expenditure.",

    "abstract": "Rodents are of concern as reservoirs and transmitters of pathogens that cause zoonotic and other diseases in domestic animals and humans. The contact between wild and urban rodent fauna is increasing in expanding cities in Africa, and this arguably increases the risk of disease transmission to urban populations. When rodents from rural areas are accidentally introduced into cities and encounter urban rodents, for example, in markets, grain mills and butcheries, there is a potential that pathogens are transferred between rural and urban rodent populations. Using a non-toxic biomarker, Rhodamine B (RB), we investigated the distances over which rodents are active around such potential introduction sites. Animals feeding at such sites were traced up to 100 m distant within a period of 10 days. We found that RB is a practical alternative for studying rodent movements. These results may be useful in designing management strategies to reduce the risk of the introduction of new rodent-borne pathogens in cities.",

A total of 49 274 early stage fishes were caught, comprising nine orders, 20 families, 29 genera and 47 taxa. Seven species accounted for 93.4% of the total catch in these estuaries, namely Gilchristella aestuaria (78.8%), Caffrogobius gilchristi (6.2%), Psammogobius knysnaensis (3.5%), C. nudiceps (2.5%), Parablennius sp. (2.4%), Omobranchus woodi (2.1%) and Atherina breviceps (1.9%). The majority (70%) of identified species are endemic to southern Africa and 96.4% of the larvae caught were estuary-resident species. Larval fish assemblages in the sampled estuaries exhibited the same seasonal and spatial patterns described for temperate estuaries both in South Africa and worldwide. Larval fish were more abundant in summer and in the mesohaline zone. The assemblages were less diverse and dominated by fewer species than temperate estuaries along the south east coast of South Africa. The differences found in composition and density of the larval fish assemblages from south and west coast estuaries result from the biogeography of the area and the differences in freshwater inflow.",

For example, aerial censuses show that many mammal populations in the Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem of western Tanzania are declining. Vehicle transect data collected from 1995 to 2011 and presented here confirm many of these declines within Katavi National Park itself. Two factors are believed to be adversely affecting large mammals in this national park: (i) reduced water flow caused by local damming of the Katuma River, for rice cultivation upstream of the park, and (ii) poaching. We used transect data, anti-poaching records and timing of dam emplacements to examine the importance of these factors for 23 species of mammalian herbivores and carnivores as well as two combinatorial measures of mammal species’ abundances. Controlling for rainfall, we found that the number of mammals counted per year was associated with both poaching and dams, the importance of which depended on the species. Both factors appear to be adversely affecting mammal populations in Katavi National Park and we make recommendations to both management and policy makers for tackling these problems. More generally, our study shows that wildlife managers of protected areas in the developing world can readily collect information on wildlife trends and basic ecology and can use them for conservation planning.Key words: Africaanti-poachinghydrologyillegal huntingmammal population changesmanagementwater flow",

    "abstract": "Urbanization through the process of habitat loss and fragmentation affects ecosystems. Many species are no longer able to survive in these urban areas; however, there are some that have been able to persist and even thrive in these habitats. One such species is Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi). Little is known about its existence in urban areas. Consequently we studied their seasonal variation in home range size, movements and foraging dynamics in the urban environment of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. In a pilot study in summer, adult fruit bats (n = 8) were caught, fitted with radio-transmitters, and their movements followed for 12 nights and days. Although their movements varied considerably, no bats left the urban environment. Some of the larger distances covered in a single night were 2 and 5 km. In winter, an additional ten adult fruit bats were caught and fitted with radio-transmitters. Movements were followed for three weeks during winter and spring respectively. Winter home range size was greater than spring home range size. During winter the bats fed mostly on syringa fruits (Melia azedarach), an alien invasive, while their diet in spring was more varied and included species of indigenous and exotic fruits. The reduced variety of fruit eaten in winter may be explained by a reduction in fruiting plant species, and thus a reliance on a few species to meet their dietary requirements. The bats would have a role in seed dispersal but therein lies the problem of them also dispersing invasive plants. Further research is needed to assess the role played by exotic and alien plant species in the continued success of urban wildlife, in particular fruit bats. The seasonal variation in home range size gives insight into the urban movements of Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bats. The use of exotic and invasive plants by these bats is also significant.",

We found that giraffe eye volume increases from 33 cm3 at birth to approximately 65 cm3 in adults. The focal (axial) length increases from c. 40 to 48 mm in adults and retina surface area from c. 3000 mm2 at birth to 4320 mm2 in adults. The orbital axis angle at birth is c. 73° and the horizontal visual field mainly monocular and panoramic. With age the axis angle becomes more acute to c. 50° in adults and the visual field more binocular, changes that occur concurrently with increasing neck length. These results show that the giraffe eye and retinal surface area are larger than in all other ungulates, and their visual fields more binocular, attributes which are consistent with the idea that they have excellent vision.",

We used null models to test if the observed phenotypic patterns deviated significantly from the random patterns expected in the absence of competition or prey defences at ensemble and functional group scales. As we predicted, species packing increased in the species-rich ensemble comprising many morphologically similar species that grouped together, with a few morphologically distinct species dispersed further away. Furthermore, we found evidence that competition influenced flight patterns of the open-air bats at the species-rich river ensemble, and prey defences influenced echolocation patterns of coexisting bats at the ensemble and functional group scales. However, non-deterministic processes such as habitat structure and the physics of sound and flight probably mediated these deterministic processes to influence the phenotypic structure of sympatric bats in urban landscapes.",

Over eight years (2004–2011), 547 birds from 39 raptor species were admitted to the centre. The majority of individuals were spotted eagle-owls (16.6%), western barn owls (15.2%) and yellow-billed kites (9.7%). The most frequent known causes of injury to raptors were motor vehicle accidents and injuries caused when birds flew into buildings. There was no significant difference in admissions of motor vehicle collision cases between seasons. People generally waited 3.8 days before bringing injured raptors in to the centre, and approximately half of the birds admitted were fed within that time, highlighting a need for public education regarding the general diets of raptors and the benefits of prompt medical attention.Key words: raptorsthreatsmortalitiesKwaZulu-NatalSouth Africa",

To provide the necessary tools in order to fill this gap, this study examined the suitability of two enzyme immunoassays for monitoring male and female reproductive function in the southern African spiny mouse (Acomys spinosissimus) based on faecal hormone analysis. Fourteen non-pregnant and one pregnant female and 24 male spiny mice were wild-caught and subsequently monitored under controlled conditions. Thirteen of the 14 non-pregnant females revealed elevated faecal progestagen metabolite concentrations with eight individuals showing indications of a luteal phase. Two females showed two post-ovulatory luteal phases with estimated cycle lengths of 16 and 18 days, respectively. The pregnant female had an elevated (231%) mean faecal progestagen metabolite level compared with the overall mean baseline hormone concentration determined for the 14 non-pregnant females. Males exposed to a long photoperiod, simulating summer-related breeding activity, exhibited a 47.8% increase in faecal androgen metabolite levels compared with males exposed to a short photoperiod. Collectively, the data demonstrated that reproductive endocrine function can be monitored in male and female spiny mice by measuring respective faecal hormone metabolites.",

Fourteen species, none of which are new to science, are added to the known fauna, raising the total number of barnacle species recorded from South Africa by over 20%, from 69 to 83 species. Ten of the additional species are offshore benthic forms and represent deep-water taxa whose ranges are extended into South African waters. The remaining four are coastal inshore or surface-dwelling species, of which three are considered recent anthropogenic introductions. The large number of additions to the fauna can be attributed to a long absence of taxonomic expertise on this group in the region and consequent accumulation of unidentified samples. A high proportion of the deep-water samples examined contained previously unreported species, suggesting that additional sampling of hard abyssal substrata in the region is certain to yield yet more new cirripede records.",

Additionally, the eastern African annual killifishes (Nothobranchius spp.) are rare in southern Africa and found exclusively in temporary habitats. There is a notable lack of literature regarding the diet of these fish, as well as the foodweb structures of temporary ecosystems. The current study aimed to address this paucity in literature by assessing the foodweb of a temporary pool located in the Ndumo Game Reserve (NGR) in northern Kwa-Zulu Natal using stable isotopes analysis. In addition, Bayesian mixing models were used to assess the diet of the spotted killifish Nothobranchius orthonotus over two seasons (dry and wet seasons). The foodweb consisted of only three trophic levels and comprised different foodweb items between the two seasons. Stable isotope analysis indicated significant increases in δ15N from the dry to wet season. It further revealed the diet of N. orthonotus to be more varied and omnivorous with primary producers contributing a much greater percentage toward their diet than previous studies have reported. This study contributes valuable information to the paucity of knowledge regarding foodweb structure and food-chain length of temporary pools in South Africa, as well as new insights into the extended diet of N. orthonotus. The analytical techniques used in this study could also be utilised as part of future research in ecological assessments of temporary pools and other aquatic ecosystems in Africa and globally.",

The most diverse phyla were Mollusca, followed by Arthropoda and Annelida, with few records of Porifera, Nemertea and Echinodermata. Importance of each phylum differs according to country, with arthropods (Upogebia africana and Kraussillichirus kraussi), and annelids (Marphysa mossambica) being most important in South Africa and Kenya, respectively. Of the taxa utilised, only 42 are reliably identified to species level, suggesting that the diversity of species utilised in the region is greatly underestimated. Most of the data on biology and exploitation were for species from South Africa. Less data were available from Kenya with minimal to none being available from the remaining WIO countries. This limits the understanding of biology and trends in exploitation of most bait taxa, and consequently information required for developing national and regional management policies. Bait management guidelines are available only for South Africa, but require updating in view of changes in use of bait resources. We recommend the development of coordinated multidisciplinary, multicountry research aimed at increasing data and information to feed into policy development and support national and regional bait resource management.",

Langebaan Lagoon (part of West Coast National Park and a Marine Protected Area) is divided into three zones. One zone is a sanctuary, a second allows non-extractive visitation, and the third is for general use including bait collecting and fishing. In 1999–2000, the number of people visiting the sandflats to collect bait was highest during summer weekends (x̄ = 48 per day), and was concentrated at two sites: Centre Banks and Klein Oesterwal. Callichirus kraussi was the main species harvested, with an estimated 1 008 178 being removed annually. This represents 0.12% of the sandprawn stock at Centre Banks and Klein Oesterwal, and 0.012% of the estimated total stock. In 2012–2013, total bait-collecting activities had increased 23% compared with 1999–2000, but still constituted a small proportion of the stock. On average, each bait collector removed 86 prawns per outing: 36 more than the legal daily limit. The amount of sediment disturbed annually by bait collecting was estimated as 6189 tonnes. The surface area trampled by bait collectors and associated persons amounted to ~562 800 m2. Thus, although the proportion of C. kraussi harvested constitutes no threat to the stock, associated disturbance has local adverse effects on the ecosystem.",

Varanus albigularis included more terrestrial prey such as diplopods in its diet. Tortoises and millipedes were also prominent in the V. albigularis diet, constituting an important component of dietary intake. Few of our samples from V. albigularis had empty stomachs, suggesting that this species may occupy a lower trophic level than its Australian counterparts.

The region of Souss-Massa in central Morocco exhibits a high incidence of scorpion envenomings, with 29 437 cases reported between 2005 and 2010, resulting in 32 deaths. In the present study, we provide an updated inventory of scorpions occurring throughout the Souss-Massa region, with additional information about their distribution and notes on preferred habitats for each species observed. Sampling was carried out at 39 stations over a three-year period: June and August 2020, April and June 2022, and July and August 2023. Twelve species belonging to two families were recovered over the course of the study. The families Buthidae and Scorpionidae were represented by eleven and a single species respectively. Overall, this represents 71% of all species reported to occur in the Souss-Massa region. Apart from Androctonus mauritanicus, A. bourdoni, A. sergenti and Hottentotta gentili which are present in and around human dwellings, all other species were found in uninhabited areas. Apart from Scorpio mogadorensis, all the species of scorpions we recovered can cause severe envenomation with potentially fatal outcomes. Field-based ecological investigations should be encouraged to gain a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of scorpion distribution patterns and habitat preference. In turn, this will inform the health-science community of the etiological factors responsible for scorpion envenoming.Keywords: species distributionsMoroccoinventoryscorpionic faunaSouss-Massa",

    "abstract": "Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, is a lake of particular interest because of the unusual nature of its benthic macroinvertebrate community. In this study we quantified the spatial and temporal distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates within the lakewith a focus on habitat associations in inshore areas. We focused on four inshore habitats: Nymphaea lotus/Nymphaea caerulea (water lily), Miscanthidium violaceum, Vossia cuspidata (hippo grass) and forest edge. The most notable characteristic of the Nabugabo fauna was the absence of bivalves and crustaceans and the scarcity of gastropods that made up only 1.8 % of the numerical abundance of the benthos. The numerically dominant taxa were ephemeropterans (77.7 %) and dipterans (11.1 %). Annelids (5.4 %), odonates (2.8 %) and trichopterans (1.3 %) comprised a much smaller component of the benthic assemblage. Total invertebrate abundance and the abundance of major taxa did not vary significantly across months, but habitat effects were evident. The water-lily habitat was very depauperate, which may reflect the low levels of dissolved oxygen near the sediments in this habitat. Lake Nabugabo is extremely poor in salts, mean conductivity in inshore sites ranging from 22.3 to 26.4 µS/cm and 22.6 to 37.9 µS/cm (K25) for surface and bottom waters, respectively. The low conductivity (low concentrations of ions) in Lake Nabugabo may limit colonization by molluscs and crustaceans that, with their calcareous shells or exoskeletons, may require water with a higher mineral content.",

This global invader had previously been restricted to rocky shores along the South African coastline. In order to investigate the effect of the invasion on naturally-occurring communities, a comparative study between invaded areas and areas clear of invasion was conducted. Communities in these areas differed significantly (ANOSIM, R = 0.685, P < 0.01). The biomass supported in invaded areas (53 262 g/m2), was significantly greater than that in clear areas (1133 g/m2), (Mann-Whitney, U = 225, P < 0.001). Invertebrate densities supported in invaded (6780.1 individuals/m2) and clear areas (835 individuals/m2) were also significantly different, (Mann-Whitney, U = 219, P < 0.001). Of the 66 species recorded, only 33 % occurred in both clear and invaded areas (often in very different densities), 41 % occurred exclusively in invaded areas, and 26 % were restricted to non-invaded areas. These figures indicate a replacement of the naturally-occurring sandbank communities by those more typical of rocky shores. It is thus recommended that the invasive mussel beds be removed to conserve the natural biota of the centre banks, which lie within a national park.",

    "abstract": "At present considerable effort is being made to document and describe invertebrate diversity as part of numerous biodiversity conservation research projects. In order to determine diversity, rapid and effective sampling and estimation procedures are required and these need to be standardized for a particular group of organisms to allow for comparisons between studies and habitat types. The savanna biome is one of the largest and most important in Africa; however, it is also one of the most poorly studied, especially in terms of invertebrates. This study was undertaken in the Greater Makalali Conservancy, Limpopo Province, South Africa. The effectiveness of six sampling methods (pitfall traps, active searching one 25 m2 nested quadrat, active searching ten 2.25 m2 random quadrats, cryptozoan traps, wet cloths and drive transects) was tested to determine which method, or combination of methods, was the best for sampling millipedes, centipedes and scorpions in the savanna environment. Active searching in a 9 m 2 area was the most effective way to sample millipede species, while the drive transect method was important for sampling larger millipede species. Both the active searching of the nested quadrats and the random quadrats proved to be the most effective methods to sample centipedes. Scorpions were most effectively sampled using pitfall traps. Efficiency for all methods was calculated as the number of species collected per hour. The most effective method was not always the most efficient one, and this needs to be considered when designing a sampling strategy. Sampling more than one period in the summer is important for determining species richness. The number of random quadrats required to sample the fauna is likely to vary in different habitats, and there is a large amount of variation in the number of species collected between samples, which is probably related to high levels of habitat heterogeneity on a small scale. These points, as well as the size, mobility and other biological features of taxa need to be considered in designing a sampling strategy for invertebrates.",

Reproductive behaviour was observed over two nesting seasons and egg production was studied by radiographing telemetered females at regular intervals. We captured and marked 1438 radiated tortoises of which 26% were adults. Mating and nesting coincided with the rainy season, and mating events peaked in December, shortly before females started nesting in January. The incubation period was approximately 263–342 days, and hatchlings emerged after the onset of the rainy season when new plant growth became available. Hatching success was high and incidental destruction by humans rather than predation had the greatest impact on tortoise nests. Individual females produced from 0–3 clutches per season with 1–5 eggs per clutch. Body size had a weak effect on clutch size, but clutch size was lower in the dry year (2000) than in the wet year (1999) and appears to reflect resource availability. Mean egg size per clutch increased significantly with increasing body size. These findings emphasize that protection of large females should be considered in the conservation of this species.",

The diet composition of this lizard community during the early spring was analysed based on 132 faecal pellets which could be individually assigned to a species and a size and sex class. Quedenfeldtia trachyblepharus had the highest prey number and the most specialized prey composition based mainly on small Coleoptera (62.5 ) which were consumed in aggregates. All three lacertids displayed higher but similar levels of populational prey diversity. Lacerta p. chabanaudi mainly fed on flying insects, whereas L. andreanszkyi and P. vaucheri had diets based on terrestrial prey. Larger lizards ate larger prey at both inter- and intraspecific levels. Species overlap was medium-high (48–84 ). Within species, P. vaucheri showed moderate segregation between males and females (74% overlap) whereas the other species did not (>94%). Pseudocommunity analyses revealed community structure based on segregation due to prey not consumed (species) and to the restriction of niche breadth (classes). The influences of species interactions on habitat use, restrictions in trophic availability and evolutionary history as determinant factors are discussed.Key words: trophic ecologycommunitiespseudocommunity analysisLacerta perspicillataLacerta andreanszkyiPodarcis vaucheriQuedenfeldtia trachyblepharusMorocco",

The two most common species were Tatera leucogaster (bushveld gerbil) and Rhabdomys pumilio (striped mouse). The mechanisms examined were habitat selection in a mosaic, microhabitat selection, spatial variation in resource abundance, temporal variation in resource abundance, and diet partitioning. The rodents were censused using mark-recapture live trapping, activity measured using sand-tracking, and foraging efficiency measured using giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food remaining following patch exploitation) in experimental food patches. There was no support for any of the five mechanisms: T. leucogaster tended to be a more efficient and mobile forager than R. pumilio. It is suggested that coexistence maybe based on a sixth mechanism, seasonal variation in resource abundance and a tradeoff of maintenance efficiency versus foraging efficiency. Further, it appears that R. pumilio is more efficient at maintaining harvest potential, not by maintaining high consumer biomass, but rather by having a high intrinsic rate of increase.",

The early developmental stages of Glossogobius callidus and Redigobius dewaali were collected during plankton surveys in seven permanently open and five intermittently open estuaries along southeastern South Africa. Larval G. callidus have a characteristic ventral row of pigment that extends from the cleithral symphysis along the ventral midline of the tail to the end of the caudal peduncle; notochord flexion takes place at the yolk-sac stage, between 3 and 4 mm BL. Larval R. dewaali are characterized by having two very large stellate melanophores on the ventral surface of the trunk and tail, and internal pigment between the snout and hindgut; notochord flexion takes place between 4 and 6 mm. Body lengths at settlement for G. callidus and R. dewaali are 13 mm and 16 mm, respectively. G. callidus and R. dewaali dominate the larval gobiid catch in warm temperate estuaries. Estuary type and freshwater input played a defining role in the occurrence of larvae of these, often sympatric, species in temperate estuaries. Larval G. callidus occurred in both permanently open and intermittently open estuaries, and were most abundant in mesohaline regions over the spring/summer period. By contrast, larval R. dewaali occurred exclusively in permanently open estuaries and were more prevalent in the fresh and oligohaline regions in autumn. Larvae of both species were more prevalent in freshwater-rich estuaries. Densities of G. callidus and R. dewaali peaked at 101 and 3829 larvae per 100 m3respectively. The usefulness of using the early stages of these gobiids as indicators of estuarine health based on their specific and often prolific estuarine occurrence is discussed.",

An exclosure experiment was set up in Mokolodi Nature Reserve, Botswana, to study ecological effects of large herbivores on the small mammal community. Specifically, we attempted to answer the following questions: 1) are population sizes and community composition of small rodents affected by the exclusion of large herbivores?; 2) if so, what changes in the environment caused by the exclusion of large herbivores are related to changes in small mammal populations?; 3) in what way do such changes in the environment affect small mammals? The populations were significantly larger in the exclosures than in the control areas. A higher number of species was also found in the exclosures. It seems that the smaller populations of small mammals in areas with large herbivores are a result of a reduction in vegetation cover. In general, the exclosures had a higher grass cover than their paired controls. This same relation also held for percentage cover of litter and dead grass.",

This sensitivity has been demonstrated in many solitary, nocturnal, small mammals which may fall victim to ambush predators. We tested the response of Cape ground squirrels, a diurnal, group-living small mammal, to the presence of predator (black-backed jackal) faeces and non-predator (black wildebeest) dung in baited traps, and also predator faeces and non-predator dung outside their burrows. The squirrels showed a significantly higher avoidance of traps scented with predator faeces than both control and non-predator dung-scented traps. They also took significantly longer to emerge from burrows that had predator faeces outside compared with control burrows and burrows with non-predator dung outside and showed a trend for higher vigilance once they emerged from burrows with predator faeces outside. We argue that as diurnal group-living reduces a reliance on olfactory cues, this species is more likely to rely on visual cues and the vigilance of other individuals than nocturnal solitary species that have been the focus of most studies up till now. As a result, squirrels very quickly return to normal behaviour after exposure to a predator cue. Level of sociality is likely to influence responses to olfactory cues of predators and should be the focus of further studies.",

In this study we investigated the impact of fire on home range, habitat use and activity patterns of the short-snouted elephant shrew (Elephantulus brachyrhynchus) by radio-tracking individuals before and after a fire event. All animals survived the passage of fire in termite mound refugia. Before the fire, grassland was used more than thickets, but habitat utilization shifted to thickets after fire had removed the grass cover. Thickets were an important refuge both pre- and post-fire, but the proportion of thicket within the home range was greater post-fire. We conclude that fire-induced habitat modification resulted in a restriction of E. brachyrhynchus movements to patches of unburned vegetation. This may be a behavioural response to an increase in predation pressure associated with a reduction in cover, rather than a lack of food. This study highlights the importance of considering the landscape mosaic in fire management and allowing sufficient island patches to remain post-fire ensures the persistence of the small mammal fauna.Key words: fireMacroscelideahabitat modificationhabitat-useSouth Africa",

    "abstract": "The Knysna seahorse, Hippocampus capensis, is an endangered teleost confined to three South African estuaries. Its abundance within these systems is low and distributions are patchy. Consequently, monitoring population sizes is labour-intensive. The aim of this study was to establish if Knynsa seahorses are associated with specific regions within the estuaries, on which conservation efforts could concentrate. The relationship of Knysna seahorses with aquatic vegetation was analysed in the Knysna Estuary (the largest of the three estuarine systems inhabited by H. capensis) to determine whether this species shows a preference for a particular plant species, vegetation density or vegetation height. Seahorses were associated with five dominant aquatic plants: Zostera capensis, Caulerpa filiformis, Codium extricatum, Halophila ovalis and Ruppia cirrhosa. Together, these comprised 96% of the submerged objects with which seahorses were associated. The relative abundance of plant species changed along the estuary, but seahorses were present throughout the system, except at the estuary mouth, which was characterized by low plant densities and strong currents. No significant difference was found between the proportion of plant species present in a particular region of the estuary and the proportion of plants that seahorses used as holdfasts. However, when Z. capensis and C. filiformis were present at the same sites, adult seahorses preferred C. filiformis as holdfast. Adult seahorse density (individuals/m2) was significantly correlated with percentage vegetation cover and with holdfast length, but juvenile seahorse density was not. Nonetheless, significantly more adult and juvenile seahorses were found at sites characterized by high vegetation cover (>75%) than at sites with lower cover. Our results indicate that although there is some evidence that Knynsa seahorses prefer certain plant species over others, they are likely to be encountered anywhere in the estuary where aquatic plants are present. Conservation efforts in the Knysna Estuary should thus concentrate on such vegetated areas, which comprise approximately 11% of the total submerged surface area.",

Of a minimum of 117 species recorded, the most commonly caught species were dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) (26%), milk shark (Rhizoprionodon acutus) (18%) and shad (Pomatomus saltatrix) (10%). By weight, the top species were dusky shark (34%) and diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) (19%). All the above species showed considerable inter-annual variation in their respective contributions to annual catch. Probably as a result of changes in fishing patterns, dusky shark and milk shark showed a general decline in percentage contribution to catch over the period, while contributions of lesser guitarfish (Rhinobatos annulatus), giant guitarfish (Rhynchobatus djiddensis), diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) and brown ray (Himantura gerrardi) increased.

The benthic macro-invertebrate fauna of Edo Ecozone comprises 55 taxa, belonging to 13 major groups. The abundance of major taxonomic groups varied considerably among the surveyed aquatic ecosystems. Chironomidae (Diptera) were well represented and dominant in 11 of the 20 water bodies surveyed. Most rare and restricted species were gastropods (Mollusca), one such species, Mutela cf. dibia, being endemic to the catchment. The overall abundance was maximal (97) at Okomu River in the lowland forest and minimal (5) at Avielle River in derived savanna, respectively. The human impact on macro-invertebrate biodiversity is documented, including changes in benthic fauna distribution patterns.",

In this study we investigated the patterns of genetic diversity in T. tangitanus and T. pater across North Africa. We analysed 12s rRNA and 16s r RNA mtDNA fragments of 26 new samples plus 19 sequences from previous studies, using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Our results confirm the two North African species as well-defined entities. Within T. tangitanus from Morocco, three genetically divergent lineages with geographic congruence were uncovered; one in the north, another widely spread across Central Morocco and one in the High Atlas and farther south. A high level of divergence among the Moroccan lineages suggests the split occurred just after the divergence between T. tangitanus and T. pater. Similar patterns have been found in other species, although more studies are needed to understand the biogeographical events shaping the complex diversity in this region.",

For fluorochrome marking, specimens of both species were injected with 60 mg/kg fish mass oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) and released into large earthen ponds under ambient conditions adjacent to Lake Gariep. Twenty-three L. aeneus and one L. capensis were recaptured 10–14 months later.

The frequency distribution of opaque margins over time was fitted using a binomial periodic regression. The estimated cycle length was not significantly different from a hypothesized 12 months for both species. The number of growth zones distal to the OTC mark was consistent with findings from the edge analysis, providing evidence that growth zones in astericus otoliths of both species can be interpreted as annuli.",

Both cytochrome b and D-loop sequences show C. leucogaster to be nested within C. pumilus sensu lato, with Malagasy C. pumilus forming a sister group to African C. pumilus and Malagasy C. leucogaster. Four distinct D-loop clades are found in southern African populations, all of which occur sympatrically in the greater Durban area of KwaZulu-Natal Province, whilst two of the Durban clades also characterize 1) northern KwaZulu-Natal and low-lying (<600 m) areas of Swaziland, and 2) ‘inland’ populations comprising the Kruger National Park and higher-lying (>600 m) areas of Swaziland. Clades from low-lying areas show evidence of historical demographic expansion around 3300–13 000 years ago (KwaZulu-Natal coastal clade, Clade A1) to 14 700–60 000 years ago (Durban clade, – Clade B1), whilst the inland clade (Clade B2a) was demographically more stable. The origin of these clades can be explained by sea level and vegetation changes hypothesized to follow the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) after 18 000 years ago. Sympatric clades are shown to differ significantly in the proportional width of the braincase, and ongoing work will test evidence for acoustic and other morphological differences between them.",

    "abstract": "African sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus, is a successful aquatic invader as it has a eurytopic physiology, is highly fecund, grows quickly and has an omnivorous diet. Despite possible threats that include predation of and competition with indigenous species, habitat degradation, and the spread of diseases and parasites, there is a lack of knowledge regarding its ecology and population dynamics within invaded systems. This study presents a mark—recapture experiment to investigate its population structure, natural mortality rate, population size and density within a population inhabiting a small, 76 ha invaded water supply reservoir in the temperate Eastern Cape region, South Africa. The adult population was found to be old ( = 120 ± 29 years) and male-dominated (1.76♂:1♀ for fish < 100 cm TL and 3.77♂: 1♀ for fish > 100 cm TL) with its maximum age estimated at one year less than the age of the reservoir. Adult abundance and density (in terms of numbers and biomass) was relatively low at 1655 fish (CV = 18%), 94.32 kg/ha (CV = 18%) and 21.78 fish/ha (CV = 16%), respectively. The estimated mean natural mortality rate was high at 0.80/year (CV = 82%). The skewed length- and age-structure suggests that the adult population is dominated by the fish that were either the initial colonizers during the reservoir filling phase or were the first internally reproduced recruits. The predominance of old, large fish in the population is also probably suppressing recruitment of younger fish. Despite the population being small, the fish are mobile and feed aggressively. Manual removal using baited longlines could be a feasible removal method.",

In this study we investigated the impact of fire on home range, habitat use and activity patterns of the short-snouted elephant shrew (Elephantulus brachyrhynchus) by radio-tracking individuals before and after a fire event. All animals survived the passage of fire in termite mound refugia. Before the fire, grassland was used more than thickets, but habitat utilization shifted to thickets after fire had removed the grass cover. Thickets were an important refuge both pre- and post-fire, but the proportion of thicket within the home range was greater post-fire. We conclude that fire-induced habitat modification resulted in a restriction of E. brachyrhynchus movements to patches of unburned vegetation. This may be a behavioural response to an increase in predation pressure associated with a reduction in cover, rather than a lack of food. This study highlights the importance of considering the landscape mosaic in fire management and allowing sufficient island patches to remain post-fire ensures the persistence of the small mammal fauna.",

The influences of organic and conventional treatments were compared in two vineyard blocks, one previously organically and the other conventionally managed. In each block, experimental plots received either full chemical weed control or 'organic' treatment, as recommended by the Organic Standards of the British Soil Association. Pest and disease control practices followed in the conventionally treated vineyard block included the use of various pesticides. The bait-lamina test was used to assess feeding activity of soil organisms. The feeding activity in the previously organically managed block, subsequently receiving conventional surface chemical treatment, decreased over time as the soil moisture content decreased. A comparison of feeding activity and moisture content on the previously organically managed block after both types of treatments, indicated that the activity was substantially higher in the organically treated plots compared to the conventionally treated ones, while the soil moisture contents were very similar. This indicated that the organic treatment favoured soil biological activity directly or indirectly. The treatment contributed to the preservation of more favourable moisture conditions for soil biological activity. A microcosm study to determine feeding activity of fauna in soil from both vineyard blocks, each subjected to both a conventional and organic treatment under controlled conditions in the laboratory, showed a statistically significantly (P < 0.05) higher feeding activity in the soil that was organically treated and provided further indications that organic management practices, as used here, may result in higher soil faunal feeding activity over the short term compared to conventional practices.",

Nevertheless, some authors attribute tail and ear deformities in up to 7.1% of some populations to predation attempts. In August 2008 we observed a mother with dependent c. 8-month-old female black rhinoceros calf in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. The calf had a recently amputated tail, wounds to the anogenital region, right posterior flank and right side of the neck resembling a lion attack. Thirteen days later and on three subsequent occasions, the mother was sighted alone, suggesting that the calf had succumbed to its injuries. This incident provides evidence to suggest a link between attempted lion predation and tail amputation in black rhinoceros. Significantly, it implies that amputated tails and ears throughout Africa may represent failed depredation attempts and that calf predation may be more prevalent than previously appreciated. Predation is seldom considered in the management of black rhinoceros but should be when attributing cause to poor population performance of this critically endangered species.",

The seasonal infection pattern was inconsistent with the findings of past studies, which showed that prevalence usually peaks during the cooler months of the year.

The zones within the littoral zone comprised a band of Zostera capensis (Setchell) exposed at spring low tide and comprising Zone I; a band of mud or sand, lacking vegetation, corresponded to Zone II; stands of Spartina maritima (Curtis) formed Zone III and a belt of Sarcocornia perennis (Miller) constituted Zone IV. Total macrofauna abundance and biomass during the study ranged from 16–816 ind/m2 and from 0.032–390.76 mg wwt/m2 and demonstrated no significant horizontal or vertical patterns (P > 0.05 in both cases). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) indicated that there were no significant spatial patterns in the macrofaunal community structure within the four zones which could be related to the predominance of euryhaline species, including Marphysa sanguinea (estuarine wonder worm), Arcuatula capensis (estuarine mussel), Macoma litoralis (littoral tellin) and Nassarius kraussianus (tick shell) throughout the estuary. The absence of any distinct spatial patterns in the community structure of the macrofauna appears to be related to the virtual absence of any horizontal patterns in selected physico-chemical variables and availability of submerged macrophytes along the length of the estuary. Comparisons with historical data indicate that while there have been no significant changes in the estimates of the total macrofauna abundance and biomass within the estuary over the past three decades, abundances of selected species have declined by as much as 80%. The decline in the abundances of these species appears to reflect the predominance of hypersaline conditions within the upper reaches of the estuary and intense fishing activities in the lower reaches of the system.Key words: long-term changesmacrobenthospermanently open estuarysouthern AfricaUpogebia africana",

These results suggest an enzootic plague activity in this region in Namibia. It is concluded that zoonotic agents, that are infectious to humans, are prevalent in rodents and shrews in the three countries, and that local communities should apply rodent control measures to reduce the risk of human infections.",

Dietary differences were detected between the two size groups. Amphipod sp. (% index of relative importance (IRI) = 69.2) and dipterans (Insecta) (%IRI = 21.9) dominated gut contents of small bass while larger bass preyed mostly on odonates (Insecta) (%IRI = 16.3) and the brachyuran Potamonautes sidneyi (%IRI = 80.0). Fish prey was of low importance during this study but comparisons with previous work on the lower Kowie River showed that when the river is flowing, young marine fish recruiting into the freshwater from the estuary become important prey items. These data suggest that in the lower Kowie River bass utilize invertebrate prey at low fish prey abundance and opportunistically feed on migrant fish when these are available.",

This station which received domestic sewage from the neighbouring cities was characterized by the highest conductivity and pH and the lowest values of dissolved oxygen.

Also, snail dynamics showed a seasonal pattern, with peak population densities and recruitment of young generations during rainy periods. This study highlighted the impacts of sewage on snail diversity and distribution in the Banco River.

The scarcity of this information makes it difficult to plan and budget for telemetry projects effectively. In this paper we present relevant information from a study involving a total of 47 individual ducks of two Afrotropical anatid species, Egyptian Goose, Alopochen aegyptiaca, and red-billed teal, Anas erythrorhyncha, using solarpowered GPS satellite transmitters of two different sizes (30 g and 22 g, respectively) at three very different southern African sites (Strandfontein wastewater treatment works in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, Barberspan Nature Reserve in the North West Province of South Africa, and Lake Manyame in north-central Zimbabwe). We present a full description of harness design and attachment and a survivorship analysis of the transmitters. Our results suggest that the 30 g units last longer than the 22 g units, with approximately 60% and 30%, respectively, of these PTTs (position tracking terminals) lasting longer than a year; 45% and 5%, respectively, lasting longer than two years; and 20% and 0%, respectively, lasting longer than three years. We strongly encourage the publication of comparable data sets so that future studies that rely on telemetry data can be planned with a realistic set of assumptions and limitations in mind.Key words: telemetryAnatidaesurvivorshipPTTtrackingsouthern Africa",

We examined jumping by the Cape dwarf gecko (Lygodactylus capensis) in terms of individuals' varying states of tail autotomy and regeneration. Although longer jumps were less likely to be successful (i.e. the animal would not successfully grip the surface and fell to the ground), there was no difference in the distance over which animals with full and partial tails would attempt to jump. Both recently autotomized individuals and individuals with intact tails successfully jumped up to nine times their body length (snout—vent length). The jumping ability of L. capensis was therefore clearly not negatively impaired by tail loss, presumably because the geckos are using their hind legs to propel their jump. Their tails may, however, be important to control their landing as well as their locomotion on vertical surfaces. The high observed frequency of tail loss, coupled with rapid and complete regeneration (including the scansorial tail tip), suggests that caudal autotomy is an important survival tactic in this species.",

The mean times lions were inactive was similar between the three prides except when the ranch lions were severely disturbed and became more nocturnal and inactive. The reserve lions ate their kills on open plains and returned to them often but the ranch lions did so only inside bushes and abandoned unfinished kills during a drought in 2005. The reserve lions spent most of their time on open plains while the ranch lions did so in bushes and woodlands. Activity budgets were similar between the prides regardless of land use. Adult lions altered not so much the type but the spatial location and timing of their behaviour on the pastoral ranches relative to the reserve.We discuss the implications of these findings for lion conservation on pastoral lands.Key words: behaviourlionspastoralismprotectionspace use",

Concentrations of Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn were determined in soil, as well as in representatives of some trophic levels in the terrestrial food webs in two Egyptian agroecosystems; El-Manzala (a rural area located in the northeast of the River Nile Delta) and El-Tebbin (an industrial area located in South Cairo). Representatives of trophic levels included arthropods, amphibians, reptiles, birds and small mammals. Metal concentrations were determined in the leaves of wild plants, bodies of arthropods and livers of vertebrates. Levels of metals in the soil, plants and most animal species were higher in El-Tebbin than El-Manzala. Minimal concentrations of metals were detected more often in plants and in the cattle egret, whereas maximum values were common in the soil, amphibians and a mantid. Accumulation of metals was more frequent in arthropods and other taxa at lower trophic levels of food webs, suggesting that the transfer of metals along the vertebrate food web may be of relatively minor importance. However, of all the metals examined, only Pb was bioaccumulated to any appreciable extent in some of the higher trophic levels. A significant increase in liver mass and relative liver mass of the Norway rat from the polluted site was observed.Keywords: environmental problemsliverplantsoiltrace elementswild animals",

Fishes were collected fortnightly over six months using two modified seine nets. Although the surf composition included typical species for this habitat type, Gobiidae, Gobiesocidae and Haemulidae dominated the larval assemblage, which suggested that the nearby rocky structure and estuaries have an influence on the assemblage. Three species, Liza richardsonii (Mugilidae), Pomadasys olivaceus (Haemulidae) and Diplodus capensis (Sparidae), showed evidence of growth and recruitment into the surf-zone from the late larval stage.

    "abstract": "AbstractSpatial and temporal patterns of disturbance and the subsequent heterogeneity are critical in maintaining biodiversity within grassland ecosystems. Grassland birds have evolved within this ‘shifting mosaic’ to become reliant on specific habitat characteristics maintained under varying levels of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Unfortunately, grasslands in South Africa have been extensively transformed and remain poorly conserved, threatening grassland avifauna. Mistbelt grassland is a threatened vegetation type endemic to the province of KwaZulu-Natal, of which only 0.3% is formally protected. This study investigated seasonal and patch type heterogeneity in a Mistbelt grassland avian community by determining avian community structure and composition in four patch types, i.e. i) untransformed open grassland, ii) burnt grassland, iii) bramble-invaded and, iv) bramble-cleared grassland, during winter and summer. Avian assemblages were significantly different between the different patch types for each season. The bramble patch type negatively affected grassland bird species diversity. Bramble-cleared grassland and untransformed grassland had similar vegetation structure and avian communities in the summer, suggesting that the grassland bird community benefitted soon after the clearing of invasive vegetation. This study provides further evidence that bird diversity is enhanced in structurally heterogeneous grassland landscapes. Furthermore, the protection and appropriate management of privately owned Mistbelt grassland, conserved in the form of rangeland, is an important refuge for threatened and endemic avifauna, such as the globally-threatened blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) and wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus).Key words: grassland birdsbird diversitydisturbancegrassland managementheterogeneityinvasive vegetation",

For geographical reasons, among the congeneric species, V. jubae could be considered as the most closely related to V. beso, the type species of the genus, but judging from the available data this genus seems to be monotypic, while jubae should be classified as a member of Labeobarbus.

Its production started with the advent of fleshy fruits, which suggests a long-term association between ethanol and frugivores. Consequently, one suggestion is that because frugivores could use its odour to locate fruiting plants, they should show a preference for fruit with high ethanol concentrations. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by determining whether frugivorous birds show a preference for fruit laden with alcohol at levels equivalent to those of overripe fruits. Three species of frugivorous bird species were used for this study: the Cape White-eye (Zosterops virens), Speckled Mousebird (Colius striatus) and Red-winged Starling (Onychognathus morio). Birds were provided with two artificial fruit diets in pairwise choice tests: an experimental diet containing 1% ethanol and a control diet with no ethanol. For all species, no significant differences were observed in the amount of artificial fruit consumed between the food types. Given that the concentration of ethanol used in the study is assumed to represent that of overripe fruit, these results, in conjunction with previous studies, suggest that birds do not show a preference for fruits with high ethanol concentrations.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the distribution, relative abundance, population growth and biology of the alien invasive fish Gambusia affinis in the Wilderness Lakes System, a coastal lake system in the warm-temperate region of South Africa. Fish were collected throughout the system during four seasonal sampling trips in spring (October 2010), summer (February 2011), autumn (May 2011) and winter (July 2011). Gambusia affinis were widespread and abundant in all habitats from the freshwater reaches of the inflowing Touw River to the more saline lakes and estuary. Sex ratio was generally female dominated and mean length at maturity was 14.7 mm standard length (SL) for males and 20.3 mm SL for females. Reproduction was strongly seasonal with reproductively active fish sampled in spring and summer but not in autumn and winter. Relative abundance also varied seasonally, with populations following typical 'boom and bust' population dynamics. By winter, the population in all habitats was lower with mortality rates as high as 85%. The stronghold of the population appears to be in the channels between the lakes, where relative abundance was more consistent and winter mortality rates were lower. The survivors, which are primarily females, then reconstitute the population in the spring and summer months.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSystematists have not often made use of avian vocalizations to assess the taxonomic rank of birds, or to infer their phylogenetic relationships. The likely reasons for this stem from the perceived inability to distinguish genetic and ecological components of variation in vocalizations, the difficulty in detecting homology across taxa, as well as the diverse selection pressures acting on vocal characters which may make such characters particularly prone to convergent evolution. In this study, we scored and analysed DNA and vocal characters of two delineated assemblages of gamebirds, francolins and spurfowls. Our phylogenetic results suggest that short strophes evolved from longer strophes among taxa within the genera Scleroptila and Peliperdix. More generally, our results corroborate the francolin–spurfowl dichotomy, with francolin calls generally being long and tonal, containing a series of discrete elements that have detectable harmonics. In contrast, most spurfowls render short, atonal calls with elements that generally have no harmonics, although they may contain discrete elements. Phylogenetically, Ortygornis sephaena is placed with 'true' francolins and its closest relatives are the two phylogenetically enigmatic Asian francolins, the grey francolin, Ortygornis pondicerianus, and swamp francolin, O. gularis.Key words: FrancolinusfrancolinsspurfowlsvocalizationtaxonomyphylogenyGalliformes",

The aim of this study was to compare the current surf-zone fish assemblage at King's Beach, South Africa, to a similar study conducted three decades ago, before the collapse of many exploited shore fishes in the region. Beach seine nets (mesh sizes of 10 and 50 mm) were used to target juvenile and adult fishes bimonthly from February to August 2011 over the high tide around sunset. A total of 14 species were recorded in both the 30 m and 100 m seine nets. The catch in these seine nets was dominated by Pomadasys olivaceus and Liza richardsonii, and this was significantly different to three decades ago, when P. olivaceus, Sarpa salpa and Diplodus capensis dominated the catch. Important linefish species belonging to the Sparidae and Sciaenidae families were significantly smaller and less abundant in this study. Two sparids, S. salpa and Lithognathus mormyrus, which made a large contribution to the surf-zone catch three decades ago were absent during this study. Reasons for the significant shifts in the surf-zone fish community, including overexploitation of the linefish and potential habitat modification, are discussed.Key words: surf-zoneichthyofaunacommunity shiftsoverfishinglinefish",

    "abstract": "Many bird species take part in a dawn chorus, the phenomenon in which the community of songbirds in a particular habitat, show a peak of vocal activity around dawn. Understanding the species-specific extrinsic factors affecting this intensive singing activity is important for us to predict and understand activity patterns of local species for long-term monitoring purposes. This study investigated the effects of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall and moon phase on vocal activity during the dawn chorus in a suite of related songbirds, the African Yellow Warbler (Iduna natalensis Smith A, 1847), Little Rush Warbler (Bradypterus baboecala Vieillot, 1817) and Lesser Swamp Warbler (Acrocephalus gracilirostris Hartlaub, 1864), in a high-elevation wetland in Golden Gate Highlands National Park, South Africa. We deployed acoustic recorders in a rolling-grid layout in the ∼6 km-long wetland from August 2019 to February 2020, recording daily acoustic data from 04:00 to 07:00 Central African Time. Temperature significantly affected the dawn chorus onset of all three species: on cooler days, the dawn chorus started later compared to days with warm temperatures. On days with high relative humidity, the dawn chorus onset of two of the three focal species shifted in opposite directions: one species began singing earlier, while another delayed its onset. Wind speed and rainfall had varied effects on the timing of the dawn chorus across species. Our results demonstrate that meteorological conditions influence the dawn singing of these three birds differently in a shared habitat.",

Owing to limited distribution and extensive habitat destruction, it may be regarded as an endangered species. C. giganteus individuals fed during eight months of the year. The mass of food in the stomachs and remains in the hind guts indicated that a high degree of foraging success occurred during the warm spring and summer months in association with seasonal variation in resource abun–dance. Analysis of the contents of 480 stomachs revealed that the diet of C. giganteus in the study area consisted almost exclusively of arthropods, with six of the major taxa (Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera) accounting for 80 % of the total number and 90 % of the gravimetric contribution of ingested food by the different age and sex groups. Coleoptera dominated as prey category throughout the seasons. The consistency of the main food categories in spring, summer and autumn suggest that prey selection took place, and that C. giganteus is opportunistic only in the sense of taking other prey taxa when they are present in greater abundance. All the major prey types in the diet showed negative relationships between relative abundance and selectivity, indicating that C. giganteus pre–ferred a prey type more when it was relatively less abundant in the environment. Measurement of dietary overlap for prey taxa indicated a high degree of dietary similarity for all age and sex classes.",

Four seed species were used during trials: white millet (Panicum miliaceum), red manna (P. maximum), canary seed (Phalaris canariensis) and Japanese millet (Echinochloa frumentacea). Diamond doves handled all seed species significantly faster than sparrows and lovebirds, as they swallow seeds whole. Java sparrows and Fischer's lovebirds husked seeds prior to ingestion; lovebirds took significantly longer than Java sparrows in handling all seed species. Seed characteristics, size and shape affected handling time with reference to bill structure. Diamond doves took significantly longer to handle elongate seeds while Java sparrows handled round seeds slowly and Fischer's lovebirds required similar handling times for all seed species. Java sparrows and Fischer's lovebirds selected greater proportions of the same seed species, suggesting that birds which husk seeds prefer similar seed species. Seeds were not selected according to nutritional intake rate. Japanese millet was the preferred seed species of Fischer's lovebirds and Java sparrows, but provided few calories and little protein per unit time. Seed selection was influenced by bill structure, as seeds were selected, amongst others, according to handling time, and handling time was dependent on bill structure.",

We found that survival was age-but not sex-related and compared our estimates to similar estimates from a previous study on the same population while in a state of decline. This was done to determine whether changes in juvenile survival were instrumental in terminating the population decline at Marion Island. On average, the probability of survival was 59.5 %, 81.4 % and 78.1 % for the first, second and third year respectively. These estimates were remarkably similar to those previously calculated for the population while in a state of decline, and we dismiss juvenile survival as a major population regulating component in southern elephant seals at Marion Island.",

The polygynous group, which was studied in the Kalahari Desert, consisted of a male, two lactating females and a litter of five pups. New aspects of parental care that were observed include the bringing of food items to pups at the den. Although bat-eared foxes in this area seldom capture lizards for their own consumption, lizards were the main food item carried to the den. It is suggested that bat-eared foxes specifically seek out lizards because they are more easily transportable than their normal insect prey. Despite this behavioural adaptation, there is relatively little opportunity for the male to contribute to the nutrition of the pups when compared to the contribution made by the males of large carnivorous canids, which routinely bring large volumes of meat to the den. Instead, young bat-eared foxes depend heavily on milk, so the females have to forage for extended periods to replenish their milk supplies. This study shows that the major duties of males are guarding and grooming the pups while the females are foraging. In this social context there are relatively few disadvantages in sharing a father between two litters and these disadvantages are occasionally outweighed by the benefits of communal care, amongst which are cooperative attacks on predators and alternate nursing.",

Relative bone thickness was found to be high in C. cataphractus and low in P. capensis. Both species displayed a high incidence of double lines of arrested growth. Endosteal resorption and deposition were extensive in C. cataphractus, occurring around the entire medullary cavity margin, and, except in the smallest juveniles, embryonic bone and the birthline had been completely resorbed. In P. capensis, on the other hand, endosteal resorption and deposition were limited and highly localized. Remnants of embryonic bone and a birthline were present in juveniles of varying size, as well as in several adults. These remnants always occurred in the dorsal half of the femoral midshaft and coincided with endosteal deposits, when present. In both species, maximum endosteal deposition and minimum periosteal deposition characterized the dorsal half of the femoral midshaft, while the ventral half was characterized by maximum periosteal deposition and most intensive endosteal resorption. In C. cataphractus, the correlation between medullary cavity area and total bone area differed significantly between the sexes, but not so in P. capensis.

A cladistic analysis suggested the presence of three clades: 1) A. bocagei, A. thomasi, A. silindensis, A. kaiseri, and A. nyikae;2) A. chrysophilus, A. ineptus, and A. hindei;3) A. granti, A. namaquensis, and A. stannarius. These phylogenetic groupings are largely inconsistent with previously postulated supraspecific relationships for the genus. Nonetheless, relationships within each clade broadly correspond with some previously suggested evolutionary hypotheses among some members of the genus, the only notable exception being a close affinity between two southern African taxa (A. namaquensis and A. granti) and the geographically disjunct West African endemic, A. stannarius. A phylogram derived from an analysis of anagenetic divergence among taxa supported the widely-held view of a close affinity between A. namaquensis and A. granti that has traditionally led to their inclusion in the subgenus Micaelamys. These results are relatively concordant with recent molecular studies based on microcomplement fixation of albumin, mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and 16S rRNA data, which collectively suggest that the genus Aethomys is paraphyletic. Possible paraphyly is also reflected by a relatively low bootstrap value at the node uniting all ingroup taxa in this study, as well as previous studies on dental morphology, modes of karyotypic change, and gross sperm and bacular morphology, and strongly supports the taxo-nomic elevation of the currently recognized subgenera Micaelamys and Aethomys to full generic rank. Despite the broad correspondence between the morphological and molecular data, homoplasy and low bootstrap support in the present investigation point to the need for a careful consideration of the power and choice of morphological characters in future studies on this and related groups of murine rodents.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLion prey selection was studied on the Greater Makalali Conservancy (140 km2), Limpopo Province, South Africa, in order to assist with management strategies. Monitoring was carried out between February 1998 and December 2001. Lion killed 15 species, with warthog, blue wildebeest, Burchell's zebra, kudu and waterbuck constituting approximately 75% of their diet. Between 2.2% and 3.1% of the available prey biomass was killed yearly, while each female equivalent unit (FEQ) killed between 3 kg and 3.2 kg daily. Lion predation was greater for warthog, wildebeest and waterbuck and less for impala than expected. When male lion were present, a greater number of warthog and giraffe were killed, while number of females had a significant effect on medium sized prey species and total prey species killed. Significantly more warthog, wildebeest and kudu were killed in winter than summer. More prey than expected was killed in open habitats and less than expected in thickets. Managers of small, enclosed reserves need to constantly monitor prey populations, especially medium sized prey and may be able to reduce predation on large prey species by manipulating male lion numbers. Reserves also need to contain adequate open habitats for lion to make use of these areas for hunting.Key words: Panthera leoPredationManagement strategiesBiomassFemale equivalent unit",

The original description was based on five shrunken, unflattened specimens. Initially O. hippopotami was not widely accepted as a valid species and the existence of this parasite was only confirmed four decades later. New specimens of O. hippopotami were collected during a hippopotamus culling operation in the KwaZulu Natal Province of South Africa. Examination of these specimens confirmed most of Stunkard's description and revealed the presence of a bucco oesophageal canal, a uterine evagination, an operculated egg, the retention of marginal hooklets in the mature parasite and the ability to double its length and feed over a large area around its position of attachment. This study also reveals striking similarities with Concinnocotyla, the polystome of the Australian lungfish, and chelonian polystomes. Morphological parameters of the species are redefined. A maximum of 24 parasites was found on a single eye and a maximum of 37 on an individual host specimen. Prevalence was found to be 75% for mature parasites, 85% for immature specimens and 90% for the total sample.",

We aimed to establish which species survive fire and the dynamics of the post-fire recolonization process, and thereby contribute to establishing the ideal area of a prescribed burn for invertebrate conservation. Four transects were sampled two and 12 weeks after burning. Along each transect one unburnt control and four burnt sites were quantitatively sampled. Richness, abundance and diversity were calculated for each site and canonical correspondence analysis was applied to transect and morphospecies counts to determine the impact of distance from the edge of the burn on community structure. Distance from burn edge affected invertebrate richness and abundance, especially for flying insects. Burning appeared to minimally impact on wingless invertebrates, suggesting they tolerated fire by finding refuge. Invertebrate community structure changed with increasing distance from burn edge two weeks, but not 12 weeks post-burn. A distance of 280 m from burn edge appears to allow sufficient recolonization to maintain invertebrate diversity. Taxa found in the unburnt control and site closest to the edge in burnt grassland may be fire sensitive and require further study.",

It is different to that of the Hawaiian monk seal and elephant seals, as Mediterranean monk seals partly moult in the water. The intermoult period was close to one year except in females nursing a pup. Such females have longer intermoult periods and can even moult whilst still lactating. In males, the process of developing the mature pelage pattern of bulls is gradual.

Mean isopod abundances and biomasses ranged between 0 and 4791 ind/m2 and 0 and 9.65 mg/dwt/m2 in the West Kleinemonde Estuary and between 0 and 108 ind/m2 and 0 and 0.318 mg/dwt/m2 in the nearby East Kleinemonde Estuary. In the Kasouga Estuary, the values ranged between 0 and 3650 ind/m2 and 0 and 5.105 mg/dwt/m2. Temporal changes in the abundance and biomass of E. hylocoetes within the three systems was primarily linked to mouth phase, with populations crashing when the mouth was open and to a lesser extent, seasonality. In all three estuaries maximum abundance and biomass was recorded in the middle reaches, which could be ascribed to the presence of submerged macrophytes. E. hylocoetes demonstrates strong sexual dimorphism, with males being significantly larger than females (P < 0.05). Sex ratios were skewed in favour of females in all three estuaries. Females were encountered carrying young from an overall length of 2.5 mm throughout the year",

Both species were temperature sensitive, with Q10(14–28) of 1.82 and 2.07, respectively. A significant positive relationship (P =0.03) between salinity and oxygen consumption was determined for D. sargus capensis, but not for C. caffer. The RMR values were significantly higher (P < 0.01) for D. sargus capensis compared to C. caffer at all temperatures and at all salinities, except 5 PSU. This was attributed to the different biologies of the two species, C. caffer being a bottom-dwelling species and D. sargus capensis a mid-water species. It is suggested that the decreased temperature sensitivity and euryhaline characteristics of C. caffer compared to D. sargus capensis, would allow the former to more effectively penetrate the upper intertidal zone.",

An unidentified sample of 18 Biomphalaria specimens from Lake Albert were divided in three morphotypes according to aperture height and coiling rate and subsequently identified through molecular inferences and morphometry. The 18 specimens were identified as follows; six specimens were identified as B. sudanica, seven species as B. stanleyi, four as B. cf. choanomphala and a single specimen as B. pfeifferi. The latter was inferred with strong molecular support only, since it had similar shell morphology to typical B. stanleyi snails, thus it might be an ecophenotypic form of B. pfeifferi adapted to a lacustrine environment. Biomphalaria stanleyi exists in forms that resemble B. choanomphala, and B. choanomphala has further overlap in morphology with B. smithi. However, the results showed some disagreement between molecular and morphometric identification, hence making it difficult to rely on shell morphology alone in identification. Overall the morphometric analysis divided Biomphalaria in two possible ecophenotypes i.e. a lacustrine type with rapidly increasing whorls and relatively high apertures and a non-lacustrine type (including snails inhabiting lake edges) with slowly increasing whorls and low apertures.Key words: BiomphalariaUgandaLake AlbertDNAmorphometry",

Although the identification of species complexes is relatively easy, the distinction within some groups is difficult due to a high variability of the external morphology. Partial mitochondrial (12S and 16S rRNA) sequences (371 and 499 base pairs, respectively) were analysed from 32 specimens of the A. pardalis group from northern Africa including the described species A. busacki, A. maculatus, A. mechriguensis and A. pardalis. Several highly distinct genetic units were resolved, but with little support for relationships between them. These units did not coincide with current taxonomic units, but showed geographic structuring. Although the A. pardalis group displays significant variation, the present taxonomy of the group must be considered unsatisfactory since it is not supported by genetic evidence. For some forms, such as A. mechriguensis there is no support and it is suggested that it should be synonymized with A. maculatus. More data are clearly needed for other forms. Complex microevolutionary patterns due to the recent contraction/ expansion phases of the Sahara Desert probably are related with the phylogenetic patterns observed.",

Catches varied significantly with season and were highest in summer. Estuary-resident species dominated the overall catch (91%). A notable absence of postflexion larvae and early juveniles characterized the artificial channels. This was attributed to the absence of shallow, marginal water habitat, typical of a good estuarine nursery area. The steep walls of the artificial channels reduce refuge areas, increasing predation by larger piscivores.",

Individuals frequently interact with heterospecifics through feeding territoriality. Underwater observations and experiments were conducted to examine interspecific variation in the frequencies of territorial behaviour and its influence on the feeding habits of heterospecifics. Frequencies of chasing and fleeing associated with interspecific territoriality were remarkably different amongst 10 cichlid species. In addition, individual fish that attacked heterospecifics more frequently were attacked less often by them, suggesting that interspecific interactions amongst cichlid species are asymmetric. The experimental removal of territory owners belonging to the most aggressive species resulted in almost fivefold increase in feeding within territories, suggesting that territorial aggression preserves food resources for the territory holder and influences the feeding habits of other species, including those with some dietary dissimilarities. Additional information regarding asymmetric interspecific interactions would improve understanding about how diverse cichlids within trophic groups manage to coexist.",

    "abstract": "Photo-identification surveys over three years along 390 km of coastline north of Cape Town, revealed that Heaviside's dolphin distribution was consistent between years and higher in areas more exposed to swells and with greater long-term availability of small hake Merluccius capensis (their principal prey). Dusky dolphin sighting rates varied considerably between years, but were generally higher in areas with lower hake availability and sandier shores (mostly straighter coastline). Large groups of 50–200 dusky dolphins were only seen in St Helena Bay the site of a wind-driven upwelling zone. Heaviside's dolphins were found in shallower, cooler water than dusky dolphins and were more likely to be seen during brighter phases of the moon (when nocturnal light conditions may influence the vertical migration patterns of prey) and in areas of high hake abundance, Near-shore fishing activity was higher in the northern half of the study area and clustered around harbours. Set netting occurred only at Yzerfontein and St Helena Bay, but due to changes in the industry is currently thought to be a low threat to the population. Interactions between Heaviside's and dusky dolphins were usually neutral and sympatry appears to be mediated by differences in overall range and the type and size of prey species taken.",

In total, 20 455 fishes were collected representing 21 families and 40 taxa, of which 13 900 fishes were from mid-channel sites (15 families and 21 taxa). Seine net hauls along the estuary margins produced 6550 fishes representing 18 families and 33 taxa. Gobiidae was the dominant fish family in the mid-channel waters followed by the Clupeidae whereas the opposite was found in marginal waters. Estuary-resident larvae were the dominant group in the estuary complex. The catches typically reflected a more warm-temperate community, although subtropical-associated species were present. Fish density in mid-channel waters was higher in the Ngqusi arm than that of the Nxaxo arm, whereas along the marginal waters, CPUE was higher in the latter. Fish densities in mid-channel waters and CPUE along the margins were typically higher in summer.",

To compare harem-forming species (type I) with those that do not establish permanent social units (type II), we conducted a comparative analysis of stallion long-range calls in seven species/breeds of equids: two breeds of domestic horses (archaic and modern breeds) and five wild species: Przewalski's horse, kiang, Somalian ass, Grevy's zebra, Grant's zebra). Acoustic features allowed assigning calls of stallions with 92% average classification success to the correct species. The duration of the call clearly separated horses (type I) from type II species: kiang, Somalian ass and Grevy's zebra. Accordingly to its harem social system (type I), the pattern of long-range call in Grant's zebra deviates from that of its relatives in the direction of horses. Frequency of the first dominant band that was associated with body size separated modern horses from the archaic breed and Przewalski's horse. Playback experiments confirmed that equids, especially the type II species, respond strongly to conspecific calls but also to calls of other equids.Key words: Equusequidscallsacoustic communicationsocial system",

    "abstract": "The taxonomy of the shrews (family Soricidae) is primarily underpinned by the analysis of morphology characters. These morphological characters are, however, often plesiomorphic and difficult to interpret in an evolutionarily meaningful way. Recent molecular studies have provided some clarity at lower-taxonomic levels, but studies giving resolution to deeper levels of the soricid phylogeny are lacking. By constructing the most taxonomically inclusive molecular phylogeny for this cosmopolitan family, this study aims to test the utility of the routinely used mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to resolve the higher-level relationships within the Soricidae. Given the life history characteristics of shrews (high metabolic rate in Soricinae, small body size, fast generation time and generally short life span), the metabolic theory predicts accelerated nucleotide turnover in this family. By examining the molecular evolution of the cytochrome b molecule, this study identifies both lineage- and codon-specific mutational rate differences. We suggest that codon-specific mutational rate patterns are best explained by unique selective regimes operating on the different codon positions, while lineage-specific rate variation among genera belonging to Soricidae may reflect differences in the mode and speed of speciation events which generated species.",

Six represented Zambezian species, two Marine origin, and all of the Cape and Karroid species are endemic to South Africa. Only three threatened species naturally occur within national parks (Serranochromis meridianus, Barbus andrewi, Pseudobarbus afer ) all of which are classified as Endangered. Two extralimital IUCN threatened species (Chetia brevis and Oreochromis macrochir ) have been introduced. At least three of the five lineages of Galaxias zebratus and two of the four lineages of Pseudobarbus afer occur within national parks in the Cape region. Many fish populations within national parks remain threatened, particularly by hydraulic alterations, impoundment, and predation by alien fishes. There are few aquatic systems within national parks where one or more of these threats are not prominent, and these collectively support only half of the freshwater fish species occurring in all national parks. Proposed management actions include determination and implementation of Environmental Flow Reserves in stressed systems, management of existing alien fish populations and prevention of new establishments, and regular assessments of fish communities.Key words: freshwater fishesnational parkbiodiversityriversaliensendemismhydrologyimpoundment",

Seasonal activity patterns of S. pardalis were investigated as a function of rainfall, sex, time of day, temperature and time after sunrise on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa. We predicted that because of seasonal rainfall, and subsequent increase in the food available, activity patterns of leopard tortoises would vary greatly among seasons, but that the primary constraint on activity levels within a season would be ambient temperature. Type of activity, time of day that the activity was performed, and the frequency that each activity was performed, differed among seasons. There was no overall seasonal difference in the level of activity with sex, but in certain seasons and with regard to specific activities, there were significant differences between the sexes. Diel activity was primarily bimodal in summer and autumn, and unimodal in winter and spring, with nonthermoregulatory activities being performed primarily in the afternoon. There was a positive correlation between number of tortoises caught and rainfall per season, but activity levels and number of tortoises walking and feeding was not correlated with seasonal rainfall. Leopard tortoise activity behaviours responded to ambient temperature, but results indicate that activity is also initiated by the time since sunrise.",

The closest correlations between these five parameters can be seen between the surface and the volume of the nests. The regressions between these two parameters are identical for both species; the addition of a first cap decreases the volume/surface ratio but a second or third cap does not alter this ratio further. Three apparent age classes have been attributed to the nests based on their external appearance: recent, eroded, and dilapidated. The great density (1297 nests/ha) and abundance of the nests that are dilapidated but still occupied by a declining population clearly suggests that the pressure from predation is weak.

This genus dominated the small mammal communities before and after the burn, and never disappeared from the burnt patches.

Movement from the burnt areas was observed, which may have had a significant impact on the numbers of rodents caught both inside the enclosure and in the more natural areas outside.

Generalist tick species represented by Amblyomma hebraeum, Hyalomma truncatum and H. rufipes all occur temporarily on highly mobile ungulate hosts and showed high levels of haplotypic genetic diversity and high levels of dispersal with an average intraspecific global Fst (population differentiation index) value of 0.27 (±0.13). Generalist parasites, such as fleas, Listropsylla agrippinae and Chiastopsylla rossi, and one mite species, Laelaps muricola, that are all semi-permanent on the host and restricted to less mobile hosts species, showed a similar high level of genetic diversity, but an intermediate average Fst value of 0.67 (±0.11). Highly specialised semi-permanent parasites, such as the mite L. giganteus and the permanent lice Polyplax praomydis, Hoplopleura patersoni and P. arvicanthis recorded the lowest level of genetic diversity and a low level of gene flow among geographic sampling localities with an average Fst value of 0.95 (±0.05).

We found that giraffe eye volume increases from 33 cm3 at birth to approximately 65 cm3 in adults. The focal (axial) length increases from c. 40 to 48 mm in adults and retina surface area from c. 3000 mm2 at birth to 4320 mm2 in adults. The orbital axis angle at birth is c. 73° and the horizontal visual field mainly monocular and panoramic. With age the axis angle becomes more acute to c. 50° in adults and the visual field more binocular, changes that occur concurrently with increasing neck length. These results show that the giraffe eye and retinal surface area are larger than in all other ungulates, and their visual fields more binocular, attributes which are consistent with the idea that they have excellent vision.Key words: giraffeeye sizeorbit orientationvisual acuity",

    "abstract": "Baits or lures are commonly used for surveying small mammal communities, not only because they attract large numbers of these animals, but also because they provide sustenance for trapped individuals. In this study we used Sherman live traps with five bait treatments to sample small mammal populations at three high-altitude sites (>1700 m) in the Sneeuberg Mountain Complex of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.We investigated the influence of bait treatment on three parameters commonly recorded in small mammal surveys. In addition, we investigated how different bait treatments vary in measuring species richness using the Chao 2 species richness estimator together with rarefaction curves. Overall, 12 small mammal species were sampled. A combination of birdseed and banana captured the highest number of species (11) but the most successful bait overall was peanut butter and oats (greatest number of captures, recaptures, number of individuals and highest Shannon diversity). The Chao 2 richness estimator indicated that four of the five bait treatments reached their sampling capacity. Rarefaction curves indicated that all bait treatments are similar with regard to species accumulation. This could possibly be explained by odours left behind in traps as even un-baited traps (i.e. controls) captured seven different small mammal species. We conclude that the most suitable bait for surveying small mammals at high altitude in South Africa is peanut butter and oats. However, using peanut butter and oats in combination with other bait treatments will improve estimates of diversity when surveying small mammal communities.",

A total of three Dactylogyrus species were found. Dactylogyrus spinicirrus was collected from all hosts, whereas Dactylogyrus afrolongicornis alberti and Dactylogyrus afrolongicornis afrolongicornis were collected from B. trimaculatus. Although D. spinicirrus was the most prevalent parasite on all three hosts, its mean intensity per host was found to be less than 10 individuals per host. Dactylogyrus afrolongicornis alberti and D. afrolongicornis afrolongicornis were less prevalent on the hosts, occurring in less than 50% of all hosts sampled, with a mean intensity of less than five individuals per host. The study showed that the intensity of D. spinicirrus infestation was influenced by season. Its occurrence displayed seasonal fluctuations with prevalence and mean intensity increasing with an increase in water temperatures. Other predictors of infestation such as fish sex and length did not have a significant influence on the prevalence and intensity of D. spinicirrus. Furthermore, parasite burdens did not have an effect on the condition of the host.",

Despite relatively stable, marine-dominated conditions the abundance of the sandprawn Callichirus kraussi recorded in the lower and middle reaches decreased significantly (p < 0.025), accompanied by an increase in seagrass biomass and the abundance of burrowing bivalves and the surface-grazing gastropod Nassarius kraussianus. No significant changes were noted in the upper reaches, where, unlike the lower and middle reaches, the size distribution and juvenile recruitment of C. kraussi remained relatively constant. The temporal data from the lower reaches showed a high, negative correlation between C. kraussi numbers and (a) seagrass (Zostera (Zosterella) capensis) biomass (r = −0.85), and (b) burrowing bivalve numbers (r = −0.69). These relationships were apparent in comparative samples taken from prawn and seagrass beds, where C. kraussi numbers were significantly lower and burrowing bivalve numbers were higher in a seagrass area than in the adjoining high-density prawn bed. These changes accord with previously demonstrated negative correlations between vegetation of sandbanks and abundance of C. kraussi, and with the demonstrable negative effects of sandprawns on bivalves and N. kraussianus. However, our study is novel in that it indicated that changes in enviromental conditions may shift the balance among these species.",

Five 2-km line transects were established in different vegetation types, and each transect was walked at 1.0 km/h. We also conducted a ‘quick survey’ by walking at c. 2.5 km/h along all transects. A detection function was estimated separately for each species by pooling all the data from the five transects. For Cephalophus silvicultor, all sighting records of the two surveys were used because there was no significant difference in the encounter rates. In total, Philantomba monticola, red duikers (Cephalophus spp.), and C. silvicultor were observed 100, 80, 33 times, respectively. Their individual densities were estimated at 16.43/km2(95% CI: 11.4–23.6), 7.1/km2 (5.5–9.2), and 1.63 km2 (1.0–2.8), respectively. The encounter rate for P. monticola and C. silvicultor did not vary significantly between the transects, while that of red duikers was higher in the primary forest than in the young secondary or gallery forest. The duiker densities in our study area are among the highest in the African rainforest. Our results indicate that quick surveys may be an effective approach to estimate the densities of rare species.",

Culmen and gular stripe lengths were selected as the best discriminators, correctly classifying 65% of birds. Male Cape gannets had significantly longer culmens and gular stripes than females. We thereby provide the first evidence suggesting that the Cape gannet demonstrates some level of dimorphism. Nonetheless, morphometric criteria used to separate sexes holds limited value due to overlap in measurements between sexes.Key words: discriminant function analysisMorus capensisseabirdSouth Africa",

Every month, we randomly sampled 20 infested twigs from different coffee trees on each of three experimental blocks, and dissected them to count different stages of X. compactus per twig. We recorded monthly mean temperature and total rainfall. Seasonal fluctuations in numbers of different life stages of X. compactus inside C. canephora twigs over time were analysed with a general linear model. Ambient temperature and rainfall were used to predict changes in monthly mean counts by means of a multiple linear regression. The population of X. compactus varied significantly across months and its major peak occurred from May to August. This variability was poorly explained by prevailing weather conditions with only the number of dead females correlated negatively with mean monthly temperature. Therefore, it may be suitable to apply management interventions against X. compactus on C. canephora in Uganda prior to May–August of each year to prevent the pest from attaining damaging levels. Further research is necessary to better understand the effect of weather variables on population dynamics of this insect pest.",

Within the order Carnivora, paternal contribution to rearing offspring is particularly high: an estimated 32% of all studied carnivore species exhibit direct paternal care. Despite the prominence of paternal investment in carnivores, the endocrine basis of this behaviour is not well understood. This review examines the current – highly constrained – state of knowledge about the endocrine basis of carnivore paternal investment. We attempt to link changes in androgen and glucocorticoid levels with variation in direct and indirect paternal care behaviour making specific predictions regarding the way forward. Well-studied species, such as bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula) and meerkats (Suricata suricatta), where social dynamics are relatively well understood, can act as ideal model systems through which we may further investigate the endocrine basis of paternal investment in carnivores.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPraying mantids (Mantodea) are not only apex predators with a 'mystical' status, but are also regarded as a kind of oracle and, in some cultures, as omens associated with good or bad. In the future, the cultural, mystical and religious values allocated to mantids over millennia can contribute not only to their own conservation, but also to conservation of arthropods in general. Historically, Mantodea influenced African, Greek, Egyptian, Japanese and Chinese cultures and they affected human culture in a variety of ways. Some of these are coin designs, hairstyles, swords, death rituals, war strategies, advertisements, children's books and even modern music. Despite human fascination with mantids, this group of arthropods is unfortunately overlooked in terms of conservation and research. Conservation as a mitigation strategy to protect threatened and endangered species is influenced by philosophical and psychological aspects and requires more than a purely scientific approach. This paper highlights the role of praying mantids in human culture and the historical relationships between humans and other arthropods. Acknowledgement of these cultural aspects of the mantids may contribute to a positive change in people's perceptions of arthropods and eventually in insect conservation. It is suggested that mantids could be used as a flagship or gateway species to advance awareness of insect conservation. We can generate much needed insect appreciation by building on the existing 'global' cultural values, fascination and intrigue of the charismatic mantid, therefore increasing wonderment of the small things that dominate the world we live in.Keywords: biodiversitycultural valueethno-entomology",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity conservation has focused on large vertebrates and plants with pronounced economic value, compared with smaller organisms such as benthic macroinvertebrates that play a particular role in freshwater ecosystems. The increasing loss and degradation of freshwater habitats, coupled with low taxonomic and ecological knowledge and limited conservation efforts in the tropical regions, threaten macroinvertebrate biodiversity. This study investigated spatial and seasonal variability in benthic macroinvertebrate diversity and the underlying environmental variables within the Aturukuku River in Tororo, Uganda. Benthic macroinvertebrates were evaluated by comparing their composition at a reference site in the upstream rural area with two urban midstream sites and one rural downstream site during dry and wet seasons in 2018. Benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in the Aturukuku River was lower than that reported from least disturbed small rivers within the same region; with moderate to high pollution tolerant taxa, dominating. Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Simulium sp. predominated at the urban sites receiving sewage and abattoir effluent. The Shannon–Wiener diversity index, species richness and species evenness in the river were generally low. Prosobranch (Thiaridae) snails and bivalves (Sphaeridae) were among the taxa with low tolerance to changes in the river. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, temperature and streambed substrate were predominant in structuring benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. There was no potential species-rich area for macroinvertebrate conservation, given the poor environmental conditions and diversity in the entire river. However, specific mitigation measures against the declining quality of the river are recommended, to boost conservation of macroinvertebrates and the entire riverine ecosystem.",

A 200 km stretch of gravel road networks that passes through the Serengeti ecosystem was surveyed in 2015 for five consecutive days during each study period during the wet and dry seasons, between March and August 2015, to document the magnitude, patterns and composition of wildlife roadkill. We found a total of 51 wildlife roadkills that consisted of 26 species of wild animals and included 18 bird and 8 mammal species. Bird species (60.8%) were more frequently killed than mammal species (39.2%). Moreover, a higher incidence of wildlife roadkill was recorded in the morning (56.9%) than in the afternoon (43.1%) and more mammals (51.7%) than birds (48.3%) were recorded in the morning. Greater numbers of wildlife roadkill were recorded along road segments with good road conditions (69.4%) that were wider (>8 m) and with higher traffic volumes than along roads with poor conditions (30.6%). Overall, the Cape hare (Lepus capensis) was the most frequently killed species (17.6%) among the mammals, whereas the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) (13.7%) was most frequently killed among the avifauna. To reduce the number of roadkill incidents, we recommend changing driver speeding behaviours by installing wildlife-warning signage that consists of picture-based signs, because they have been proved to be more effective than word-based signs to reduce speeds and hence, reduce collisions. Additionally, the responsible management authorities should provide education to drivers on safe driving and enforcement of laws and regulations. Further, policy briefings that focus on wildlife roadkill should be made available to assist decision-makers and engineers to improve road design in protected areas.",

Ebenavia inunguis and U. phantasticus had 2n = 36 telocentric elements, NORs on the first chromosome pair in E. inunguis, and on the third chromosome pair in U. phantasticus.

The remaining species exhibited karyotypes with a diploid chromosome number ranging from 2n = 31 to 2n = 38. We assume that these karyotype assemblages derived from the 2n=36 karyotype by cryptic and/or simple rearrangements, such as inversions, fissions and fusions. Furthermore, molecular and/or chromosomal data indicate that Paroedura is a monophyletic genus, in which chromosome rearrangements occurred repeatedly and independently during the specific diversification. Moreover both P. bastardi and P. gracilis in current definitions are paraphyletic assemblages of several related species, since their population proves more closely related to P. ibityensis or P. oviceps than co-specific populations.",

A phylogenetic analysis including three mitochondrial (16S, cytb and COI) and one nuclear marker (BRCA) shows that C. g. nimbasilvanus is the sister taxon of C. nimbae, a species also endemic to West Africa. Crocidura g. goliath is part of the C. olivieri group and closely related to C. olivieri, C. viaria and C. fulvastra . Calculation of genetic distances between cytb sequences confirms this pattern (divergence of 13.5% between C. G. nimbasilvanus and C. G. goliath ). An analysis of 112 skulls using morphometric geometrics provides evidence of marked shape differences between the two taxa. Despite close external morphological resemblances, we found diagnostic external and craniodental characters between these two forms. We therefore propose to treat C. nimbasilvanus and C. goliath as distinct species. Similar morphological features exhibited by these two African giant forest shrews, especially their large size, may be the result of homoplasy due to convergent evolutionary pressure. We also investigated the phenotypic diversification in size and skull shape within C. goliath and discovered strong intraspecific variability.",

We assessed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on lepidopteran assemblages across five different land use types (Fragmented Forest, Crop Fields, Pasture Land, Rural Settlements and undisturbed Natural Forest) in the Choke Mountains, Ethiopia. Lepidoptera were sampled using 20 W UV LED lights in 19 sites for 12 consecutive months. A total of 4 559 specimens representing 14 families and 339 species were sampled. The highest diversity was obtained from the Natural Forest, followed by the Fragmented Forest, Rural Settlements, Pasture Land and Crop Fields. The monthly trends of the diversity estimates showed strong differences among the five land use types, with months when the highest Hill–Shannon and Hill– Simpson values were observed not in the Natural Forest, but in the Rural Settlements and Fragmented Forest. The highest dominance values were observed in the Crop Fields and Pasture Land, with dominant species percentages of about 10%. The multivariate results clearly highlight the separation of the Natural Forest sites from all other sites and, in general, great consistency within each land use. A high positive linear relationship between the number of vascular plants and sampled Lepidoptera species was observed. The results of this study will be useful for guiding conservation management priorities to prevent irreversible biodiversity loss and maintain ecosystem provisioning services that are essential for the sustainable development of rural communities.Keywords: mothsAfricaland useecosystem monitoringdiversity measures",

Previous studies of seed predation in southern Africa have largely been conducted in desert ecosystems. However, this woodland-savanna habitat is more mesic and has relatively predictable rainfall patterns. The experiment was conducted in grassy and woody microhabitats in the hot, dry season and early wet season, and followed a year in which precipitation was 69% of the long-term average. Birds removed the greatest quantity of seeds, followed by ants and then rodents. Previous studies in northern hemisphere mesic environments emphasize the importance of rodents and minor role of invertebrates in seed predation. Although our site appears to have more in common with southern hemisphere desert sites than with northern hemisphere mesic sites, we recognize thatour results are likely to reflect a lower limit of consumption by rodents.",

Studies have shown significant negative effects of burning on the abundance, species diversity and community composition of smaller vertebrates and invertebrates. Social arthropods are likely to suffer from repeated burning, as destruction of the colony means a permanent loss of the entire reproductive unit. Nests of social spiders of the genus Stegodyphus (Eresidae) are a prominent feature of African savannas and their size and visibility make them potentially good indicators of ecological consequences of fire. The colonies are sedentary and their nests may persist for several years, although individuals have an annual life cycle. We explored the mortality patterns and the effects of burning on survival of colonies of two species of social spider, Stegodyphus mimosarum and S. dumicola that live sympatrically. We compared colony mortality in burned and unburned areas to determine if colony mortality was due to burning or, alternatively, to natural senescence. Analysis of five years of nest mortality data together with information on the burning regime in Spioenkop Nature Reserve, KwaZulu Natal province (South Africa), indicates that colony extinction in S. mimosarum is independent of the burning regime, while burning is a significant cause of colony mortality in S. dumicola. The different responses of the two species are likely a result of different colony dynamics and nesting sites.",

Several additional small-bodied Pachydactylus have been historically considered subspecies of P. capensis or members of this group. To assess evolutionary relationships among these taxa, we conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the members of the P. capensis group using sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b and 16S ribosomal RNA genes (1081 nt). Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses recovered a well-supported clade comprising all five species of the currently-recognized P. capensis group. This clade is clearly separate from the P. rugosus group and P. labialis, both of which were formerly included in P. capensis. Sequence data thus corroborate patterns of affinity based on phenetic analysis of scale features (Broadley 1977). Within the P. capensis clade, Pachydactylus tigrinus and P. oshaughnessyi form a tropical lineage, whereas P. capensis (P. affinis + P. vansoni) represent a more temperate, southern assemblage. Cladogenesis within the group appears coincident with Tertiary events affecting the Zambezi River, Kalahari and Great Escarpment.",

The current study examined two distinct populations of elephants separated by an area with a high human population. The average group size of \nelephant herds in both the eastern and western sections of the catchment has declined steadily from the early 1980s until the present day. Average group size also appeared to be seasonally dependent, with larger group sizes observed during the cold-dry and wet season in the eastern catchment and during the wet and hot-dry season in the western catchment. The social interactions between elephants were investigated in the western section of the catchment only. Associations between different family units were only loose affiliations lacking the strong social bonds reported from other areas of Africa. Adult male group associations were shown to be transient and irregular, with small group size.",

Mean aggregate home-range size for the three radio-collared jackals was 15.9 km2. Mean home-range size varied between seasons with a tendency for range expansion during winter. The first two radio-collared jackals had similar activity patterns and were most active at dawn and dusk. Distances moved between hourly re-locations ranged from 2 m to 3000 m, and average distances moved between hourly relocations differed between individuals. The mean distance travelled per 24-hour period was 14.6 km. Time of day influenced movements considerably, with greater distances being moved during dawn and dusk. Extraterritorial excursions directed towards farmland were frequent and accounted for 21.1 % (n = 66) of all radio relocations. Jackals in MNR utilized wooded cover for denning, predator avoidance and foraging. They did not use habitats according to their proportional availability in any season. In all seasons jackals used open savanna grassland, Croton/Combretum tree savanna, and seasonal floodplains less than expected from their availability, and used tree and bush savanna, semi-sweet mixed bushveld and agricultural areas much more than expected. Implications of space use by jackals on management and conservation are discussed.",

The Namaqua rock mouse, Aethomys namaquensis, is a medium-sized, omnivorous, nocturnal murid with a wide distribution throughout southern Africa. Sex differences in space use behaviour were found: female captures were described by non-overlapping contiguous areas, whereas males were caught over 50% larger areas that overlapped spatially and temporally. Movements during breeding were characteristic of scramble-competition polygyny: a transient influx of non-resident males (coinciding with an increase in perforate females) skews the sex ratio towards males early in the breeding season. Whereas female condition improved with time, male body condition declined significantly over the breeding period (r262 = 0.134, P = 0.002) and males had lower persistence in the trappable population. This study may therefore document a link between mobility (associated with a polygynous mating system) and reduced male survivorship and body condition for this murine rodent.",

The endemic Melanoides species of Lake Malawi have been investigated several times during the last century, due to their large conchological variation, but no unambiguous answer regarding the number of species has been given. The phylogenetic relationship between morphs or genetic clones of Melanoides in Lake Malawi was inferred by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial genes 16S and COI. Additional sequences from GenBank were included to investigate the relationship to other morphs from different parts of the world. For the first time, a putative secondary structure was developed for a partial region of 16S in this genus to identify the variability of the secondary structure in stems and loops. The molecular analyses indicated that several genetic clones exist in Lake Malawi and that M. tuberculata is a paraphyletic taxon. It is not clear from the results whether invasions or dispersals account for the complex situation in Lake Malawi. The basal position of M. admirabilis, endemic to Lake Tanganyika, in the inferred phylogeny indicates that Africa might be the origin of the genus. The results further indicate that three major clades of Melanoides, consisting of several genetic clones, are present in Lake Malawi; one clade consisting of invasive M. tuberculata, another of native M. tuberculata and a third consisting of the M. polymorpha- complex. It appears as if the unique development of morphs within the Melanoides genus in Lake Malawi has evolved primarily by divergence of genetic clones instead of species differentiation.",

One of the females was postreproductive and the other had lost its pup of the season, consequently they might have stayed longer at sea after settlement of the goose barnacles and prior to hauling out, than females with pups. Attached to the guard hairs of the seal, the barnacles were clogged with underfur fibres, making it impossible for them to feed, leading to emaciation. A possible explanation for the clogging is that the seals had begun to moult.Key words: Subantarctic fur sealArctocephalus tropicalisgoose barnacleLepas australisinfestation",

Both sexes spent nearly 3.5 h per day basking with 90% of the basking time in the cover of sparse vegetation. Feeding and walking were the most frequent active behaviours. The activity pattern of the sexes differed between 10:00 and 12:00 in the morning when males spent more time out of cover on active behaviours, particularly feeding, than females did. The daily activity pattern of the population peaked between 10:00 and 12:00, reflecting the activity pattern of the more active sex, males. Females were out of cover, active, and feeding at higher temperatures than were males. The high temperatures probably allowed females to complete activities more efficiently, reducing their exposure time and predation risk. Although fighting and mating represented small fractions of male time budgets, the extended physical presence through walking and feeding may help males to establish dominance hierarchies and enhance mating success.",

Top predators have been extensively controlled in rangelands managed for sheep in South Africa, because top predators prey on sheep. To test whether this control of top predators has increased nest predation risk for breeding birds in rangeland landscapes, I compared nest predation rates between rangeland areas subject to predator control, and large protected areas with no predator control. An artificial nest experiment found that nest predation by mammalian mesopredators was non-significantly higher in rangeland areas, providing weak support for increased predation by mammalian mesopredators as a consequence of mesopredator release. However, nest predation rates on natural nests of a suite of nine species did not differ between rangeland and protected area landscapes. Thus, control of top predators does not appear to reduce bird nesting success in this system. This result may reflect complex interactions between mammalian mesopredators and other predators of birds' nests, particularly snakes.",

ND4 mitochondrial DNA sequences from 28 specimens comprising 20 P. shokari, two P. aegyptius, one P. elegans, two P. sibilans, one P. condanarus and two outgroups were analysed. Within P. schokari we identified four genetic lineages (Morocco/Western Sahara, Mauritania, Algeria and Israel) with a genetic divergence ranging from 4-5%, less than that typically found between different species. Surprisingly, Moroccan/Western Sahara and Algerian lineages are the most divergent ones. This geographic substructuring may be due to severe climate changes in the Sahara desert between the Miocene and Pleistocene associated with expansion/contraction phases of this desert. Psammophis aegyptius is the sister-taxon of Psammophis schokari with a high level of genetic divergence between them (10.7%) supporting the recognition of P. aegyptius as a distinct species. The three Moroccan/Western Sahara colour morphotypes form one genetic lineage, indicating that colour pattern does not reflect a different phylogenetic history, and is probably an ecological adaptation to the local environment.",

We investigated the role of bushclumps as refugia for small mammals, and examined the effect of a limited number of abiotic and biotic factors on their richness, diversity and abundance. Small mammals were surveyed using Sherman small mammal traps at two sites in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa (Mountain Zebra National Park and Kwandwe Private Game Reserve). Soil hardness and seed abundance, inside and outside bushclumps, were determined. Trap success was significantly higher inside bushclumpsthan in areas outside, and species diversity and the abundance of small mammals were greater within bushclumps compared tooutside. Bushclumps also had significantly softer soil and a higher concentration of seeds. We conclude that bushclumps provide a concentrated source of food and protection from predators for small mammals, and are thus used significantly more than adjacent open areas. The conservation of bushclumps is therefore important for the overall maintenance of ecosystem functioning.Key words: conservationmicrohabitatsrodents",

Seven species accounted for 93.4% of the total catch in these estuaries, namely Gilchristella aestuaria (78.8%), Caffrogobius gilchristi (6.2%), Psammogobius knysnaensis (3.5%), C. nudiceps (2.5%), Parablennius sp.

Larval fish assemblages in the sampled estuaries exhibited the same seasonal and spatial patterns described for temperate estuaries both in South Africa and worldwide. Larval fish were more abundant in summer and in the mesohaline zone. The assemblages were less diverse and dominated by fewer species than temperate estuaries along the south east coast of South Africa. The differences found in composition and density of the larval fish assemblages from south and west coast estuaries result from the biogeography of the area and the differences in freshwater inflow.",

We recorded the diversity pattern of zooplankton in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, a system which include water bodies with different stability with regard to water levels and wet–dry phases, from permanent rivers and lagoons to seasonal floodplains and temporary water-filled rain ponds. The yearly flood pulse caused a gradual shift in aquatic parameters on seasonal floodplains, which promoted zooplankton diversity. Species composition differed between temporal and permanent habitats, but highest diversity was recorded on floodplains. Diversity on floodplains showed a distinct seasonal trend, being low during increasing flood, to highly diverse during high water periods. Density and hatching sequence of major cladoceran species suggested that the bank of resting eggs in the soil is the major source of species occurrence during flooding. We propose that seasonal floodplains, which have significant higher diversity and abundance, serve as source areas for the cladoceran diversity in the Okavango Delta. From these habitats ephippia are dispersed into the other four habitats. The dominant vectors for such dispersal are probably wind and mammals.Key words: CladoceraOkavango Deltadispersalintermediate disturbanceegg bank",

We investigate correlates of anxiety and stress among wild adult male olive baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis) in Gashaka-Gumti National Park, Nigeria, and present the first examination of these correlates for male baboons living in forested environments. We used rates of self-directed behaviours (SDB) to quantify anxiety, and faecal glucocorticoid (FGC) concentrations to quantify physiological stress. We first examined the relationship between SDB rates and FGC concentrations, and then examined each measure in relation to a range of variables previously linked to anxiety or stress. We found that SDB rates and FGC concentrations were not correlated with each other, nor were they related to any measure of grooming or receiving aggression. SDB rates were negatively correlated with time spent with an adult female as nearest neighbour, but were unrelated to time with another adult male as closest conspecific. FGC concentrations were unrelated to time with adult nearest neighbours of either sex. Our results add to the growing body of literature examining the psychological and physiological costs of social living among wild primates.",

Aggression may therefore be favoured by sexual selection, the strength of which can be assessed using repeatability of aggressive behaviour. Here, we tested the hypotheses that male swordtails, Xiphophorus sp., are consistent in the aggressive and mating behaviours exhibited and in the time spent at a close distance to females (female attendance), and that aggressive males gain increased opportunity to attempt copulation compared to their less aggressive conspecifics (sneak frequency). As predicted, aggression between males, and male display and sneak frequency were repeatable. However, male aggression was not significantly correlated with sneak frequency. The function of aggression in this species is not clear-cut and may have an indirect female access function through formation of dominance hierarchies or defence of resources. A surprising finding highlighted by this study was the contradictory results for consistency in female contact, with high repeatability scores indicating consistency in behaviour but the within-subjects component of repeated measures ANOVA showing differences in female contact between trials. The possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.",

Based on evidence from molecular dating, however, this speciation event was estimated as having occurred in the Miocene, an early date of origin for an extant species, predating the dramatic climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene. Here, we explore the possibility of more recent connections of populations of this species across the Sahara Desert that would have facilitated faunal exchange through the Last Glacial Maximum. We used ecological niche modelling based on current climatic datasets and known occurrence points to develop models of present-day potential distributions of E. rozeti and related taxa. Given that the Miocene scenario was proposed based on a single set of evidence, we here provide a partial test based on an independent analysis of present and past potential distributions. Our results corroborate the idea of vicariance, but indicate that distributional patterns and ecological characteristics are consistent with a more recent, post-Pleistocene vicariance across an increasingly arid Sahara. We emphasize the importance of multiple sets of evidence to be brought to bear on complex biogeographical questions, and offer models of palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological distributions and independent sources of such information to complement molecular systematic studies.",

None were encountered in the northern stratum Dakar-Agadir, 6 November -15 December 2011. Total visual survey effort was 468 h, 01 min, covering 5335 km. Depending on the exclusion or inclusion of probable records, the sum of group sizes totalled 33 or 43 individuals, respectively. Humpback whale encounter rates between Conakry and Dakar then amounted to 1.74 or 2.27 whales/ 100 km, respectively. Group sizes ranged from 1–6 individuals (mean = 1.94, S.D. = 1.20, n = 17; median = 2). Minimally five of 17 groups (29.4%) consisted of adult-calf pairs, with a minimum crude birth rate ranging from 0.060–0.152. All sightings occurred in shallow water, 22–60 m (mean = 35.0 m, S.D. = 10.13, n = 17) but survey effort in deeper, offshore water was negligible. Sea-surface temperature at sighting locations ranged from 25.5–29.0°C (mean = 27.34, S.D. = 0.96, n = 17). No humpback whales were sighted during a second survey covering Conakry-Tangier-Las Palmas, from 9 May to 22 July 2012 (519 h, 13 min; 6278 km). The Cape Verde Islands comprised, to date, the only known wintering ground located in the North-East Atlantic. This study showed that Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Guinea are normal range states for M. novaeangliae. A temporal signature, six to seven months out-of-phase with mid-season in the Cape Verde Islands, and neonate presence strongly suggest that the wide Conakry-Dakar continental shelf serves as both wintering and nursery grounds for a South Atlantic stock, in agreement with Bamy et al. (2010). This stock may comprise the northwesternmost component of the large humpback whale assemblage migrating in and out of the northern Gulf of Guinea in austral winter/spring. Further research is required to consolidate insights linking temporal and spatial distribution off western Africa with hemispheric stock identity and migration paths.",

The second is via the east where specimens of R. rattus appear linked to Arab and southeast Asian haplotypes.

This has highlighted the importance of other minor populations. The Phongola River Nile crocodile population was previously considered as unsubstantial. Consequently, we investigated the Nile crocodile population numbers and status and the effects of the impoundment of the Phongola River on this. In 2009–2010 we determined a minimum population number of 281 Nile crocodiles in Pongolapoort Dam using a combination of survey methods. The population structure was identified as having a minimum of 116 (41.3%) juveniles (<1.2 m total length), 31 (11.0%) subadults (1.2–2.5 m total length) and 134 (47.7%) adults (>2.5 m total length). At the commencement of the breeding season in August, crocodiles congregated at a major basking site where the main tributary entered the dam. Three major nesting areas were identified, two of which were located on the river inlet to the dam. We identified approximately 30 nesting females during the 2009/10 nesting season. Several nests were predated by the Nile monitor Varanus niloticus. There was a total recruitment failure of nests along the river inlet to the dam due to a flash flood of the Phongola River in January 2010. This preliminary study suggests that the Pongolapoort Dam Nile crocodile population has a relatively high potential reproductive output, although their annual successes may vary greatly because of loss of nesting sites as a result of water-level fluctuations and predation. It appears that the river impoundment has generally had a positive impact on this Nile crocodile population, although suitable nesting sites may become limited. Continued long-term monitoring of the Nile crocodile population in Pongolapoort Dam is required to determine if the impoundment continues to support a viable population.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThroughout the Miocene, the African landscape underwent broad climatic shifts that profoundly influenced the distribution of fauna and flora. Since the late Miocene, these shifts have created a landscape in southern Africa that is strongly characterised by savanna and arid environments. Forests persist in small fragments, primarily in mountainous or heterogeneous landscapes. Arthroleptis wahlbergii is a small frog endemic to eastern South Africa that has presumed low dispersal ability. Because of its preference for forests, the dynamics of forests since the late Miocene in this region might have promoted diversification within A. wahlbergii. To investigate whether habitat fragmentation might have driven divergences among populations, we carried out species distribution modelling and population level and phylogenetic analyses using two genetic loci (16S, mitochondrial; RAG-1, nuclear) sequenced for 48 individuals from 14 forests across the c. 500 km range of this species. There is substantial population-level structuring within A. wahlbergii, however the structure does not relate to forest types or catchments. We instead propose that the structure is a result of dynamic and idiosyncratic changes in forest connectivity over the Pleistocene. We identified two geographically circumscribed clades, the northern of which corresponds to true A. wahlbergii. The southern clade corresponds to populations from which Arthroleptis wageri FitzSimons, 1930 was described. This has long been considered a synonym of A. wahlbergii, but our molecular phylogenetic and distribution modelling supports recognising A. wageri as a distinct species.Keywords: Afrotemperate forestamphibiansbarcodingcryptic speciesrefugia",

The objectives of the current study were to specifically describe the morphology and determine for the first time the phylogenetic position of Glossidium pedatum and Orientocreadium batrachoides. Examination of G. pedatum using conventional light and scanning microscopy techniques revealed undescribed features related to the digestive system, the presence of papillae-like lateral lappets, and terminal lobes covered with backwardly directed spines. Orientocreadium batrachoides revealed a pharynx that is four lobed anteriorly. Both the large (28S) and small (18S) subunits of the ribosomal genome, analysed through Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood, were used to genetically characterise these species. Phylogenies indicate that G. pedatum does not fit well into any known family within the Plagiorchioidea, as currently indicated in various systematic structures based on morphology. However, G. pedatum was closely related to Haematoloechidae according to analyses of 18S and 28S rDNA. Based on 28S rDNA, O. batrachoides formed a well-supported clade with Orientocreadium pseudobagri within the family Orientocreadiidae. In turn, Orientocreadiidae is closely related to Leptophallidae. The current study provides essential information that could be helpful to assign the family for Glossidium in future studies. Characterisation of life-cycle stages may be necessary to fully elucidate the systematic position of G. pedatum.",

Grassland birds have evolved within this 'shifting mosaic' to become reliant on specific habitat characteristics maintained under varying levels of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance.

Mistbelt grassland is a threatened vegetation type endemic to the province of KwaZulu-Natal, of which only 0.3% is formally protected. This study investigated seasonal and patch type heterogeneity in a Mistbelt grassland avian community by determining avian community structure and composition in four patch types, i.e. i) untransformed open grassland, ii) burnt grassland, iii) bramble-invaded and, iv) bramble-cleared grassland, during winter and summer. Avian assemblages were significantly different between the different patch types for each season. The bramble patch type negatively affected grassland bird species diversity. Bramble-cleared grassland and untransformed grassland had similar vegetation structure and avian communities in the summer, suggesting that the grassland bird community benefitted soon after the clearing of invasive vegetation. This study provides further evidence that bird diversity is enhanced in structurally heterogeneous grassland landscapes. Furthermore, the protection and appropriate management of privately owned Mistbelt grassland, conserved in the form of rangeland, is an important refuge for threatened and endemic avifauna, such as the globally-threatened blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) and wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus).",

Indigenous fishes include 43 species of the Zambezian faunal group (70% of the national total), eight Karroid (47%), five Cape (31%) and seven species of Marine origin (79%). Six represented Zambezian species, two Marine origin, and all of the Cape and Karroid species are endemic to South Africa. Only three threatened species naturally occur within national parks (Serranochromis meridianus, Barbus andrewi, Pseudobarbus afer ) all of which are classified as Endangered. Two extralimital IUCN threatened species (Chetia brevis and Oreochromis macrochir ) have been introduced. At least three of the five lineages of Galaxias zebratus and two of the four lineages of Pseudobarbus afer occur within national parks in the Cape region. Many fish populations within national parks remain threatened, particularly by hydraulic alterations, impoundment, and predation by alien fishes. There are few aquatic systems within national parks where one or more of these threats are not prominent, and these collectively support only half of the freshwater fish species occurring in all national parks. Proposed management actions include determination and implementation of Environmental Flow Reserves in stressed systems, management of existing alien fish populations and prevention of new establishments, and regular assessments of fish communities.",

Acoustic features allowed assigning calls of stallions with 92% average classification success to the correct species. The duration of the call clearly separated horses (type I) from type II species: kiang, Somalian ass and Grevy's zebra. Accordingly to its harem social system (type I), the pattern of long-range call in Grant's zebra deviates from that of its relatives in the direction of horses. Frequency of the first dominant band that was associated with body size separated modern horses from the archaic breed and Przewalski's horse. Playback experiments confirmed that equids, especially the type II species, respond strongly to conspecific calls but also to calls of other equids.Key words: Equusequidscallsacoustic communicationsocial system",

Phylogenetic reconstructions of all known species from the family Megadermatidae based on DNA sequences of two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes yielded incongruent topologies (both Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analysis) with only weak support for nodes. The phylogeny that combined all six loci into a species tree was not congruent with any previous inference based on dental or cranial characteristics, but it suggested separate generic status of two Megaderma species.

Plasma levels of alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamyl transferase (γ GT), total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were assessed, and liver tissue sections were examined under a microscope. The level of CYP3A11, CYP7A1, UGT1A1, and SULT2A1 were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. The data showed that infection of mice with E. papillata induced metabolic disturbance, inflammation and injury of the liver. This was evidenced (i) as increases in inflammatory cellular infiltrations, dilated sinusoids, and vacuolated hepatocytes, (ii) as increased plasma levels of ALT, AST, ALP, γ GT, total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose, (iii) as decreased mRNA expression of CYP3A11, UGT1A1, and SULT2A1, respectively and (iv) as increased mRNA level of CYP7A1. The data provide evidence that E. papillata parasites are able to induce a metabolic disturbances and hepatic tissue injury. Investigation of the expression profile of CYP, UGT and SULT genes in the hepatic tissues may help elucidate the underlying mechanism for regulation of the transcription of genes in the process of pathogenesis.",

Although the prevalence of these items was low, with sun spiders recorded in nine and scorpion remains in one of 246 scats, our observations suggest that aardwolves opportunistically feed on larger prey than previously thought. However, our observations do not suggest that aardwolves utilized these large prey items as alternatives to their main food resource during periods of food scarcity.

Berega has a distinct unimodal rainfall pattern, with most rainfall from November to April/May. We hypothesized that breeding of rodents in central Tanzania would be confined to the wet season, when unlimited resources would be available for reproduction. We provide evidence of breeding discontinuity in the three species, showing that breeding was seasonally restricted to the wet season and early in the dry season. The observed discontinuity could largely be ascribed to variation in primary productivity between the wet and dry seasons. Reproductively active females were found in the population as early as November, a month into the rainy season, but when early rains occurred, some individuals were already breeding in October. Breeding was more intensive in the latter part of the wet season (March–May) and completely ceased during the dry season. For M. natalensis, survival was highest in the wet period and low in the dry season. The study provides knowledge on the breeding dynamics of rodents in central Tanzania, which can help farmers to take proactive rodent management decisions to prevent high rodent densities and reduce crop damage in the fields. Application of control measures by the community early in the season when populations of reproductive females is lowest will be most rewarding.",

The phylogenetic relationships of three haplochromine cichlid species from the upper Lufubu River were analysed in the context of the phylogeographic structure of haplochromine cichlids from the surrounding hydrological systems. Patterns of genetic distances between the Lufubu fish and their sister taxa from the upper Congo system indicate that the headwaters of the Lufubu River were colonized from drainages pertaining to the Upper Congo system during extreme flooding or river capture events (at least several 100 000 years ago), possibly even three times independently.

Langebaan Lagoon (part of West Coast National Park and a Marine Protected Area) is divided into three zones. One zone is a sanctuary, a second allows non-extractive visitation, and the third is for general use including bait collecting and fishing. In 1999–2000, the number of people visiting the sandflats to collect bait was highest during summer weekends (x̄ = 48 per day), and was concentrated at two sites: Centre Banks and Klein Oesterwal. Callichirus kraussi was the main species harvested, with an estimated 1 008 178 being removed annually. This represents 0.12% of the sandprawn stock at Centre Banks and Klein Oesterwal, and 0.012% of the estimated total stock. In 2012–2013, total bait-collecting activities had increased 23% compared with 1999–2000, but still constituted a small proportion of the stock. On average, each bait collector removed 86 prawns per outing: 36 more than the legal daily limit. The amount of sediment disturbed annually by bait collecting was estimated as 6189 tonnes. The surface area trampled by bait collectors and associated persons amounted to ~562 800 m2. Thus, although the proportion of C. kraussi harvested constitutes no threat to the stock, associated disturbance has local adverse effects on the ecosystem.Key words: sandprawnsmudprawnscallianassidbait collectingprawn stock",

This species is endemic to the Ngele mistbelt forest in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. In recent years the forest has been severely impacted by anthropogenic activities such as logging of indigenous trees, construction of a national highway, commercial timber plantations and introduction of alien plant species, resulting in habitat fragmentation and potential range contraction for the species. A total of 35 specimens were collected from five sample sites (logs) in the Ngele Forest and sequenced for a partial fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit one (COI) locus. In addition, the sex ratio at each sample sites was determined. A highly skewed sex ratio was detected within sites and only three males were present among the 35 O. roseus specimens. The results reveal the presence of 11 haplotypes and moderate genetic differentiation between the five sampled sites. In addition, it is evident that samples from the same log represented a mixture of haplotypes and did not comprise a single maternal haplotype. The results further suggest that gene flow between individuals occurs in the interior of the forest. Conservation implications of the present study are briefly discussed.",

We use binary logistic regression models to evaluate selected habitat features as predictors of hippo occurrence at two spatial scales and a negative binomial model with log-link function to evaluate predictors of frequency of use at a fine spatial scale. At the scale of the whole estuary, models indicate that hippos preferentially select diurnal refuge sites that are closer to river inlets and farther from human settlements. At a fine scale (within the Narrows in which more than 50% of the population resides), occurrence and frequency of use models suggested that hippos preferentially settle in sites with water depths between 0.5 and 1.49 m, that are farther from human settlements, closest to natural wetland vegetation and near neighbouring groups. Preliminary data on habitat variables influencing hippo distribution highlights the necessity to manage water levels, restore wetland floodplains, protect wetland vegetation and halt human settlement encroachment in order to ensure the viability of this UNESCO site and its hippo population.",

It has previously been subsumed within Kassina, and is currently placed as a sister genus to Afrixalus, although it has not been included in any phylogenetic studies until now. This species is poorly represented in museum collections and is only known from fewer than 35 specimens from southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjacent Zambia. Newly collected material from central Angola, a range extension of 400–800 km west of previously known localities, allowed us to revisit the taxonomic placement of the genus with the aid of phylogenetic analysis and shed light on its geographic distribution, morphology and natural history. Although our phylogenetic analysis is limited to a single mitochondrial gene (16S), we place Kassinula in the subfamily Hyperoliinae and closely related to Afrixalus, with a high degree of confidence.

Following examination, only P. p. philander was found to be infected with C. philander – indicating strict host specificity. Parasite intensity varied from 0 to 184 specimens per fish. Although no significant correlation between season and the infection of specimens of C. philander occurred, a maximum mean intensity of 91.6 occurred in winter. The prevalence was 100% in 10 of the 14 surveys, with no preference for host sex. Mean intensity of infection correlated positively with total length of the host and more parasites were present on fish with a higher condition factor.

Few studies have investigated the biota of pans in this area, which is seriously threatened by mining and agricultural development. Nineteen pan sites within a 20 kmradius covering a wide range of water chemistries were sampled once for zooplankton, epiphytic diatoms and water physico-chemical data in 2009. Collected zooplankton and diatom samples were identified to species or genus level. Many of the zooplankton taxa reported in this study were not recorded in similar pan studies in South Africa and southern Africa. The study revealed a difference among the compositions of zooplankton and diatom communities between temporary pans and permanent pans. Zooplankton found exclusively in freshwater temporary pans included cladocerans (Megafenestra aurita and Scapholeberis kingi), calanoids (Mesocyclops major and Thermodiaptomus mixtus), a cyclopoid (Acanthocyclops vernalis) and a rotifer (Platyias quadricornis). Permanent pans were characterized by taxa such as cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia rigaudi and Dunhevedia crassa), a calanoid (Metadiaptomus transvaalensis), cyclopoids (Paracyclops fimbriatus and Eucyclops gibsoni) and rotifers (Brachionus dimidiatus and Brachionus plicatilis). The most commonly occurring diatom taxa in temporary pans included taxa indicative of slightly acidic to circumneutral, dystrophic and nutrient-poor waters such as Nitzschia acidoclinata, Gomphonema gracile and Eunotia bilunaris. Permanent pan assemblages were characterized by taxa typical of saline waters, including Nitzschia frustulum, Amphora veneta and Planothidium engelbrechtii.

A total of 16 host specimens were collected in February 2014 from Padda Dam (Gauteng province, Johannesburg, 26°17′ S, 27°99′ E). This monogenoid occurred at a prevalence of 56.3%, mean abundance of 2.6 and mean intensity of 4.2. Pieces of stomach tissue with parasites in situ were fixed and processed for routine histological investigations. The anchors and marginal hooks played important roles in the attachment of the parasite to the host. The parasites inserted the sharp curved terminal ends of their anchors into epithelial tissue, while the hooks penetrated superficially and lifted the epithelial tissue. This resulted in a secure attachment and, in most cases, parasites could only be dislodged from the host tissue with some difficulty by using a needle. The histopathological changes caused by the monogenoid on these wild fish were mild and restricted to the vicinity of haptoral attachment. Pleomorphism and mild metaplasia, vacuolation, and mild epithelial hyperplasia occurred in the vicinity of haptoral attachment.",

This study investigated the roosting dynamics of E. wahlbergi in the urban environment of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. To determine roost fidelity bats were radio-tracked to daytime roosts. Bats were found to change their daytime roosts regularly, and would change more frequently during winter than spring. Roost temperatures were measured by placing i-Button® temperature loggers at known roosts, either in man-made structures or vegetation. Temperatures varied across different roosts, but roost temperatures were generally higher than ambient temperatures. Roosts in man-made structures had higher temperatures than those in natural vegetation. This study showed the importance of temperature in E. wahlbergi daytime roosts, although other factors such as reproduction and social interactions, predator avoidance and proximity to food resources are likely to also affect selection of daytime roosts.",

These differences match differences in habitat use between the species: the more aquatic V. niloticus consumed aquatic prey, such as amphibians and crabs, more often than did V. albigularis. Varanus albigularis included more terrestrial prey such as diplopods in its diet. Tortoises and millipedes were also prominent in the V. albigularis diet, constituting an important component of dietary intake. Few of our samples from V. albigularis had empty stomachs, suggesting that this species may occupy a lower trophic level than its Australian counterparts. Although there is a large degree of overlap in the diets of the two species, there is a trend for V. albigularis to eat more slow-moving prey. These differences result in the species foraging at different trophic levels.",

Here, we present the validation of a non-invasive method for assessing adrenocortical activity as an indicator of stress in the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis). By conducting an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, we examined the suitability of three enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) detecting 11,17 dioxoandrostanes (11,17-DOA) as well as faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) with a 5β-3α-ol-11-one (3α,11oxo-CM), or 11,17,21-trihydroxy-4-ene-20-one structure (cortisol), respectively, for monitoring stress-related physiological responses in male and female bat-eared foxes. Our results suggest that the cortisol EIA seems most suitable for measuring fGCMs in this myrmecophageous mammal. Using the cortisol EIA, we compared fGCM concentrations of three populations of foxes. Only one population experienced a sudden change in social environment and the assay appeared to effectively detect the expected resulting increase in stress hormone levels. Therefore, the identified EIA is effective at detecting intraspecific variation in fGCM levels and hence is a useful tool to evaluate physiological stress responses in this species.",

Here, we aimed to demonstrate this species' opportunistic behaviour by investigating its feeding habits in the Albany Thicket Biome (Great Fish River Nature Reserve, Eastern Cape). We analysed 61 scats collected across the four seasons of the year deposited at 15 latrines by Cape genets, as confirmed through video-recordings. Small mammals were primary and arthropods secondary prey, respectively. We recorded seasonal variations in both percentage occurrence and volume of food remains, with peaks in consumption of small mammals in winter, and arthropods in spring–summer. The consumption of supplementary food items such as plant material was higher in spring and autumn, and particularly seeds/fruit in autumn. Reptiles and other food items occurred as trace foods throughout the year, although birds reached a peak in winter. Intermediate to high diet diversity and low to intermediate diet breadth indices were obtained for all seasons. Inter-seasonal diet overlap was intermediate to high depending on the diet descriptor and pairs of seasons considered. Cape genet is therefore a generalist opportunist forager that likely adjusts its diet according to seasonal variations in main prey availability, potentially leading to apparent seasonal or local \"specialisms\".Keywords: Carnivoradietgeneralist opportunist foragerGenetta tigrinascat analysisseasonal variations",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe taxonomy of many Hemidactylus geckos from the Horn of Africa has recently been evaluated. However, the lack of fresh material for some species and also regions has led to the misidentification of some taxa and an underestimation of the true diversity in others. In this study we analyse new material of Hemidactylus collected from poorly known coastal areas of northern Somaliland. Our results support the existence of two yet undescribed species within the arid clade. One of the new species is small-sized and closely related to H. afarensis from the Afar Triangle in Ethiopia, and together with two other species (H. foudaii, H. sinaitus) forms the monophyletic group for which we propose here the name sinaitus species group. The other new species is medium to large-sized, known from only one locality, and belongs to the macropholis species group, where it is a sister species of H. macropholis. Both new endemic species from the northern coastal hyper-arid plains highlight the role of northern Somaliland as an important biodiversity hotspot. Furthermore, our results show pronounced genetic diversity within H. macropholis, and imply possible existence of cryptic taxa within the species. Hemidactylus arnoldi and H. tropidolepis have, for the first time, been sequenced and placed in a phylogenetic context in this study. Our results confirm that H. tropidolepis is nested within the African radiation and is most closely related to H. funaiolii. Hemidactylus arnoldi clustered within the Arabian radiation of Hemidactylus and it was recovered as a sister lineage to all other species of the radiation.Keywords: GekkotaHorn of AfricalizardsmorphologyreptilesSomaliataxonomy",

    "abstract": "AbstractUrbanisation is a major driver of habitat transformation that alters the environmental conditions and selective regimes of the habitats where it occurs. For species inhabiting urban habitats, such alterations can facilitate adaptive responses in their phenotypes, including their morphology. Quantifying potential responses could provide important information for assessing adaptation to urbanisation and may also be relevant to their conservation. Previous studies on African dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion) have shown these lizards to have remarkable adaptive capacity in response to different habitats (e.g. closed canopy habitats vs. open canopy habitats). Several of these species exploit urban habitats, but the extent to which populations are adapting to urban environments has only recently started to receive attention. In this study, we quantify differences in body size and body condition between urban and natural populations of five species of dwarf chameleons. For most comparisons, either females, males or both sexes from urban populations were longer, heavier and/or had better body condition than those from natural populations. In the remaining cases, there were no differences in these traits between populations. Our findings conform with the emerging paradigm that urbanisation positively correlates with enhanced lizard body sizes and condition, although the reasons for this may be complex. Nevertheless, our data provide an avenue for future research into investigating the potential factors (e.g. food supply, predation risk, etc.) that facilitate the trends we observed.Keywords: adaptationAfricaecologymorphologyreptiles",

The neurosecretory cells become vacuolated and show increased cellular and nuclear volumes and nucleocytoplasmic indices during the reproductively active clitellate stages.

Identifying these two species in the field is difficult because of an overlap in the ranges of both forearm and mass. We thus attempted to find morphological features that could be used to distinguish between these two species in the field. We compared cranial and external morphological measurements from museum specimens of the two species, using principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis, to determine which variables could be used to discriminate between them. Length of the hind foot and total body length were identified as the variables responsible for most of the variation between these two species. Miniopterus s. natalensis has a longer total body length (113.6 ± 3.5 mm) than M. fraterculus (102.2 ± 4.8mm)but a relatively shorter hind foot (9.1 ± 0.6 mm, 9.8 ± 0.8 mm, respectively). A function generated from standardized canonical variables, (HF × 0.279417) – (TL × 0.989306) + 100, and based on length of hind foot (HF) and total body length (TL) generated function scores <0 for M. s. natalensis and +0 for M. fraterculus. On the basis that positive values (above zero) indicated M. fraterculus, and negative values (below zero) indicated M. s. natalensis, we were able to correctly assign 20 individuals to their respective species using the above function. These individuals were previously identified as M. fraterculus or M. s. natalensis from their mtDNA sequences. The function thus provides a useful tool for discriminating between the two species in the field.",

Additional scat samples were collected from the Possession Island seal colony (1999–2000) to gain a broader perspective of spatial variation. A uniform and low diversity of cephalopods, only six species amongst all colonies, was identified, indicating that independently the scat sampling method is unsatisfactory for determining species diversity within the diet. Given the ease of scat collection, this method does, however, provide valuable insight into the variability of the most important species in the diet. Ommastrephids dominated the cephalopod component of the diet of seals from Atlas/Wolf Bay and Cape Cross, both in terms of wet mass and numbers. Sepia australis proved to be numerically the most important cephalopod in the diet of seals from Possession Island and Van Reenen Bay, while Octopus magnificus dominated at these colonies in terms of wet mass. Contrary to previous findings it is suggested that seals from Van Reenen Bay and Possession Island forage south of the upwelling cell at Lüderitz (in the southern Benguela ecosystem), while previous evidence of Atlas/Wolf Bay and Cape Cross seals foraging north of this upwelling cell (in the northern Benguela ecosystem) is supported. Prey specimen size differences, within species between colonies, were identified, but lack of cephalopod life history and movement data, and scat sampling biases preclude adequate explanation of these findings, indicating the necessity for further studies.",

    "abstract": "Ungulates can reduce the quantity of food available for other herbivores in general or reduce the available cover for small mammals in particular. On the other hand, browsing and grazing may facilitate foraging by other mammals if the quality and palatability of young re-sprouting tissue is high. An exclosure experiment was set up in Mokolodi Nature Reserve, Botswana, to study ecological effects of large herbivores on the small mammal community. Specifically, we attempted to answer the following questions: 1) are population sizes and community composition of small rodents affected by the exclusion of large herbivores?; 2) if so, what changes in the environment caused by the exclusion of large herbivores are related to changes in small mammal populations?; 3) in what way do such changes in the environment affect small mammals? The populations were significantly larger in the exclosures than in the control areas. A higher number of species was also found in the exclosures. It seems that the smaller populations of small mammals in areas with large herbivores are a result of a reduction in vegetation cover. In general, the exclosures had a higher grass cover than their paired controls. This same relation also held for percentage cover of litter and dead grass.",

Canonical correspondence analyses and multiple regressions determined which wetland and upland characteristics were most strongly associated with waterfowl density and species richness for both the wet and dry season. Overall, diving ducks were not abundant in the wet season, and were rare to absent in the dry season. Divers only responded positively to the characteristics of natural wetlands, including greater surface area, percent coverage of emergent vegetation, and high (ungrazed) shoreline vegetation. Of six species of dabbling ducks present during the wet season, occurrence of three co-varied with wetland and upland characteristics associated with agriculture, namely permanent water, and agricultural grains in the dry season. Being largely grazers, geese responded positively to the higher proportions of bare shoreline, characteristically surrounding agricultural ponds. Because only a few species associated with artificial waterbodies, natural wetlands should be conserved to protect waterfowl diversity in semi-arid South Africa.Key words: semi-aridSouth Africawaterfowl abundanceenvironmental characteristicsartificial waterbodies",

Both predators strongly reduced abundance of all prey species, yet with a striking size-selective effect for Daphnia prey only, where fish showed a strong preference for small individuals, while Anisops preferred large Daphnia individuals. This contrasts with the general view of size selection in invertebrate versus vertebrate predators, but is logically caused by the feeding mode of the notonectid, and the gape size limitation of the fish fry. The two predators also showed a dietary niche differentiation in terms of both prey selection and habitat choice. T. rendalli fed preferably on small species and size classes, whereas predation from A. sardea concentrated on large prey. Competitive interference was indicated when feeding on Ceriodaphnia, and niche partitioning when feeding on the two other species. The predatory pattern suggests long-lasting coexistence in the system.",

Two species have upper lethal temperatures of 37i?½C and 39i?½C when heated at a rate of 1i?½C/day. It has been concluded that they can tolerate much higher temperatures than they normally encounter in the estuary. The salinity tolerances of four species (S. capensis, S. corneus, Dosinia, Macoma) have been investigated. All four appear to be euryhaline osmoconformers and can tolerate a wider range of salinities than they normally encounter in nature. Most of them are, however, unable to survive very low salinities, such as occur during floods, for long periods. It has been noted that species with a large gape to their valves come rapidly into osmotic equilibrium with the external medium, while those with no gape can remain closed, and thus survive low salinities for long periods. A strong shell with little gape also has a noticeable insulating effect when the animals are rapidly heated.",

This sensitivity has been demonstrated in many solitary, nocturnal, small mammals which may fall victim to ambush predators.We tested the response of Cape ground squirrels, a diurnal, group-living small mammal, to the presence of predator (black-backed jackal) faeces and non-predator (black wildebeest) dung in baited traps, and also predator faeces and non-predator dung outside their burrows. The squirrels showed a significantly higher avoidance of traps scented with predator faeces than both control and non-predator dung-scented traps. They also took significantly longer to emerge from burrows that had predator faeces outside compared with control burrows and burrows with non-predator dung outside and showed a trend for higher vigilance once they emerged from burrows with predator faeces outside. We argue that as diurnal group-living reduces a reliance on olfactory cues, this species is more likely to rely on visual cues and the vigilance of other individuals than nocturnal solitary species that have been the focus of most studies up till now. As a result, squirrels very quickly return to normal behaviour after exposure to a predator cue. Level of sociality is likely to influence responses to olfactory cues of predators and should be the focus of further studies.",

Five habitat types (white sand bushveld, brown sand bushveld, general mixed bushveld, rocky outcrops and mopane woodland) within the Greater Makalali Conservancy, Limpopo Province, South Africa, were studied using four successful sampling methods (active searching of two types of quadrats, pitfall traps and drive transects) during three sampling periods between February 1999 and March 2000. Millipedes were consistently the most species rich and abundant taxon. Species were not uniformly distributed across all habitat types; some species were unique to certain habitats. Generally, the more heterogeneous habitats supported the greatest millipede, centipede and scorpion diversity, richness and density, and in the case of the millipedes contained the highest number of regional endemics and habitat specialists. There was no significant difference in scorpion diversity among habitats.",

Marion Island (46°54‘S, 37°45‘E) is host to a relatively small breeding population of southern elephant seals, which like its counterparts in the southern Indian and southern Pacific Oceans, have declined precipitously over the past few decades. An intensive mark–recapture study, which commenced in 1983, has yielded a long time-series of resight data on this population. We used the program MARK to estimate adult female survival in this population from resight data collected over the period 1986–1999. Including concurrent population counts as covariates significantly improved our mark–recapture models and suggests density dependent population regulation to be operational in the population. Although predation may have been involved, it is far more likely that density dependent regulation has been based on a limited food supply. A significant increase in adult female survival was evident which is likely to have given rise to recent changes in population growth.",

The average earthworm community comprised fewer than five species, but up to seven species were sampled from a single forest. Four of the species recorded are national (one species), regional (one species) or local (two species) endemics. Because these species are not known to live elsewhere, the protection of Limpopo Province forests is critical to their survival. The majority (71%) of the earthworm species sampled was exotic, and differences between exotic and indigenous species richness in forests were mostly significant.

Here we review the broader ecological and conservation lessons from recent work on non-indigenous species in two southern systems, the policy implications thereof, and the subsequent changes to policy as a result of this work. First, we discuss invasions in the Antarctic region. Strong relationships exist between numbers of animal invasions and numbers of human visitors to Southern Ocean Islands, abiotic factors are often limiting for introduced species, homogenization across islands differs among taxonomic groups, and control actions can rapidly result in unintended consequences. This knowledge has influenced national policy and decisions within the Antarctic Treaty System. Second, we discuss ungulate introductions and translocations, both in South Africa and elsewhere. We show that substantial homogenization has resulted from both processes. However, firm evidence for impacts of ungulate introductions and translocations is sometimes difficult to find, despite the theoretical likelihood thereof. Such a lack of information may have profound consequences for the effective implementation of policy.",

We recorded the diversity pattern of zooplankton in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, a system which include water bodies with different stability with regard to water levels and wet–dry phases, from permanent rivers and lagoons to seasonal floodplains and temporary water-filled rain ponds. The yearly flood pulse caused a gradual shift in aquatic parameters on seasonal floodplains, which promoted zooplankton diversity. Species composition differed between temporal and permanent habitats, but highest diversity was recorded on floodplains. Diversity on floodplains showed a distinct seasonal trend, being low during increasing flood, to highly diverse during high water periods. Density and hatching sequence of major cladoceran species suggested that the bank of resting eggs in the soil is the major source of species occurrence during flooding. We propose that seasonal floodplains, which have significant higher diversity and abundance, serve as source areas for the cladoceran diversity in the Okavango Delta.

Birds showed increased food intake with decreasing glucose concentration, but showed no significant differences in these intake amounts with differing sucrose concentrations. Apparent assimilation efficiencies were lower than most nectar studies, and were generally higher for glucose fruit (79.3–85.6%) compared with sucrose fruit (69.0–78.4%).

These results are compared with data from the 1970s and 1980s in the same zones. Rodents were the most common prey (over 90%). Gerbillinae were most common in dry areas (84 to 96%) whereas in wetlands and rice fields murines were most common (77 to 88%). Nowadays, the genus Gerbillus constitutes the main prey in dry areas (77% to 88%). The genus Taterillus, which was the most abundant rodent in the Ferlo in the 1970s, now represents only 7% of rodents. Gerbils were not present in Senegal before the 1980s: G. tarabuli and G. henleyi were trapped for the first time in 1989 at the northern border of Senegal, and G. nigeriae 10 years later at the same place. The latter is now present a hundred kilometres southwards and as abundant in owl pellets as the two other gerbils.",

    "abstract": "Developmental plasticity results from environmental influences on the phenotype of an organism during its development, and its effects are irreversible. The phenomenon of phenotype-genotype uncoupling (plasticity) causes problems in species delineations, and has been suggested as a cause underlying a mismatch between morphology and genetics between the Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion thamnobates) and the KwaZulu dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion melanocephalum). The two species are morphologically distinct, but are very poorly distinguished genetically. It has been hypothesized that B. melanocephalum and B. thamnobates may be phenotypically plastic populations of the same species, since environmental conditions, the driving force behind developmental plasticity, varies between the distributions of these two allopatric taxa. We raised juveniles of both species under identical controlled laboratory conditions. Two treatments were used. These varied in both habitat structure and temperature, each approximating conditions that one of the species would encounter naturally. Although not specifically controlled or monitored, all other environmental factors (e.g. humidity, light and wind) were standardized since chameleons were raised in the artificial conditions created in environmental chambers. If taxa are developmentally plastic, phenotypes would reflect treatment conditions, irrespective of specific associations. Neither B. thamnobates nor B. melanocephalum were phenotypically plastic over the environmental differences tested; species developed into the expected phenotypes, irrespective of treatment conditions. The low genetic difference between B. thamnobates and B. melanocephalum may indicate their recent divergence from a common ancestor or the mitochondrial gene fragments (ND2 and 16S) used in previously published phylogenetic analyses of the genus may not be representative of divergence for the genome as a whole.",

The shoal has historically been heavily utilized by fishermen and SCUBA divers. In this study, a survey was undertaken to describe and zone the reef and its benthic communities in terms of topography, habitat types, species diversity, species richness and benthic cover. Data were collected using underwater photography and analysed by point intercept analysis. Three distinct benthic communities were identified using multivariate non-metric statistics. Benthic communities appeared to be influenced by topography, sediment cover and wave energy. The highest abundance of zooxanthellate hard corals and the encrusting zooxanthellate sponge, Suberites kelleri were found on the large shallow areas of the shoal. This suggested that light penetration to the elevated areas on the reef was adequate for photosynthesis and played a role in the distribution of its biota. The encrusting morphology of the sponge Suberites kelleri, and the branching morphology of the hard corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora spp., appeared to be tolerant of the high-energy environment near the surface. A second community was found only on steep edges of the Shoal and was characterized by a large abundance of Polychaeta and the soft coral Eleutherobia aurea, while a third community was found deeper on the offshore side of the shoal and consisted primarily of coralline and red foliose algae.Key words: subtropical reefalgal-dominated reefmarine protected areaAliwal ShoalSouth Africacommunity structure",

    "abstract": "The Algerian hedgehog Atelerix algirus is an insectivorous species. However, the exact composition of its natural diet remains largely undetermined, especially in relation to seasonal variations in food availability. From March to November, we simultaneously analysed the composition of 180 hedgehog faecal samples and food availability in the Soumman Valley, Algeria to assess food selection in this species. The faeces contained 196 different prey species, of which 92% belonged to the class Insecta. The highest prey species diversity was found in the Coleoptera order (100 species recorded) and the highest species occurrence was found in Hymenoptera (65% of the prey items, mainly represented by the harvester ant Messor barbarus, a crop-ravaging species). This study shows that the Algerian hedgehog is mainly a generalist species with a diet that is strongly linked to food availability. However, seasonal variations were observed in prey selection, and a notable shift in food preference was observed during autumn. The exact nature of these changes in feeding behaviour remains to be investigated, notably in relation to changes in energy requirements of this species before hibernation, in terms of quantity and/or quality.",

    "abstract": "DNA barcoding represents an objective tool for fast species identification, especially for taxa for which morphological identification is difficult. One current limitation of barcoding is the lack of reference sequences for many groups. While many European and North American countries have started their own barcoding initiatives to generate complete local inventories and databases, such efforts are sparse for African, Asian and South American countries, despite their high biodiversity and comparably poorly explored faunas. Therefore, it is important to start local barcoding efforts in such countries. In this study we performed DNA barcoding for the band-winged grasshoppers of the Biskra province in Algeria, a region of high diversity for this taxon. All specimens were identified morphologically and then barcoded. We generated a total of 47 sequences of the COI gene for 22 morphologically identified species of Oedipodinae, many of which were sequenced for the first time. We present the data in a phylogenetic tree, which suggests monophyly for most genera, but rejects it for Sphingonotus and Vosseleriana. Statistical species delimitation worked well for most genera, except those within the Sphingonotini, likely because these have radiated rather recently. Together with data sourced from the literature we used our new data set to generate an updated list of band-winged grasshoppers for the region. Several species are recorded for the region and for the country for the first time. One species appears to be new to science. Furthermore, we found geographic variation within several more widespread species for which data from other countries were present. We consider the new data as an important resource for future faunistic, ecological and biodiversity studies and point out the importance of local (taxon-specific) barcoding studies.",

Tree size was the primary determinant of oviposition at both the habitat (tall riverine-, medium height woodland- and short-shrub mopane) and individual tree scale, with an increase in the number of egg masses with increasing tree size (estimated by height and canopy volume). Preference for larger trees was only evident at the habitat scale, however, as individual trees were utilized as expected according to the availability of their canopy size class. More detailed tree characteristics, such as leaf size, shoot size, stem number and even leaf chemistry (protein:tannin ratio and total polyphenols) had no influence on host choice. Host choice was based on the most obvious measure of resource abundance, namely tree size, as expected for an outbreak species, since resource availability rather than nutritional quality is likely to be the primary determinant of larval survival.Key words: host choiceresource abundancetree sizeoutbreakoviposition",

A phylogenetic analysis including three mitochondrial (16S, cytb and COI) and one nuclear marker (BRCA) shows that C. g. nimbasilvanus is the sister taxon of C. nimbae, a species also endemic to West Africa. Crocidura g. goliath is part of the C. olivieri group and closely related to C. olivieri, C. viaria and C. fulvastra . Calculation of genetic distances between cytb sequences confirms this pattern (divergence of 13.5% between C. G. nimbasilvanus and C. G. goliath ). An analysis of 112 skulls using morphometric geometrics provides evidence of marked shape differences between the two taxa. Despite close external morphological resemblances, we found diagnostic external and craniodental characters between these two forms. We therefore propose to treat C. nimbasilvanus and C. goliath as distinct species. Similar morphological features exhibited by these two African giant forest shrews, especially their large size, may be the result of homoplasy due to convergent evolutionary pressure. We also investigated the phenotypic diversification in size and skull shape within C. goliath and discovered strong intraspecific variability.",

Formerly, the Arabian house bats were referred to similar-looking white-bellied S. leucogaster, which differs from S. dinganii mainly by the colour of ventral pelage. We reassessed the taxonomic status of house bats from southwestern Yemen using genetic and morphological analyses. The Yemeni specimens clustered within two distantly related mitochondrial lineages of African Scotophilus: East African S. aff. dinganii, which is a paraphyletic group to S. dinganii s.str. from South Africa, and West African S. leucogaster. This taxonomic assignation was based on published sequences of reference museum specimens. Differences in external and cranial measurements also indicated the presence of two distinct taxa in Yemen. The Yemeni and comparative Ethiopian populations of S. aff. dinganii showed close morphological similarity to the type specimen of S. nigrita colias from Kenya. Because the Yemeni and Ethiopian yellow-bellied house bats cannot be synonymized with S. dinganii, the designation S. colias is tentatively suggested for this particular East African and Yemeni lineage of the S. dinganii complex. However, final correspondence of this name with the respective populations or applicability of some of other available names must yet be explored. Based on environmental differences of the Yemeni localities of origin, S. colias appears to be ecologically delimited to mountainous habitats, while S. leucogaster to harsh lowland deserts. This is consistent with known habitats of African populations of both species.",

Both sexes grew at a similar rate until the onset of maturation, after which male growth and survival rates declined. Male mortality rate was significantly higher than estimated for females explaining both the older ages attained by females (12 years) compared to males (9 years) and a female-dominated adult population. Maturation proceeded faster in males than in females, but was considerably delayed in both age and length. Female reproductive contribution was double that of males despite males maturing a year earlier. Intraspecific life history comparisons with riverine and early impoundment populations suggest that L. capensis has largely maintained its riverine life history characteristics. These characteristics are common in large fishes that are well-adapted to seasonal riverine environments, but often show high vulnerability to damming or overfishing. The absence of a directed fishery and the availability of periodic floodplains that form when marginal vegetation is inundated by either the unregulated inflow of the Orange River or local erratic rains is suggested to have played a vital role for the successful establishment of L. capensis within the impoundment.",

To do so, we determined the most important climatic predictors of the geographical range of this species. Climatic data were obtained for 130 localities where O. cataphractus is known to occur and 168 adjacent localities where it is known to be absent. For each locality, data for 10 climatic variables were extracted from the South African Atlas of Agrohydrology and Climatology database. We constructed a forward stepwise logistic regression model of the probability of O. cataphractus occurrence, based on the set of 10 climatic variables. The best model included, in order of importance, average monthly summer rainfall, mean annual precipitation, average monthly solar radiation, and the ratio of winter rainfall over summer rainfall as most significant predictors. The selected model predicted 88.80% of the presences correctly and 85.52% of the absences. In essence, O. cataphractus is restricted to the winter rainfall zone of South Africa, excluding the high-rainfall southwestern section. We postulate that the highly predictable seasonal rainfall and the ameliorating effect of the Atlantic Ocean on climates in the Namaqualand region, in particular, have provided a unique selective regime for the origin of group-living in O. cataphractus. Dependence on M. viator as food source developed to survive the summer-autumn period of low food availability and resulted in the evolution of heavy armour and group-living behaviour. The moderate winters and early spring temperatures allowed full capitalization on high arthropod abundance during winter–spring, thereby overriding the negative impacts of armour and group-living on foraging efficiency at the home crevice.",

Reference intervals for these indices can facilitate wildlife management, and would benefit initiatives to save the Critically Endangered geometric tortoise (Psammobates geometricus). We collected data from 126 geometric tortoises to establish baseline values reflecting variation over four seasons (spring 2000 to winter 2001) and among three groups (female, male and juvenile). We measured body condition index (BCI; mass to shell volume), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), plasma chloride, packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration (Hb) and red blood cell count (RBC), and used PCV, Hb and RBC to calculate erythrocyte indices. BCI correlated poorly with haematological measures but had a strong inverse relationship with BUN. BCI did not vary among groups, but all groups had low condition indices in autumn, the end of the dry season. High BUN and chloride values in autumn indicate dehydration, particularly in males. Males had the highest PCV, Hb and RBC values, especially during summer and autumn when they moved long distances, likely pursuing mates. Female and juvenile indices were similar, except that female Hb was higher than juvenile Hb, possibly to meet female energy needs associated with their large size and reproductive metabolism. Low Hb levels in winter coincided with low temperatures and reduced movements. Our results illustrate how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence the physiology of geometric tortoises and provide reference intervals to monitor their health.",

Cormorants and herons were the dominant predators and seasonal variations in the avifaunal community composition were noted. Based on comprehensive counts over three years, the piscivorous bird population was estimated to have consumed a maximum of 4 414 kg of fish in 1994, 2 400 kg in 1995/96 and 2 960 kg in 2004/05. In 1995/96 fish production in the East Kleinemonde Estuary (55.89 g m−2 a−1) was estimated at 9 780 kg and maximum bird predation amounted to 25% of annual fish production within the system over the same period, assuming that all birds counted on the estuary foraged there and that the diet of these birds comprised only fish. The above 1995/96 figures, together with an estimate of fish predation by the dominant piscivorous fish Lichia amia of 696 kg suggests that birds are probably the single most important natural predator of fishes within this estuary. An unusual mass invasion by marine Cape Cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis during July 1994 was responsible for large-scale predation of fish (2 155 kg) and resulted in the population of estuary-associated marine fishes declining from approximately 63 300 to about 18 600 individuals during the 1994 closed phase. Given that little or no marine fish recruitment was possible while the estuary mouth was closed, piscivorous birds are likely to have a higher predatory impact on populations of juvenile marine fishes in small temporarily closed estuaries than in larger permanently open systems.",

    "abstract": "The increased rate of human-driven change is a major threat to biodiversity. Although there is sufficient evidence to suggest that species notably alter their ranges, facilitation of such movement for larger vertebrate species often places burdens on management agencies. Oribi antelope (Ourebia ourebi ourebi) in South Africa continue to experience dramatic decreases in range and numbers. Animals have and continue to be translocated for conservation, but also aesthetic and financial reasons. Initial translocations were done in the absence of any thought or understanding of genetic structure, while for the past two decades a conservative best-practice approach was adopted, but in the absence of any specific genetic information. Here, we use two mitochondrial and one nuclear fragment to report the phylogeographic structure in oribi antelope across South Africa. Our data indicate that the South African subspecies is distinct from other subspecies to the north, confirming that oribi in South Africa should be managed as a distinct conservation unit. Across the South African range, high genetic diversity is present with some evidence for genetic structure (phylogenetic trees and haplotype networks). However, there is no spatial component to the diversity (non-significant p-values in AMOVA analyses), possibly because of historic translocations. We evaluate translocation approaches currently in place, and make specific and general recommendations for future conservation management based on an improved understanding of population genetic diversity and genetic structure.",

The African Clawed Frog Xenopus laevis (Daudin, 1802) (Anura: Pipidae) is a global invader, with established populations on four continents and is a domestic exotic in southern Africa. Despite a century of parasitological surveys, the current study reports seven previously unrecorded nematode species parasitising X. laevis across South Africa. These are adult Capillaria sp. and Falcaustra sp. from the intestine, third stage larvae of Contracaecum sp. encysted in the body cavity, third stage larvae of Paraquimperia sp. and Tanqua sp. from the intestine and two different species of second stage nematode larvae from the lungs and kidneys, respectively. Morphological descriptions, photomicrographs and molecular data of the 18S and 28S rRNA and COI genes are provided to aid future investigations. We propose that these nematodes could well be using X. laevis as a definitive, paratenic and intermediate host, probably involving native fish, piscivorous birds, semi-aquatic reptiles and invertebrates in their life cycles. All recovered nematodes are recorded for the first time herein in association with X. laevis, except for the genus Contracaecum, members of which have previously been recorded from invasive X. laevis from California and Chile. The current study illustrates that X. laevis is an important parasite reservoir in its native range, with implications for its role in the invasive range. The fact that none of these nematodes could be identified to species level underscores the importance of provid ing morphological descriptions and molecular data when reporting on parasitological surveys, especially those of known invasive species.",

Unfortunately, mining produces large volumes of solid waste in the form of tailing disposal facilities (TDFs), which contain a variety of metals that are hazardous to the soil environment. The aim of this study was to use earthworm bioassays and avoidance-behaviour tests to assess the effects of gold mine tailings on soil organisms. Six random soil samples were taken from four different sites on a gold mine viz. two different TDFs and two grassy pasture sites. Earthworms (Eisenia andrei) were exposed for a period of 28 days to the soils from these different sites. Soil from the TDFs was also diluted to 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively. Soil chemical analysis showed that the TDFs had the lowest pH levels and that only Cr concentrations were higher than proposed benchmarks in two of the sites. Earthworms exposed to the TDF material showed significantly lower earthworm biomass, allied with a very low cocoon production. The avoidance-behaviour test showed similar results, where earthworms generally preferred natural and control soils over the TDF material. It can be concluded, that even though the gold mine was inactive for a long period of time, it still remains a highly contaminated area.",

It is therefore becoming increasingly necessary to develop methods for screening these materials for possible toxic effects. Behavioural analyses have proven to be a dependable and accurate measure of ecotoxicological risk factors. The aim of the current study was to investigate the toxicological effect of two types of nanomaterials (carbon- and metal-based) on zebrafish larvae. Individual larvae, seven days post fertilisation, were transferred to wells on 24-well plates containing OECD ISO fish media. Sections of the plate to be exposed were randomly arranged and incrementally dosed with sublethal stock concentrations of suspended CdTe (functionalised cadmium-tellurium) quantum dots (QDs) and nanodiamonds (NDs). Subsequently, the 24-well plate was loaded into a DanioVision® system and the behaviour of the larvae recorded for 12 h. The recordings were then analysed using Noldus™ EthoVision® software. Exposure to QDs affected various locomotor and behaviour endpoints over time, i.e. distance travelled, swimming speed, mobility and acceleration states. A significant increase in locomotor activity, coupled with erratic and hyperactive swimming bouts, were observed in zebrafish larvae exposed to QDs, a nanomaterial associated with cadmium dissolution toxicity. However, behaviour remained largely unaffected in zebrafish exposed to NDs. The results support the use of zebrafish in acute toxicological studies, as a result of its sensitivity to environmental toxins. Their relatively small size permits the use of multi-well plates to allow rapid, high-throughput screening of pollutants.",

We used unbaited pitfall traps over a 12-month period in four treatments of varying O. stricta density. Species richness, species density and abundance of beetles and spiders were compared. A total of 72 beetle and 128 spider species were collected. Species richness and species density for beetles and spiders did not differ significantly across the four treatments. Assemblages for spiders did not differ across treatments but beetle assemblages were significantly different from uninvaded control sites.

Analyses of time series data from five fishing methods between 1897 and 2011 provided trends in relative abundance. Of the 37 species found in False Bay, 25 showed no significant trends for any fishing method. Of the 12 species and two genera with catch trends, four showed a common trend across methods, two increasing (Mustelus mustelus and Carcharhinus brachyurus) and two decreasing (Galeorhinus galeus and Raja spp.), while another two species (Triakis megalopterus and Isurus oxyrinchus) showed highly significant declines in one method only. A productivity index was used in conjunction with information on species distribution, catch frequency and trends in abundance to assess the vulnerability of False Bay chondrichthyans. Among the various habitats and depth strata, the surf-zone has been most impacted by exploitation, whereas the conservation of deep-water, soft-sediment species has benefited from the ban on trawling in False Bay implemented in 1928. Continued monitoring using catch data from beach-seine, recreational shore-angling and the commercial linefishery is recommended, along with improved species identification.",

The mean times lions were inactive was similar between the three prides except when the ranch lions were severely disturbed and became more nocturnal and inactive. The reserve lions ate their kills on open plains and returned to them often but the ranch lions did so only inside bushes and abandoned unfinished kills during a drought in 2005. The reserve lions spent most of their time on open plains while the ranch lions did so in bushes and woodlands. Activity budgets were similar between the prides regardless of land use. Adult lions altered not so much the type but the spatial location and timing of their behaviour on the pastoral ranches relative to the reserve.We discuss the implications of these findings for lion conservation on pastoral lands.",

From 2008 to 2010 fish in the Okavango and Orange-Vaal River Systems were collected and dissected in order to determine the prevalence and intensity of larval trematode infections in the eyes and brains. This paper discusses the possible ecological factors which can influence the probability of certain fish species becoming infected with diplostomid cercariae and hence metacercariae. The feeding strategies and sizes of piscivorous birds, which could act as definitive hosts for the adult worms, are summarized and discussed.

This species exhibits extreme reproductive skew with a single breeding female whereas reproduction in subordinate group members is completely blocked. Rainfall, as it greatly facilitates burrowing, provides the opportunity for individuals to disperse from their natal colony and hence, to overcome reproductive suppression. However, because rainfall is scarce, optimal conditions for burrow system construction are restricted to very short periods of the year. In order to observe the construction of a new burrow system of dispersing individuals, I released a small group (two females, one male) following heavy rains, and monitored their burrowing activity in the form of mound production during the following weeks. Recapture revealed that a new male had joined the group. Over a period of one month the four individuals extruded 127 mole hills and constructed a tunnel system with a total length of approximately 100 metres. Mound production ceased after 30 days due to the lack of subsequent rain. The study provides an example of dispersal in Damaraland mole-rats and gives new insights into the method of burrow system construction of this species. It further highlights the high costs associated with dispersal.Key words: BathyergidaedispersalDamaraland mole-ratburrow systemreproductive suppression",

Daily food intake, daily gross energy intake, daily faecal energy loss, daily energy assimilated, daily water intake and apparent assimilation efficiency were calculated for each porcupine and for each diet trial. Cape porcupines maintained body mass on all three experimental diets and energy intake ranged from 3 002.36 kJ kg−1 d−1 (potato) to 4 499.00 kJ kg−1 d−1 (sweet potato). The moisture content in each experimental diet was relatively high (>60%) and preformed water intake of winter acclimated Cape porcupines ranged from 60 ml kg−1 d−1 (potato) to 100 ml kg−1 d−1 (sweet potato). Assimilation efficiencies were high (>85%) on all three diets. Cape porcupines ingested c. 1.5–2.7 kg of each crop daily, translating to potentially large economic impacts on farmers. Knowledge and understanding of Cape porcupine food intake and dietary requirements give insight to their potential impact on commercial crops.

Hence, in this study, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to investigate the possible effects of short-term exposure to ringing or talking cellphone modes on locomotor activity. Interestingly, an hour exposure to the cellphone ringing mode did not significantly affect the fly movement speed in the negative geotaxis assay. However, the flies exposed to sending or sending–receiving ringing modes showed disturbed movement paths compared with control flies. To verify these results, third-instar larvae were tested using a crawling assay. The larvae exposed to emissions of 1 h sending-rings tended to crawl in short, random and scattered paths, whereas control larvae crawled parallel to the wall of the petri dish. On the other hand, exposure to the cellphone talking mode induced significant reduction in the movement speed of adult Drosophila. The speed of flies exposed to sending mode showed a negative regression with the time of exposure. The flies exposed to receiving-talk mode were significantly slower than the controls at all tested time intervals. Furthermore, the flies exposed to 1 or 2 h sending-talks exhibited irritated zigzag locomotor paths and hyperactivity. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to signalling cellphone electromagnetic radiation may exert locomotor disorders as evident by significant alterations in the neuro-behavioural events related to locomotor equilibrium of D. melanogaster.Keywords: behaviourcellphone radiationlocomotionringing and talking modes",

Scorpion assemblages often exhibit higher levels of species diversity in dry habitats and are beneficial indicators in ecological studies in such environments. In this study, we investigated the effects of climatic and spatial predictors on beta diversity patterns among scorpion assemblages distributed in the drylands of Egypt. Scorpion occurrences were compiled from the scientific literature. For each location, we created a set of climatic variables related to precipitation, temperature, and solar irradiation, as well as spatial predictors. A total of 134 scorpion occurrences were obtained, comprising 21 species grouped into three families. Climatic and spatial variables together influenced the patterns of scorpion diversity in Egyptian landscapes. Species replacement accounted for 69% of the total beta diversity. In addition, species replacement was positively affected by climatic and spatial variables. Our results suggest a reciprocal link between the region's ecological history and the patterns of beta diversity observed in scorpion assemblages from Egyptian drylands.",

This view was recently challenged by von Hippel et al.

In this paper, I present evidence from my own more intensive study during the same period that suggests that the guereza population at Isecheno is actually quite robust and may in fact be increasing. I provide evidence to suggest that the census methods adopted by von Hippel and his colleagues are prone to overestimating density and that the decline in guereza density that they reported probably did not occur. My study suggests that brief censuses based on group counts over a given area, even when conducted by multiple observers, are not sufficient for accurately determining primate distributions and densities in rainforest environments. Data on animal distribution and density play a critical role in the development of conservation strategies and it is therefore important that these data be relatively accurate if biologists are to make informed conservation decisions.",

To date the description of calls published for A. tropicalis and A. gazella are fragmented and not easily compared. We compare the vocal signalling of males and females of the two species of fur seals to aid understanding of the factors involved in hybridization. Five call types were compared: barking, guttural challenges and territorial calls emitted by adult males; the pup attraction call used by adult females and the response: female attraction call emitted by pups. The calls emitted by males of the two species have certain similarities but are separated by multivariate analyses. By contrast, the calls of females and pups of the two species are more similar and do not cluster separately. Since many of the differences in male calls are audible to the human ear, female seals can presumably also hear these differences and we suggest that interbreeding of the two fur seal taxa is not caused by similarity in male vocal communication. Following this preliminary study, further behavioural studies are required for a fuller understanding of hybridization in these animals.",

Other material collected from near Pietermaritzburg in 1988/89 by the late J.O. Wirminghaus was also analysed. A minimum of 38 micromammalian species was identified, with notable range extensions being recorded for Crocidura fuscomurina and Tatera leucogaster and new localities for all other species. These samples have also added to the numbers of insectivore and rodent species known to occur in the Drier and Moist Upland bioregions. General diversity appears to be much lower in the Coastal Hinterland bioregion but this is probably due to human disturbance of the vegetation near the collecting sites. The samples further illustrate the usefulness of data collection from barn owls for biodiversity studies in particular.",

When they surface, which is not necessarily daily, it is often for only a few minutes or hours. Is the decision to bury or emerge determined by thermal benefits or optimization of water vapour pressure relationships or other factors? We evaluated this question by measuring temperature and relative humidity above and below the sand in dunes near Gobabeb continuously over 24 h, and calculating the vapour pressure difference between a hypothetical beetle and its surroundings. When beetles emerged, temperatures were available such that buried beetles could have attained their preferred body temperature, of 36 to 40i?½C, and avoided solar radiation. Desiccation stress on the beetles was also greater above surface during the day when they emerged, and greater below surface at night, when they were buried. We conclude that it is neither the need to attain preferred body temperature nor the need to prevent desiccation that induces the beetles to emerge or bury.",

The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve indicated that A. berda in northern KwaZulu-Natal is a slowgrowing species, capable of reaching at least 16 years of age.

They also had a high sequence differentiation in a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene (pairwise divergence 8.6 %), while all other populations were genetically rather uniform. This Tsaratanana population is described as the new species Mantidactylus zavona; it is also morphologically distinct from the sympatric M. granulatus in that it has a smaller body and a shorter, wider head. The relatively small differences between M. granulatus from different sites in northern Madagascar (pairwise 16S divergences up to 1.4 %), including the isolated Montagne d’Ambre, supports a biogeographic scenario in which the lowland rainforests in this area were connected in Pliocene Pleistocene times. By contrast, the presence of endemic species at higher altitudes of the Tsaratanana Massif may be seen as evidence for a longer isolation of the habitats at these elevational levels.",

I studied the body condition, diet, behaviour and moult intensity of whitefaced whistling ducks prior to departure for breeding areas during spring 1995. Other than higher protein levels in immature males than immature females, there were no sexual differences in body mass or levels of lipid, protein, or ash in adults or immatures. Adults were heavier than immatures and had higher levels of ash. There were no sex- or age-related differences in the proportion of individual food items consumed, 96.6% of which was maize. By foraging on neighbouring agricultural fields, birds were able to spend large portions (80%) of the day/night in comfort-related activities (preen, loaf, sleep) and little time foraging (8.8%) while on ponds. There were no sex- or age-related differences in overall moult intensity score or intensity of moult in 20 feather areas. With exception of primaries and secondaries, birds were moulting moderately to heavily in all feather regions. Agricultural ponds permit whitefaced whistling ducks to overwinter close to breeding areas, while the high availability and energy content of maize enables them to attain higher spring fat levels than birds that overwinter on traditional sites closer to the coast. Intensive agriculture has probably contributed to the population increase and range expansion of white-faced whistling ducks in South Africa.",

Mean mussel cover, length, biomass and bed depth were all low in the southeast (former Transkei). Faunal abundance and biomass were minimal along the south coast, increasing up both west and east coasts. Species diversity and richness showed the reverse trends, peaking at south coast sites and dropping off to the west and east. Multivariate analysis grouped the faunal communities into four distinct clusters, corresponding to the recognized Namib, Namaqua, Agulhas and Natal biogeographical provinces. The low mussel biomass and cover in the Eastern Cape can be attributed to intense human exploitation, but the low faunal abundance and biomass along the south coast was unexpected, as was the negative correlation between faunal abundance and diversity. Over recent decades intense exploitation has resulted in marked declines in mussel cover along the east coast, while the M. galloprovincialis invasion has resulted in dramatic increases in mussel cover to the west. The results given here indicate how these changes might have affected the wider intertidal communities in these regions.Key words: biogeographySouth Africamusselsinvasive species",

No strong correlations between the ichthyofauna and recorded physico-chemical parameters were documented, although temperature did show a weak correlation to demersal fish distributions. A second sampling programme undertaken in 2004 was specifically designed to test the influence of sedimentary characteristics on the distribution patterns of the dominant demersal species. Analyses showed that sediment size composition and organic content was strongly correlated (r = 0.70) to the distribution of the soles Solea bleekeri and Heteromycteris capensis, as well as the goby Glossogobius callidus. S. bleekeri and G. callidus showed a preference for the muddier middle and upper reaches of the Kariega Estuary channel, whereas H. capensis and Psammogobius knysnaensis were more abundant in the sandier lower reaches and mouth region of the estuary. The exact reasons for these preferences are unknown but are likely to be related to preferred prey availability, foraging success and predator avoidance in the different types of sediment. Other species caught in the otter trawl were not significantly correlated to sedimentary characteristics.",

We recorded body temperature (Tb)) in speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus) under semi-natural conditions in outdoor aviaries, and examined interactions between behavioural and metabolic thermoregulation by experimentally manipulating food availability and communal roosting behaviour. When food was available ad libitum, mousebirds roosting in a cluster maintained approximately constant rest-phase Tb, with 32°C < Tb < 42°C. By contrast, rest-phase Tb in single mousebirds decreased at 0.5°C/hr and minimum rest-phase Tb was significantly lower than when clustering. When food availability was restricted, the mousebirds exhibited facultative hypothermic responses that were less pronounced in clustering groups (minimum rest-phase Tb = 33.3°C, circadian amplitude of Tb = 9.5°C) compared to single birds (minimum rest-phase Tb = 30.7°C, circadian amplitude of Tb = 11.8°C). When clustering, rest-phase Tb was highly synchronized among individuals. Our data reveal that communal roosting has profound consequences for rest-phase thermoregulation in C. striatus, and provide further insights into the potential role of physiological constraints in the evolution of avian sociality.",

Over this period, the pride consisted of between four and 11 lions with a paired coalition of adult males during the first three years and a single adult male for the next three years. We recorded shorter than normal interbirth intervals, high birth rates of 1.3 cubs/lioness/year, very high cub survival rates, and subadults leaving the pride at young ages. This translated into substantially faster growth rates than are typical in large lion populations in ecologically similar circumstances such as Kruger National Park, but are similar to those of lions in Serengeti National Park. These demographic characteristics were probably induced initially by a lack of intense intraspecific competition and high prey availability, but population stability was maintained through the removal of young subadults by management. Interestingly, variability in conception rates between lionesses resulted in lower growth rates than have been found in other similar reintroduced lion populations. These demographic traits characterize many of the small reintroduced lion populations, and call for appropriate management to avoid the consequences of high predator densities.Key words: birth rateinter-birth intervalintraspecific competitionpride sizesmall enclosed reserves",

The young of the year in the littoral zone were rapidly depleted and resultant estimates of the instantaneous rate of total mortality (Z) ranged from 5.4/yr to 6.9/yr. High annual rates of juvenile mortality and small adult populations imply that stock recovery after a reduction in adult population numbers, through activities such as fishing, may be slow.

Five habitat types (white sand bushveld, brown sand bushveld, general mixed bushveld, rocky outcrops and mopane woodland) within the Greater Makalali Conservancy, Limpopo Province, South Africa, were studied using four successful sampling methods (active searching of two types of quadrats, pitfall traps and drive transects) during three sampling periods between February 1999 and March 2000. Millipedes were consistently the most species rich and abundant taxon. Species were not uniformly distributed across all habitat types; some species were unique to certain habitats. Generally, the more heterogeneous habitats supported the greatest millipede, centipede and scorpion diversity, richness and density, and in the case of the millipedes contained the highest number of regional endemics and habitat specialists. There was no significant difference in scorpion diversity among habitats.",

Salinity had no significant effect on oxygen consumption at 12.5 and 20°C in both large and small crabs. At 30°C and 44°, however, the rate of oxygen consumption declined in large crabs (from 0.233 to 0.176 mg O2 g wwt/h) and increased in small crabs (0.300 to 0.469 mg O2 g wwt/h). There was also a significant increase in the oxygen consumption (0.300 to 0.536 mg O2 g wwt/h) of small crabs at the high temperature/low salinity combination. Temperature had a significant effect on the rate of oxygen consumption at all salinities, with Q10 values ranging from 1.16 to 2.85. In all cases the mass-specific oxygen consumption rate of small crabs was higher than that of large crabs. The results suggest that the confinement of this species to the lower reaches of estuaries may, in part, be due to physiological constraints on juveniles and small individuals.Key words: estuarine crabaquatic metabolism",

Pristurus samhaensis from the small islands of Samha (n = 18) and Darsa (n = 24) and P. sokotranus from the main island of Socotra (n = 40) were compared. Like other Pristurus species, P. samhaensis on Samha and P. sokotranus on Socotra were highly myrmecophagous (76.7% and 38.6% ants, respectively). However, ants were absent from the diet of P. samhaensis on Darsa. In contrast to the rich native ant fauna of the other islands, only one ant species was reported for Darsa, Pheidole teneriffana, likely a recently introduced species. Pristurus samhaensis seems to have overcome this scarcity in ant prey by consuming substitute prey, namely Coleoptera and Heteroptera, which are secondary for the other two populations studied. The two P. samhaensis populations inhabiting the small islands displayed less diverse diets compared to that of P. sokotranus from the main island where vegetation structure was more complex. Prey items of P. samhaensis from Darsa were also smaller than those of P. sokotranus from Socotra, those of P. samhaensis from Samha being intermediate. It remains unclear how ancient these differences are, but they are probably too recent to have promoted special morphological and ecological adaptations in these geckos.Key words: Trophic ecologyMyrmecophagyGekkonidaePristurus samhaensisPristurus sokotranusSocotra",

Both species were temperature sensitive, with Q10 (14–28) of 1.82 and 2.07, respectively. A significant positive relationship (P =0.03) between salinity and oxygen consumption was determined for D. sargus capensis, but not for C. caffer. The RMR values were significantly higher (P < 0.01) for D. sargus capensis compared to C. caffer at all temperatures and at all salinities, except 5 PSU. This was attributed to the different biologies of the two species, C. caffer being a bottom-dwelling species and D. sargus capensis a mid-water species. It is suggested that the decreased temperature sensitivity and euryhaline characteristics of C. caffer compared to D. sargus capensis, would allow the former to more effectively penetrate the upper intertidal zone.",

    "abstract": "Baits or lures are commonly used for surveying small mammal communities, not only because they attract large numbers of these animals, but also because they provide sustenance for trapped individuals. In this study we used Sherman live traps with five bait treatments to sample small mammal populations at three high-altitude sites (>1700 m) in the Sneeuberg Mountain Complex of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.We investigated the influence of bait treatment on three parameters commonly recorded in small mammal surveys. In addition, we investigated how different bait treatments vary in measuring species richness using the Chao 2 species richness estimator together with rarefaction curves. Overall, 12 small mammal species were sampled. A combination of birdseed and banana captured the highest number of species (11) but the most successful bait overall was peanut butter and oats (greatest number of captures, recaptures, number of individuals and highest Shannon diversity). The Chao 2 richness estimator indicated that four of the five bait treatments reached their sampling capacity. Rarefaction curves indicated that all bait treatments are similar with regard to species accumulation. This could possibly be explained by odours left behind in traps as even un-baited traps (i.e. controls) captured seven different small mammal species. We conclude that the most suitable bait for surveying small mammals at high altitude in South Africa is peanut butter and oats. However, using peanut butter and oats in combination with other bait treatments will improve estimates of diversity when surveying small mammal communities.",

In support of niche partition hypothesis, diets of western kob and waterbuck diverged significantly along both faecal selection axes (δ13C and δ15N) during the resource-limited period of the dry season as opposed to wet season when there is resource abundance. Western kob and waterbuck resource partitioning does not occur only on the basis of diet segregation but also some habitat variables play an important role in the coexisting system. Findings support the niche partition hypothesis, where morphologically, ecologically and closely related sympatric species segregate at least in one of the niche dimensions to allow coexistence. The two bovid species were observed to diverge largely along distance to water source gradient. The results provided empirical evidence that habitat features acts as an additional dimension over which herbivores partition resources.",

In contrast, we found no evidence of an effect of group size or vegetation structure on the distance that ungulates were seen from man-made structures.

There was no significant difference in admissions of motor vehicle collision cases between seasons. People generally waited 3.8 days before bringing injured raptors in to the centre, and approximately half of the birds admitted were fed within that time, highlighting a need for public education regarding the general diets of raptors and the benefits of prompt medical attention.",

In this study, the diet of two rodent pest species, Mastomys natalensis and Gerbilliscus vicinus, coexisting in fallow land in central Tanzania were studied to assess the degree of diet differentiation among them. Dietary niche breadth of G. vicinus was greater than that of M. natalensis in all stages of the maize cropping seasons. The rodent species studied overlapped considerably in the food items consumed ranging from niche overlap (Ojk) of 0.77–0.89. Grains/seeds featured high in the diet of M. natalensis while plant material occurrence was high in G. vicinus. These two food categories may have contributed to differences in diet partitioning, which may, in turn, facilitate their coexistence in fallow land.",

A total of three focal groups (used in published works) and two non-focal groups were assessed. These focal groups, including two laboratory cultures and one field population, have been referred to as Eisenia fetida in the literature. A previous molecular study had already helped to establish that one of the two laboratory groups was a population of E. fetida's sister species E. andrei. In the present contribution, analyses of the COI gene revealed that the taxonomy of the remaining laboratory and field populations had also been incorrectly assigned since all the generated sequences grouped unequivocally with published sequences of E. andrei. Very high sequence divergence (>25% K2P) found within E. andrei could signal the occurrence of hitherto undescribed cryptic species. These findings are discussed with an emphasis on the possible consequences of using poorly identified earthworms or specimens with high molecular divergence in ecotoxicological bioassays. It is not clear whether unbeknownst to the researchers, the use of cryptic species in bioassays could jeopardise the quality of ecotoxicological investigations. Early evidence suggests that cryptic oligochaete species may respond differently to metal toxicity. The need for comparative ecotoxicological studies between E. andrei and E. fetida is also evidenced, especially in the light of recent numerous reports of cryptic oligochaete species. Ecotoxicologists are consequently encouraged, whenever possible, to make use of available genomic technologies to screen their laboratory stocks and available field populations for any molecular distinctiveness.",

In order to assess whether these animals possess an endogenous rhythm of locomotor activity that entrains to the light:dark cycle, they were subjected to three distinct light cycles: an LD cycle (12 h light/12 h dark), a DD cycle (constant darkness) and a DL light cycle (an inverse of the LD light cycle). All eight individuals studied exhibited entrainment of their activity to the light cycles. Under LD, the total percentage of activity during the dark phase was 93.7 ± 1.8%. Activity was distributed throughout the night (mean peak activity 22:46 ± 0:14). All eight animals expressed distinct endogenous free-running rhythms of locomotor activity (mean τ = 23:55 ± 0:36). During constant darkness, animals still displayed more activity during the subjective night (75.6 ± 0.4%). Under the DL light cycle, the total percentage of activity was 92.7 ± 1.8% during the dark phase. In conclusion, the daily locomotor activity rhythm of Wagner's gerbil is strongly entrained by the light:dark cycle with the most activity concentrated during the night and consequently this desert-dwelling mammal may thus be considered truly nocturnal.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIncreasing urbanization and industrialization along the coastal areas of False Bay in South Africa can endanger coastal ecosystems because of increasing metal pollution. To obtain baseline data on contamination levels in the intertidal zone, cadmium (Cd) body loads of four invertebrate species were measured seasonally over a period of 15 months from different sites within the bay. Specimens of Tetraclita serrata (barnacle), Oxystele sinenses (periwinkle), Cymbula oculus (limpet) and Choromytilus meridionalis (mussel) were collected and analysed to determine temporal changes in Cd body burdens. Cd concentrations were also measured in water and sediments. Cd concentrations in the intertidal animals varied considerably between sampling sites and between seasons and also occasionally between species. All four species accumulated Cd in their bodies to levels several times higher than environmental concentrations. No significant difference could be shown between the Cd concentrations in the gastropod grazers and the filter-feeders. The highest mean body load of Cd (70.67 μg/g dry weight) for a single sampling occasion was measured in the sessile barnacles (T. serrata) collected at Rooi-Els. The highest mean Cd concentration (11.95 μg/g) for the bay as a whole was measured in the limpet C. oculus. Two-way analysis of variance indicated that spatial (location) rather than temporal (seasonal) factors affected Cd concentrations in the invertebrates. Cd concentrations in False Bay sometimes exceeded the norms or water quality standards.Key words: Cdinvertebrate body burdensmarine pollutionseasonal variations",

    "abstract": "The redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus is a recent introduction into Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe where it is rapidly spreading. There are, however, no studies that have investigated the population dynamics and possible ecological impacts of the crayfish in the lake. This study investigated aspects of the population biology of C. quadricarinatus in the lake. These included sex distribution, population growth and mortality parameters, probability of capture, recruitment and length at age of ge at maturity. Crayfish were captured monthly between January and December 2013 from 13 sites using opera house bait traps. Aspects of the species population biology were estimated using a fish stock assessment tool, FISAT II. A total of 3 205 crayfish were captured, of which 44% were male, 49% female and 7% intersex individuals. The asymptotic length (L∞ = 112.88 mm), curvature parameter (k = 0.72), longevity (tmax = 4.17 years), growth performance index (ϕ = 3.96), total mortality (Z = 2.06 y−1), fishing mortality (F = 1.07 y−1), natural mortality (M = 0.99 y−1), rate of exploitation (E = 0.52) and length-at-first capture (Lc = 44.48 mm) were estimated. Fecundity averaged 503 ± 229 eggs female−1 and increased with size (weight and carapace length). Gravid females were found throughout the year but the highest proportion of females with eggs (4–10%) were found in the first quarter, whereas recruitment peaked in May and June. The smallest crayfish with eggs (48.75 mm CL) was estimated to be 1.02 years and the largest (94.82 mm CL) 2.85 years. Cherax quadricarinatus exhibited an r strategy life-history pattern due to continuous reproduction and high fecundity. In Lake Kariba, C. quadricarinatus is now well into the establishment stage of the Introduction–naturalisation–invasion continuum and spreading in the lake. Management options should thus aim at preventing further spread and reducing the population size and the potential negative impacts of this species.",

    "abstract": "The spatial genetic structure of a species, and whether distinct genetic lineages are present, is strongly influenced by their biology and habitat requirements. Given habitat specificity and low vagility, many herpetofaunal species are reservoirs for high levels of cryptic diversity; chameleons are a case in hand. The common flap-necked chameleon Chamaeleo dilepis has a large range that spans much of sub-Saharan Africa. Within South Africa, the species is largely confined to the north-eastern and central areas of the country, and occurs from the coastal forests in southern KwaZulu-Natal westwards into Namibia. Their large range, together with anecdotal evidence that there is considerable morphological and phenotypic diversity across the range, suggests a questionable taxonomy with possible cryptic lineages. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether C. dilepis is genetically structured across parts of its South African range, and whether this species (as it currently stands) might include cryptic lineages. To this end, 72 C. dilepis individuals sampled from four localities across South Africa (Gauteng, n = 2; KwaZulu-Natal, n = 2) were sequenced for two mitochondrial markers (ND4 and 16S). The phylogenetic results suggest that C. dilepis is indeed spatially structured. In addition, the large sequence divergence values between groups strongly suggests the presence of cryptic lineages and, pending the inclusion of more data from a larger geographic range, the group may be in need of a taxonomic revision.",

    "abstract": "Utilisation of food resources in migrant and resident birds living sympatrically often leads to differences in feeding strategy. For sit-and-wait hunters such as shrikes, it is connected with competition for food and hunting places. In this study, foraging behaviour of three shrike species was studied in savanna-like habitat in southern Africa. The fieldwork was carried out in December 2017 during wintering season of Lesser Grey Shrike Lanius minor and Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio and breeding season of Common Fiscal Lanius collaris. Details of the bird's behaviour were recorded during 30 min observations of each bird. A general linear mixed model with logit link function and binomial error variance was used to compare the species' behaviour. Although the type of perch-site and perching time did not differ between species, Red-backed Shrike used places situated significantly lower than other shrikes. This species also more often used bushes and attacked from lower perch-sites than Lesser Grey Shrike. This may possibly be due to interspecific competition and antipredator behaviour of Red-backed Shrike. No differences in foraging behaviour between Common Fiscal and Lesser Grey Shrike were observed. All three species utilised the same category of prey. Hunting success (the ratio of successful to all attacks) was low and similar in all three species (47%–57%). The lack of statistically significant differences in behaviour, hunting success and size of prey items among shrike species may be a consequence of the relatively short observation time and small sample sizes.",

Information on brown hyaena diets is important for understanding the degree of potential conflict with farming livelihoods and exploring diet variation across their range and how this might shift in response to land use change. Here we explore the diet of brown hyaena on a game reserve in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. We collected scats in 2013 (n = 55) and 2018 (n = 73) from Zingela Game Reserve to identify mammalian prey based on the cuticular scale imprints and cross-sectional appearance of hairs found in scat. Artiodactyls were most frequently consumed (total relative frequency of occurrence = 69.6%), dominated by common duiker Sylvicapra grimmia and steenbok Raphicerus campestris. Smaller prey were also common with Rodentia appearing in 15.8% of scats, although for all prey items there was some variation between years. We found only one occurrence of a domestic species in scats (donkey Equus africanus). Set alongside other studies from across southern Africa the results illustrate that brown hyaena are flexible in their diet and that domestic animals generally only represent a very small proportion of their diet.",

However, national bird atlases are undertaken in different ways in different countries, usually with little formal assessment of alternatives. Existing research suggests that the differences in accuracy between line and point transects are influenced by context, habitat and other details of the sampling protocol. To determine the best approach to use for southern Africa, where collection of data for atlases must cope with a wide range of field conditions, we compared data from a point-count approach to data from line transects on 302 routes in 19 South African National Parks. Data were analysed using paired sample tests, linear models, qualitative assessment and a Bayesian multispecies occupancy model to estimate species richness, while accounting for imperfect detection. On average, five more bird species were recorded along a route using point counts, even though the line transects covered three times more area. There was no obvious difference in the kinds of species recorded. Occupancy models showed that point counts consistently and substantially outperformed transects in estimating species richness. In transects, low detection probability leads to highly biased and imprecise estimates. For almost identical observer effort, standardised point counts along a route provided significantly higher quality data than transects.",

Accurate population data that can inform management is, however, outdated, whereas demand for bloodworm continues or is even increasing. This study provides genetic data on the population structure of A. loveni sampled at seven sites in the Western Cape and one in the Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) data indicate that the population forms two lineages that should be managed separately: a western lineage that contains mostly samples from Saldanha Bay and a southern lineage that contains samples from the south coast (Muizenberg to Swartkops). High haplotypic, but low nucleotide diversity for the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and COI genes, suggest that populations from both lineages have a recent common ancestry. Low pairwise Fixation index (Fst) values among most populations on the south coast, and common haplotypes shared among localities, indicate some degree of connectivity among populations. The presence of many private haplotypes at each site, however, indicates that local populations also rely heavily on regional recruitment. Gene flow among populations, and the absence of this between the western and southern lineages, is most likely attributed to larval dispersal facilitated by the predominant oceanic circulation patterns. These results suggest that although individual populations may be protected against local extinction through recruitment from elsewhere, reliance on local recruits may render populations vulnerable should baiting pressure increase.",

Twenty-four murid rodents were sampled from pet shops in four of the five municipalities in Gauteng Province, South Africa for genetic identification using mitochondrial cytochrome b (mtDNA) sequence data. Distance-based Neighbour-Joining (NJ), character-based maximum likelihood (ML) and model-based Bayesian inference (BI) were used to infer the relationship between the pet murid rodents. Brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus musculus) were the most dominant species in the pet shops. The results demonstrated that pet shop owners lacked the taxonomic expertise to identify murid rodent species they trade in. For example, the juveniles of brown rats were misidentified as adults of the house mouse. The murid rodents sampled in the current study were genetically affiliated to both wild and laboratory strains of R. norvegicus and M. musculus. The results of the BI showed that the pet murid rodents were in the terminal clades as those of conspecifics in NCBI GenBank reference sequences. The molecular data used in the current study may be useful for developing national policies and regulations for synanthropic invasive murid rodents in the pet trade industry in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchies are prevalent in social animals and display of aggression by dominant individuals often results in appetite and growth suppressions in lower-ranked fish. This study investigated the effects of dominance hierarchies on growth and some physiological responses in Nile tilapia (mass range: 120–300 g). Fish were grouped based on body mass into three classifications of one dominant and three subordinates (1D:3S), two dominants and two subordinates (2D:2S) and four equal-sized (4ES) individuals, and each grouping was triplicated. Rates of aggressive interactions under conditions of food deprivation, hypoxia and increased temperature stressors were also assessed. The 4ES treatment was characterised by more frequent aggressive interactions, compared with the other groupings. The number of lost scales recovered from the different groups after 24 h of group formations were significantly higher in the 1D:3S group. Food deprivation resulted in progressively increasing rates of aggressive interactions up to 48 h, but decreased at 72 h in all treatments. Feed intake for the 4ES group was significantly higher for than the other groups, because access to feed was largely unrestricted for all individuals. The lower-ranked individuals in the 1D:3S and 2D:2S groups had lower growth rates, compared with the dominants. Subordinate fish under treatment 1D:3S and dominant individuals in 2D:2S had elevated mean red blood cells, haemoglobin, haematocrit and white blood cell counts relative to other fish. Although aggression counts were highest in the 4ES group, the results of this study provide evidence ensuring homogeneous weights improve feed intake and growth in Nile tilapia.",

We investigated the feeding ecology of a small number of marsh mongooses living next to a small, non-permanent reservoir (Andries Vosloo Kudu Nature Reserve, Eastern Cape), where freshwater crabs were not available. Using a combined metric of the percentage of occurrence and the percentage volume of food remains in 133 scats collected from 2006–2009, no primary prey could be detected. Amphibians, mammals, arthropods and fish all acted as secondary prey. Plants supplemented the diet, whereas birds only occurred as trace foods. There were seasonal variations in the diet, with peaks in amphibian (spring), arthropod (summer) and fish (autumn) consumption contributing to the change. Dietary diversity and niche breadth were relatively high throughout the year. This study strongly suggests that the marsh mongoose is in fact a generalist opportunist feeder. Although it consumes crabs and other aquatic prey in areas where they are particularly abundant, it can adapt to local food availability and include a significant proportion of terrestrial prey in its diet.",

Berega has a distinct unimodal rainfall pattern, with most rainfall from November to April/May. We hypothesized that breeding of rodents in central Tanzania would be confined to the wet season, when unlimited resources would be available for reproduction. We provide evidence of breeding discontinuity in the three species, showing that breeding was seasonally restricted to the wet season and early in the dry season. The observed discontinuity could largely be ascribed to variation in primary productivity between the wet and dry seasons. Reproductively active females were found in the population as early as November, a month into the rainy season, but when early rains occurred, some individuals were already breeding in October. Breeding was more intensive in the latter part of the wet season (March–May) and completely ceased during the dry season. For M. natalensis, survival was highest in the wet period and low in the dry season. The study provides knowledge on the breeding dynamics of rodents in central Tanzania, which can help farmers to take proactive rodent management decisions to prevent high rodent densities and reduce crop damage in the fields. Application of control measures by the community early in the season when populations of reproductive females is lowest will be most rewarding.",

However, risk of predation facing an organism is dependent on various biotic and abiotic factors. In order to better understand escape behaviour of an African snake, the Namaqua dwarf adder (Bitis schneideri), I simulated predatory attacks on 51 free-ranging snakes, quantifying whether or not they fled. Additionally I measured body size, sex, body condition, and the surface temperature of the location of each snake, as well as the situation (buried or active on the surface) of the snake. I used generalized logistic regression to assess which variables predicted whether the snake fled during/following the simulated attack or not. Surface temperature was significantly associated with a flight-response, with warmer snakes more likely to flee than cooler snakes. Buried snakes were less likely to flee than snakes that were active on the surface. These findings generally support optimal escape theory in that both factors are strongly linked to risk of predation: temperature is likely to influence sprint performance, while situation is likely to influence the detectability of the snake to predators.",

Cd concentrations in the intertidal animals varied considerably between sampling sites and between seasons and also occasionally between species. All four species accumulated Cd in their bodies to levels several times higher than environmental concentrations. No significant difference could be shown between the Cd concentrations in the gastropod grazers and the filter-feeders. The highest mean body load of Cd (70.67 μg/g dry weight) for a single sampling occasion was measured in the sessile barnacles (T. serrata) collected at Rooi-Els. The highest mean Cd concentration (11.95 μg/g) for the bay as a whole was measured in the limpet C. oculus. Two-way analysis of variance indicated that spatial (location) rather than temporal (seasonal) factors affected Cd concentrations in the invertebrates. Cd concentrations in False Bay sometimes exceeded the norms or water quality standards.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMany protected areas in Africa and elsewhere suffer from several external pressures making it difficult for management to set priorities. For example, aerial censuses show that many mammal populations in the Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem of western Tanzania are declining. Vehicle transect data collected from 1995 to 2011 and presented here confirm many of these declines within Katavi National Park itself. Two factors are believed to be adversely affecting large mammals in this national park: (i) reduced water flow caused by local damming of the Katuma River, for rice cultivation upstream of the park, and (ii) poaching. We used transect data, anti-poaching records and timing of dam emplacements to examine the importance of these factors for 23 species of mammalian herbivores and carnivores as well as two combinatorial measures of mammal species’ abundances. Controlling for rainfall, we found that the number of mammals counted per year was associated with both poaching and dams, the importance of which depended on the species. Both factors appear to be adversely affecting mammal populations in Katavi National Park and we make recommendations to both management and policy makers for tackling these problems. More generally, our study shows that wildlife managers of protected areas in the developing world can readily collect information on wildlife trends and basic ecology and can use them for conservation planning.Key words: Africaanti-poachinghydrologyillegal huntingmammal population changesmanagementwater flow",

Recently, an intraleucocytic haemogregarine was observed in one species of tortoise, Stigmochelys pardalis, from the province of KwaZulu-Natal. Gamonts were identified in the monocytes and lymphocytes of 5/126 (4%) S. pardalis, but no additional stages were detected. Mixed infections with H. fitzsimonsi were observed for 2/5 (40%) of the parasitized S. pardalis, but the intraleucocytic gamont stages were larger than the intraerythrocytic gamont stages of both H. fitzsimonsi and H. parvula. The only other record of a chelonian intraleucocytic haemogregarine is of Haemogregarina pseudemydis, with stages described from the red and white blood cells of neotropical terrapins. Thus, the report of an intraleucocytic haemogregarine infecting a terrestrial tortoise from Africa is significant, although its taxonomic placement remains problematic at present.Key words: intraleucocytichaemogregarinetortoise blood parasiteSouth Africanapicomplexan taxonomy",

In Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), diet and a homogenous environment have been shown to affect nestmate recognition by altering the CHC profile and consequently intraspecific aggression. In our study, Argentine ants were collected from field nests representing two supercolonies in South Africa. Individuals were paired in aggression assays and their CHC profiles analysed. The same nests used in the aggression assays were maintained in the laboratory for five months on a shared diet of crickets and sugar water, in soil-free nests. We predicted that aggression between previously aggressive paired individuals from different nests would decrease over time through the homogenisation of CHCs as a consequence of the shared diet and similar nesting environment. Our data showed that ants maintained in the laboratory readily absorbed prey-derived hydrocarbons and experienced a loss in the number of cuticular compounds compared with their original CHC profiles. However, the changes in CHCs did not impair nestmate recognition with non-aggressive paired interactions maintained while previously aggressive paired interactions persisted. The persistence of aggression between previously aggressive pairs despite environmental homogeneity supports the notion that intrinsic nestmate recognition cues are not overridden by extrinsic cues in the recognition system of Argentine ants.",

Firstly, a preference for a certain demographic class results in selective predation by a predator. Secondly, different demographic classes exhibit varied behaviour and thus susceptibility to predation risk. To test these mechanisms, a study was conducted on Samara Private Game Reserve to investigate the potential impact cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) predation has had on the kudu (Tragelaphus strepciseros) population. Kudu age and sex data were collected across both predator-present and predator-absent sections using a spotlight-count method. Results suggest that juvenile kudu and subadult male kudu are selectively hunted by cheetah. This was reflected in significantly lower proportions of these two demographic classes within the predator-present section (both 6.0%, respectively) compared with the predator-absent section (16.8% and 17.4%, respectively). These findings indicate that the shift in the demographics of the kudu population within Samara could be explained by a combination of these two mechanisms.",

We examined home range size, activity periods, habitat selectivity and refuge site selection of 13 individuals over three years in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa, near the western edge of the species’ range. Kernel home ranges of adults averaged 6.5 ± 5.9 km2, while juveniles had average home ranges of 6.1 ± 4.0 km2. Reliable prediction of 95% of the Kernel home range required 88 ± 67.7 tracking days. No significant habitat selectivity was observed. Earthen burrows were the most frequently used refuge type. The time at which activity commenced varied seasonally as well as among individuals, with an increase in diurnal activity during winter. Young pangolins also displayed more diurnal activity compared to adults. Individuals spent 5.7 ± 2.0 hours per 24–hour cycle outside of refuges, with no significant seasonal variation. Juvenile dispersal peaked during mid-summer, with individuals travelling up to 49 km from their natal areas. We estimate a breeding density of 0.16 individuals/km2 and a total density of 0.31 individuals/km2 for our study area. Our data suggest that activity patterns, movements and refuge selection is similar across the species’ southern African range, but that densities may be higher in the Kalahari compared to populations in more mesic eastern areas.",

The likely reasons for this stem from the perceived inability to distinguish genetic and ecological components of variation in vocalizations, the difficulty in detecting homology across taxa, as well as the diverse selection pressures acting on vocal characters which may make such characters particularly prone to convergent evolution. In this study, we scored and analysed DNA and vocal characters of two delineated assemblages of gamebirds, francolins and spurfowls. Our phylogenetic results suggest that short strophes evolved from longer strophes among taxa within the genera Scleroptila and Peliperdix. More generally, our results corroborate the francolin–spurfowl dichotomy, with francolin calls generally being long and tonal, containing a series of discrete elements that have detectable harmonics. In contrast, most spurfowls render short, atonal calls with elements that generally have no harmonics, although they may contain discrete elements. Phylogenetically, Ortygornis sephaena is placed with ‘true’ francolins and its closest relatives are the two phylogenetically enigmatic Asian francolins, the grey francolin, Ortygornis pondicerianus, and swamp francolin, O. gularis.",

When food was available ad libitum, mousebirds roosting in a cluster maintained approximately constant rest-phase Tb, with 32°C < Tb < 42°C. By contrast, rest-phase Tb in single mousebirds decreased at 0.5°C/hr and minimum rest-phase Tb was significantly lower than when clustering. When food availability was restricted, the mousebirds exhibited facultative hypothermic responses that were less pronounced in clustering groups (minimum rest-phase Tb = 33.3°C, circadian amplitude of Tb = 9.5°C) compared to single birds (minimum rest-phase Tb = 30.7°C, circadian amplitude of Tb = 11.8°C). When clustering, rest-phase Tb was highly synchronized among individuals.

Karyotype evolution within the genus has been accompanied by chromosomal inversions and centromeric shifts. Comparison of the diploid number found in Pseudobarbus with other African barbine cyprinines, which have in the region of 2n = 50 and lower FNs, suggests a tetraploid evolutionary origin of the genus, possibly by allotetraploidy.Key words: PseudobarbusBarbinaetetraploidycytogeneticskaryotype",

A biological-environmental (BIOENV) analysis was undertaken using the catch per unit effort ichthyofaunal data from the spring/summer period of 1996/97 and concurrent water temperature, salinity and turbidity data. No strong correlations between the ichthyofauna and recorded physico-chemical parameters were documented, although temperature did show a weak correlation to demersal fish distributions. A second sampling programme undertaken in 2004 was specifically designed to test the influence of sedimentary characteristics on the distribution patterns of the dominant demersal species. Analyses showed that sediment size composition and organic content was strongly correlated (r = 0.70) to the distribution of the soles Solea bleekeri and Heteromycteris capensis, as well as the goby Glossogobius callidus. S. bleekeri and G. callidus showed a preference for the muddier middle and upper reaches of the Kariega Estuary channel, whereas H. capensis and Psammogobius knysnaensis were more abundant in the sandier lower reaches and mouth region of the estuary. The exact reasons for these preferences are unknown but are likely to be related to preferred prey availability, foraging success and predator avoidance in the different types of sediment. Other species caught in the otter trawl were not significantly correlated to sedimentary characteristics.",

It is different to that of the Hawaiian monk seal and elephant seals, as Mediterranean monk seals partly moult in the water. The intermoult period was close to one year except in females nursing a pup. Such females have longer intermoult periods and can even moult whilst still lactating. In males, the process of developing the mature pelage pattern of bulls is gradual.

One of the females was postreproductive and the other had lost its pup of the season, consequently they might have stayed longer at sea after settlement of the goose barnacles and prior to hauling out, than females with pups. Attached to the guard hairs of the seal, the barnacles were clogged with underfur fibres, making it impossible for them to feed, leading to emaciation. A possible explanation for the clogging is that the seals had begun to moult.",

Significantly more individuals were caught during the winter than in summer. Vegetation transformation had a negative impact on small mammal diversity. Density, diversity and distribution were correlated with vegetation and landscape structural diversity.

A further 34 offspring were available from eight breeding groups where profiles were available for a single parent. This study utilized four microsatellite genetic markers, originally developed for the African grey parrot. Parentage testing was undertaken using genotype comparisons with the dominant pair within the breeding group as well as auxiliary males where available. Although four markers were insufficient to provide conclusive evidence they do suggest that extra-pair copulation occurs in this species.

Where data were available fecundity selection and diet partitioning (ecological causation) were tested as possible proximate causes for dimorphisms found. The possibility of a relationship between head shape and microhabitat density was also investigated. The data showed that significant sexual dimorphism in snout–vent length and head shape was present in only a minority of taxa and that it was absent with respect to tail length. There are indications of a relationship between head shape and microhabitat density, and head shape seems to become increasingly more pointed as SVL increases. A serious impediment to placing the findings of this study into a firm evolutionary context is the general lack of information about the ecology, social organization and behaviour of the taxa.Key words: sexual size and shape dimorphismlegless skinksAcontiinae",

In addition, a haplotype network was constructed using TCS and an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was conducted. The derived topologies were highly congruent and showed that melanistic and non-melanistic populations were interdigitated on all tree topologies and a number of haplotypes were shared between melanistic and non-melanistic specimens.

Using a combination of catch, survey and life history data, the occurrence and long-term changes in populations of chondrichthyans in False Bay are described. Analyses of time series data from five fishing methods between 1897 and 2011 provided trends in relative abundance. Of the 37 species found in False Bay, 25 showed no significant trends for any fishing method. Of the 12 species and two genera with catch trends, four showed a common trend across methods, two increasing (Mustelus mustelus and Carcharhinus brachyurus) and two decreasing (Galeorhinus galeus and Raja spp.), while another two species (Triakis megalopterus and Isurus oxyrinchus) showed highly significant declines in one method only. A productivity index was used in conjunction with information on species distribution, catch frequency and trends in abundance to assess the vulnerability of False Bay chondrichthyans. Among the various habitats and depth strata, the surf-zone has been most impacted by exploitation, whereas the conservation of deep-water, soft-sediment species has benefited from the ban on trawling in False Bay implemented in 1928. Continued monitoring using catch data from beach-seine, recreational shore-angling and the commercial linefishery is recommended, along with improved species identification.Key words: chondrichthyanselasmobranchsexploitationvulnerabilitypopulation trendsconservation",

However, knowledge surrounding these estuarine circulation patterns is not clear, and consensus regarding the importance of fronts has yet to be reached. A full appraisal of the plankton in frontal systems in the estuary was undertaken. Ichthyoplankton, zooplankton and phytoplankton were collected from in and out of the frontal systems in the Kowie Estuary, using two WP2 plankton nets. Plankton was identified and abundance calculated. Various water quality parameters were also recorded in and out of the front and make up an important part of determining the physical difference between the separated water masses. Values for in and out of the frontal region were determined in order to make comparisons between the different areas. All data was tested for normality and homogeneity of variance. Differences between in and out of the frontal region were determined using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the relationships between water quality variables and plankton abundances. Community analysis was also run on the data in order to determine community dynamics associated with frontal system convergence and downwelling.",

    "abstract": "Most polygynous male mammals exhibit little or no parental care or involvement raising young. Instead, they invest indirectly in their own morphological and physiological attributes which enhance their chance of reproduction. Such secondary morphological sex traits may contribute to differences in the burrow architecture of fossorial mammals, such as the Cape dune mole-rat, Bathyergus suillus. Indeed, little is known about the seasonal changes in burrow architecture or differences in burrow configuration may differ between the sexes of subterranean African mole-rats (Bathyergidae). We excavated burrow systems of male and female B. suillus during the summer and the winter to investigate whether male burrow architecture reflected putative mate-seeking behaviour. We consider burrow geometry in response to mating strategies. Male burrow systems explored the environment more efficiently than females. This is presumably because of the increase in associated energetic costs of being a large male. Males produce more mounds indicating territorial behaviour even when it is energetically costly to dispose of soil onto the surface when the soil is less friable during the summer. Overall tunnel dimensions did not differ between the sexes. It appears that a change in season does not affect the geometry of the burrow system or tunnel dimensions in a climatically buffered environment.",

However, assessing the predation pressure facing a particular species is difficult when that species faces a suite of predators. We aimed to characterize the suite of avian predators that are likely to feed on the Namaqua dwarf adder, Bitis schneideri, and used field surveys to assess their relative abundance. We used literature records to map the feeding preferences of avian species, and point counts to estimate relative abundance. Finally, we produced an index of relative predatory pressure (RPP) to assess the relative importance of each avian species as predators. We counted 490 individual birds from 30 species during 39 point counts. A cluster analysis of similarity between diets produced a dendrogram that we split into three functional groups: specialist predators, generalist predators, and non-predators. Specialist predators and generalist predators made up a total of 10.6% of the entire community by abundance. Generalist predators are likely to be the most important predators of Namaqua dwarf adders. We also noted an increased abundance of anthropophylic species outside our study site and suggest that anthropogenic areas could provide regions of increased predation pressure on small vertebrates.",

Juvenile zebra displayed the highest degree of residency followed by white musselcracker and blacktail, with re-sightings recorded on 53%, 40% and 10% of observation days, respectively.

    "abstract": "The greater cane rat, Thryonomys swinderianus, utilizes high fibrous plant material and is an important meat source in West Africa. An insight in its digestive physiology will enhance our understanding of its feeding habits. Digestibility coefficients of the food were determined during two seasons before the animals were euthanased. The distribution and concentrations of nutrients and energy in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract were determined at the time of day when animals practised coprophagy. Trial 1 diet in the wet season consisted of 36% neutral detergent fibre (NDF), 11% protein and 49% dry matter, while the Trial 2 diet in the dry season consisted of 53% NDF, 8–9% protein and 89% dry matter. The Trial 2 animals on the poor diet increased their daily nutrient intake, possibly increased the volume of digesta and practised frequently cophrophagy, so that faecal production was reduced and digestibility coefficients were relatively high. Coprophagy increased both protein and energy intake as soft pellets in the distal colon had higher protein and energy content than the hard faeces. Energy, protein and acid-detergent fibre were retained in the caecum of Trial 1 females and the caecum and proximal colon of the Trial 2 animals 16 hours after feeding, illustrating the importance of these two regions in the fermentation process. Water was absorbed in the distal colon as dry matter content of digesta increased 53%, 4% and 56% from the proximal colon to the distal colon. Animals produced hard faeces with only 16% and 5% lower moisture content in the dry season, compared to that produced in the wet season, as water was not a limiting factor during the trials. It was concluded that an increase in daily food intake, an increase in coprophagy and the presence of a colonic separation mechanism (that retains small particles) enable the greater cane rat to utilize high fibrous plant material. These digestive strategies seem to be comparable to those observed in other hystricomorph rodents.",

One of the most curious aspects of this species flock is the large number (8) of piscivorous species. Cyprinids are not well designed for piscivory (i.e. small slit-shaped pharyngeal cavity, lack of teeth in the oral jaws, lack of a stomach), which raises the question how well adapted these labeobarbs actually are to function as piscivores? In this study we analyse the kinematics of prey capture (by varied combinations of suction, swimming and jaw protrusion) among Lake Tana's piscivorous labeobarbs. Suction feeding kinematics were similar to values reported for other piscivorous fish species. A detailed analysis of several Labeobarbus species displayed distinct types of techniques (overswimming, velocity/volume suction with jaw protrusion) suited to capture elusive prey in different macro-habitats, Lake Tana's Labeobarbus species evolved a wide range of piscivorous predation techniques, a unique scenario for cyprinid fishes.",

The present work aimed to study the ameliorative effects of curcumin, a potential therapeutic agent against several chronic diseases, on reproductive toxicity induced by the organophosphate insecticide fenthion. Forty adult male albino rats were divided into four groups. The control group received distilled water. The curcumin group was administered curcumin at a dose of 100 mg kg−1 body weight. The fenthion group was administered fenthion at a dose of 0.001 mg kg−1. The fenthion/curcumin group was administered fenthion and curcumin together at the same doses. After four weeks of daily oral administration, the animals were sacrificed and their testes were excised. Specimens were processed for histopatholological and immunohistochemical investigations. Light and electron microscopic analysis visualised dramatic degenerative changes in seminiferous tubules as indicated by atrophy, necrosis, vacuolation and decreased number of spermatogenic cells. Moreover, the fenthion group showed a significant reduction in the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-immunoreactivity. Decreased PCNA-immunoreactivity reflected the depletion in the proliferation rate of spermatogenic cells and suggesting arrested spermatogenesis. Curcumin administration to fenthion-treated rats revealed mild degenerative changes with partial improvement of active spermatogenesis. In conclusion, these data may confirm the cytoprotective potency of curcumin against fenthion-induced cyto-toxicity.",

Mean annual rainfall, temperature and relative humidity from 2005 to 2014 were 1 886 mm, 24.2 °C and 70%, respectively. Per 1 000 people, mean malaria morbidity was 228.9 and mortality 0.311. Years with peak malaria morbidities (2006, 2011 and 2014) had lowest annual rainfalls (1 488–1 677 mm). Monthly, malaria morbidity had a significantly negative linear relationship with rainfall (r = −0.536, p < 0.0001) and relative humidity (r = −0.509, p < 0.001), and a significantly positive linear relationship with temperature (r = 0.305, p = 0.001). Within the decade, malaria morbidity and mortality increased by 0.298% and 0.0007%, respectively. This study provides information on the malaria situation in Taraba State that could be useful to the National Malaria Control Programs and public health service providers in formulating policies that might promote the mitigation of malaria in Nigeria.",

Because diet plays a central role in the social dynamics of these canids, we hereby contribute further to our knowledge about their dietary habits. We present 2-year data of direct observations of foraging bouts of 19 habituated bat-eared foxes in the kalahari desert of South Africa, as well as data on seasonal variation in invertebrate prey communities obtained through pitfall and sweep net trapping. Despite showing a diet breadth reflective of a specialised forager across all seasons, foxes exhibited substantial seasonal variation in diet breadth with a broader range of food categories utilised in summer compared to the other seasons. Supplementary food categories appear to not have been utilised opportunistically, but it is unclear what drove the preference for some food categories over others. A literature review indicated strong effects of local conditions on the utilisation of supplementary food across southern Africa. Our data support bat-eared foxes as obligate termite specialists but highlight that they appear to have the ability to show dietary flexibility based on both temporal and spatial variations in food abundance.",

Subadults benefit from group living through exposure to novel areas, and protection from territorial males (i.e. ‘buddy system’). In contrast, it is unclear whether mothers benefit from group living. To determine if they benefit, or if there is simply no cost, we recorded the vigilance of white rhino mothers in different-sized groups. We predicted that as group size increased, calves would have lower predation risk and mothers would reduce their vigilance. In contrast, we found that vigilance did not decrease as group size increased. Our findings thus indicate that decreased vigilance is not a benefit that white rhino mothers gain from living in groups. Also, costs of group formation are minimal for mothers as their large body size and ability to feed on a wide range of grasses reduces competition with other group members. As a result, we suggest that the benefits obtained by subadults, coupled with the lack of costs to adult females, are the main drivers of group formation in white rhinos.",

Seasonal samples were collected between winter 2007 and autumn 2009 at eight sites along the estuary by means of boat-based plankton tows using two modified Working Party 2 (WP2) nets. Salinity ranged from 1.5–36.5 and temperature from 11.6–26.8°C during the study period. A total of 8174 larval and early juvenile fishes were caught, representing 12 families and 23 taxa. The Clupeidae, Gobiidae and Blenniidae were the numerically dominant fish families. Common species included Gilchristella aestuarias (Clupeidae), Omobranchus woodi (Blenniidae), Caffrogobius gilchristi, Glossogobius callidus (Gobiidae), Liza dumerilii and Myxus capensis (Mugilidae), largely reflecting the adult assemblage of the estuary.

Highest catches were recorded in summer (mean of 464 and 928 larvae per 100 m3 in 2008 and 2009, respectively). Species diversity also varied seasonally, with highest diversity occurring during summer. Highest larval fish density occurred in the euhaline zone while the oligohaline zone supported the highest diversity. Estuarine-resident species (category I) dominated the system (91%). The preflexion stage of development dominated the catches suggesting a high degree of local production in the Sundays Estuary. Larval sizes of the estuarine-resident G. aestuarias and catadromous species M. capensis tended to increase towards the middle and upper reaches of the estuary.

The phylogenetic relationships of three haplochromine cichlid species from the upper Lufubu River were analysed in the context of the phylogeographic structure of haplochromine cichlids from the surrounding hydrological systems. Patterns of genetic distances between the Lufubu fish and their sister taxa from the upper Congo system indicate that the headwaters of the Lufubu River were colonized from drainages pertaining to the Upper Congo system during extreme flooding or river capture events (at least several 100 000 years ago), possibly even three times independently. This study exemplifies how phylogeographic data from an understudied region might help to unravel unrecognized historical connections between separate water odies and drainage systems in a geologically/hydrologically unstable region.",

The present study aimed to establish a non-invasive protocol for monitoring faecal progestagen metabolite (FPM) patterns in wild female southern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum simum). Six adult females at Lapalala Wilderness, South Africa, were tracked and accurately identified at least once every week. Three animals gave birth during the study period. Fresh faecal samples were collected for 12 months and stored frozen at –20°C until analysis with an enzyme immunoassay utilizing an antiserum raised against 5_-pregnan-3_-ol-20-one which cross-reacts with a number of progestagens. Mean FPM concentrations were 35 to 64-fold higher during pregnancy (55–145 days before parturition) compared to postpartum (120–140 days after parturition) (P < 0.001). Also, the non-pregnant animals had mean FPM concentrations significantly higher than postpartum values (P = 0.006). Our results show that non-invasive FPM measurements provide information on the pregnancy status of wild female white rhinoceroses, and may be used for the detection of pregnancy in free-living individuals, without the necessity of immobilization and/or relocation of the animal. This information has potential value for optimizing breeding management of wild and captive populations.",

    "abstract": "The parasitic infections of amphibians in the National Park (pristine savanna), Buffer Zone (slightly altered savanna closer to fields) and Agricultural Zone (agricultural land including cotton fields with intensive use of pesticides) of the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve, Benin, were investigated. A total of 145 amphibian specimens of 14 species were examined and parasites recovered included two monogenean parasites, an acanthocephalan, two cestode species, four trematode species and eight nematode species. Results obtained show the possible influence of land-use pattern on parasite distribution. For example, the encysted acanthocephalan had higher prevalence in Phrynobatrachus latifrons caught in the Agricultural Zone, but specimens from the Buffer Zone had a higher intensity of infection. Infection with trematodes occurred predominantly in hosts collected in the Agricultural Zone, indicating that landscape alteration, pesticide use and nutrient enrichment from fertilizers in this zone may be enhancing intermediate host populations and hence parasite prevalence. Furthermore, this infection pattern may be indicative of an immunosuppressive effect of pesticides on the frogs of the Agricultural Zone. Prevalence of Rhabdias sp. infecting P. latifrons caught in the Buffer Zone was almost 14 times higher than those caught in the Agricultural Zone. Similarly, the infection with Amplicaecum sp. was higher in Amietophrynus maculatus from the National Park (57.1%) than those from the Agricultural Zone (15%). It is possible that the pesticide-contaminated environment of the Agricultural Zone inhibits the development of the free-living stages of these nematodes.",

    "abstract": "The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is the largest of southern Africa's 13 tortoise species, and occurs in a variety of habitats from arid and semi-arid areas to mesic grassveld, savanna and bushveld. Seasonal activity patterns of S. pardalis were investigated as a function of rainfall, sex, time of day, temperature and time after sunrise on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa. We predicted that because of seasonal rainfall, and subsequent increase in the food available, activity patterns of leopard tortoises would vary greatly among seasons, but that the primary constraint on activity levels within a season would be ambient temperature. Type of activity, time of day that the activity was performed, and the frequency that each activity was performed, differed among seasons. There was no overall seasonal difference in the level of activity with sex, but in certain seasons and with regard to specific activities, there were significant differences between the sexes. Diel activity was primarily bimodal in summer and autumn, and unimodal in winter and spring, with nonthermoregulatory activities being performed primarily in the afternoon. There was a positive correlation between number of tortoises caught and rainfall per season, but activity levels and number of tortoises walking and feeding was not correlated with seasonal rainfall. Leopard tortoise activity behaviours responded to ambient temperature, but results indicate that activity is also initiated by the time since sunrise.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSpatial patterns in the macrofauna community structure within four distinct zones of the permanently open, freshwater-deprived Kariega Estuary on the southeastern coastline of southern Africa were investigated in March–May 2010. The zones within the littoral zone comprised a band of Zostera capensis (Setchell) exposed at spring low tide and comprising Zone I; a band of mud or sand, lacking vegetation, corresponded to Zone II; stands of Spartina maritima (Curtis) formed Zone III and a belt of Sarcocornia perennis (Miller) constituted Zone IV. Total macrofauna abundance and biomass during the study ranged from 16–816 ind/m2 and from 0.032–390.76 mg wwt/m2 and demonstrated no significant horizontal or vertical patterns (P > 0.05 in both cases). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) indicated that there were no significant spatial patterns in the macrofaunal community structure within the four zones which could be related to the predominance of euryhaline species, including Marphysa sanguinea (estuarine wonder worm), Arcuatula capensis (estuarine mussel), Macoma litoralis (littoral tellin) and Nassarius kraussianus (tick shell) throughout the estuary. The absence of any distinct spatial patterns in the community structure of the macrofauna appears to be related to the virtual absence of any horizontal patterns in selected physico-chemical variables and availability of submerged macrophytes along the length of the estuary. Comparisons with historical data indicate that while there have been no significant changes in the estimates of the total macrofauna abundance and biomass within the estuary over the past three decades, abundances of selected species have declined by as much as 80%. The decline in the abundances of these species appears to reflect the predominance of hypersaline conditions within the upper reaches of the estuary and intense fishing activities in the lower reaches of the system.Key words: long-term changesmacrobenthospermanently open estuarysouthern AfricaUpogebia africana",

P. pantherinum laid their eggs at an average depth of 18.95 m (min: 7.4 m; max: : 26.8 m) preferentially attaching their eggs singly onto sea fans Leptogorgia palma, Eunicella papillosa and Eunicella tricoronata. H. pictus laid their eggs at an average depth 3m(min: 1m; max: 30.7 m) and attached their eggs, predominantly in pairs, to the seaweed Bifurcariopis capensis. The average temperature at which eggs were found were similar (15°C) and eggs were laid year-round. Embryo development was observed in the laboratory under constant controlled environmental conditions of 14 and 17°C. Embryo length-age relationships were linear for both species and there were significant differences in growth rate at the two temperatures. For P. pantherinum average growth rate was 0.37 mm/day at 14°C and 0.79 mm/day at 17°C. The average incubation period was 266 days at 14°C and 125 days at 17°C. Embryos thus grew two times faster and development time was 53% shorter when the temperature was raised by only 3°C. For H. pictus, the average growth rate was 0.49 mm/day at 14°C and 0.78 mm/day at 17°C. The incubation period was 242 days at 14°C and 190 days at 17°C.

Primates are of particular interest, because they are highly vulnerable to forest fragmentation. In this study, we investigated faecal glucocorticoid measurements (FGCM), an indicator of physiological stress, in an endemic and IUCN-endangered monkey species inhabiting forest blocks in the Udzungwa Mountains in south-central Tanzania. The Udzungwa red colobus (Procolobus gordonorum) is threatened by hunting, and habitat degradation and loss due to agricultural expansion. They are highly folivorous, more abundant at lower elevations, but able to persist in extremely small forest blocks. We collected faecal samples in four forest blocks that differed in size, level of human impact (hunting and past logging activities) and ecological factors to examine the potential influence on stress hormone output. Across all four forests, we did not find any clear effect on FGCM levels of the variables considered, apart from elevation. Red colobus had higher FGCM levels at lower elevations, where their seemingly optimal habitat occurs, but concomitantly where greater human disturbance is found. Although our results should be interpreted with caution and confirmed with further study, we suggest that this species is not negatively influenced by a moderate level of human activity, consistent with ecological modelling data.",

This, combined with the recent drought, led to low water levels, hypersaline conditions and dramatic losses in biodiversity. The excavation of a beach spillway between the estuary and the Mfolozi River mouth in 2012, combined with the commencement of a wet phase in the preceding year, has alleviated the freshwater deprivation crisis. This study compares the meso-zooplankton composition within the channel on both flood and ebb tides, providing a preliminary understanding of the role of the Mfolozi channel in the migration and recruitment of organisms. Abundance was higher on ebb tides, while species richness was higher on flood tides. A total of 53 zooplankton taxa were recorded in the channel. Of these, one had never been recorded in St Lucia before, namely the gastropod Pterotrachea cf. hippocampus. Additionally, the ctenophore Pleurobrachia cf. pileus and the mysid Gastrosaccus gordonae were again recorded for the first time since the late 1970s. Results show that the beach spillway has facilitated recruitment into St Lucia from the ocean and the Mfolozi River. Further research is needed to ascertain what effect this recruitment has on long-term zooplankton community structure.",

Kroyeria lineata from Mustelus palumbes constitutes a new host and geographical record, K. rhophemophaga from Galeorhinus galeus a new geographical record and K. carchariaeglauci from Carcharhinus amboinensis an additional new host record. Except for K. dispar, Kroyeria species generally display low parasite loads on their hosts. Prevalence varied between 11.8% (CI: 1.5–36.4%) and 94.4% (CI: 86.4–98.5%). Mean intensity and mean abundance values ranged from four to 72.8 (SE 11.1) individuals per infected host and from 0.7 (SE 0.5) to 65.7 (SE 10.5) individuals per examined host, respectively. All Kroyeria species examined display an aggregated distribution pattern. This study confirms previous suggestions that Kroyeria species are generally host specific, with only a few species found on multiple hosts.Keywords: Copepodamean abundancemean intensityprevalenceSiphonostomatoida",

Copper concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in whole crabs of different size classes as well as in various organs and tissues. The digestive gland contained the highest concentration of copper (mean 29.9, range 1.9–74.1 µg/g wet mass) irrespective of season, when compared to other tissues. No differences in total sediment (range 1.2–13.5 µg/g) or water (range 0.01–0.2 µg/g) copper concentrations were found between the two localities. An influence of anthropogenic activities between the localities on the sediment and water levels of copper could not be detected. Smaller crabs accumulated more copper per unit mass than larger crabs with all crabs having significantly higher concentrations than both water and sediment. Higher copper concentrations per unit mass in whole crabs from the downstream locality indicated that environmental conditions at this locality may have favoured uptake since total copper concentrations both in water and sediments did not differ significantly between the two localities. P. perlatus may therefore still be utilized in biomonitoring studies, not necessarily to reflect prevailing environmental concentrations, since copper can also be regulated, but to assess exposure to and bioavailibility of copper.",

Differences in sampling techniques were at least partly responsible for differences noted. In the case of commercially important penaeid prawns, species composition differed from those reported historically. Marked contrasts in crustacean catches were recorded from different sites and while salinity and turbidity may have played a role it is probable that the nature of the substratum and proximity of large mangrove stands are most influential in determining species spatial distributions in the harbour. Given the harbour's importance as a nursery to estuarine crustaceans, including species of considerable ecological and commercial value, this fact must be accounted for in future development plans.",

Low repeat trapping may result from low survivorship or emigration from the area after flowering of P. humiflora. Mean mass of A. subspinosus was lower than published values due to a high proportion of juveniles in the population, coinciding with P. humiflora flowering. Comparison with other published data suggests that A. subspinosus is an opportunistic breeder. This contrasts with its geographically nearest congener, A. spinosissimus, in which breeding is restricted to the summer months, but is similar to data for other Acomys species. Minimum home range areas (≈0.23 ha, minimum overnight distance 39 ± 6 m), were relatively high and may indicate a species surviving on thinly dispersed resources.",

Maximum age of limpets was calculated to be 5-6 years. H. pectunculusl/Ig is a protandrous hermaphrodite, males becoming sexually mature at about 10-12 mm shell length (about one year old), and changing sex at about 16 mm shell length (about two years old). This resulted in sex ratios of about two males to one female. Limpets from both geographic locations spawned mainly in summer (November / December) with a second smaller spawning in autumn (April). There was no significant difference in the gonad index (GI) between southeast coast males and females. However the GI of southwest coast males was about 5% greater than that of the females. The gonad indices of southeast coast and southwest coast limpets was not significantly different.",

To determine MPM and PTM, observations were made from an observation tower using a semi-natural outdoor enclosure, and through a one-way glass panel using a semi-natural indoor enclosure. Each lizard (n = 10) was observed for a 10 minute period during peak activity and the times it was moving and the times it was stationary were recorded. Data obtained in the indoor- and outdoor enclosures did not differ significantly and were pooled. MPM (0.37 ± 0.21 S.D.) and PTM (1.92 % ± 0.93 S.D.) values recorded for C. anguina fall within the range given as characteristic for sit-and-wait foragers. Nine C. anguina were habituated in glass terraria to accept mealworms offered to them. When all lizards accepted food without hesitation, they were tested for their ability to discriminate among three different odours presented to them in a randomized block design: prey odours consisting of mealworm surface odours, distilled water as an odourless control stimulus, and cologne as a pungency control. The number of tongue-flicks directed at the cotton applicator containing the stimulus odour during 60 seconds was recorded. No statistically significant differences were found among the responses to the three treatment odours. An analysis of the stomach contents of 21 C. anguina revealed a diet of mostly diurnally active arthropods.",

Each species thus appears to have its own 'dietary niche' within the assemblage, reducing interspecific competition for food.",

They did not show any preference for a specific sex of host, or side of the body. Parasites occurred most frequently in pairs (65.6 % of cases), or alone (32.8 %), with infection by more than two parasites rare (1.6 % of cases). The 604 P. blochii collected ranged in size from 13.0–50.9 cm, but parasitized individuals were only found amongst smaller size classes (14.8–31.2 cm), with only one individual larger than 28 cm parasitized. A. capensis individuals were found to be protandric hermaphrodites, passing through three stages (functional male, intermediate or 'transitional' stage, and then functional female) with increasing size. Parasite sizes were positively correlated with those of the host, suggesting that parasite and host growth could be concurrent. Length and weight of parasitized fish was slightly, but significantly below that of non-parasitized individuals, suggesting that infection byA. capensis had a negative effect on host condition. Given the low frequency of infection by A. capensis within False Bay, however, it is unlikely that this has any significant adverse impacts on the hottentot fishery in the region.",

Three experiments were carried out on (a) potted rice plants, (b) rice in an upland environment and (c) rice in a lowland environment, all on the Temporary Farm of the Rice Development Programme of Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Nigeria. The results indicated that the association of worm casts with the bases of rice stands significantly improved height at tillering, mass of seeds and root volume at harvest in the upland-grown \nrice. In the lowland-grown rice, earthworm casting significantly improved all growth parameters. In the experiment with potted plants , only leaf area, number and mass of seeds per stand responded positively to the level of cast treatment. For the other growth parameters different levels of cast treatment did not make a significant difference. These results indicate that earthworm activities contribute significantly to the physiological well-being of rice under flooded (lowland) conditions. This may be related to their aeration of the soil and to growth factors that they produce. It is recommended that rice farmers should adopt farming operations that conserve earthworm populations in their plantations.",

A. monochrus is an amphibious species and remains almost exclusively above the water line, migrating vertically with the tide while feeding on a thin algal layer scraped from the moist substratum. Spawning activity peaks were observed at Pointe aux Caves, Mauritius, during the full moon periods of October and November and two corresponding oocyte size cohorts were identified in excised ovaries collected over the breeding season. Larvae hatched in approximately four days and otolith ring counts showed that settlement occurred 28 days later. Initial post-settlement growth was rapid but growth rate in length declined linearly beyond 50 mm. Length frequency time series showed that the 1991 cohort reproduced at age one, but that none of this cohort survived into the 1993 breeding season, consistent with annual semelparity. By contrast, other expected correlates of semelparity were not observed: fecundity in A. monochrus was lower than in some iteroparous blennies, and there was no obvious physical deterioration of adults following the breeding season, despite their high mortality rate.Key words: Blenniidaeagegrowthecologyamphibiousfish",

During this sally, through marginal to poor habitats and prime terrain, movements were rapid, with only short spells of inactivity, and little apparent foraging behaviour.

A land-use map of the study area was derived from a Landsat image, and land-use change information came from an earlier study by the author. Bird data were collected by observations along timed, standardized walks. Shannon (1948) indices of bird diversity for highlands, bushland and lowlands were 3.29, 2.99, and 2.62. The highland category was divided into two subcategories, homegarden and highland garden, as bird populations of the two were distinct. Highland garden had a higher diversity (3.15) than homegarden (3.07). The lower species diversity and number of individuals in homegardens was probably due to lower niche diversity and more human disturbance. Lowland fields had low diversity indices as they are dominated by large flocks of birds. The equitability indices for highlands, bushlands and lowlands were 0.82, 0.80 and 0.65, respectively. Each land-use type had many species that were not seen in the others. As bushland is disappearing, the species currently threatened are the 15 bushland species that are not found in other land-use types. Growing population pressure leading to deagrarianization of the homegarden area is likely to affect homegarden bird populations, though it is not clear whether the very high human population density will prevent it from supporting a highland garden type of a bird population.",

The early developmental stages of Glossogobius callidus and Redigobius dewaali were collected during plankton surveys in seven permanently open and five intermittently open estuaries along southeastern South Africa. Larval G. callidus have a characteristic ventral row of pigment that extends from the cleithral symphysis along the ventral midline of the tail to the end of the caudal peduncle; notochord flexion takes place at the yolk-sac stage, between 3 and 4 mm BL. Larval R. dewaali are characterized by having two very large stellate melanophores on the ventral surface of the trunk and tail, and internal pigment between the snout and hindgut; notochord flexion takes place between 4 and 6 mm. Body lengths at settlement for G. callidus and R. dewaali are 13 mm and 16 mm, respectively. G. callidus and R. dewaali dominate the larval gobiid catch in warm temperate estuaries. Estuary type and freshwater input played a defining role in the occurrence of larvae of these, often sympatric, species in temperate estuaries. Larval G. callidus occurred in both permanently open and intermittently open estuaries, and were most abundant in mesohaline regions over the spring/summer period. By contrast, larval R. dewaali occurred exclusively in permanently open estuaries and were more prevalent in the fresh and oligohaline regions in autumn. Larvae of both species were more prevalent in freshwater-rich estuaries. Densities of G. callidus and R. dewaali peaked at 101 and 3829 larvae per 100 m3respectively. The usefulness of using the early stages of these gobiids as indicators of estuarine health based on their specific and often prolific estuarine occurrence is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The karyotypes of three species of yellowfish, namely Labeobarbus marequensis (A. Smith, 1841), L. capensis (A. Smith, 1841) and L. polylepis (Boulenger, 1907), were examined by Giemsa staining using an approach improved for the description of high chromosome numbers. In each case, 2n = 150; no heteromorphic chromosomes were detected; chromosomes in all morphological categories ranged smoothly from large to small, with no distinctly large submetacentric pairs; and metacentric chromosomes showed little variation in size. Labeobarbus marequensis had 26 metacentric (m), 44 submetacentric (sm), 42 subtelocentric (st) and 38 acrocentric (a) chromosomes and a fundamental number (FN) of 262; L. capensis had 16 m, 58 sm, 42 st and 34 a chromosomes and FN = 266; and L. polylepis had 18 m, 60 sm, 42 st and 30 a chromosomes and FN = 270. These results, combined with published literature, imply that Labeobarbus Rüppel, 1836 is an evolutionarily hexaploid African lineage and support its removal from synonymy with the evolutionarily tetraploid Asian genus Tor Gray, 1834. A review of fundamental numbers for conspecific Labeobarbus species examined in different studies implicated karyological technique as a confounding factor in assessing details of karyotypes, leading to recommendations for future karyological studies of barbine fishes. Potential synapomorphies are pointed out in karyological characters of species within Labeobarbus.",

    "abstract": "We examined 170 museum specimens of the southern African gekkonid lizard Homopholis wahlbergii, to quantify sexual dimorphism, male and female reproductive cycles and diet. The largest male and female we recorded were 116 and 119 mm snout–vent length (SVL) respectively. We compared SVL, tail length, head length, head width and eye diameter and found no evidence of sexual dimorphism in any of these characters. The smallest female with thickened muscular oviducts and follicles, indicating sexual maturity, was 59 mm SVL, but the smallest female we found with fully developed eggs was 85 mm SVL. Virtually all females larger than 59 mm appeared to be in some stage of reproduction, suggesting that females reproduce every year once they reach sexual maturity. Egg size ranged from 17–19 mm long. Egg size was not correlated with maternal SVL. We found adult females with ready-to-lay eggs during the warmer months of the year, but not during winter and spring. The smallest sexually mature male was 72 mm SVL. Virtually all males larger than this size displayed at least semi-turgid testes and most adult male testes were at least semi-turgid for much of the year. The only significant decrease in testicular activity was in mid-winter (June–August), thus, spermatogenesis is closely tied to female follicular development and ovulation. Velvet geckos are largely insectivorous (92%) and feed on a broad spectrum of prey. Their diet was dominated both numerically (34%) and volumetrically (22%) by beetles. Lepidoptera were the next most important prey category, suggesting that they exploit both terrestrial and flying invertebrates. They are unusual among lizards because they feed on millipedes. Males and females had very similar diets which may be explained by their lack of sexual dimorphism, although females tended to eat a greater volume of prey. Interestingly, less than half (37%) of the lizards examined contained prey items, suggesting that most individuals were not in positive energy balance. We also found evidence of prey size selection as a function of gape size, such that larger geckos took advantage of larger prey items.",

Female C. fluviatilis reached sexual maturity at a length of about 6.0 mm, and males at about 5.2 mm. Fecundity was positively correlated to female body length.

Overall, diving ducks were not abundant in the wet season, and were rare to absent in the dry season. Divers only responded positively to the characteristics of natural wetlands, including greater surface area, percent coverage of emergent vegetation, and high (ungrazed) shoreline vegetation. Of six species of dabbling ducks present during the wet season, occurrence of three co-varied with wetland and upland characteristics associated with agriculture, namely permanent water, and agricultural grains in the dry season. Being largely grazers, geese responded positively to the higher proportions of bare shoreline, characteristically surrounding agricultural ponds.

Top predators have been extensively controlled in rangelands managed for sheep in South Africa, because top predators prey on sheep. To test whether this control of top predators has increased nest predation risk for breeding birds in rangeland landscapes, I compared nest predation rates between rangeland areas subject to predator control, and large protected areas with no predator control. An artificial nest experiment found that nest predation by mammalian mesopredators was non-significantly higher in rangeland areas, providing weak support for increased predation by mammalian mesopredators as a consequence of mesopredator release. However, nest predation rates on natural nests of a suite of nine species did not differ between rangeland and protected area landscapes. Thus, control of top predators does not appear to reduce bird nesting success in this system. This result may reflect complex interactions between mammalian mesopredators and other predators of birds' nests, particularly snakes.",

Of these, three were considered obligate: the myzostomidans, Myzostoma fuscomaculatum and Myzostoma n.sp., and the shrimp, Hippolyte catagrapha, all of which only occurred on T. carinata. Both frequency and density of infestation were higher for the two myzostomes than for the shrimp.

A total of 67.5% of all T. carinata collected were infested by symbionts. Of these 45% hosted only one species, 17% hosted two species and 5.8% hosted all three. Most M. fuscomaculatum (85.2%) and H. catagrapha (82.1%) matched their hosts' colouring, while Myzostoma n. sp. were all yellowish incolour. Infestation by Myzostoma n. sp. increased in both frequency and density with depth.

Preference for larger trees was only evident at the habitat scale, however, as individual trees were utilized as expected according to the availability of their canopy size class. More detailed tree characteristics, such as leaf size, shoot size, stem number and even leaf chemistry (protein:tannin ratio and total polyphenols) had no influence on host choice. Host choice was based on the most obvious measure of resource abundance, namely tree size, as expected for an outbreak species, since resource availability rather than nutritional quality is likely to be the primary determinant of larval survival.",

Communal roosting likely does not facilitate flocking unless the food resources are close to the roost site, but may function in anti-predator defence. Meyer's parrots appear to be dependent on riverine forest, Acacia-Combretum marginal woodland and mopane woodland for roost sites in the Okavango Delta. They aggregated more during the breeding season due to their specialist nutritional requirements, and female dependence on food provisioning by the male parrots. Meyer's parrots may be sedentary in the Okavango Delta, but the possibility of limited local movements in other areas (especially the Zimbabwean highlands) should be investigated.",

Foraging efficiency was determined by measuring the remaining food in artificial food patches (giving-up densities: GUDs) from two experiments. In the first experiment, we placed patches in different microhabitat types (cover vs open) and at varying distances from cover. This experiment was conducted during three moon stages (waxing, full, waning). We found that the rodents had higher GUDs (lower foraging efficiency) in the open microhabitat. The distance from nearest shelter had a marginally significant positive effect on GUDs. GUDs were higher in both microhabitat types during the waxing and full phases, but decreased sharply once the moon began to rise after sunset. These results are likely due to higher predation risk away from cover and in more illuminated environments. In the second experiment, we examined mouse responses to seeds impregnated with plant toxins. Seeds impregnated with oxalic acid were avoided by the rodents, while seeds soaked in tannic acid did not differ significantly from control seeds. Our results highlight important ecological factors affecting the foraging behaviour of these rodents.Key words: giving-up densitiesforaging ecologykopjelunar",

This study aimed at generating information on the population fluctuation and breeding patterns of M. natalensis in a maize dominated agro-ecosystem in the Mayuge district, Eastern Uganda. The area is characterised by a bimodal rainfall pattern with rains in the periods March to May and August to November. A Capture–Mark–Recapture study was established in cultivated and fallow field habitats with, in each habitat, two plots of 60 m by 60 m with 49 evenly spaced trapping points. Trapping was conducted monthly for three consecutive nights, and the study extended from January 2016 to June 2018. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model analysis showed significantly higher population density estimates (β = 0.69, p < 0.0001) in fallow land compared to cultivated fields, and also significantly higher density estimates( β = 0.75, p = 0.006) in the first wet season and lowest in the first dry season. The percentage breeding females differed significantly across months (χ2 = 27.05, df = 11, p = 0.003) and seasons (χ2 = 17.64, p = 0.0003). Breeding females occurred throughout all the months of trapping, but with significantly higher percentages in the months of March to July (i.e. first wet season extending to second dry season) and generally lowest in the first dry months (i.e. January and February in 2017, and February 2018). The results of this study have important consequences for the timing of control efforts, and recommends that control should be initiated during the dry seasons prior to wet seasons to counteract potential damaging population build up in later wet seasons when crop planting is expected.",

The shoal has historically been heavily utilized by fishermen and SCUBA divers. In this study, a survey was undertaken to describe and zone the reef and its benthic communities in terms of topography, habitat types, species diversity, species richness and benthic cover. Data were collected using underwater photography and analysed by point intercept analysis. Three distinct benthic communities were identified using multivariate non-metric statistics. Benthic communities appeared to be influenced by topography, sediment cover and wave energy. The highest abundance of zooxanthellate hard corals and the encrusting zooxanthellate sponge, Suberites kelleri were found on the large shallow areas of the shoal. This suggested that light penetration to the elevated areas on the reef was adequate for photosynthesis and played a role in the distribution of its biota. The encrusting morphology of the sponge Suberites kelleri, and the branching morphology of the hard corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora spp., appeared to be tolerant of the high-energy environment near the surface. A second community was found only on steep edges of the Shoal and was characterized by a large abundance of Polychaeta and the soft coral Eleutherobia aurea, while a third community was found deeper on the offshore side of the shoal and consisted primarily of coralline and red foliose algae.",

We assess these vegetation types in terms of their family and species composition, as well as levels of endemicity, relating these differences with vegetation structure. We inventoried 297 species (49 families) in an area less than 450 ha, as part of South African National Survey of Arachnida. Analysis of the results suggests that endemic taxa are associated with Tall Forest and, to a lesser extent, Woodland. The Woodland had the highest species diversity, and much of the variation observed in spider assemblage structure is explained by these two vegetation types. Based on vegetation structure variables that explained significant variation in spider assemblages, human influence through bush encroachment will result in a change of spider assemblages to that of Short Forest and Mosaic Woodland vegetation types, with implications for biodiversity maintenance and heterogeneity.",

Seasonal samples were collected between winter 2007 and autumn 2009 at eight sites along the estuary by means of boat-based plankton tows using two modified Working Party 2 (WP2) nets. Salinity ranged from 1.5–36.5 and temperature from 11.6–26.8°C during the study period. A total of 8174 larval and early juvenile fishes were caught, representing 12 families and 23 taxa.

Common species included Gilchristella aestuarias (Clupeidae), Omobranchus woodi (Blenniidae), Caffrogobius gilchristi, Glossogobius callidus (Gobiidae), Liza dumerilii and Myxus capensis (Mugilidae), largely reflecting the adult assemblage of the estuary. Catches varied significantly between seasons, but not between sites and salinity zones within the estuary. Highest catches were recorded in summer (mean of 464 and 928 larvae per 100 m3 in 2008 and 2009, respectively). Species diversity also varied seasonally, with highest diversity occurring during summer. Highest larval fish density occurred in the euhaline zone while the oligohaline zone supported the highest diversity. Estuarine-resident species (category I) dominated the system (91%). The preflexion stage of development dominated the catches suggesting a high degree of local production in the Sundays Estuary. Larval sizes of the estuarine-resident G. aestuarias and catadromous species M. capensis tended to increase towards the middle and upper reaches of the estuary. Important variables regulating larval fish dynamics in the Sundays Estuary included salinity, temperature and turbidity.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the invasive, omnivorous Clarias garipienus is capable of rapid invasions and long-term persistence in recently inhabited freshwater systems. To test this hypothesis, the life history of the established, extralimital Darlington Dam (33°10’31”S, 25°09’13”E) population was investigated. By counting post-fluorescent mark increments on otoliths from 21 chemically tagged wild fish recaptured 244–537 days later, the deposition of growth zones, comprising alternating opaque and translucent bands, was validated as annual. Examination of sectioned otoliths from 175 fish revealed that the oldest fish, two males of 840 and 1074 mm total length (TL), were 25 years old – 10 years older than previously described for any C. gariepinus population. The oldest female was 885 mm TL and 21 years old. Length-at-age was subsequently described using the von Bertalanffy growth model. Combined-sex growth was best described as Lt = 931.7(1– exp(–0.15(t+2.43))) mm TL. Total mortality (Z) was calculated using catch curve analysis and the Chapman & Robson estimator to be 0.35/yr. The presence of specimens 15 years and older indicates that these fish established quicklyand supports the finding that mortality rates are low, which, in turn, suggests likely long-term population persistence.",

No signs of pollution or algal blooms were observed, but large variations in climatic conditions were associated with both events. The 1991 mortalities occurred during a warm spell in autumn, when there was a rapid increase in the daily air temperatures. Similarly, the February 2012 event occurred after abnormally high air temperatures of January 2012 declined sharply due to a cold-water upwelling event in early February. These findings are compared with those of other marine disease and mortality studies.",

The present study aimed to establish a non-invasive protocol for monitoring faecal progestagen metabolite (FPM) patterns in wild female southern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum simum). Six adult females at Lapalala Wilderness, South Africa, were tracked and accurately identified at least once every week. Three animals gave birth during the study period. Fresh faecal samples were collected for 12 months and stored frozen at –20°C until analysis with an enzyme immunoassay utilizing an antiserum raised against 5_-pregnan-3_-ol-20-one which cross-reacts with a number of progestagens. Mean FPM concentrations were 35 to 64-fold higher during pregnancy (55–145 days before parturition) compared to postpartum (120–140 days after parturition) (P < 0.001). Also, the non-pregnant animals had mean FPM concentrations significantly higher than postpartum values (P = 0.006). Our results show that non-invasive FPM measurements provide information on the pregnancy status of wild female white rhinoceroses, and may be used for the detection of pregnancy in free-living individuals, without the necessity of immobilization and/or relocation of the animal. This information has potential value for optimizing breeding management of wild and captive populations.",

In the Cochlear zone and entire intertidal (Cochlear- and Balanoid zones combined) biomass values of invertebrates and filter-feeders were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at semi-exposed shores, while grazer biomass was greater at sheltered sites: a negative relationship (P < 0.01) and a moderate to weak correlation (r > 0.42) was also recorded between filter-feeder biomass and grazer biomass. This negative relationship reflected changes in standing biomass of the two dominant filter-feeders (Octomeris angulosa and Perna perna) against that of the dominant grazer (Scutellastra cochlear). On sheltered shores the biomass of trophic groups varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the intertidal gradient studied, with values of grazers and algae decreasing with increased aerial exposure. Similar, but less substantial (P > 0.05) variations were recorded at semi-exposed sites, where the median shell length < 0.05). Multivariate analyses of square-root transformed biomass values separated most of the sheltered Cochlear zone stations from semi-exposed ones. This study supported the concept that the structure of low-shore communities is determined largely by differences in wave action.",

Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses showed craniometric differences between age classes 1–3 and age classes 5–9, with age class 4 being intermediate between these two age class groupings. This suggests that age class 4 lies at a point on a hypothetical growth curve where growth begins to stabilize. The intermediate placement of age class 4 in multivariate space broadly coincided with body mass categorizations into juveniles (age classes 1–3; <100 g), subadults (age class 4; c. 100–150 g), and adults (age classes 5–9; >150 g). The analyses also revealed the absence of sexual dimorphism in the relatively younger age classes 1–4 but its presence in the relatively older age classes 5–9, and these results are supported by data on body mass. These results may have implications in our understanding of the population and social structures, and reproductive strategies in this little-studied giant mole-rat.",

In contrast, R. pumilio was able to find caches of all sizes in wet soil conditions but recovery success of small caches (single-seed) was poor in dry soil conditions.

We investigated whether the numbers of the ice rat Otomys sloggetti robertsi, whose populations are regulated by low temperatures, have increased in the recent past as a consequence of current environmental warming in the Lesotho Drakensberg. Ice rats are endemic to the southern African alpine zone, are exclusively herbivorous, have a diurnal activity profile, and live in underground burrows. We predicted that ice rat numbers would remain stable or increase since winters have become milder. We monitored ice rat numbers in three locations, separated by 70, 80 and 130 km. The results show that the population density of ice rats has increased over threefold to 352 ice rats per hectare over the past decade. Our findings suggest that higher temperatures could have improved habitat productivity and reduced thermal stress, and thus improved winter survival of ice rats.",

The resulting estimate of evolutionary divergence between the fluke and other dicrocoeliids was 1.60 ± 0.22% base differences per site. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the fluke is a new species within Dicrocoeliidae falling in a cluster with the genera Corrigia, Lyperosomum, Concinnum and Eurytrema although phylogenetic relationships among these genera are not well resolved.

A total of 145 amphibian specimens of 14 species were examined and parasites recovered included two monogenean parasites, an acanthocephalan, two cestode species, four trematode species and eight nematode species. Results obtained show the possible influence of land-use pattern on parasite distribution. For example, the encysted acanthocephalan had higher prevalence in Phrynobatrachus latifrons caught in the Agricultural Zone, but specimens from the Buffer Zone had a higher intensity of infection. Infection with trematodes occurred predominantly in hosts collected in the Agricultural Zone, indicating that landscape alteration, pesticide use and nutrient enrichment from fertilizers in this zone may be enhancing intermediate host populations and hence parasite prevalence. Furthermore, this infection pattern may be indicative of an immunosuppressive effect of pesticides on the frogs of the Agricultural Zone. Prevalence of Rhabdias sp. infecting P. latifrons caught in the Buffer Zone was almost 14 times higher than those caught in the Agricultural Zone. Similarly, the infection with Amplicaecum sp. was higher in Amietophrynus maculatus from the National Park (57.1%) than those from the Agricultural Zone (15%). It is possible that the pesticide-contaminated environment of the Agricultural Zone inhibits the development of the free-living stages of these nematodes.Key words: amphibiansparasitesPendjari Biosphere ReserveBenin Republic",

This study aimed to determine the physiological response of Africa’s premier freshwater angling species, the tigerfish Hydrocynus vittatus, to C&R angling in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Standard angling techniques were used to collect fish, whereafter fish were anaesthetised in clove oil, blood drawn from the caudal vein and general biometric data noted, then revived and released. Blood plasma was analysed for glucose, cortisol and lactate concentrations to assess the effects of angling duration, fish size and fish condition. Larger fish were angled for a longer duration. Plasma glucose concentrations decreased with greater lactate concentrations, an indication of the aerobic and anaerobic work done during capture. Few individuals showed increased plasma cortisol concentrations. In extended-capture fish (angled for >1 min), lactate concentrations increased significantly above values for control fish. A linear regression analysis showed that well-fed fish had less of a stress response compared with less well-fed individuals. Furthermore, a discriminant function analysis indicated that the suite of biomarkers used were successful in indicating different stress responses according to angling duration. Angling and handling times along with nutritional status were likely influential factors in the range of glucose, cortisol and especially lactate levels in this study. These data suggest that C&R causes physiological stress to tigerfish, but could nonetheless be a valuable fisheries management tool, ensuring the sustainability of fish populations.",

Other concerns include the 'marine bushmeat' trade, habitat loss/degradation, overfishing, marine pollution, anthropogenic sound and climate change. Conservation challenges include a paucity of scientific data on the species, and widespread human poverty within most range states, resulting in high dependence on artisanal fisheries. Recommended conservation and research priorities include: (1) distribution and abundance surveys in known and potential range states, (2) bycatch monitoring programmes, (3) education/awareness schemes, and (4) protection of core areas via reduction/elimination of nearshore gillnetting.",

Satellite telemetry and uniquely engraved colour-rings were used to study moult-site fidelity of Egyptian geese marked at two sites in South Africa – Barberspan in the summer-rainfall region and Strandfontein in the winter-rainfall region. Twelve Egyptian geese were tagged with satellite GPS PTT transmitters while moulting at Barberspan and Strandfontein during 2008 and 2009, and a further 527 were colour-ringed between June 2007 and March 2009. Bi-monthly point counts of Egyptian geese and scans for colour-ringed birds were made at each study site from July 2007 until June 2010, resulting in 139 individually colour-ringed geese being re-sighted during the study period. We explored Egyptian geese dispersal distances away from the study sites and modelled moult-site fidelity from colour-ring return rates corrected for survivorship, sampling period efficiency and colour-ring detectability estimates. There were 12% and 29.7% colour-ring return rates for geese ringed at Barberspan and Strandfontein, respectively. Four of five moulting birds tagged at Barberspan with satellite transmitters returned to Barberspan to moult the following year. Two of these same birds moulted at Barberspan in the third year while the other two moulted elsewhere. One out of seven Egyptian geese satellitetagged at Strandfontein returned to the same site to moult the following year. One bird moulted at a nearby pan (5 km away), two moulted at estuaries less than 30 km from Strandfontein and one bird moulted at a farm dam 56 km away. Two birds satellite-tagged at Strandfontein did not moult the following year and returned to moult at Strandfontein in the third year. The moult-site fidelity model suggested that a minimum of 16% of Barberspan birds and 51% of Strandfontein birds returned to the same wetland to moult the following year. The apparent low moult-site fidelity at Barberspan suggested by colour-ring resightings may reflect the small number of birds colour-ringed at the site.",

    "abstract": "Seventeen confirmed and four probable sightings of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, were documented from platform-of-opportunity Research Vessel (R/V) Dr. Fridtjof Nansen in a passing-mode visual survey of continental shelf waters between Conakry and Cap Vert Peninsula (Dakar), 21 October -5 November 2011. None were encountered in the northern stratum Dakar-Agadir, 6 November -15 December 2011. Total visual survey effort was 468 h, 01 min, covering 5335 km. Depending on the exclusion or inclusion of probable records, the sum of group sizes totalled 33 or 43 individuals, respectively. Humpback whale encounter rates between Conakry and Dakar then amounted to 1.74 or 2.27 whales/ 100 km, respectively. Group sizes ranged from 1-6 individuals (mean = 1.94, S.D. = 1.20, n =17; median = 2). Minimally five of 17 groups (29.4%) consisted of adult-calf pairs, with a minimum crude birth rate ranging from 0.060-0.152. All sightings occurred in shallow water, 22-60 m (mean = 35.0 m, S.D. = 10.13, n = 17) but survey effort in deeper, off-shore water was negligible. Sea-surface temperature at sighting locations ranged from 25.5-29.0°C (mean = 27.34, S.D. = 0.96, n = 17). No humpback whales were sighted during a second survey covering Conakry-Tangier-Las Palmas, from 9 May to 22 July 2012 (519 h, 13 min; 6278 km). The Cape Verde Islands comprised, to date, the only known wintering ground located in the North-East Atlantic. This study showed that Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Guinea are normal range states for M. novaeangliae. A temporal signature, six to seven months out-of-phase with mid-season in the Cape Verde Islands, and neonate presence strongly suggest that the wide Conakry-Dakar continental shelf serves as both wintering and nursery grounds for a South Atlantic stock, in agreement with Bamy et al. (2010). This stock may comprise the northwesternmost component of the large humpback whale assemblage migrating in and out of the northern Gulf of Guinea in austral winter/spring. Further research is required to consolidate insights linking temporal and spatial distribution off western Africa with hemispheric stock identity and migration paths.",

Individuals frequently interact with heterospecifics through feeding territoriality. Underwater observations and experiments were conducted to examine interspecific variation in the frequencies of territorial behaviour and its influence on the feeding habits of heterospecifics. Frequencies of chasing and fleeing associated with interspecific territoriality were remarkably different amongst 10 cichlid species. In addition, individual fish that attacked heterospecifics more frequently were attacked less often by them, suggesting that interspecific interactions amongst cichlid species are asymmetric. The experimental removal of territory owners belonging to the most aggressive species resulted in almost fivefold increase in feeding within territories, suggesting that territorial aggression preserves food resources for the territory holder and influences the feeding habits of other species, including those with some dietary dissimilarities. Additional information regarding asymmetric interspecific interactions would improve understanding about how diverse cichlids within trophic groups manage to coexist.",

We investigated whether morphological measurements could be used to discriminate between sexes of this species, with a sample of birds captured in two forest types on Mt Cameroon. We used discriminant function analysis based on a combination of traits to develop models to discriminate between sexes. The sex of birds predicted from these models was compared with molecular sexing of the same individuals. Discriminant analysis revealed that a discriminant function incorporating wing length, tail length and bill height allowed 74% of western mountain greenbuls to be sexed correctly based on morphometric measurements alone. Sex ratios varied between montane and lowland forests, with the former having a higher proportion of males (70.5 and 54.6%, respectively), but the difference was not statistically significant. Cloacal sizes did not differ between males and females, and males do not develop large cloacal protuberances while breeding. This is in agreement with low predicted levels of sperm competition in this species. We show that sexing based on morphology has its limitations, but can still provide some insight if DNA analysis is not available.",

We used mitochondrial DNA data from wintering populations of the Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) in western (Nigeria), southern (Botswana and Zambia) and eastern (Kenya) Africa, as well as from several Eurasian breeding populations, to compare genetic differentiation and haplotype sharing between non-breeding and breeding populations. We found that the population in Nigeria had the best genetic match to breeding populations in West and Central Europe. In contrast, Botswana matched with West, Central and East Europe, and Zambia with Central and East Europe and the Middle East. Finally, Kenya showed the most distinct connectivity pattern of the four analysed populations and matched with East Europe and, in particular, to the Middle East. Our results indicate clear but weak migratory connectivity in Great Reed Warblers, a pattern that should be considered in conservation strategies of Palearctic–African migratory passerines.",

Ten adult fish were tagged and released in four discrete pools below a weir that precluded possible upriver migration. Their residency and movement patterns were monitored using 27 moored acoustic receivers spanning both riverine and estuarine habitats between January and November 2013. Small-scale movements ranging from 50 to 400 m occurred between pools in the headwater region, where tagged fish remained resident (did not leave their tagging pool) during the warmer (summer) months. The onset of autumn and winter correlated with declining water temperatures and half of the tagged largemouth bass made downstream excursions into the slightly warmer upper reaches of the estuary. The penetration of these alien piscivores into estuarine headwaters potentially provide additional predator pressure on the juveniles of migratory estuary-associated native marine fish species, which utilise these areas as nurseries. The presence of the alien fish in South African estuarine headwaters may impair the migration of juvenile fishes between the estuarine and freshwater environments.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTransfers to new breeding herds and supplementary feeding are crucial management steps for small populations of ungulates. However, the successful realisation of those steps is strongly dependent on social interactions among individuals. Agonistic encounters connected with feeding determine the quality and quantity of the food accessed, and therefore directly influence food intake. We analysed the dominance relationships of mixed herds of critically endangered Western Derby eland with regard to access to supplementary food in the Bandia reserve, Senegal. We tested the influence of age and sex on feeding rank, the linearity and stability of hierarchies and the relation- ship between the position of an offspring in the hierarchy and the position of its mother. A linear hierarchy existed in all herds. Sex influenced the rank only in interaction with age. Feeding rank was significantly related to age in growing animals; in adults the effect of age was weaker. While body mass is correlated with age during the growth period and not after reaching adulthood, we concluded that the position in the hierarchy was related to the actual condition, reflecting the resource holding potential of individuals. The dominance index of a growing offspring depended on the index of its mother, but hierarchies of adult individuals were not stable. High-ranking individuals in good condition limited access to supplementary feeding to their lower-ranking herdmates. Effective supplemen- tary feeding should therefore be provided in excess amounts to enable younger and weaker individuals in need to benefit from it, despite their lower positions in the hierarchy.Keywords: dominance indexhierarchylarge herbivoreTaurotragus derbianusungulatewildlife management",

The sharks were more enriched in 15N than the hake, an indication of the apex predator status of sharks. Among the sharks considered, C. squamosus occupied the highest trophic level and fed primarily on benthic prey. The two species of shark from the genus Deania were not different based on δ15N or δ13C, so they had similar diets. The δ13C signatures indicated that M. capensis and sharks fed on prey derived from similar basal resources. However, there was a significant difference in δ13C between M. paradoxus and all other species examined, suggesting that they occupied different feeding niches. Isotope-based population metrics showed narrower trophic ranges in sharks than M. capensis. Carbon and nitrogen ranges indicated that hake fed on a more diverse pool of carbon sources and had generally more enhanced trophic diversity in their feeding patterns than sharks. Among the species considered, C. squamosus occupied a unique isotopic space. Our results supported the hypothesis there are trophic overlaps among these species, but some interesting differentiation was revealed.Keywords: dietecological rolefood webstable isotopesstandard ellipse areatrophic nichetop predators",

In this study, four mitochondrial gene regions and one nuclear gene region were used to investigate their different abilities to identify tissue associated with museum specimens of Aethomys chrysophilus, Aethomys ineptus and Micaelamys namaquensis. Aethomys chrysophilus and the more recently elevated A. ineptus are indistinguishable on morphological grounds; however, their ranges are largely parapatric with only one syntopic locality currently known. All of the mitochondrial gene regions were able to separate M. namaquensis from A. chrysophilus and A. ineptus, but they varied in their abilities to resolve differences between A. chrysophilus and A. ineptus. The sequence results identified a specimen from KwaZulu-Natal that was misclassified and should have been identified as A. ineptus. Seven specimens that had not been reclassified following the elevation of A. ineptus to species level were identified as A. ineptus. Individuals of A. chrysophilus from Malawi could not be classified as either A. chrysophilus or A. ineptus, and may be a hybrid or a new, distinct species. This study indicates that DNA barcoding may be used to separate M. namaquensis from A. chrysophilus and A. ineptus, and although it was not able to separate A. chrysophilus and A. ineptus, it did indicate specimens from Malawi may be a new cryptic species.",

The aim of this investigation was to determine the physiological response of Orange-Vaal smallmouth yellowfish, Labeobarbus aeneus, to catch-and-release angling in the Vaal River, South Africa. Fish were collected using standard fly-fishing techniques, anaesthetised in clove oil and blood was drawn from the caudal vein; thereafter the fish were weighed, measured, revived and released. Blood plasma was analysed for concentra- tions of glucose, cortisol and lactate to determine the effects of angling duration, fish size and water tempera- ture. Larger fish were angled for a longer duration compared with smaller fish. Levels of glucose were affected by water temperature (influenced by time of year). Plasma glucose concentrations decreased with greater angling duration. Few individuals (n = 12) showed increased plasma cortisol concentrations. In extended-capture fish (angled for >1 min), lactate concentrations increased significantly above values for rapid-capture fish (angled for >30 s). These data suggest that catch-and-release causes physiological stress to fish, but nonetheless this practice can be a valuable fisheries management tool to ensure the sustainability of fish populations. Other factors beyond the 'angling' time are likely to contribute to physiological disruptions in homeostasis and therefore handling and air exposure of angled fish should be included in future catch-and–release angling studies. In addition, the longer-term impact of angling on fish health should also be determined.",

Edge analysis demonstrated that the highest proportion of opaque zones was detected between August and December, most likely as a result of slow growth during lower temperature water during the preceding winter. With growth zone deposition validated as annual, future research should focus on determining the growth, maturity and mortality rates of these species, parameters which are important for their management.",

This species exhibits extreme reproductive skew with a single breeding female whereas reproduction in subordinate group members is completely blocked. Rainfall, as it greatly facilitates burrowing, provides the opportunity for individuals to disperse from their natal colony and hence, to overcome reproductive suppression. However, because rainfall is scarce, optimal conditions for burrow system construction are restricted to very short periods of the year. In order to observe the construction of a new burrow system of dispersing individuals, I released a small group (two females, one male) following heavy rains, and monitored their burrowing activity in the form of mound production during the following weeks. Recapture revealed that a new male had joined the group. Over a period of one month the four individuals extruded 127 mole hills and constructed a tunnel system with a total length of approximately 100 metres. Mound production ceased after 30 days due to the lack of subsequent rain. The study provides an example of dispersal in Damaraland mole-rats and gives new insights into the method of burrow system construction of this species. It further highlights the high costs associated with dispersal.Key words: BathyergidaedispersalDamaraland mole-ratburrow systemreproductive suppression",

There were no significant differences in measured environmental variables between sites above and below the waterfall, and M. dolomieu is thus implicated as the main factor responsible for the differences in native fish densities.

Thorough knowledge of their feeding ecology is fundamental in understanding the pressures imposed on mesocarnivores by urbanisation. The diet of the water mongoose Atilax paludinosus has been studied in natural habitats of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, its urban conspecifics have been mostly overlooked. We used scat analysis to investigate the feeding ecology of water mongooses in the urban greenspace matrix of the Upper Highway Area of eThekwini, KwaZulu-Natal Province. We analysed dietary intake trends using relative percentage of occurrence, based on 105 scat samples collected in 2018–2019. Urban water mongooses opportunistically consumed a wide array of prey items. Their diet was dominated by three main categories: crustaceans 35.9%, rodents 19.6%, and invertebrates 18.4%. Seasonal variation was only detected for crustaceans and rodents. We found chicken bones, plastic particulates and cigarette butts in the scat samples. This indicated that water mongooses in an urban landscape were supplementing their diet by foraging on anthropogenic waste. Our study highlights the generalist and flexible feeding habits of water mongooses in an urban matrix.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGomphocerinae grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) are generally characterised by their polymorphism and cryptic diversity, which can be confusing when relying on morphological identification alone. DNA taxonomy serves as a powerful molecular tool for species identification and biodiversity assessment. In the context of zoogeography and the biodiversity conservation of animal resources in ecosystems, DNA barcoding data for Algerian Gomphocerinae fauna remains limited in global databases, despite their agroeconomic and environmental importance. Therefore, in this study, we collected various species of this subfamily from the Biskra region in Algeria and conducted DNA barcoding analysis, employing different molecular species delimitation methods (the automatic barcode gap discovery, assemble species by automatic partitioning, single-threshold general mixed Yule coalescent model, Bayesian Poisson tree process and multi-rate Poisson tree process methods), as well as phylogenetic analyses (maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference) based on two molecular markers (COI and ITS). The results of the 163 newly generated sequences demonstrated that DNA barcoding technology is highly efficient and valuable for species identification in the subfamily Gomphocerinae, showing strong congruence with morphological evidence for 12 species, including eight species that were sequenced for the first time. This study also reported a new record of the genus Stenohippus Uvarov, 1926 in Algeria, comprising two species. Additionally, taxonomic revision allowed the species Dociostaurus biskrensis Moussi & Petit, 2014, to be transferred to the genus Stenohippus. Molecular tree analyses revealed the phylogenetic positions of the newly sequenced species within the subfamily Gomphocerinae and provided insights into their evolutionary relationships. These new data serve as a starting point for future research in other geographical areas, enabling a better understanding of the biodiversity of this insect group in Algeria.Keywords: BiskraCOI and ITSDNA barcodingmolecular taxonomynew recordStenohippus",

This study investigates a recent extension of its distribution into the sandy habitats of Langebaan Lagoon. Inspection of 22 potential sites (15 littoral and seven sublittoral) in the lagoon revealed three substantial mussel beds, two littoral and one sublittoral. All were located at sites in the mouth and lower reaches of the lagoon that experienced the full force of the incoming tide. The littoral mussel beds apparently started forming in the mid 1990s, and that in the sublittoral after the 1970s. In July 1999 the overall size of the littoral mussel beds was 0.99 ha, supporting an estimated 47 million mussels, but by March 2001 it had decreased by more than 88 to 0.10 ha and an estimated 3 million individuals. The primary cause of the dieback appeared to be sediment deposition, possibly aggravated by a scarcity of food (phytoplankton). The littoral mussel populations were comprised almost exclusively (99 )of M. galloprovincialis. At the low-water mark of spring tide (LWMST) mean packing densities were 6–8 times lower than those at 0.5–0.6 m above LWMST, while median shell lengths were notably (c. 1.5 times) larger. A close (P <0.00005) relationship was recorded between packing density and median shell length. The sublittoral population differed from that sampled at LWMST, having no Aulacomya ater, a higher proportion of Choromytilus meridionalis (20 ) and substantial proportions of both large and small M. galloprovincialis. The competitiveness of M. galloprovincialis is discussed.Key words: Population sizesTemporal changesCompetitivenessMortalitySedimentation",

Overall, termite diversity in western Namibia is low. The Shannon Index ranged from 0–1.46. Diversity was generally higher at sites under relatively low land-use intensity. On the farm with the most arid climatic conditions, this relationship was reversed, probably as dung and other resource inputs were relatively high at the higher land-use intensity site. Termite species assemblages differed between the various farms, as wellas across the land-use intensity gradients. Whether this was attributable to differing environmental parameters or land-use histories was not clearly discernible.Key words: biodiversitytermitesarid environmentsland use",

In M. edulis, inter-lamellar connections are reported to connect the inner and outer lamellae over the entire ventral to dorsal surface. In P. perna, the inter-lamellar connections are restricted to between the third and sixth row of cilial disks from the marginal groove. All cilia emanating from the epithelial cells of M. edulis are reportedly longer than those of their counterparts in P. perna. Further, laterofrontal cirri in M. edulis comprises 22-30 pairs of cilia, whereas in P. perna there are only 18-23 pairs. This report complements an earlier fine-structural study and completes the description of gill filaments in P. perna.

The most abundant earthworms, comprising 62 % of the population, were the advantageous solid-wormcast makers. Mixed Leguminous Wooded Savanna had the highest earthworm density (1.50 million worms/ha), while Wooded Savanna had the lowest (0.23 million worms/ha). Coastal Forest and Mangrove (0.51 t/ha) had the highest earthworm biomass and Afziela Savanna/Semi-Deciduous Forest (0.03 t/ha) had the least. A new soil impact index (SIINDEX) is introduced, which simultaneously incorporates both earthworm biomass and density. The highest SIINDEX was from Mixed Leguminous Wooded Savanna (0.72) and the lowest from Afziella Savanna/Semi-Deciduous Forest (0.11). Forests with SIINDEX less than 0.2 should be regarded as endangered, because their earthworm functions are too low to accomplish significant leaf-litter breakdown and recycling. We suggest that if the illegal annual bush burning is prevented, the soil surface will be naturally mulched, earthworms protected, and by their function in the soil, the need for soil mechanization and fertilization could be replaced by earthworms to produce natural foods.",

Mean mussel cover, length, biomass and bed depth were all low in the southeast (former Transkei). Faunal abundance and biomass were minimal along the south coast, increasing up both west and east coasts. Species diversity and richness showed the reverse trends, peaking at south coast sites and dropping off to the west and east. Multivariate analysis grouped the faunal communities into four distinct clusters, corresponding to the recognized Namib, Namaqua, Agulhas and Natal biogeographical provinces. The low mussel biomass and cover in the Eastern Cape can be attributed to intense human exploitation, but the low faunal abundance and biomass along the south coast was unexpected, as was the negative correlation between faunal abundance and diversity. Over recent decades intense exploitation has resulted in marked declines in mussel cover along the east coast, while the M. galloprovincialis invasion has resulted in dramatic increases in mussel cover to the west. The results given here indicate how these changes might have affected the wider intertidal communities in these regions.",

Salinity had no significant effect on oxygen consumption at 12.5 and 20°C in both large and small crabs. At 30°C and 44°, however, the rate of oxygen consumption declined in large crabs (from 0.233 to 0.176 mg O2 g wwt/h) and increased in small crabs (0.300 to 0.469 mg O2 g wwt/h). There was also a significant increase in the oxygen consumption (0.300 to 0.536 mg O2 g wwt/h) of small crabs at the high temperature/low salinity combination. Temperature had a significant effect on the rate of oxygen consumption at all salinities, with Q10 values ranging from 1.16 to 2.85. In all cases the mass-specific oxygen consumption rate of small crabs was higher than that of large crabs. The results suggest that the confinement of this species to the lower reaches of estuaries may, in part, be due to physiological constraints on juveniles and small individuals.Key words: estuarine crabaquatic metabolism",

A primary hindrance to such initiatives has been the lack of information pertaining to its habitat requirements. We assessed various soil and vegetation parameters, at each population site, in areas where the animals were found to be present or absent. A multiple logistic regression model highlighted the importance of soil hardness (governed by soil particle size distribution), in combination with the cover provided by trees, as the two ecological factors that best explained habitat suitability for Juliana's golden mole at the three localities. An IndVal analysis failed to identify any plant species that could reliably act as an indicator of habitat suitability for this fossorial mammal.

Such behaviour could lead to increased contacts between people and carnivores, with the potential for escalated conflicts. Within protected areas, carnivores experience limited risks of visiting anthropogenic sites. However, conflict could still arise, so that it is important to evaluate the drivers for visitation within protected areas. We tested how age, sex and social rank influenced seasonal visitation rates by spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) at two sites with elevated human activity and infrastructure within the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Social rank did not influence visitation rates, and differences among age classes did not correspond to differences in abilities to procure native food. Instead, juveniles had higher visitation rates than older individuals, but only during the wet season. Visitation rates were not consistently higher during the dry season, nor was there more pronounced differences between age classes in the dry season. Our results suggest the anthropogenic sites were visited as part of exploratory behaviour coupled with occasional rewards. Our study also showed a large individual variation in tendencies towards visiting anthropogenic sites, but only for younger animals. We call for additional studies quantifying individual variation in tendencies to visit anthropogenic sites, and argue that deterrents and limitations in rewards of visiting anthropogenic sites might be efficient in preventing human-hyaena conflict within the Kruger National Park.",

    "abstract": "Farmers in the northern, communally managed parts of the Succulent Karoo, an arid rangeland system in South Africa, historically used donkeys and horses for transport and ploughing. With increasing mechanisation, draught animal power has largely been replaced by machines. Yet, donkeys and horses have been maintained in the agricultural landscape in small feral and semi-feral herds. Research has shown that they compete directly with productive livestock (mostly sheep and goats) for forage resources, contributing little to the local economy. Local farmers identify the presence of feral donkeys and horses as one of the primary challenges in maintaining sustainable grazing regimes on their land. However, records of the number of animals roaming the rangelands are scarce and anecdotal. We therefore conducted a combination of aerial, ground, and social surveys to estimate the minimum population size and potential grazing impact of the donkey and horse population in two communally farmed sites in the Succulent Karoo. We show that, in the representative sites surveyed, there are at least 376 equines (274 donkeys and 102 horses), representing approximately the equivalent of 2 228 sheep and goats, and consuming ∼8% of the potential grazing available for productive livestock in these areas. This could represent a significant lost opportunity cost for local farmers in the region.",

We investigated the influence of anthropogenic activities on myriapod assemblage structures along an altitudinal gradient at Mount Kala. Myriapods were collected by pitfall trapping, hand sorting and litter sifting in four altitudinal levels and habitats (820 m, 920 m, 1 020 m and 1 120 m above sea level) from November 2017 to July 2018. A total of 1 131 individuals from 58 species in 3 classes (Diplopoda, Chilopoda and Symphyla), 36 genera and 17 families were recorded at Mount Kala. The Diplopoda was the most abundant and diverse class (94.69% and 49 species), followed by Chilopoda (4.51% and 8 species) and Symphyla (0.80% and 1 species). Aporodesmus gabonicus Lucas, 1858 and Karkinikus colonus Attems, 1914 were the most abundant species in the study site. Along the altitudinal gradient, the myriapod species richness decreased in anthropised areas (820 m to 920 m above sea level), reached a maximum in transitional forest (920 m to 1 020 m above sea level) and slightly decreased within the submontane forests (1 020 m to 1 120 m above sea level). Myriapod abundance followed the same trend. However, our results also indicate a high species richness turnover observed between altitudinal levels suggesting that most species are adapted to a particular habitat and could serve as indicators of environmental changes. Accordingly, this study demonstrates a negative relationship between anthropisation and myriapod diversity, as well as the implications towards the management of the Mount Kala forest.",

BFRs were in all eggs, but not all BFRs were quantifiable. Concentrations ranged between 2.9 and 46 ng g−1 wm (wet mass) and the predominant congeners were BDE-47, -153, -154, -183 and -209. The BFR compositional patterns of the congeners in eggs differed between species, feeding guilds, and habitats. Differences in associations of birds with humans seemed to have as much an influence as the trophic levels occupied by the maternal animals. The congener pattern of BFRs differed between terrestrial and aquatic species. The congener concentrations and patterns also differed from eggs from other countries, suggesting differences in sources. BFR concentrations in eggs from the current study area were below a reported no observed effect level (NOEL; 1 000 ng g−1 wm). Although this suggests that the BFRs do not pose a risk, the NOEL was mostly based on information from birds from moderate and colder climates. This NOEL might not apply to birds from warmer climates with different life histories, as in the current study, because there are currently only draft regulations on importing BFRs or BFR-containing products in South Africa. The BFR-containing products otherwise destined for countries with BFR restrictions in place may now find their way to South Africa. The additional waste these poorly regulated products generate will eventually find their way to landfills ensuring that release to the environment and consequent exposures to biota will continue without effective interventions and waste management. Our findings indicate the need for on-going environmental monitoring to assess trends, identify hot spots, investigate effects, strengthen waste management, and the need to urgently implement the commitments under the Stockholm Convention.",

Using stable isotope techniques, we investigated the diet of spotted-necked otters occupying habitats artificially stocked with trout. Stable isotope analyses revealed that the diet of spotted-necked otters included equal proportions of crab and trout followed by frog. Diet was found to vary between, as well as within, individuals suggesting individual dietary plasticity. Temporal variation in foraging areas was evident for some otters. These results suggest that individual animals specialise on trout when available. However, this was not consistent between individuals. The resulting conflict with freshwater fisheries may, therefore, be primarily due to individual animals adapting to diets consisting largely of farmed trout. The extent of spotted-necked otter influence on stocked trout, however, needs further investigation.",

A total of 442 individuals assigned to 25 species were captured using ground-level mist nets.

Myonycteris angolensis had the highest relative abundance in the region, with large numbers captured in cultivated farms. According to the rank-frequency diagram, bat assemblages in cultivated farms (Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) = 53.7), gallery forest (AIC = 27.7), and secondary forest (AIC = 48.5) are distributed according to the pre-emption model, whereas the distribution in the savannah (AIC = 40.0) follow the null model.

Echo parakeets are unusual in that, although traditional breeding pairs occur, there are also multi-male breeding groups. This raises questions about the potential for extra-pair copulations. Genotype data were obtained from the dominant male and female in eight breeding groups (including three with profiles of attendant auxiliary males) and their 36 offspring. A further 34 offspring were available from eight breeding groups where profiles were available for a single parent. This study utilized four microsatellite genetic markers, originally developed for the African grey parrot. Parentage testing was undertaken using genotype comparisons with the dominant pair within the breeding group as well as auxiliary males where available. Although four markers were insufficient to provide conclusive evidence they do suggest that extra-pair copulation occurs in this species. The echo parakeet is classified as endangered (<500 birds) and understanding its mating system would be valuable in its future conservation.Key words: Echo parakeetPsittacula equesextra-pair copulationmicrosatellites",

Foraging efficiency was determined by measuring the remaining food in artificial food patches (giving-up densities: GUDs) from two experiments. In the first experiment, we placed patches in different microhabitat types (cover vs open) and at varying distances from cover. This experiment was conducted during three moon stages (waxing, full, waning). We found that the rodents had higher GUDs (lower foraging efficiency) in the open microhabitat. The distance from nearest shelter had a marginally significant positive effect on GUDs. GUDs were higher in both microhabitat types during the waxing and full phases, but decreased sharply once the moon began to rise after sunset. These results are likely due to higher predation risk away from cover and in more illuminated environments. In the second experiment, we examined mouse responses to seeds impregnated with plant toxins. Seeds impregnated with oxalic acid were avoided by the rodents, while seeds soaked in tannic acid did not differ significantly from control seeds. Our results highlight important ecological factors affecting the foraging behaviour of these rodents.",

Where data were available fecundity selection and diet partitioning (ecological causation) were tested as possible proximate causes for dimorphisms found. The possibility of a relationship between head shape and microhabitat density was also investigated. The data showed that significant sexual dimorphism in snout–vent length and head shape was present in only a minority of taxa and that it was absent with respect to tail length. There are indications of a relationship between head shape and microhabitat density, and head shape seems to become increasingly more pointed as SVL increases. A serious impediment to placing the findings of this study into a firm evolutionary context is the general lack of information about the ecology, social organization and behaviour of the taxa.",

    "abstract": "Developmental plasticity results from environmental influences on the phenotype of an organism during its development, and its effects are irreversible. The phenomenon of phenotype–genotype uncoupling (plasticity) causes problems in species delineations, and has been suggested as a cause underlying a mismatch between morphology and genetics between the Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion thamnobates) and the KwaZulu dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion melanocephalum). The two species are morphologically distinct, but are very poorly distinguished genetically. It has been hypothesized that B. melanocephalum and B. thamnobates may be phenotypically plastic populations of the same species, since environmental conditions, the driving force behind developmental plasticity, varies between the distributions of these two allopatric taxa.We raised juveniles of both species under identical controlled laboratory conditions. Two treatments were used. These varied in both habitat structure and temperature, each approximating conditions that one of the species would encounter naturally. Although not specifically controlled or monitored, all other environmental factors (e.g. humidity, light and wind) were standardized since chameleons were raised in the artificial conditions created in environmental chambers. If taxa are developmentally plastic, phenotypes would reflect treatment conditions, irrespective of specific associations. Neither B. thamnobates nor B. melanocephalum were phenotypically plastic over the environmental differences tested; species developed into the expected phenotypes, irrespective of treatment conditions. The low genetic difference between B. thamnobates and B. melanocephalum may indicate their recent divergence from a common ancestor or the mitochondrial gene fragments (ND2 and 16S) used in previously published phylogenetic analyses of the genus may not be representative of divergence for the genome as a whole.",

Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) has a high glucose intake irrespective of sugar concentration of nectar. It is not known how these bats regulate their blood plasma glucose concentrations in order to avoid the negative effects associated with hyperglycemia. Fruit bats have a high amount of sugar intake in a short period of time which could cause a glucose challenge and it is therefore necessary to determine whether these bats are able to regulate their blood plasma glucose concentrations within normal concentrations. This study investigated the diel variations in blood plasma glucose concentrations of E. wahlbergi. Epomophorus wahlbergi's blood plasma glucose concentration was lower (5.24 ±0.38 mmol/1) at 18:00 before feeding and increased during/after feeding (8.19 ± 1.24 mmol/1) but bats appeared to regulate it within limits. Their range in concentrations was higher than the normal mammalian blood plasma glucose concentrations range. Consequently these bats appear to regulate their blood plasma glucose concentration, although at a range higher than normal mammalian levels, and thus reduce the negative consequences associated with hyperglycemia.",

During this period the East Kleinemonde Estuary opened more frequently than the West Kleinemonde Estuary and it also experienced a greater number of bar overwash events when larval recruitment can occur. The timing of mouth opening and the frequency of marine overwash events did not influence species richness of marine-spawning species but had a pronounced effect on abundances (catch-per-unit-effort) of species. The species composition of both estuaries was similar, but the catch-per-unit-effort in the East Kleinemonde Estuary was more than three times greater than that of the West Kleinemonde Estuary. The East Kleinemonde also supported a greater proportion of immature individuals of Rhabdosargus holubi and Monodactylus falciformis, and the length frequency distributions of both these species differed significantly between the two estuaries. The larger fish sizes in the West Kleinemonde Estuary were attributed to the prolonged mouth closure that resulted in the trapping of larger juveniles and mature fish within the estuary.Key words: mouth openingtemporarily open/closed estuariesfish communities",

We measured the effects of supplemental food on activity and browsing patterns during seasons of scarce natural food resources in 2008 and 2009 for a herd of six animals in the Fathala Reserve (Senegal). In response to the provision of high-quality pods of Acacia albida, animals reduced foraging time in 2008 and allocated it to resting. This pattern corresponds to the animals' behaviour in captivity without foraging versus vigilance trade-offs and with predictable (in time and space) access to food. In 2009, supplemental feeding had no effect on behaviour and was associated with increased foraging and ruminating times than in 2008, suggesting more limited natural food resources in 2009. We recorded high species diversity in the animals' natural diet. Supplemental food did not induce changes in browsing pattern at the plant species level, probably due to small individual effect on total nutrient and energy intake. Food supplementation, however, facilitates the animals overcoming unfavourable conditions or alleviates stress with additional rest, and could therefore assist as a conservation intervention to enhance fitness.",

However, risk of predation facing an organism is dependent on various biotic and abiotic factors. In order to better understand escape behaviour of an African snake, the Namaqua dwarf adder (Bitis schneideri), I simulated predatory attacks on 51 free-ranging snakes, quantifying whether or not they fled. Additionally I measured body size, sex, body condition, and the surface temperature of the location of each snake, as well as the situation (buried or active on the surface) of the snake. I used generalized logistic regression to assess which variables predicted whether the snake fled during/following the simulated attack or not. Surface temperature was significantly associated with a flight-response, with warmer snakes more likely to flee than cooler snakes. Buried snakes were less likely to flee than snakes that were active on the surface. These findings generally support optimal escape theory in that both factors are strongly linked to risk of predation: temperature is likely to influence sprint performance, while situation is likely to influence the detectability of the snake to predators.",

In addition to having a very low number of protozoal species, little is known about temporal (seasonal) variation and geographic variation in protozoan diversity. Forty-one warthogs were harvested over a two-year period (2003–2005) from a wildlife area owned by the South African Air force (Ditholo). Additional samples were obtained from three animals at a farm near Northam (2004), plus three animals from a game ranch (Knapdaar) near Ellisras (2010). Several physical parameters of the digestive tract were measured, i.e. pH, temperature, organ length, weight of organ contents, dry matter, density and digesta in vitro gas production. Samples were collected from the caecum and colon for protozoal counts. In the animals from Ditholo and Northam, Telamodinium onyx was present in 42 of the 44 animals and was the predominant species. Megadinium aethiopicum was observed in 33 animals and Teratodinium sphaeredon was present in 10 of the warthogs. Blepharoconus krugerensis was present in four animals. A single species of both Cyclopostidae and Isotricha were present in two separate animals. In the warthogs harvested at Knapdaar, T. onyx, M. aethiopicum and B. krugerensis were present in all three animals, while M. sphaeredon was present in only two. Unexpectedly, the species Blepharosphaera intestinalis and Charonina equi were found in all three animals. Concentration of protozoans in caecum/colon fluid averaged about 25 × 103 per ml. In conclusion, the larger number of animals studied established that there can be considerable protozoan diversity among animals and that both seasonal and geographic variation occur.",

Therefore, diagnostics for the infection should be expedient, efficient and flexible in applicability. We compared and contrasted two diagnostic techniques for avian malaria; microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We also used both methods to determine the basic distribution and prevalence of avian malaria amongst passerines in the Western Cape. Approximately 1000 birds from 49 species were sampled from 26 wetlands across the Western Cape and examined for avian malarial infections. Infections were categorized by genus of malarial pathogen and by bird species infected. Using ocular diagnosis, 183 (18%) birds were infected, compared to 221 (23%) birds diagnosed with PCR. Plasmodium spp. were found to be the predominant cause of infection using both techniques, followed by Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, respectively. Although outcomes from both techniques were strongly correlated, PCR was superior in terms of its sensitivity and expediency. PCR also has wider applicability for users with varying experience in malarial diagnostics, further endorsing molecular diagnostics as the default technique for in-depth analysis of avian malaria epidemiology.Key words: avian malariamicroscopypolymerase chain reaction",

Satellite telemetry and uniquely engraved colour-rings were used to study moult-site fidelity of Egyptian geese marked at two sites in South Africa – Barberspan in the summer-rainfall region and Strandfontein in the winter-rainfall region. Twelve Egyptian geese were tagged with satellite GPS PTT transmitters while moulting at Barberspan and Strandfontein during 2008 and 2009, and a further 527 were colour-ringed between June 2007 and March 2009. Bi-monthly point counts of Egyptian geese and scans for colour-ringed birds were made at each study site from July 2007 until June 2010, resulting in 139 individually colour-ringed geese being re-sighted during the study period. We explored Egyptian geese dispersal distances away from the study sites and modelled moult-site fidelity from colour-ring return rates corrected for survivorship, sampling period efficiency and colour-ring detectability estimates. There were 12% and 29.7% colour-ring return rates for geese ringed at Barberspan and Strandfontein, respectively. Four of five moulting birds tagged at Barberspan with satellite transmitters returned to Barberspan to moult the following year. Two of these same birds moulted at Barberspan in the third year while the other two moulted elsewhere. One out of seven Egyptian geese satellitetagged at Strandfontein returned to the same site to moult the following year. One bird moulted at a nearby pan (5 km away), two moulted at estuaries less than 30 km from Strandfontein and one bird moulted at a farm dam 56 km away. Two birds satellite-tagged at Strandfontein did not moult the following year and returned to moult at Strandfontein in the third year. The moult-site fidelity model suggested that a minimum of 16% of Barberspan birds and 51% of Strandfontein birds returned to the same wetland to moult the following year. The apparent low moult-site fidelity at Barberspan suggested by colour-ring resightings may reflect the small number of birds colour-ringed at the site.Key words: waterfowlEgyptian goosesouthern Africatelemetrycolour-ring",

The major dietary components belonged to the groups Chlorophyta, Cirripedia, Rhodophyta and Bivalvia, and made up 71.7% of the diet in terms of a computed ranking index. There was a clear ontogenetic dietary shift with small fish feeding predominantly on algae and large fish on barnacles and mussels. This increasingly durophagous diet corresponded with a positive allometric growth pattern in the gape dimensions (width, height and surface area), adductor mandibulae muscle process and incisor width. Conversely, the relative gut length followed an isometric growth pattern, suggesting a decreased absorptive capacity. This isometric growth pattern is attributed to the better digestibility of the durophagous prey items when compared with algae and further corroborates a link between the morphology and an ontogenetic dietary shift observed in this species.",

Exploring the spatial distribution pattern of this species is problematic because of its nocturnal and secretive behaviour. In order to overcome these constraints, we used spotlight surveys on equidistant points along tracks to collect presence/absence data. Using a likelihood-based approach, we estimated occupancy and relative abundance of Cape hare populations in three national parks: Sidi Toui, Bouhedma and Jbil. We also combined the three parks in a single area to represent 'southern Tunisia' for investigating the factors affecting its distribution pattern. Sidi Toui showed the highest occupancy and relative abundance values (88.84 ± 10.95% and 7.97 hares km−2, respectively). Bouhedma was also recognised as high-quality hare habitat with occupancy and relative abundance values of 61.70 ± 11.70% and 2.85 hares km−2, respectively. The lowest occupancy (49.65 ± 26.25%) and relative abundance (2.10 hares km−2) estimates were encountered in Jbil. The combined parks model suggested that part of the distribution pattern of Cape hares can be explained by habitat quality. Spatial occupancy over southern Tunisia showed a positive relationship between its occurrence and the availability of Poaceae and Plantaginaceae.",

In this paper we present relevant information from a study involving a total of 47 individual ducks of two Afrotropical anatid species, Egyptian Goose, Alopochen aegyptiaca, and red-billed teal, Anas erythrorhyncha, using solarpowered GPS satellite transmitters of two different sizes (30 g and 22 g, respectively) at three very different southern African sites (Strandfontein wastewater treatment works in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, Barberspan Nature Reserve in the North West Province of South Africa, and Lake Manyame in north-central Zimbabwe).

We observed aggressive behaviour by African sunbirds (Cinnyris reichenowi and Cinnyris bouvieri) defending the nectar plant Hypoestes aristata against carpenter bees (Xylocopa caffra and Xylocopa inconstans) in the Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon. During 200 hours of observation, we recorded 38 cases of the sunbirds attacking carpenter bees; all these intrusions occurred only in the flower-richest patches of the plant. We predict that similar aggressive interactions will occur between other Old World nectarivorous birds and insects. Such interference competition between distantly related taxa could have an important impact on the evolution of pollination systems.",

    "abstract": "Sociality confers many benefits to gregarious animals, but group-living does not come without associated costs. Social living can cause anxiety, which if prolonged can lead to stress. We investigate correlates of anxiety and stress among wild adult male olive baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis) in Gashaka-Gumti National Park, Nigeria, and present the first examination of these correlates for male baboons living in forested environments. We used rates of self-directed behaviours (SDB) to quantify anxiety, and faecal glucocorticoid (FGC) concentrations to quantify physiological stress. We first examined the relationship between SDB rates and FGC concentrations, and then examined each measure in relation to a range of variables previously linked to anxiety or stress. We found that SDB rates and FGC concentrations were not correlated with each other, nor were they related to any measure of grooming or receiving aggression. SDB rates were negatively correlated with time spent with an adult female as nearest neighbour, but were unrelated to time with another adult male as closest conspecific. FGC concentrations were unrelated to time with adult nearest neighbours of either sex. Our results add to the growing body of literature examining the psychological and physiological costs of social living among wild primates.",

We examined jumping by the Cape dwarf gecko (Lygodactylus capensis) in terms of individuals’ varying states of tail autotomy and regeneration. Although longer jumps were less likely to be successful (i.e. the animal would not successfully grip the surface and fell to the ground), there was no difference in the distance over which animals with full and partial tails would attempt to jump. Both recently autotomized individuals and individuals with intact tails successfully jumped up to nine times their body length (snout–vent length). The jumping ability of L. capensis was therefore clearly not negatively impaired by tail loss, presumably because the geckos are using their hind legs to propel their jump. Their tails may, however, be important to control their landing as well as their locomotion on vertical surfaces. The high observed frequency of tail loss, coupled with rapid and complete regeneration (including the scansorial tail tip), suggests that caudal autotomy is an important survival tactic in this species.",

Many species are no longer able to survive in these urban areas; however, there are some that have been able to persist and even thrive in these habitats. One such species is Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi). Little is known about its existence in urban areas. Consequently we studied their seasonal variation in home range size, movements and foraging dynamics in the urban environment of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. In a pilot study in summer, adult fruit bats (n = 8) were caught, fitted with radio-transmitters, and their movements followed for 12 nights and days. Although their movements varied considerably, no bats left the urban environment. Some of the larger distances covered in a single night were 2 and 5 km. In winter, an additional ten adult fruit bats were caught and fitted with radio-transmitters. Movements were followed for three weeks during winter and spring respectively. Winter home range size was greater than spring home range size. During winter the bats fed mostly on syringa fruits (Melia azedarach), an alien invasive, while their diet in spring was more varied and included species of indigenous and exotic fruits. The reduced variety of fruit eaten in winter may be explained by a reduction in fruiting plant species, and thus a reliance on a few species to meet their dietary requirements. The bats would have a role in seed dispersal but therein lies the problem of them also dispersing invasive plants. Further research is needed to assess the role played by exotic and alien plant species in the continued success of urban wildlife, in particular fruit bats. The seasonal variation in home range size gives insight into the urban movements of Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bats. The use of exotic and invasive plants by these bats is also significant.",

A detection function was estimated separately for each species by pooling all the data from the five transects. For Cephalophus silvicultor, all sighting records of the two surveys were used because there was no significant difference in the encounter rates. In total, Philantomba monticola, red duikers (Cephalophus spp.), and C. silvicultor were observed 100, 80, 33 times, respectively. Their individual densities were estimated at 16.43/km2(95% CI: 11.4–23.6), 7.1/km2 (5.5–9.2), and 1.63 km2 (1.0–2.8), respectively. The encounter rate for P. monticola and C. silvicultor did not vary significantly between the transects, while that of red duikers was higher in the primary forest than in the young secondary or gallery forest. The duiker densities in our study area are among the highest in the African rainforest. Our results indicate that quick surveys may be an effective approach to estimate the densities of rare species.",

Queen succession occurs from within usually as a result of aggressive encounters with subordinate females that queue for reproductive succession following colony instability, which inevitably results in death of either the queen or the challenging conspecific. We monitored a queen succession following the death of the breeding male in a colony of the naked mole-rat, Heterocephalus glaber, prior to, during as well as after replacement of the original breeding female. The response of the pituitary luteotrophs was investigated in the non-reproductive females during this period of instability by the administration of endogenous gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and evaluating the subsequent luteinising hormone (LH) response in the blood. Larger and older non-breeding females engaged in aggressive encounters that culminated in death. The new breeding successor which arose from within the colony was a large female who continued to procreate. The six non-breeding females that were killed during reproductive takeover were larger and older females which exhibited elevated basal circulating LH concentrations as well as increased pituitary sensitivity as measured by the amount of releasable LH to an exogenous GnRH challenge. By contrast, non-breeding females that survived the succession were smaller and younger animals with reduced basal and GnRH challenged LH concentrations. Likewise, five non-breeding males which were heavier and older than those non-breeding males which survived were killed. These animals did not, however, show elevated basal or exogenous GnRH challenged LH concentrations when compared to the surviving males. The non-breeding animals of both sexes which survived the reproductive takeover event represented individuals which posed a minimal threat to the new successor and hence promoted the continuation of the marked reproductive skew that is prevalent in this highly inbred colonial subterranean hystricomorph.Key words: naked mole-ratHeterocephalus glaberluteinizing hormonequeenreproductive replacementsuccession",

The current study aimed to investigate the metabolic change as well as the hepatic inflammatory response caused by Eimeria papillata infection. Female Balb/c mice were orally infected with 103 sporulated oocysts of E. papillata. Plasma levels of alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamyl transferase (γ GT), total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were assessed, and liver tissue sections were examined under a microscope. The level of CYP3A11, CYP7A1, UGT1A1, and SULT2A1 were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. The data showed that infection of mice with E. papillata induced metabolic disturbance, inflammation and injury of the liver. This was evidenced (i) as increases in inflammatory cellular infiltrations, dilated sinusoids, and vacuolated hepatocytes, (ii) as increased plasma levels of ALT, AST, ALP, γ GT, total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose, (iii) as decreased mRNA expression of CYP3A11, UGT1A1, and SULT2A1, respectively and (iv) as increased mRNA level of CYP7A1. The data provide evidence that E. papillata parasites are able to induce a metabolic disturbances and hepatic tissue injury. Investigation of the expression profile of CYP, UGT and SULT genes in the hepatic tissues may help elucidate the underlying mechanism for regulation of the transcription of genes in the process of pathogenesis.",

We found a significant correlation between rank and females' mean self-scratching rates over the study period, with subordinates showing higher rates of self-scratching. Analysis of temporal variation in females' self-scratching rates indicated that while these rates were related to measures of both grooming and aggression, the relationship between rank and self-scratching remained significant even after controlling for these effects. Our data suggest that lower ranked female Barbary macaques suffer higher levels of anxiety than more dominant individuals, and hence that there is an emotional cost associated with having low social status in this species.",

We illustrate both species to clarify the features that identify and distinguish them and determine their true distributions by re-examining historical samples and by collecting new material from estuaries and lagoons along the west and south coasts of South Africa. Adult males of O. gammarellus have slender antennae and characteristic expanded, flattened, oar-like distal segments on pereopod 7. Adult males of P. platensis have the peduncle of antenna 2 strongly swollen and have bulbous, but not flattened, distal segments on pereopod 7. Both species occur under wrack and other debris along the banks of estuaries and sheltered lagoons. Orchestia gammarellus is found only along the south-west coast, in the Berg River Estuary, Langebaan Lagoon and the Diep River Estuary. Previous records from Knysna were misidentifications of P. platensis. Platorchestia platensis is found at one west coast site, Langebaan Lagoon, but is widely distributed from Cape Point eastwards to at least Algoa Bay. Both species share the same habitats as several other native beachfleas and competitive interactions between native and introduced species merit investigation.",

The diet of P. brantsii in this winter rainfall area confirms that it is a generalist herbivore, feeding on most plant species in proportion to their abundance, with winter annuals as well as succulent perennials being of particular importance. Summer was the only season in which foraging time (searching for food) exceeded feeding time. Additionally, feeding rates were depressed in summer, indicating that whistling rats may have been nutritionally stressed at this time. The findings of this study support the view that P. brantsii, whose physiology is not particularly well suited to the semi-arid regions in which it occurs, has partly overcome this constraint through diet selection. Furthermore, in the winter rainfall area where this study was conducted, individuals were least able to feed and forage effectively during summer when food availability is presumably lowest.",

Moreover, the rates of increase in head depth and width differ significantly between the sexes after reaching maturity so that adult males have larger heads for a given body size than adult females. I suggest three proximate mechanisms that may cause sex-related differences in adult head size of O. c. cuvieri based on natural selection; to reduce intersexual food competition, sexual selection involving mate acquisition in males, and ontogenetic change of allometry to improve reproductive output in females.",

Food restriction (70 % of normal daily food intake) for six weeks, under short day conditions, was associated with a significant decrease in body fat index and mass of the accessory glands, testes and epididymides, while a high-fibre diet resulted in a significant reduction in fat index and masses of both the accessory glands and epididymides. A low-fibre/low-protein diet had no significant effect on either fat index or masses of the reproductive organs. Although the three experimental diets resulted in assimilation of significantly less energy than the controls, they did not inhibit spermatogenesis. We conclude that reproduction in the pouched mouse in the Eastern Cape Province is probably opportunistic and that the winter inhibition of reproduction may be controlled by a reduction in available energy which results from a combination of the lower ambient temperatures of winter and reduced food quantity and/or quality.",

Low effective temperature and high wind speed result in more resting and less foraging by foxes. Th reverse applies at high effective temperature and low wind speed. No foraging occurred during rain, and only for short periods when the sun shone on overcast days. With the start of pair formation in June-July allogrooming, which was not influenced by abiotic factors, increased. Foxes resumed activity from the same resting sites each day.",

Mitochondrial DNA sequences (274 base pairs) of the cytochrome b gene of 25 C. angulata identified 10 haplotypes in three lineages. Estimates of coalescence time for the three lineagesranged from approximately 1.3 to 3.8 million years, implying that the lineages’ present distribution may reflect radiation during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene Epochs. The mtDNA sequences of Dassen Island and West Coast NationalPark populations did not differ significantly. The geographic heteroge neity in haplotype frequency distribution suggests that the Kleinzee population represents a distinct lineage from the two southwestern populations. The observed genetic structure of C. angulata has management implications for the conservation of this species. Until more information is available, we recommend that C. angulata should not be translocated between the northwestern andsouthwestern regions, to prevent disruption of local gene pools.",

(1991) that did not take density dependence into account and that were based on census data, suggest that many of the herbivore species in Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) are vulnerable to local extinction. As a result of low abundance, grysbok and bushpig populations are likely to become extinct within the next ten years. Species such as the common duiker, eland, buffalo, ostrich and bushbuck are likely to go extinct within the next 60 years, whereas populations such as the black rhino, kudu and red hartebeest appear less vulnerable and display an insignificant probability of local extinction. This conclusion was supported by the absence of discernible density-dependence effects in all but one of the species included in the analyses. In addition, population variance parameters (F2 of herbivore species from AENP, were larger than those recorded from the Kruger National Park and various elephant populations from South Africa. These data suggest that strict adherence to the management objectives, by managing for increasing mega-herbivore populations (elephant, black rhino) in AENP may have been responsible for increasing the risk of local extinction of other herbivore populations. Consequently, should the objectives of AENP be amended to incorporate broader biodiversity objectives, the recent extension of AENP, which increased habitat heterogeneity in the Park, may prove timely.",

Twelve focal feeding observations made between 8 October and 31 October 2002 were synthesized with literature reports to develop species lists of food and non food grasses and geophytes in renosterveld habitat. Failure load and tensile strength were determined in the field for leaves of food and non food plants that were spatially available to the tortoises and present in relative abundance during the course of the study. Leaves of geophyte food plants were fleshy and succulent with a low failure load and tensile strength. Leaves of food plant grasses had significantly higher failure loads and tensile strengths compared to leaves of food plant geophytes. In non food plants there was no signifi cant difference in failure load between grasses and geophytes, but tensile strength was signifi cantly higher in the grasses. Non food plant grasses and geophytes overall had significantly higher failure load and tensile strength values than did food plants. Two non food plants that overlapped in mechanical strength to the food plants either have toxic/unpalatable chemicals in high amounts or are recent invasive species to the renosterveld. Thus, these studies support the hypothesis that leaf biomechanical properties may be an important factor in determining the diet of the geometric tortoise and perhaps tortoises in general.",

Sex-related intraspecific karyotype variation was not found. The shared chromosome numbers and general similarity of the karyotypes (FN = 186–192) provide a new synapomorphy to support their monophyly, which is already indicated by anatomical and mtDNA markers.

This was likely due to higher food availability during our study, coupled with lower white rhino density. These findings suggest that during high rainfall years, white rhinos at a density of 3/km2 will not overutilize food in the park. Dispersal, initiated by declining food resources, is used to manage white rhino population size in HiP. We suggest that during high rainfall years it is unlikely that dispersal rates will increase.

It becomes even more difficult when trying to identify similar-sized skulls. Additional characteristics of the skull are discussed that may be useful when used along with the original identification key. The presence of a bar across the foramen ovale in the skull of T. gregorianus proved to be the most heuristic. However, because it is not absent in all T. swinderianus skulls, it should be used in combination with the other characteristics.

Isopods were captured in highest numbers in the lower to middle reaches of the estuary, which appears to be related to a preference by C. fluviatilis for sediment with high mud content. Size-frequency distributions tended to be unimodal, becoming slightly bimodal only after manca release, which occurred predominantly during the warm summer months (December–March). Female C. fluviatilis reached sexual maturity at a length of about 6.0 mm, and males at about 5.2 mm. Fecundity was positively correlated to female body length.

Four microsatellite markers, originally developed for the African grey parrot, were characterized for use in the echo parakeet. Given its recent population bottleneck, a relatively high level of genetic diversity has been retained in the wild population (H O = 0.57). The genetic data are examined for their value in the conservation management of this species, both captive and wild. A number of conservation and breeding management issues are highlighted which warrant further investigation, for example in selecting captive breeding pairs and bachelor males for public display. Whilst four mircosatellite loci can only provide a limited insight, they do provide useful information relating to the remaining echo parakeet population and highlight that further genetic studies would prove invaluable to the conservation management of this species.",

Petrodromus tetradactylus occurred in monogamous male-female pairs that defended partially overlapping home ranges. There was virtually no overlap between the ranges of adjoining pairs, indicating low population density although not negating mutual avoidance or territorial defence, which could be inferred by incongruent intra-pair ranges. Our findings largely concur with those of a similar study of P. tetradactylus in Kenya and studies of other elephant-shrew species elsewhere. Home ranges estimated from a mean of >34 radio-tracking fixes over a short period suggest that male home range areas were similar to those reported in previous studies, while home range areas of females, although variable, were on average smaller than those previously reported. Most males and some females had two separate centres of activity that confounded the accurate estimation of their home ranges. The reason for this is unclear but may be related to habitat characteristics and quality, as it was not the result of home range shifts.",

In many cases the rivers are transformed by the combined impact of alien species, dams and weirs, water abstraction, water regulation, pollution from industrial, agricultural, mining, forestry and urban areas as well as by sedimentation. These factors have caused the species distribution to become fragmented and have made it vulnerable to possible extinction. Because of the transformed nature of river systems in South Africa, the use of older historical data for biodiversity planning and conservation assessments might increase the risk of underrating conservation status and risks.",

It is not known how different habitats and plant characteristics affect the foraging behaviour of X. rutilus. We used giving-up densities (GUDs) as a measure of foraging efficiency to explore the foraging costs of environmental heterogeneity. To determine foraging efficiency across spatial scales, we established food patches in two microhabitats (open and cover), which were nested within three habitats (koppie, edge and bushland). When foraging in a cover microhabitat, foraging efficiency decreased away from the koppie, but when in the open microhabitat, foraging efficiency was lowest near the koppie edge. Second, to determine foraging efficiency with common plant toxins, we presented the squirrels with seeds soaked in either tannic acid, oxalic acid or distilled water (control). Foraging efficiency did not differ between tannic-treated and control seeds, but oxalic-treated seeds had higher GUDs. Overall, our results suggest that X. rutilus is a remarkably efficient forager across multiple axes of environmental heterogeneity, which may have intriguing consequences for the ecological community.",

The study was conducted to determine the best period of exogenous feeding and the stage when the digestive tract is able to digest processed microdiets. Results indicated that at hatching, the digestive tract, mouth and anus were closed. The opening of the mouth and anus were observed 3–4 DAH, whereas complete separation of the entire gut was observed on 5 DAH. Exogenous feeding started 5–6 DAH, but complete yolk exhaustion occurred 7–8 DAH, indicating a period of mixed feeding. Mucosal epithelial folds were first noted 3 DAH in the anterior intestine and became profound with some goblet cells (mucous cells) by 6 DAH. At 7 DAH the mucous cells had started secreting both neutral and acid glycoconjugates. The first intestinal single loop occurred at 28–30 DAH and a double loop at 45–50 DAH. Each coiling was proceeded by larval weight increase. By 7 DAH the buccopharyngeal cavity was lined by a layer of squamous epithelial cells with scattered goblet cells and tastebuds that became numerous by 15 DAH. At hatching, the liver and the pancreas were undifferentiated, but on 3 DAH the hepatocytes and zymogen granules of the pancreas became clear. By 7 DAH both organs enlarged, making extensions into the posterior. Intestines coiling at 28–30 DAH coincided with the beginning of external dressing of the scales, a period when B. altianalis started transforming into a juvenile. By 7–8 DAH the digestive structure showed all the necessary digestive features that could enable the larvae to digest any compound diet suggesting that it may be feasible to substitute or offer a complete microdiet during larvae nursing with reduced larval mortality.",

    "abstract": "Animal behavioural traits determine trophic interaction strength, which in turn structures ecological communities. Behavioural responses to prey cues can inform upon how prey are perceived and detected and therefore determine whether certain stimuli can increase or dampen predatory efficiency and therefore community structuring. We examined the functional foraging traits of an amphibian predator Xenopus laevis on mosquito larvae (Culex sp.), with regard to responses towards different prey cues. We assessed a suite of foraging behaviours exhibited when supplied with three abundances of live prey (2, 4 and 20); non-injury prey cues; prey injury kairomones from mechanically damaged prey in order to determine the importance of cues in stimulating foraging. High abundance of live prey caused frogs to visit the top of the arena significantly more than in the other treatments. This suggests that hydromechanical and visual cues alert X. laevis to prey items in different spatial zones, which results in foraging where the prey have aggregated, while the non-injury prey cue resulted in a decrease in foraging behaviours. The injury kairomone cue elicited a significantly farther distance travelled, and similar responses in terms of velocity of movement and duration of time spent moving when supplied with 20 live prey items. Previous work on X. laevis predation has focused on prey detection via lateral line sensitivity, however, the strength of response elicited by the prey injury kairomone treatment indicates that there are also complex olfactory pathways involved in detecting prey items. This is possibly related to abiotic context (i.e. turbid ponds) and high predator density in the wild.",

We determined haematological and serum biochemical values for ten Temminck's pangolins rescued from the illegal wildlife trade in Zimbabwe and placed in the care of the Tikki Hywood Foundation as part of their rehabilitation. Our results suggest a large overlap in serum biochemistry and haematology values with previously reported values for other pangolin species, but also suggest some apparent differences. Haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and albumin:globulin ratio were positively correlated with mass, while alkaline phosphatase and amylase were negatively correlated with mass. Lymphocytes and monocytes were positively correlated with body condition, while mean corpuscular volume, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin were negatively correlated with condition. These results suggest that at least some parameters are independent of mass and are directly correlated with body condition and may therefore be informative in rapid health assessments of confiscated individuals.",

In order to gain biological insights into an understudied scorpion species, the current study investigates fine-scale spatial distributions and sexual dimorphism in the South African endemic Drab Thick-tail Scorpion (Parabuthus planicauda). The species closely track rocky areas, with the sexes homogenously distributed across habitats. Varying adult sex ratios are evident at each sampling area, likely influenced by differing vegetation cover and predation pressures. When considering size-corrected measurements, several characters are significantly sexually dimorphic in P. planicauda; this sexual dimorphism is not readily observable (<10% difference in size) based on uncorrected measurements, thereby rendering the identification of males and females in the field difficult. Even so, sexually dimorphic characters in females appear to be shaped mainly by natural selection (e.g. carapace width, pedipalp patella and metasoma), likely for enhanced feeding ability, fecundity, parental care and juvenile survival. In contrast, the male morphology may be primarily subject to sexual selection pressures on features used during courtship and mating (e.g. pectines, chela movable finger, pedipalp femur, 2nd and 4th legs). Taken together, the results reported on here add novel preliminary information on the understudied biological aspects of a South African endemic scorpion species.",

Organisms at higher trophic levels may contain metals at elevated concentrations, as a result of accumulation from anthropogenic and natural sources, potentially making them more susceptible to detrimental effects, as well as passing them on to consumers. The concentrations of thirty metals were quantified in hake (Merluccius capensis), kingklip (Genypterus capensis), monkfish (Lophius vomerinus) and chokka (Loligo reynaudii) collected from the South Atlantic Ocean of South Africa in February 2017 and February 2019, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Metal concentrations and composition in nektobenthic chokka differed significantly from the three demersal fish predators (hake, kingklip, and monkfish). Demersal fish metal concentrations and relative pattern compositions (fingerprints) were similar. Because the samples were collected within an 80 km radius, the differences are likely as a result of a combination of factors, such as diet, habitat (depth), and differences in the physiological regulation of metals between cephalopods and fish, rather than location. Based on South African estimated daily intake, total hazard quotient and European Union limits for mercury, cadmium and lead, these four economically important species from the South Atlantic Ocean are safe for human consumption. Plankton, herbivorous marine species, and larger predators, such as sharks and dolphins, should be studied to obtain further insight into metals as baseline for monitoring possible future pollution and effects from climate change, trophic transfer, toxic effects, and human consumer safety.",

Because of the natural hydrological functioning of pans, these systems are usually restricted to arid regions and complete desiccation occurs seasonally. In the eastern provinces of South Africa many pans are perennial in nature often remaining inundated for several years. A study of the aquatic invertebrate community structure of selected perennial pans indicated that when these systems undergo complete desiccation, the communities are comparable to the communities of ephemeral ecosystems. During these periods the community displays normal succession patterns with branchiopod crustacean dominating the community structure a few weeks after inundation. These perennial ecosystems are comparable to similar habitats around the world but are under increasing threat due to an increase in mining and agricultural activities within the study area.",

To date few parasite studies in South Africa, and especially the Northern Cape, have focused on fleas, while those that have are biased by small sample sizes. In an attempt to address the paucity of information fleas were collected from five small carnivore species trapped at Loxton and Kimberley in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa. The aim of the study was to contribute to current data on the flea diversity found on various small carnivore species. Small carnivores were trapped and while anesthetized the fleas were manually removed from the fur of the animals. In total 48 small carnivores were trapped of which 30 harboured fleas. Of the five flea species that were recorded the most numerous and prevalent was Echidnophaga gallinacea followed by Ctenocephalides connatus and Ctenocephalides damarensis. Fleas were more numerous and prevalent on the small-spotted cat, Felis nigripes, followed by the yellow mongoose, Cynictispenicillata. The flea community on the small carnivores consisted of fleas that prefer carnivores as principal hosts and also fleas that prefer rodents. The latter maybe acquired through predation on rodents.Key words: Siphonapterafleassmall carnivoresSouth Africa",

We collected data on nest sites and usage for 42 nests over three breeding seasons in the communal areas surrounding the Matobo National Park. For the active nests in the breeding seasons of 2008/9 and 2009/10 the mean nearest neighbour distances were 4.41 km and 3.53 km, respectively. Most nests were found in granite crevices (67%) while the remainder were found in five different tree species. Most nests (90%) were in areas of subsistence crop farming, the remainder (10%) were found in forests and open savannas. The high breeding density of the southern ground hornbill in the communal areas surrounding the Matobo National Park in Zimbabwe could be attributed in part to traditional Ndebele culture which, for the most part, protects this species. Food also appears to be relatively abundant under communal farming conditions.",

Forty-six warthogs were culled in autumn (15), winter (16) and spring (15). Each individual warthog was screened for ectoparasites for 7–10 minutes by 3–4 persons. Parasites were removed using forceps and stored in 70% ethanol. Ticks were identified by an expert taxonomist, while fleas and lice were identified using published books containing their respective taxonomic keys. A single flea (Echidnophaga larina) and louse (Haematopinus phacocheri) species and three tick species (Hyalomma truncatum, Rhipicephalus gertrudae and Rhipicephalus simus) were recovered from 46 warthogs. The louse and flea were the most abundant ectoparasitic taxa, while the ticks had lower mean abundances. This is the first record of the tick R. gertrudae on warthogs in South Africa. Temporal variation in parasite abundance was observed. The louse was most abundant during spring and summer, while the flea preferred cooler and drier winter conditions. Hyalomma truncatum and R. gertrudae both preferred warmer spring conditions. In general, parasite species richness in the non-indigenous host population was low, which could support the parasite release hypothesis.Key words: ectoparasitesflealousePhacochoerus africanustickwarthog",

Hair samples from eight species of co-occurring small mammals in two separate locations were analysed for stable carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) isotope ratios. In addition, we investigated the seasonal variation in diet again by using variation in isotopic composition of one of the most common small mammal species, the Cape spiny mouse. We also analysed seeds and leaves from the most common plant species at each study site. Results showed that some dietary separation exists among these coexisting small mammals. Geographic differences exist in isotope signatures within the Cape spiny mouse, possibly resulting from area-related variations in isotope values of plants, as well as differences in the animals' diets. A. subspinosus hair shows little to no seasonal fluctuation of isotopic signals, except in summer, which possibly indicates a stable diet over much of the year. We conclude that the isotopic approach to determine trophic levels is limited by significant geographic variation in plant isotopes and enrichment in seeds compared to leaves.",

P. pantherinum laid their eggs at an average depth of 18.95 m (min: 7.4 m; max: : 26.8 m) preferentially attaching their eggs singly onto sea fans Leptogorgia palma, Eunicella papillosa and Eunicella tricoronata. H. pictus laid their eggs at an average depth 3m(min: 1m; max: 30.7 m) and attached their eggs, predominantly in pairs, to the seaweed Bifurcariopis capensis. The average temperature at which eggs were found were similar (15°C) and eggs were laid year-round. Embryo development was observed in the laboratory under constant controlled environmental conditions of 14 and 17°C. Embryo length-age relationships were linear for both species and there were significant differences in growth rate at the two temperatures. For P. pantherinum average growth rate was 0.37 mm/day at 14°C and 0.79 mm/day at 17°C. The average incubation period was 266 days at 14°C and 125 days at 17°C.

Morocco presents high levels of endemism and appears to be the centre of diversity for the genus. Further differentiation was found within the clade distributed in Tunisia and Algeria, with the discovery of new phylogenetic patterns. In addition, a phylogeny combining all published CO1 data for the genus emphasized the ongoing complex situation regarding the genus' taxonomy. Highly similar sequences were attributed to different species by different authors throughout the tree, and no differentiated monophyletic species could be resolved. This lack of congruence between morphologically defined species and genetic lineages is a major hindrance in the study of the highly complex genus Buthus.",

    "abstract": "The greater cane rat is a recently domesticated monogastric herbivore, and the importance of the caecum in the functioning of its digestive tract has frequently been mentioned. However, no data are available on caecal fermentative activity of this animal and research on the digestive physiology was only performed in adult animals. The present work was initiated to describe some parameters of the digestive tract anatomy and to study caecal fermentation of the growing cane rat. Thirty 40-day-old weaned cane rats were used in this experiment. Six of them were immediately euthanased and 12 were housed in a collective pen for gastrointestinal tract (GIT) parameters measurements. Twelve others were kept in individual cages to record growth and food intake. Captive cane rats received a pelleted diet containing 12.5% of crude protein and 16.7% of lignocellulose. Six of the 12 collectively housed animals were euthanased on day 82 and a further six on day 103. The growth rate increased with age (P < 0.01) with a linear growth curve (P < 0.001) while the feed intake (g/kg body weight) did not vary (P > 0.05). The caecum represented the largest compartment of the digestive tract constituting more than 40% of total GIT contents. Acetate was the most abundant short-chain fatty acid with more than 70% of the total, followed by propionate (less than 25%) and butyrate (around 5%). Short-chain fatty acid profiles varied with age: when age increased, the acetate proportion increased (P < 0.01), the propionate proportion decreased (P < 0.001) and the butyrate proportion remained unchanged (P > 0.05). The propionate/butyrate ratio showed a decrease with an increase in age (P = 0.05). Ammonia concentrations did not vary with age (P > 0.05). It is concluded that the caecum is an important site of fermentation in the growing cane rat.",

Field observations identified plants being fed on by T. pisana, accounting for almost half of the dune plant species present in the study area. Five plant species, on which snails were found frequently and in high abundance, were selected for feeding preference experiments. Laboratory experiments and field observations indicate that T. pisana feed preferentially on Tetragonia decumbens over Osteospermum moniliferum, Osyris compressa and Cynanchum obtusifolium. It is clear that while T. pisana is reported to have a generalist diet, consuming a range of plant species commonly found in South African dune vegetation, it also exhibits a definite preference for T. decumbens. The reasons for this preference need to be investigated further.",

This genus dominated the small mammal communities before and after the burn, and never disappeared from the burnt patches. Its numbers also did not crash directly after the burn, as have been reported in most other studies. Movement from the burnt areas was observed, which may have had a significant impact on the numbers of rodents caught both inside the enclosure and in the more natural areas outside. Our study suggests that fire can be investigated as a tool to keep rodent densities down in areas where they are nuisance animals, especially when used in conjunction with models that forecast outbreaks of Mastomys.

Raptors came from as far away as Ghana, although most of the birds were from Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces, South Africa. In 48% of cases (n = 304), the causes of injuries were not documented. Of the 252 cases in which the causes of injury were recorded, the most frequent causes of injury (for all raptor species combined) were poisoning (23%, n = 59), followed by motor vehicle collisions (17%, n = 43), falls from nests (10%, n = 25), and collisions with fences (8%, n = 20). For the 516 individuals for which the outcome was known, the most common outcome was 'release' (37%, n = 193). Our results highlight the impact of poisoning on raptors and underpin the need for increased public education about the ecological and cultural importance of raptors, and the threats that raptors face.",

Both sexes grew at a similar rate until the onset of maturation, after which male growth and survival rates declined. Male mortality rate was significantly higher than estimated for females explaining both the older ages attained by females (12 years) compared to males (9 years) and a female-dominated adult population. Maturation proceeded faster in males than in females, but was considerably delayed in both age and length. Female reproductive contribution was double that of males despite males maturing a year earlier. Intraspecific life history comparisons with riverine and early impoundment populations suggest that L. capensis has largely maintained its riverine life history characteristics. These characteristics are common in large fishes that are well-adapted to seasonal riverine environments, but often show high vulnerability to damming or overfishing. The absence of a directed fishery and the availability of periodic floodplains that form when marginal vegetation is inundated by either the unregulated inflow of the Orange River or local erratic rains is suggested to have played a vital role for the successful establishment of L. capensis within the impoundment.",

The aim of this study was to compare the current surf-zone fish assemblage at King's Beach, South Africa, to a similar study conducted three decades ago, before the collapse of many exploited shore fishes in the region. Beach seine nets (mesh sizes of 10 and 50 mm) were used to target juvenile and adult fishes bimonthly from February to August 2011 over the high tide around sunset. A total of 14 species were recorded in both the 30 m and 100 m seine nets. The catch in these seine nets was dominated by Pomadasys olivaceus and Liza richardsonii, and this was significantly different to three decades ago, when P. olivaceus, Sarpa salpa and Diplodus capensis dominated the catch. Important linefish species belonging to the Sparidae and Sciaenidae families were significantly smaller and less abundant in this study. Two sparids, S. salpa and Lithognathus mormyrus, which made a large contribution to the surf-zone catch three decades ago were absent during this study. Reasons for the significant shifts in the surf-zone fish community, including overexploitation of the linefish and potential habitat modification, are discussed.",

Molecular studies were performed by sequencing the near complete 18S rDNA gene of the fluke to assess its phylogenetic position within the Dicrocoeliidae. The resulting estimate of evolutionary divergence between the fluke and other dicrocoeliids was 1.60 ± 0.22% base differences per site. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the fluke is a new species within Dicrocoeliidae falling in a cluster with the genera Corrigia, Lyperosomum, Concinnum and Eurytrema although phylogenetic relationships among these genera are not well resolved. This is the first dicrocoeliid reported from rodents in eastern Africa.",

Thus, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the growth rate and morphometrics of S. cylindraceus in St Lucia. Growth lines of this species are too indistinct and irregular to be of any use. This study, therefore, adopted a more direct method of monitoring the shell length of individuals, by caging them in situ. Shell measurements were taken from the individuals in cages and the surrounding environment at monthly intervals for one year. Thereafter, salinities decreased below their tolerance range and the experiment was terminated. Caged and uncaged animals had a shell length of 31.0 ± 4.5 and 31.7 ± 2.3 mm after a year of growth, respectively. An overall growth rate of 0.049 ± 0.059 mm/d was derived for the caged animals. In conclusion, first year growth rates appeared lower than previously recorded for S. cylindraceus. Additionally, it appears that animals are unable to survive in the prevailing harsh environment of St Lucia to reach maximum size.",

This, combined with the recent drought, led to low water levels, hypersaline conditions and dramatic losses in biodiversity. The excavation of a beach spillway between the estuary and the Mfolozi River mouth in 2012, combined with the commencement of a wet phase in the preceding year, has alleviated the freshwater deprivation crisis. This study compares the meso-zooplankton composition within the channel on both flood and ebb tides, providing a preliminary understanding of the role of the Mfolozi channel in the migration and recruitment of organisms. Abundance was higher on ebb tides, while species richness was higher on flood tides. A total of 53 zooplankton taxa were recorded in the channel. Of these, one had never been recorded in St Lucia before, namely the gastropod Pterotrachea cf. hippocampus. Additionally, the ctenophore Pleurobrachia cf. pileus and the mysid Gastrosaccus gordonae were again recorded for the first time since the late 1970s. Results show that the beach spillway has facilitated recruitment into St Lucia from the ocean and the Mfolozi River. Further research is needed to ascertain what effect this recruitment has on long-term zooplankton community structure.",

A study of the aquatic invertebrate community structure of selected perennial pans indicated that when these systems undergo complete desiccation, the communities are comparable to the communities of ephemeral ecosystems. During these periods the community displays normal succession patterns with branchiopod crustacean dominating the community structure a few weeks after inundation. These perennial ecosystems are comparable to similar habitats around the world but are under increasing threat due to an increase in mining and agricultural activities within the study area.",

In contrast, R. pumilio was able to find caches of all sizes in wet soil conditions but recovery success of small caches (single-seed) was poor in dry soil conditions. This suggests that scatter-hoarding may have evolved in A. subspinosus as an anti-pilfering strategy.

Small carnivores were trapped and while anesthetized the fleas were manually removed from the fur of the animals. In total 48 small carnivores were trapped of which 30 harboured fleas. Of the five flea species that were recorded the most numerous and prevalent was Echidnophaga gallinacea followed by Ctenocephalides connatus and Ctenocephalides damarensis. Fleas were more numerous and prevalent on the small-spotted cat, Felis nigripes, followed by the yellow mongoose, Cynictispenicillata. The flea community on the small carnivores consisted of fleas that prefer carnivores as principal hosts and also fleas that prefer rodents. The latter maybe acquired through predation on rodents.",

The major dietary components belonged to the groups Chlorophyta, Cirripedia, Rhodophyta and Bivalvia, and made up 71.7% of the diet in terms of a computed ranking index. There was a clear ontogenetic dietary shift with small fish feeding predominantly on algae and large fish on barnacles and mussels. This increasingly durophagous diet corresponded with a positive allometric growth pattern in the gape dimensions (width, height and surface area), adductor mandibulae muscle process and incisor width. Conversely, the relative gut length followed an isometric growth pattern, suggesting a decreased absorptive capacity. This isometric growth pattern is attributed to the better digestibility of the durophagous prey items when compared with algae and further corroborates a link between the morphology and an ontogenetic dietary shift observed in this species.",

There were interspecific differences in these distances and much of this interspecific variation could be explained by body size, with larger species tending to be found further away from manmade structures. In contrast, we found no evidence of an effect of group size or vegetation structure on the distance that ungulates were seen from man-made structures. These results lend further evidence that size influences sensitivity to the presence of human disturbance, and that management strategies may need to tailor to the range requirements of larger species.",

We collected faecal samples from nine spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta), 15 lions (Panthera leo) and 13 African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) from Luangwa Valley, Zambia. The most common gastrointestinal parasites found were Isospora spp., Spirometra sp., Taeniidae and Sarcosystis spp. Twenty-eight per cent of all samples were co-infected with Spirometra sp. and Taeniidae, with co-infection rates highest among lions (67%). Thirty-three per cent (3/9) of spotted hyaenas were infected with Isospora sp. Ninety-two per cent (12/13) of wild dog were infected with Sarcocystis, similar to results from studies in South Africa. One lion was infected with a parasite whose morphology suggested Strongyloides sp., not previously been reported in lions. Samples from one lion and two spotted hyaenas yielded no gastrointestinal parasites. Overall, parasite species were consistent with those found from studies in other regions of Africa and are likely a result of ingesting infected prey. To our knowledge this study provides the most comprehensive survey of gastrointestinal parasite infection in large carnivores from this region of Africa to date and provides baseline data for future studies.",

Copepods from the present study were collected from the gills of Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) from Kibos Fish Farm, Kenya (between December 2017 and April 2018) and Sharqia Governorate (June 2019) and El-Minia (between July and December 2018) in Egypt. They were identified as L. monodi based on morphology and genetic data. Parasites were studied morphologically with the aid of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and female infection levels calculated. Genetically, the specimens were studied using fragments of 18S and 28S rDNA. SEM analyses revealed additional diagnostic morphological features for the three adult males (elusive) and 249 females. These data were used to update the identification key for male Lamproglena species. Prevalence, mean intensity and mean abundance of the females were calculated as 13.5%, 8.6 and 1.2 respectively. Both 18S and 28S rDNA fragments confirmed the distinctness of L. monodi from previously characterised Lamproglena species, with distances of 1.22–1.94% (17–27 bp) for 18S rDNA and 15.66–18.1% (111–128 bp) for 28S rDNA. Haplotypes obtained from male and female specimens were identical, confirming the identity of the male specimens. This is the first genetic study of Lamproglena from Africa, the first SEM and genetic study of male L. monodi, and the first geographical report of this parasite from Kenya. The male and molecular data reported herein provide a useful point of reference for future Lamproglena studies.",

This can have implications for conservation, since different polychaete species will not be equally vulnerable to exploitation, and uncertainties about the names of species make it difficult to monitor harvests to assess catch rates. This study develops a consensus view of English and Afrikaans common names for known bait species, building on names already used by fishers and in the literature. The greatest (but not complete) consensus in use of names among fishers and in the literature was for species in the families Arenicolidae, Eunicidae and Nereididae. However, most species are known by multiple common names, some common names are used for multiple species in different families, and the use of at least one name has changed. By applying principles like those used to develop scientific names, we propose a binomial naming system that includes a collective common name that applies to the family or genus, and which, for most species, is already used by fishers, as well as qualifying names that apply to the individual species. The qualifying names may refer to a morphological character that can be observed in the field, its distribution, ecology or the specific name. Research is needed to develop consensus names in isiXhosa.",

We examined the community structure and species diversity of nothobranchiids (African rivulines) in rainforest streams of Cameroon's southern plateau and part of the coastal plain, using data on 19 environmental variables for ecological indices and multivariate analyses. In total, 1 019 individual cyprinodontiforms assigned to 14 species (largely species of Aphyosemion) were collected, for a global sampling effort of 78.6%. The presence of nothobranchiids in the study area was associated with several local environmental factors common to all sampling sites, mainly canopy cover above the watercourse and physicochemical characteristics of the stream habitat. Distribution of the species was strongly spatially structured, driven by the site's elevation and the water temperature, and influenced primarily by the riparian vegetation, substrate type, water conductivity and flow velocity. However, fish species richness did not differ significantly between the five sectors sampled and by elevation. The nothobranchiid communities were highly diverse (Shannon's H′ = 2.28 ± 0.05; Pielou's J = 0.87) and the species evenly distributed. Seven species were exclusive to a single sector, others were prevalent in multiple sectors, and no species was common to all sectors. Affinities between species were relatively few, though there were exceptions, and most species tended to exclude each other. These findings highlight nothobranchiids as local fish assemblages having high biotic integrity and responsiveness to environmental degradation. In tropical Africa, these fishes often occupy fragile habitats influenced by anthropogenic activities. A better understanding of the unifying role of habitat in ecology will assist management efforts to promote biodiversity conservation.Keywords: Aphyosemioncommunity structurediversityenvironmental variablesEpiplatyshabitatkillifishtropical freshwater",

An updated description, together with genetic data, is provided using the holotype in conjunction with additional specimens collected at or near the type locality, to facilitate comparative analysis of other Arabella species and improve taxonomy within the genus. Arabella iricolor can be distinguished primarily through the long notopodial cirri that reach to or beyond the prechaetal lobes on chaetigers 1–9, in combination with unidentate maxilla I on both sides, four short digitiform pygidial cirri and gradually tapering ventralmost chaetae. The updated description and molecular information enabled the identification of a new species co-habiting with A. iricolor at the type locality and elsewhere. The new species, Arabella ampulliformis sp. nov., is characterised by two lateral pygidial lobes that extend into short cirri, appearing ampulliform in lateral view, in combination with a bifid left maxilla I, short left and long right maxilla II, short notopodial cirri and gradually tapering ventralmost chaetae. A new species from South Africa is also described, Arabella umgazanae sp. nov., distinguished through a bifid left maxilla I, short left and long right maxilla II, short notopodial cirri, two large lateral pygidial lobes and gradually tapering ventralmost chaetae along with additional characters relating to the chaetae, mandibles and maxillary apparatus. Problems surrounding the identification of Arabella species in South Africa are discussed in conjunction with details of the other species reported from the region.ZooBank: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:9E60941E-7F95-4327-8884-5A56A5E7F309Keywords: AnnelidaArabella ampulliformis sp. novArabella umgazanae sp. novpolychaetere-descriptiondistributionCOI16SmorphologyOenonidae",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe reef-building serpulid polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus is an invasive species in brackish waters in tropical and temperate zones worldwide and often has massive impacts on ecosystems and anthropogenic activities. In Prokopos Lagoon in Greece, the species has constructed large reefs over the past few decades which occupy a large area of the lagoon. In this study, we used high-resolution aerial photography to map the distribution of these reefs, and conducted a one-year field survey to investigate settlement and growth parameters, including abundance, biomass and body length, using artificial settlement panels. We correlated our findings with physicochemical measurements, specifically focusing on temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. Salinity exhibited marked and rapid fluctuations, ranging from less than 2 to over 42 Practical Salinity Units (PSU). These variations did not affect the adult population, but settlement only occurred at salinities above approximately 10 PSU and only when water temperatures surpassed 18–20 °C. Settlement was reduced when temperatures were high (> 28 °C) but was not affected by high salinity. The maximum abundance measured was 880 000 individuals m−2, and reefs attained a weight of 18 kg m−2 in 11 months. This study contributes further to understanding the species' environmental tolerances and life cycle, which in turn may help to design future management measures.Keywords: brackish watersecosystem engineerMediterranean Seanon-native speciestransitional waters",

Nonetheless, despite the major contribution it has made, we now know that the biodiversity of Polychaeta (commonly known as bristleworms) in southern Africa has been underestimated by more than 500 species. As one of the top 20 polychaete families highlighted as requiring revision in southern Africa, direct observation of magelonids in the collections of Iziko Museums of South Africa and Natural History Museum, London identified by John Day, and additional material has been carried out. This has revealed that the original description of Magelona capensis was based on two species. Consequently, an additional redescription of the holotype of M. capensis is provided herein, and the additional material is described as Magelona ekapa sp. nov. The new species shares similarities with eight species comprising the 'Magelona pitelkai group', which is further discussed. A redescription of M. cincta is also provided based on the holotype and freshly collected material. A specimen from Morrumbene Estuary, southern Mozambique, originally identified as M. cincta likely represents an undescribed species: images and a description are provided here, but the species will remain undescribed until further material becomes available.

Ten pronotal colour patterns were recorded, of which two (brown with two black spots and black with/without very faint brown bands of variable lengths and positions) are reported for the first time. Pronota of most R. phoenicis from Busia and Uganda were black with/without very faint brown bands of variable lengths and positions. Samples of R. phoenicis from Kwale were dominated by four reddish brown and three black bands, which either ran through the pronotal length or the reddish-brown bands coalesced anteriorly. The following pronotal colour patterns were male-specific: (i) two reddish brown bands, approximately ¾ the pronotal length and coalescing anteriorly, (ii) two reddish brown bands running through the pronotal length but discontinuous towards the posterior end and (iii) a brown pronotum with two black spots. Only the females had (i) two faint reddish brown bands running through the pronotal length, fading posteriorly and (ii) four reddish brown and three black bands, two of the former on either halves coalescing posteriorly. Females had longer snouts and mesocoxal distance, and wider elytra than males. Males possessed a longer profemur than females. Morphometric polymorphism was not linked to the site of sample collection. These findings provide additional diagnostic features and improve sexing of P. phoenicis and open opportunities for further research on the mechanisms for polymorphism in the species.Keywords: morphometric measurementspolymorphismPrinciple Component Analysissexual dimorphism",

Along the Atlantic coast of North America, specimens of Scolelepis inhabiting high-energy beaches have long been erroneously identified as the European species Scolelepis squamata (O.F. Müller, 1806). In this study, we examined specimens of Scolelepis collected from Massachusetts to Virginia, finding they match Scolelepis agilis (Verrill, 1873), originally described from beaches in New Jersey. Scolelepis agilis can be most easily distinguished from S. squamata based on differences in palp ciliary pattern, morphology of neuropodial lamellae, and the quantity and start of both notopodial and neuropodial hooded hooks. Live specimens of S. agilis collected from New York were also examined to provide data on their reproduction and morphometric analyses. In addition, molecular data (18S, 28S rRNA, cytochrome c oxidase I and 16S rRNA) showed that specimens of S. agilis from the north to mid-Atlantic coast formed a monophyletic group (p-distance ≤ 0.004 for MA, RI, NY and VA populations) and were distinct from S. squamata (p-distance ≥ 0.196 (0.03 SE)). The molecular data also suggest the presence of several misidentified or undescribed species of Scolelepis, highlighting the need for additional taxonomic work on the genus from these localities as well as others (e.g. South Africa) where the worms have been incorrectly identified as S. squamata. A key to species of Scolelepis from the east coast of the United States is provided and a lectotype and paralectotypes for S. agilis are herein designated.Keywords: beachreproductionScolelepis squamataSpionidaetaxonomy",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe black-footed cat (Felis nigripes) is the smallest and one of the rarest cats in Africa. Endemic to the semi-arid regions of South Africa, Namibia and Botswana, this nocturnal carnivore spends daytime in burrows, thus avoiding high temperatures and diurnal predators. Despite the importance of burrows, den usage has never been studied in detail for this species. Here we report on the frequency with which female black-footed cats use burrows of different dimensions and compared with burrow availability. The entrances of 50 dens, used by five radio-collared black-footed cats over four weeks, were scanned with LiDAR to measure tunnel width (mean = 15.2 ± 3.9 cm) and height (mean = 13.9 ± 3.6 cm). Of these, 98% (n = 49) most closely matched the dimensions of springhare (Pedetes capensis) burrows. Each cat used a mean of 11.6 den sites and spent a mean of 2.0 consecutive days in a den before selecting a new one. When kittens reached an age of 44–50 days, mothers switched from using a den for a mean of six days-per-den, to changing dens every day. Our results suggest that female black-footed cats are reliant upon springhares to provide suitable daytime refugia and maternity dens in southern Namibia. Further studies should be conducted to determine what den sites are selected in the absence of springhare, and whether localised persecution of springhare impacts the survival of black-footed cats.Keywords: 3D scandencarnivoreLiDARNamibiaspringhare",

I examine the validity of this assumption for a subset of African ticks and their hosts using the computer program Treemap to compare published phylogenies for each group. There is a marked lack of congruence between tick and host phylogenies and they offer no support for the hypothesis that cospeciation has been a dominant pattern in tick evolution. While this result does not prove that cospeciation between these taxa has not occurred, it suggests that the current host preferences of ticks are a poor guide to their evolutionary history and should not be used as key components of theories of tick evolution.",

Cape sugarbirds spent most of their time in territory defence and resting at all times of the day – both at mid breeding season and at the end of the breeding season – and only about ten percent of their time foraging. Cape sugarbirds may feed in the morning to replenish energy deficits and water imbalances experienced at night, and then maintain a high feeding rate at midday to maximize energy gain when nectar energy availability is greatest. Gurney’s sugarbirds, by contrast, showed little variation in the amount of time spent feeding on nectar throughout the day. More dispersed or lower availability of food may have constrained vocal activity in Gurney’s sugarbirds, which spent most of their time throughout the day perching silently on the tops of trees. In Cape sugarbirds, feeding preferences for particular Protea species changed in relation to their flowering seasons, and reduced inflorescence availability during the breeding season is related to increased perching and decreased territory defence at midday.",

In terms of percentage relative frequency of occurrence, the spiny lobster Panulirus homarus was found to be the most common prey item at both Mkambati (37.93%) and at Dwessa (35.21%), followed by fish (31.03% and 36.62%, respectively), crab (22.41% and 19.72%) and molluscs (3.11% and 4.23%). No significant differences were found in spraint dry masses between sites (15.10 g vs 17.95 g) or between masses of the diet categories for the two regions, but, when converted to 'fresh' mass, mean spraint mass was significantly lower at Mkambati than Dwessa (108.08 g and 135.73 g, respectively). When diet categories were compared using ANOVA, only fish were found to be significantly different when expressed as fresh mass. Spiny lobster mandibles collected from spraints were used to estimate otter prey size preferences by comparing with wild caught lobster dimensions (ANCOVA, paired t tests, correlation and regression).

This has overshadowed possible effects of radiation exposure on biochemical environment throughout the epididymis and the viability of spermatozoa that appeared morphologically normal. The effects of radiation exposure on sperm quality were evaluated through mating trials and assessment of the cauda epididymal sperm motility. Sprague Dawley rats with body mass of 300–400 g were selected at random. Two experimental groups received acute 6°Co γ-radiation doses of 3.5 and 6.0 Gy, respectively. Data were collected 2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days post-irradiation. Each male was housed with a non-irradiated super-ovulated female during mating trials. Cauda epididymal sperm motility was assessed with the CASMA. Hormone analyses were carried through chemiluminescence diagnostic tests to determine the endocrine status. Results suggest that irradiation causes an overproduction of estrogens, which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and inhibits LH and FSH secretions. Both LH and FSH deficiencies have negative effects on the testicular index and local reproductive hormones. Elevated estrogen levels influenced the epididymal internal milieu negatively, resulting in rigid, flagella bending sperm tail, impaired progressive movement of the spermatozoa and hence infertilityKey words: radiation exposurespermiogenesisestrogensperm motility",

Data for P. nebulosus were recorded in the Landdroskop area in the Hottentots Holland Mountains, South Africa. The total sample of 87 lizards, consisted of 26 adult males, 49 adult females and 12 juveniles. Size at sexual maturity was determined as 60 mm snout–vent length (SVL) for both sexes. Generation glands were found to be present in males only and the number present was significantly correlated to body size. Both adult males and adult females possessed active femoral glands, but males had significantly more than females. Females were found to reach larger body sizes than males, but adult males had relatively larger heads than females. No significant difference in scar frequency was found between male and female samples. The female-biased SSD in P. nebulosus and its sister species, P. capensis, is tentatively ascribed to fecundity selection for offspring to be large at birth in order to survive in a predictable unfavourable environment at high altitudes. Variation in SSD among montane cordylids is discussed and the need for more comprehensive data is highlighted.Key words: epidermal glandsbody sizehead sizemelanisticfecundity selection",

Thirty-two rhinos were removed from one site to reduce rhino density. Seasonal use of grassland types was similar at both sites, but differed to what a previous study reported. This was likely due to higher food availability during our study, coupled with lower white rhino density. These findings suggest that during high rainfall years, white rhinos at a density of 3/km2 will not overutilize food in the park. Dispersal, initiated by declining food resources, is used to manage white rhino population size in HiP. We suggest that during high rainfall years it is unlikely that dispersal rates will increase. The impact that a similar density would have on food availability and dispersal during low rainfall years is uncertain.",

We counted ticks on Homopus signatus signatus during each spring in the years 2001–2004, and evaluated tick frequencies in relation to tortoise anatomy, climate and microhabitat. Tortoises hosted Ornithodoros compactus and O. savignyi, and ticks seemed to prefer the hindlimbs, avoid the shell, and use the forelimbs and neck in intermediate frequencies. The number of ticks on the neck and forelimbs did not differ among males, females and juveniles, but for the hindlimbs and all body parts, males and females usually had similar tick numbers and adults often had more ticks than juveniles. The number of ticks on the hindlimbs correlated with the body size of male and female tortoises, whereas the number of ticks on the forelimbs correlated with juvenile body size. Males and females had similar incidences of ticks despite sexual dimorphism in body size (female size > male size), and this may be due to the relatively large shell openings (soft skin exposure) of males compared to females. Body condition and microhabitat had no effect on the number of ticks. It is unclear why tick numbers on H. s. signatus increased in dry years. The adverse effects of drought on mammals may have caused ticks to switch from mammals to tortoises when preferred hosts were no longer available.",

Morphometric measurements of the gut regions were taken with the aid of light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The stomach is fully glandular and unilocular with a low pH and is possibly the initial site of protein digestion. The duodenum, with its closely packed columnar cells with many mitochondria, may be the main site of enzymatic digestion. Owing to coprophagy, food and fermentation products are recycled for further digestion in the small intestine. The caecum is by far the largest region in mass and the apex ceci may be the main site of fermentation. A ridge-lined furrow is present inside the proximal colon. Thick muscle layers are present in the vicinity of the ridge-lined furrow. It is suggested that the furrow is part of the colonic separation mechanism that transports bacteria back to the caecum. The longitudinal folds and long villi in the proximal colon enlarge the surface area, where the columnar cells of the villi have many mitochondria, probably to absorb fermentation products and to transport water and electrolytes across the mucosa. In the distal colon many mucous cells open in tubular glands of Lieberkühn. Reabsorption of water probably occurs through the dense microvillous border.",

Principal component \nanalysis of twenty truss and nine non-truss variables, and heteroscedastic t- tests on all but one \nmeasurement, indicated that 'size' rather than 'shape' separate out fish from the two rivers. \nThere was, therefore, a substantial degree of congruence between genetic and morphological \ndata.

We aimed to establish which species survive fire and the dynamics of the post-fire recolonization process, and thereby contribute to establishing the ideal area of a prescribed burn for invertebrate conservation. Four transects were sampled two and 12 weeks after burning. Along each transect one unburnt control and four burnt sites were quantitatively sampled. Richness, abundance and diversity were calculated for each site and canonical correspondence analysis was applied to transect and morphospecies counts to determine the impact of distance from the edge of the burn on community structure. Distance from burn edge affected invertebrate richness and abundance, especially for flying insects. Burning appeared to minimally impact on wingless invertebrates, suggesting they tolerated fire by finding refuge. Invertebrate community structure changed with increasing distance from burn edge two weeks, but not 12 weeks post-burn. A distance of 280 m from burn edge appears to allow sufficient recolonization to maintain invertebrate diversity. Taxa found in the unburnt control and site closest to the edge in burnt grassland may be fire sensitive and require further study.",

A species distribution model and data on wheat and maize production were used to determine whether WCM could establish where its hosts are grown. WCM is most likely to be introduced to South Africa as a contaminant of maize from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and USA; on live plant imports from China and Germany; and on seed imports from Brazil and Australia. Some of these pathways are not currently prominent, but could increase in the future. Parts of South Africa were predicted by the species distribution model to be climatically suitable for WCM, and within some of these areas the host crops are grown. Therefore, if WCM is introduced, it is likely to establish and cause extensive damage to agriculture.

There was a significant difference in the distance from nests to the edge of the wetland (χ2 = 24.843, n = 46, df = 3, p < 0.001). However, in all study areas the distance between nests, which indicates the degree of territoriality, did not show any significant difference (χ2 = 6.016, n = 34, df = 3, p = 0.111). In addition, nests were constructed in the wetland where the water depth ranged from 80 to 220 cm. Nest height (H2i) and water depth (WDi) at nesting sites were highly correlated, and the regression equation (H2i = 13.77 + 1.03WDi) indicated that when the water depth increases, the nest height also increases. The shallowest depth where a nest was constructed was 80 cm. Vegetation type varied, but cranes used Leersia hexandra, Oryza longistaminata, and Cyprus rotundus plants as their selected nesting material. The average vegetation height observed at nests with eggs, measured one metre away from the nest rim, ranged from 20 to 90 cm (44.83 ± 2.397), n = 48. The vegetation height at each study site showed no significant difference (F(3) = 2.527, p = 0.07). The mean nest length, width, and height from the surface of the water between nests were not significantly different. Nesting density was variable depending on the size of the wetland, water depth, and vegetation type and cover.",

Invertebrate macrofauna inhabiting mussel beds were sampled from six sites in the embayment. In addition, mussel cover, mussel bed depth, density and size of mussels were recorded. With the exception of two sites (The Heads and Featherbed) where some Perna perna was present, we confirmed that the mussel beds were composed of the invasive species M. galloprovincialis. At The Heads, mussel beds were single-layered and in patches, whereas at other sites they were multi-layered with 100% cover. Bed depth, mussel density and shell size varied among sites. A total of 65 taxa (mainly Crustacea and Mollusca) were identified across all sites with species richness and diversity being significantly different among sites. Forty-three percent of taxa were new records for the estuary. Macrofaunal richness and diversity were highest at the two sites (The Heads and Featherbed) closest to the mouth of the embayment. There were negative relationships between species diversity and mussel density, and diversity and macroinvertebrate abundance. At most sites macrofaunal abundance was dominated by one or two species. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant difference in species composition among sites. Where wave action was present (The Heads, Featherbed and Leisure Isle) only a few deposit feeders were present in the mussel beds. At sites where wave action was minimal (Thesen Wharf, Marina and Railway Bridge) fine silt was present in the mussel matrix and there was an increase in the number of deposit feeding species.",

    "abstract": "The sand flea, Tunga penetrans, causes tungiasis, the detrimental skin inflammation with the potential for bacterial co-infections. It is a neglected tropical disease common among the rural poor, especially communities along the coastlines in Southwest Nigeria. There are very few studies on T. penetrans infestation in Nigeria, and no records of infestation along the sandy coastal areas of Ondo State. Therefore, the current study was carried out to examine the prevalence of T. penetrans infestation in the coastal communities of Zion Igbokoda, Kofawe and Laranda in the region of Igbokoda, Ondo State. Hands and feet of selected household members were examined, whereas fleas on different types of floors were sampled by sweeping and beating, soil collection, and extraction by tullgren funnel methods. The prevalence of tungiasis was 35.8% of the total population studied with infection more prevalent in males within 0–4 years (46.9%), 5–9 years (60.2%), 10–14 years (60%) and 60 years and above (28.1%) age groups than in females (p = 0.015). Infestation prevalence was in the order of 43.9%, 34.6% and 29.0% for Zion Igbokoda, Kofawe and Laranda, respectively. The number of flea-infested floors was 81 out of 363 examined with the greatest percentage infestation in houses that had earthen floored rooms and verandas. The high prevalence recorded in this study is capable of affecting the socio-economic well-being of the Igbokoda community. Therefore, a well-designed intervention measure involving concrete flooring of houses is suggested in order to ameliorate infestation burdens.",

Of these, three were considered obligate: the myzostomidans, Myzostoma fuscomaculatum and Myzostoma n.sp., and the shrimp, Hippolyte catagrapha, all of which only occurred on T. carinata. Both frequency and density of infestation were higher for the two myzostomes than for the shrimp. The majority of crinoids infested with myzostomes hosted two or more individuals, while H. catagrapha usually occurred singly. A total of 67.5% of all T. carinata collected were infested by symbionts. Of these 45% hosted only one species, 17% hosted two species and 5.8% hosted all three. Most M. fuscomaculatum (85.2%) and H. catagrapha (82.1%) matched their hosts' colouring, while Myzostoma n. sp. were all yellowish incolour. Infestation by Myzostoma n. sp. increased in both frequency and density with depth.

Both predators strongly reduced abundance of all prey species, yet with a striking size-selective effect for Daphnia prey only, where fish showed a strong preference for small individuals, while Anisops preferred large Daphnia individuals. This contrasts with the general view of size selection in invertebrate versus vertebrate predators, but is logically caused by the feeding mode of the notonectid, and the gape size limitation of the fish fry. The two predators also showed a dietary niche differentiation in terms of both prey selection and habitat choice. T. rendalli fed preferably on small species and size classes, whereas predation from A. sardea concentrated on large prey. Competitive interference was indicated when feeding on Ceriodaphnia, and niche partitioning when feeding on the two other species. The predatory pattern suggests long-lasting coexistence in the system.",

We used radio telemetry to obtain quantitative information on the surfacing frequency of lungfish in Lake Baringo. The results showed radio-tagged lungfish came to the surface during the period immediately following their release but that aerial respiration later ceased, indicating that the fish were able to meet their metabolic oxygen requirements solely through aquatic respiration. These results suggest that under certain conditions lungfish in the wild may not be obligate air breathers and that the use of aerial respiration may be a function of ecological as well as physiological factors.",

In the black-tailed tree rat (Thallomys nigricauda) we expected differences in the home-range size of populations in habitats of differing productivity, as measured along an aridity gradient, and between seasons. We studied the variations in home-range size of black-tailed tree rats by radiotracking in winter 2006, 2007 and summer 2007 at three study sites along an aridity gradient in southern Africa. Home ranges were estimated using 100% and 95% minimum convex polygons (MCP) and 95% and 50% fixed kernels. Home ranges varied widely, from 166 to 80 199 m2 for males and from 46 to 8810 m2 for females. Males had larger home ranges than females, which supports a promiscuous mating system reported for the species. Although range size was reduced in both sexes in winter, this was not significant. We found no significant difference in home-range size along the aridity gradient. It is suggested that a combination of habitat productivity, season and breeding system influences the size of home range and that this species displays phenotypic flexibility in terms of its behavioural responses to these factors.",

    "abstract": "The Zoological Society of Southern Africa (ZSSA) has held conferences since 1962. Given the major changes in national and international environmental priorities and in political and societal structures in South Africa over this period, together with technological advances, major shifts in research trends would be expected. The mix of papers presented at conferences held in 1984, 1994, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2009 were investigated to identify trends in the subdisciplines, in taxa and habitats studied, and in the collaboration and participation of students. Trends reflected in publications by South African zoological researchers in 1980 and 2007 were also used. Zoology remains a strong discipline, with 16 university departments employing 16% more staff and 14% more professors in 2007 than in 1980. A large number of zoologists are also employed at museums (43) and at other research institutions (74). There has been little major change in terms of subdisciplines, or the taxa or habitats studied, and conferences have remained broad, with no narrow subdiscipline ever comprising more than 15% of presentations. Priorities for terrestrial zoological research identified in a 1995 commentary paper have not received noticeably more attention. Mammals have consistently received the largest amount of attention, but research on birds has increased. The split between research on vertebrates (64%) and invertebrates (36%), as reflected by publications, was identical in 1980 and 2007. Terrestrial research continues to dominate conferences and publications, and collaborative presentations have increased since 1994. Maintaining traditional research focus in filling of vacancies at universities and other institutions, as well as funding opportunities, have probably contributed to the maintenance of broad research coverage over the last 25 years. Major changes in funding strategies and the national focus on large, integrated scientific questions may influence trends into the future.",

No significant differences (P = 0.43 to 0.54) were obtained for the growth rates of male and female E. hylocoetes under the suite of temperature/salinity combinations. Among the variables considered, temperature was identified as the most important in influencing the growth rates of the isopod. Elevated temperatures promoted faster initial growth in both males and females. Salinity had no significant influence on the growth rates of males and females. Males (25.77 ± 3.40 weeks) lived significantly longer (P < 0.001) than females (21.52 ± 3.00 weeks), allowing males (8.08 ± 0.25 mm mean body length) to attain a significantly larger size than females (6.59 ± 0.25 mm) under experimental conditions. Females, however, attained sexual maturity (at 2.5 mm body length) 2–4 weeks earlier than males (5.5 mm in length). It is suggested that the faster growth rates at the higher temperature/salinity combinations allow the isopod to reach sexual maturity at an earlier stage than those at the lower combinations.",

Given the extensive size of the lake, there is a possibility of isolation by distance that can lead to local adaptations. Microsatellite DNA variability was used to assess the genetic diversity and to define the population structure of Nile perch collected from 22 different geographical locations within Lake Victoria. In total, 432 individuals were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci. Analyses of multilocus microsatellite genotypes revealed that genetic diversity of Nile perch of Lake Victoria is relatively high (HE = 0.68). Results also reveal shallow but significant genetic differentiation (FST = 0.029, P < 0.05). STRUCTURE indicated that Nile perch of Lake Victoria was made up of two (K = 2) genetically distinct populations. Separate analysis for each of the two groups also revealed relatively high genetic diversity for each group (HE[N1] = 0.73 and HE[N2] = 0.64). These results are surprising given that Nile perch was only recently introduced and is known to be migratory by nature.We interpret these results in light of multiple introductions from two different source populations of Nile perch and discuss implications of these results for the region's fisheries management.",

The elongated paired testes, consisting of dome-shaped lobules, were embedded in an epigonal matrix. The lobules consisted of spherical spermatocyst, containing the spermatogenic cells arranged in concentric layers. In each spermatocyst, germ elements were in the same stage of differentiation. Discharging of sperm was found to be conveyed via a ciliated ductule system. The excurrent duct system consisted of the vasa efferentia, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and cloaca. Seasonal reproductive activity was evident when the gonadosomatic index reached a maximum in November and a minimum in May. Ripe running males were observed from January to June. Mating took place between April and June. Sexual maturity was reached at a total body length of 580 mm and at three years of age. Knowledge of size/age at sexual maturity and seasonal reproductive activity in the local elasmobranch, Rhinobatus annulatus may prove critical to ensure effective management and conservation strategies for this species.Key words: Rhinobatos annulatusmaturitygonadosomatic indexspermatogenesisbreeding cycle",

    "abstract": "The African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) has suffered population declines and is listed in the IUCN Red List as Endangered. The species is endemic to the coast of southern Africa, and breeding colonies are distributed on the south-western coast of Africa. Currently, African Penguins are being kept in zoo and aquarium facilities throughout South Africa. In this study, molecular genetic data based on 12 microsatellite markers from 1 119 African Penguin samples from four facilities were generated in order to determine the level of genetic variation, population structure and differentiation, and effective population size to assist in the development of an effective captive management plan. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.57 to 0.62, and allelic richness from 4.2 to 5.1. However, based on differences between first- and second-generation captive birds, we conclude that the ex situ population is at risk of losing genetic variability in the future and management programmes should include exchange of birds between captive facilities in order to induce gene flow and increase effective population size. Adding individuals from in situ populations should also be considered in the future in cases where these birds cannot be rehabilitated. Molecular genetic analyses of wild penguin populations should be carried out for comparison, and to ascertain to what degree 'in situ genetic diversity' is represented among ex situ populations. With regular resampling and analyses, the extent of the effect of processes such as genetic drift on diversity in the ex situ penguin populations will become evident.",

    "abstract": "Breeding success (fledglings pair−1 y−1) of the Red-listed African Black Oystercatcher (Haematopus moquini) is highly variable, both spatially and temporally. Despite a diversity of natural factors causing this variability, there is evidence that two anthropogenic factors, i.e. disturbance and an introduced mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), are having an impact on the local breeding success of this species. Using a data set comprising 87 site-years of nest-monitoring data across most of the species’ breeding range, we analysed the extent and causes of variability in breeding success. Breeding success differed across three population categories defined by varying levels of human disturbance: island populations, protected mainland populations, and unprotected mainland populations. Differences in breeding success between island populations and protected mainland populations were likely due to differing exposure to predators; however, differences between protected and unprotected mainland populations were unlikely caused by this as both experience equivalent predation levels (although from different predators). Protection only improved the breeding success of oystercatchers in very high-quality habitats (with a high biomass of alien mussels), and where populations were ‘released’ from high levels of human disturbance. In unprotected mainland areas, human activity impacted on the breeding success of local populations primarily through predation of small chicks by uncontrolled dogs, and by rising tides drowning chicks that were hiding from human disturbance. The findings of this study note the potential conservation dilemma resulting from an invasive species improving the conservation status of a Red-listed species, and encourage the implementation of restricted sites in high-quality habitats with high breeding pair densities.",

In addition, we investigated the seasonal variation in diet again by using variation in isotopic composition of one of the most common small mammal species, the Cape spiny mouse. We also analysed seeds and leaves from the most common plant species at each study site. Results showed that some dietary separation exists among these coexisting small mammals. Geographic differences exist in isotope signatures within the Cape spiny mouse, possibly resulting from area-related variations in isotope values of plants, as well as differences in the animals' diets. A. subspinosus hair shows little to no seasonal fluctuation of isotopic signals, except in summer, which possibly indicates a stable diet over much of the year. We conclude that the isotopic approach to determine trophic levels is limited by significant geographic variation in plant isotopes and enrichment in seeds compared to leaves.Key words: isotope ecologyCape Fynbossmall mammalsinterspecific competitionCape spiny mouse",

Given the extensive size of the lake, there is a possibility of isolation by distance that can lead to local adaptations. Microsatellite DNA variability was used to assess the genetic diversity and to define the population structure of Nile perch collected from 22 different geographical locations within Lake Victoria. In total, 432 individuals were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci. Analyses of multilocus microsatellite genotypes revealed that genetic diversity of Nile perch of Lake Victoria is relatively high (HE = 0.68). Results also reveal shallow but significant genetic differentiation (FST = 0.029, P < 0.05). STRUCTURE indicated that Nile perch of Lake Victoria was made up of two (K = 2) genetically distinct populations. Separate analysis for each of the two groups also revealed relatively high genetic diversity for each group (HE[N1] = 0.73 and HE[N2] = 0.64). These results are surprising given that Nile perch was only recently introduced and is known to be migratory by nature.We interpret these results in light of multiple introductions from two different source populations of Nile perch and discuss implications of these results for the region’s fisheries management.",

Data analysis showed that 84.7% of recaptured fish remained in relatively small home ranges (-750 m linear distance), while 13.3% abandoned their home ranges and undertook unidirectional movements (of 21-1 211 km) along the KwaZulu-Natal coast in a north-easterly direction, most likely to spawn. While the no-take area of the PMPA provides effective protection for resident fish, the export of adult P. praearbitalis provides strong evidence of the benefits that no-take MPAs can offer to adjacent fisheries. Based on the tag-recapture length data, the growth rate was found to be relatively slow, averaging 46 mm y-1. This growth rate was similar to that determined by a study of ageing using sectioned otoliths. Reliable tag-recapture data can thus be used to provide a valuable means of validating growth rates determined by other methods.",

We counted 89 and 61 Grevy’s zebra during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The total population size was estimated to be 75 individuals with a 95% confidence interval of 60–90 individuals. The adult to sub-adult ratio was 3.1:1.0 during the wet season and 4:1 during the dry season. The sex ratio of adult female to adult male was 5:1 during the wet season and 4:1 during the dry season. The seasonal range of the species in the HAPA was 477 km2 (n = 89) during the wet season and 711 km2 (n = 61) during the dry season. During the dry season Grevy’s zebra move out of the protected area to the Blen hot spring and its associated wetlands for green grazing and water. Hence, further study is needed on the possibility of incorporating the Blen hot spring and its associated wetlands into the protected area to promote the sustainable conservation of the species in the HAPA.Keywords: age structureanimal movementconservationzebra populationsprotected areaseasonssex structure",

Although eDNA has strong links to DNA barcoding, the molecular marker most often used to detect vertebrates in eDNA studies is a portion of the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA (12S rRNA) and not the standard cytochrome oxidase I (COI) marker used in traditional DNA barcoding. eDNA methods rely on a comprehensive reference library to link sequence data to species, which are often lacking in hyper-diverse countries such as South Africa. In this study, we review the present state of DNA barcode reference databases for both 12S rRNA and COI for freshwater fish (native and introduced) found in South African aquatic systems. Analysis of DNA records available on GenBank and the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) revealed incomplete records of the examined taxa for both markers. Our findings showed that 34 species, 6 genera and 0 families of native South African freshwater fish lack COI barcode records, while 86 species, 22 genera and 8 families lack 12S rRNA records. Unlike the native freshwater fish, the non-native fish all had barcode records available for both COI and 12S rRNA. Producing comprehensive reference libraries for both markers is an important first step in developing an eDNA protocol for the non-invasive monitoring of native and non-native freshwater fish in South Africa.",

The case of the Table Mountain Ghost frog (Heleophryne rosei) provides an example of this, listed as Critically Endangered for the last 15 years with limited conservation actions identified due to a lack of information about threat mechanisms and magnitude of declines. To address this, we investigated H. rosei tadpole occupancy dynamics over three years in stream pools on Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa, the only locality where this species occurs. Tadpole spatiotemporal distribution was examined as a function of abiotic and biotic factors to quantify habitat requirements, rank threats, and identify conservation actions. Heleophryne rosei tadpole occupancy was negatively correlated with levels of fine sediments (silt and sand), which embed larger substrates and decrease the diversity of benthic microhabitat. Increased abundance of these fine sediments was also associated with higher extinction probabilities. Localised habitat degradation from hiking paths, alien vegetation, and flow manipulation were identified as the primary threats to this species, increasing the sources of fine sediments and inhibiting the fluvial systems ability to effectively flush these sediments out. Our results demonstrate the importance of pore space refugia for mountain headwater stream-adapted amphibians and provides the required data to inform management decisions for this Critically Endangered species.Keywords: AfricaconservationCritically Endangeredheadwater mountain streamHeleophrynidaesubstratetadpole",

This studyinvestigated length at maturity, sexual dimorphism, spawning behaviour, breeding seasonality, fecundity, fertility, egg size, and brooding habits of C. chrysonotus in southern Lake Malawi. Males in breeding colouration aggregated in sheltered areas at least several metres deep, and each male defended a mobile breeding territory near the surface while attempting toattract females. Breeding was mostly continuous from August to May, with peaks in August–September and January–March. A major lull in breeding activity occurred in May and June. Mean fecundity and fertility increased significantly with female total length, while mean egg length, mean egg mass and gonadosomatic index did not increase significantly with female totallength. Females brooded their young up to 15–16 mm total length before abandoning them. Open-water spawning by C. chrysonotus may be an adaptation to reduce both egg predation during spawning and competition for substrate-based breeding territories.",

Because of the polytentaculate nature of most species, the branched nature of the tentacles of some species, the shape of the calcareous ring, the ambulacral restriction of the pedicels and the form of the body wall tables, the Rhopalodinidae could well be classified within the Dendrochirotida, close to the Phyllophorinae.

A sperm duct ran along the medial surface of each testis before fusing caudally to form the common sperm duct that terminated at the urogenital pore. Main sperm ducts were lined by simple columnar epithelium supported by a wall with elastic connective tissue and a few smooth muscle cells. The tunica albuginea divided the testes into lobules, which contained spermatogenetic cell types.

We monitored the timing of breeding of Namaqua sandgrouse in relation to rainfall and food availability in the arid Nama Karoo biome, South Africa, to test the prediction that this species should start to breed as soon as the ephemeral plants began to set seed. Despite substantial variability in the timing and quantity of rainfall and subsequent seed production, the timing of breeding was relatively fixed, generally starting 3–5 months after food became abundant and extending into the rainy season, when food supplies can reach critically low levels. We conclude that food availability is not the sole factor determining the timing of breeding of Namaqua sandgrouse in the Nama Karoo. Daily nest predation rates decreased by up to 50 % during the course of the breeding season. We suggest that this seasonal decrease in nest predation pressure, combined with high levels of nest predation, may provide a strong selective pressure for delayed breeding by this species in the Nama Karoo.",

Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction \n(RAPD-PCR) was used to assess the genetic variation in populations found in these estuaries. A high level of variation with a low geographic bias suggested that the South African population should be considered a single entity. The Madagascan population grouped together as a separate clade from the South African estuarine populations and was therefore probably distinct. The Madagascan population also had a lower level of genetic variation than that found among the populations within South African estuaries. While restocking estuaries by releasing newlyhatched larvae would probably not be possible, restocking of estuaries by translocation of cultured juveniles (when hatchery technology becomes available) between South African estuaries may be done with minimal risk of affecting the genetic integrity of the indigenous population of S. serrata .",

It is most abundant on exposed beaches where the sand is not too coarse and phytoplankton production is high. Adults occupy zone just above the mean level of spring tide. Spat settle subtidally and move upshore as they grow. Growth is initially rapid, to about 32 mm at one year and 48 mm at two years. Thereafter growth is very slow and most adult productions goes into reproduction, with a small summerspawning and a large winterspawning each year. Somatic production is low, as large adults totally dominate the population and have low growth and low mortality. Reproductive production is relatively high and P 18 values of 0,2 and 0,5 are suggested for growth and reproduction. D. serra was found to be very tolerant of fluctuating salinities for up to four days and should be able to penetrate river mouths, but is limited by restricted swash action. Total dry-tissue mass, energy and biochemical constituents showed some seasonal fluctuations related mainly to the reproductive cycle.

Contrary to our predictions, the faeces did not act as a deterrent to either predator. Tongueflick trials with cotton scent applicators indicated that the skinks showed a heightened predatory response to king cricket faeces over king cricket integument, field cricket integument and an odourless control. We suggest that 'primary' defence mechanisms, such as nocturnal behaviour, cryptic colouration and immobility, are more effective than 'secondary' defence mechanisms, such as stridulation, kicking and defecation. Given that the noxious faeces already have a demonstrated role in inter- and intrasexual communication, we suggest that the assumed defensive role of the faeces is minor or an epiphenomenon.Key words: Anostostomatidaeking cricketdefence behaviourtongue-flickspredatory behaviour",

Length frequency time series showed that the 1991 cohort reproduced at age one, but that none of this cohort survived into the 1993 breeding season, consistent with annual semelparity. By contrast, other expected correlates of semelparity were not observed: fecundity in A. monochrus was lower than in some iteroparous blennies, and there was no obvious physical deterioration of adults following the breeding season, despite their high mortality rate.",

The present study conducted conservation priority assessments for 221 South African terrestrial mammal species using existing data sources. These data sources included regional IUCN Red List assessments, regional geographic distributions, relative endemism, taxonomic distinctiveness, relative body mass and human density. These components were in turn subjected to two quantitative conservation priority assessment techniques in an attempt to determine regional conservation priorities for South African terrestrial mammals. The top 22 mammal species (i.e. the top 10% of assessed species) identified by both regional conservation priority assessment techniques to be of conservation priority, consistently identified 13 South African terrestrial mammal species to be of high conservation priority. Seven of the 13 species were from the order Afrosoricida, two species from the order Eulipotyphla, with one species each from the orders Chiroptera, Lagomorpha, Pholidota, and Rodentia. More importantly, 12 of the 13 mammal species were also listed as threatened in the 2004 Red Data Book of South African Mammals. These results suggest that the two conservation priority assessment techniques used in the present study may represent a practical and quantitative method for determining regional conservation priorities, and include measures that represent vulnerability, conservation value, and threat.",

Using a single opportunistic sighting, we were able to collect two dung samples from one oestrous female white rhino; one unmarked and one overmarked with male urine. Because of the behaviour of both the male and the female, we suggest that the female was in pro-oestrus. We hypothesised that the function of overmarking by the male was for oestrus concealment (i.e. odour masking), as observed in horses. Because dung from oestrous female white rhinos emits a higher proportion of alkanes than non-oestrous dung, we expected the proportion of alkanes emitted from oestrous dung to decrease after overmarking. In contrast, we found that after overmarking the proportion of alkanes emitted increased. We suggest that the function of urine overmarking in white rhinos could be to conceal all signals of reproductive condition, so that neither oestrous nor non-oestrous signals are recognisable, or that a signal is added to indicate that the female has been mated.",

One of these is the Succulent Karoo, which together with the Nama-Karoo, forms the Greater Karoo region. Notwithstanding a paucity of studies from this region, it would appear that, although mammal diversity is low, endemism is high. Here, as part of the Karoo BioGaps project, we use a molecular approach to assess small mammal diversity and endemism in the Karoo. We focus on rock rats (Micaelamys) and elephant shrews (Elephantulus and Macroscelides). Using a DNA-informed identification approach, we reveal two, well supported, monophyletic clades of Micaelamys; one that corresponds to M. granti. Our study is the first to publish sequence data for this species. Furthermore, when unverified records are excluded, the range of M. granti is far smaller (∼99 000 km2) than that given by the IUCN red list assessments (236 027 km2), which lends support to the species being a Karoo endemic. Our macrosceledid samples grouped into four well supported clades of the genera Elephantulus and Macroscelides. Very high intraspecific diversity was present within E. pilicaudus compared with other species in our study and this newly described species may harbour cryptic diversity. Our geographic analyses confirm that the range of this species, previously considered to be a Nama-Karoo endemic, extends beyond this region. This study adds more information to the nominal data currently available for the species, Elephantulus pilicaudus.",

In a number of birds and other vertebrates, genetic variation at the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r) gene is associated with melanin-based colour variation.

A single nucleotide change was found, which although it resulted in an amino acid change, was shared by all jackal buzzards irrespective of colour morph.

Using a completely randomised design, mosquito traps were set at different locations in a rural and an urbanised community. One hundred and eighty (180) mosquitoes were trapped and pooled on the basis of genus, sex and site of collection, because there have been no earlier reports of Wolbachia isolated from Nigeria. Twenty pools, made up of not more than ten mosquitoes per pool, were homogenised and analysed for Wolbachia-specific DNA. Mosquitoes were trapped within Ede (urbanised community) and Akoda (rural community). Genomic DNA was extracted from trapped mosquito samples and used as a template in a PCR reaction. The Wolbachia sp. specific 16S rRNA gene was amplified, sequence analysis of PCR products was performed and a chromatogram of the sequence was subjected to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis to identify the Wolbachia sp. This sequence was subsequently submitted to GenBank with accession number MK127541. The first evidence of the presence of the endosymbiont, Wolbachia in field-caught mosquitoes is hereby documented. The homology of this strain of Wolbachia bears similarities to those reported recently from other parts of West Africa and forms a single clade with a Wolbachia sp. from Mali, with a strong bootstrap support of 99%. This finding of a Wolbachia strain in mosquitoes at Ede could form the basis for more searches for diverse strains of Wolbachia in Nigeria.",

Random sampling with different traps from February 2016 to February 2019 made it possible to capture two families comprising 20 species, of which 13 are recorded for the first time in the region. The second scale concerned the desert oases. Monthly sampling from March 2017 to November 2018 captured 11 species belonging to two families and four different subfamilies. A comparative study of the grasshopper community in three palm groves with two types of habitat (cultivated and uncultivated) indicated homogeneity in fauna diversity, although their composition was very different. Phenological analysis of species in three oasis habitats revealed the presence of three groups of species: (1) a group of hygrophilic species with a reproduction period concentrated in summer, (2) xerophilic species only present during the spring and autumn, (3) a group of mesophilic species remaining present almost throughout the year and moving between the two types of habitats. Despite three years of field work with several trips and in different biotopes, we believe that the list of species presented here is not exhaustive, but only an updated list, and we consider the new data as an important resource for various future studies, especially genetic studies.Keywords: adaptationAdrarbiodiversityhostilepalm grovesphenology",

This gnathiid does not conform to any other known species, having morphological characteristics not seen in the other 11 recognized genera. Features making the genus unique include a pylopod consisting of only one article, a mandible with two rows of unequal teeth on the blade and apex, and cephalosome appendages that could be maxillae 1 (maxillules), which are usually absent in all known male gnathiids. This species is also characterized by clusters of sensory pits scattered over the cephalosome and pereon.",

The average earthworm community comprised fewer than five species, but up to seven species were sampled from a single forest. Four of the species recorded are national (one species), regional (one species) or local (two species) endemics. Because these species are not known to live elsewhere, the protection of Limpopo Province forests is critical to their survival. The majority (71%) of the earthworm species sampled was exotic, and differences between exotic and indigenous species richness in forests were mostly significant. At the two spatial scales examined (20 m2 and individual forest) there is no evidence of an association between exotic and indigenous species richness.

    "abstract": ">This work describes the utilization of shallow, subtidal bays, associated with rocky shores, by the late-stage larvae and early juveniles of some common inshore fishes. Larval and early juvenile fishes were collected in seven small bays (30–50 m wide) between Port Alfred (33°36’S, 26°53’E) and Hamburg (33°17’S, 27°29’E), using a modified, beach seine net (500 µm mesh). Four bays were sampled weekly during peak fish spawning (September–November 2004) to firstly assess whether larval fishes occur in these previously-unstudiedhabitats and secondly, to assess the extent of this utilization in terms of species occurrence, abundance and potential nursery function. An additional three replicate bays, situated >50 km away near Bira were used for comparison. In total, 14 fish families represented by 26 taxa were recorded but the catch was dominated by a small suite of common species. Bays were extensively utilized by Sparidae (>Diplodus capensis >and >Sarpa salpa>), and to a lesser extent by Clinidae (>Clinus superciliosus>), Mugilidae (>Liza >spp.) and Kyphosidae (>Neoscorpis lithophilus>). Mean CPUE of larvae was high and exceeded 900 individuals per seine haul. Larval abundance peaked at 4000 larvae per haul and at these times, was dominated only by the two sparid species. Abundance of sparid larvae exceeds that recorded for these species in surf zones, estuaries or the shallow nearshore habitatssampled to date in temperate South Africa by an order of magnitude. Larval abundance was significantly higher during new moon sampling throughout the study period, but was not significantly different between repeated samples collected per site on each fieldtrip. The length-frequency of larvae utilizing the bays was dominated by postflexion stages ranging 7–14 mm SL. Length-frequency distribution of >Diplodus, Sarpa, Clinus, Sparodon, Neoscorpis >was indicativeof grow-out and use of bays as interim nurseries. The nursery function of these bays is supported by gut analysis of a sub-sample of the dominant species, >Diplodus capensis, >which showed that these larvae were actively feeding in the area, predominantly on copepods. This work prompts further research on shallow habitats associated with rocky shores particularly the shelter and feeding role that these under-studied habitats are playing in the early life history of coastal fishes.",

Here we investigate the nature of gustatory organs in a terrestrial caecilian, Boulengerula boulengeri (Herpelidae), from Tanzania using standard light and scanning electron microscopy. We found only taste bud type organs to be present in B. boulengeri. These occur mainly in the mucosa of the front part of the oral cavity, usually near the teeth.

    "abstract": "Naked mole-rats occur in large colonies where usually a single queen monopolizes reproduction. Queen succession occurs from within usually as a result of aggressive encounters with subordinate females that queue for reproductive succession following colony instability, which inevitably results in death of either the queen or the challenging conspecific. We monitored a queen succession following the death of the breeding male in a colony of the naked mole-rat, Heterocephalus glaber, prior to, during as well as after replacement of the original breeding female. The response of the pituitary luteotrophs was investigated in the non-reproductive females during this period of instability by the administration of endogenous gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and evaluating the subsequent luteinising hormone (LH) response in the blood. Larger and older non-breeding females engaged in aggressive encounters that culminated in death. The new breeding successor which arose from within the colony was a large female who continued to procreate. The six non-breeding females that were killed during reproductive takeover were larger and older females which exhibited elevated basal circulating LH concentrations as well as increased pituitary sensitivity as measured by the amount of releasable LH to an exogenous GnRH challenge. By contrast, non-breeding females that survived the succession were smaller and younger animals with reduced basal and GnRH challenged LH concentrations. Likewise, five non-breeding males which were heavier and older than those non-breeding males which survived were killed. These animals did not, however, show elevated basal or exogenous GnRH challenged LH concentrations when compared to the surviving males. The non-breeding animals of both sexes which survived the reproductive takeover event represented individuals which posed a minimal threat to the new successor and hence promoted the continuation of the marked reproductive skew that is prevalent in this highly inbred colonial subterranean hystricomorph.",

Chaerephon pumilus s.l. comprised two cytochrome b lineages separated by a mean genetic distance of 0.7% (0.1–1.4%), consistent with intraspecific variability. The C. pumilus s.l. clade was paraphyletic, containing a nested C. leucogaster (Madagascar) clade. As well as the expected four mitochondrial control region lineages, we identified a new strongly-supported clade from the Durban area. Indices of diversity and neutrality, combined with a ragged multimodal mismatch distribution, are inconsistent with demographic expansion of a single C. pumilus s.l. population in southeastern Africa, and suggest that the control region lineages are stable units at demographic equilibrium. Dating analyses suggest that these lineages were established during the late Pleistocene, between 60 000 and 13 000 years ago. We found no evidence to support our hypothesis that the sympatric genetic lineages of C. pumilus s.l. are associated with distinct sonotypes, as discriminant function analysis based on four echolocation parameters could not discriminate between the four clades. We hypothesise that the different genetic lineages may be distinguished by differences in social communication and behaviour.",

In a locality where C. nanum and C. boettgeri occur sympatrically the parasite has been found in both species. This finding of a Polystoma sp. in two closely related host species questions the strict host-specificity generally ascribed to the genus, but supports the hypothesis that host-specificity is determined by the oncomiracidium's ability to recognize the tadpole as a suitable host. This is the first polystome to be described from the genus Cacosternum and the ninth species of Polystoma from South Africa. The species is distinguished by its huge haptor and suckers relative to the body size. The haptor length/body length ratio of 0.38 is by far the largest for the known southern African polystomes. The prevalence of infection with P. channingi n.sp. was 25% for C. nanum and 40% for C. boettgeri, while the mean intensity of infections in adult frogs was 1.5 for C. boettgeri and 1.0 for C. nanum.",

Subadults benefit from group living through exposure to novel areas, and protection from territorial males (i.e. ‘buddy system’). In contrast, it is unclear whether mothers benefit from group living. To determine if they benefit, or if there is simply no cost, we recorded the vigilance of white rhino mothers in different-sized groups. We predicted that as group size increased, calves would have lower predation risk and mothers would reduce their vigilance. In contrast, we found that vigilance did not decrease as group size increased. Our findings thus indicate that decreased vigilance is not a benefit that white rhino mothers gain from living in groups. Also, costs of group formation are minimal for mothers as their large body size and ability to feed on a wide range of grasses reduces competition with other group members. As a result, we suggest that the benefits obtained by subadults, coupled with the lack of costs to adult females, are the main drivers of group formation in white rhinos.",

Further differentiation was found within the clade distributed in Tunisia and Algeria, with the discovery of new phylogenetic patterns. In addition, a phylogeny combining all published CO1 data for the genus emphasized the ongoing complex situation regarding the genus’ taxonomy. Highly similar sequences were attributed to different species by different authors throughout the tree, and no differentiated monophyletic species could be resolved.

A total of three focal groups (used in published works) and two non-focal groups were assessed. These focal groups, including two laboratory cultures and one field population, have been referred to as Eisenia fetida in the literature. A previous molecular study had already helped to establish that one of the two laboratory groups was a population of E. fetida's sister species E. andrei. In the present contribution, analyses of the COI gene revealed that the taxonomy of the remaining laboratory and field populations had also been incorrectly assigned since all the generated sequences grouped unequivocally with published sequences of E. andrei. Very high sequence divergence (>25% K2P) found within E. andrei could signal the occurrence of hitherto undescribed cryptic species. These findings are discussed with an emphasis on the possible consequences of using poorly identified earthworms or specimens with high molecular divergence in ecotoxicological bioassays. It is not clear whether unbeknownst to the researchers, the use of cryptic species in bioassays could jeopardise the quality of ecotoxicological investigations. Early evidence suggests that cryptic oligochaete species may respond differently to metal toxicity. The need for comparative ecotoxicological studies between E. andrei and E. fetidais also evidenced, especially in the light of recent numerous reports of cryptic oligochaete species. Ecotoxi-cologists are consequently encouraged, whenever possible, to make use of available genomic technologies to screen their laboratory stocks and available field populations for any molecular distinctiveness.",

    "abstract": "Disturbance has been offered as an explanatory mechanism in structuring the variation of species across a landscape. In this study, we investigated the effect of the impact by Kolomela Iron Mine on the variation of species occurring in temporary pans. Using a novel null model approach to partitioning two sets of data (from before and after the establishment of the mine) into independent alpha (α) and bet β components, we determined that the mining practices have had little to no impact on the invertebrate diversity. This suggests that these communities were more resilient than previously assumed. The results were, however, confounded by the fact that the resting eggs of pan inhabitants could remain dormant in the sediment for decades; suggesting that observed diversity patterns were possibly remnants of unknown past events. To ensure that the effects of present-day impacts are assessed, continuous monitoring is recommended. Similarly, the preservation of conservation areas and a landscape wide management system were proposed to ensure that large-scale ecological process are not jeopardized by the gradual fragmentation of the pan metacommunity.",

    "abstract": "Most polygynous male mammals exhibit little or no parental care or involvement raising young. Instead, they invest indirectly in their own morphological and physiological attributes which enhance their chance of reproduction. Such secondary morphological sex traits may contribute to differences in the burrow architecture of fossorial mammals, such as the Cape dune mole-rat, Bathyergus suillus. Indeed, little is known about the seasonal changes in burrow architecture or differences in burrow configuration may differ between the sexes of subterranean African mole-rats (Bathyergidae). We excavated burrow systems of male and female B. suillus during the summer and the winter to investigate whether male burrow architecture reflected putative mate-seeking behaviour. We consider burrow geometry in response to mating strategies. Male burrow systems explored the environment more efficiently than females. This is presumably because of the increase in associated energetic costs of being a large male. Males produce more mounds indicating territorial behaviour even when it is energetically costly to dispose of soil onto the surface when the soil is less friable during the summer. Overall tunnel dimensions did not differ between the sexes. It appears that a change in season does not affect the geometry of the burrow system or tunnel dimensions in a climatically buffered environment.",

To test this hypothesis, the life history of the established, extralimital Darlington Dam (33°10′31″S, 25°09′13″E) population was investigated. By counting post-fluorescent mark increments on otoliths from 21 chemically tagged wild fish recaptured 244–537 days later, the deposition of growth zones, comprising alternating opaque and translucent bands, was validated as annual. Examination of sectioned otoliths from 175 fish revealed that the oldest fish, two males of 840 and 1074 mm total length (TL), were 25 years old - 10 years older than previously described for any C. gariepinus population. The oldest female was 885 mm TL and 21 years old. Lengthat- age was subsequently described using the von Bertalanffy growth model. Combined-sex growth was best described as Lt = 931.7 ( 1 - exp(-0.15(t 2.43))) mm TL. Total mortality (Z) was calculated using catch curve analysis and the Chapman & Robson estimator to be 0.35/yr. The presence of specimens 15 years and older indicates that these fish established quickly and supports the finding that mortality rates are low, which, in turn, suggests likely long-term population persistence.",

To test the effects of huddling on Tb, 10 rock hyrax, Procavia capensis, were housed in outside cages in four groups, varying from one to four individuals. iButtons® were surgically implanted into each rock hyrax to record their Tb every 15 min from August to November. Despite considerable variations in ambient temperatures, the rock hyrax were found to display some degree of heterothermy by varying their mean Tb from 36.70 to 37.72°C (n = 10) but not allowing it to drop below 33.60°C or rise above 39.67°C.

Therefore, diagnostics for the infection should be expedient, efficient and flexible in applicability. We compared and contrasted two diagnostic techniques for avian malaria; microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We also used both methods to determine the basic distribution and prevalence of avian malaria amongst passerines in the Western Cape. Approximately 1000 birds from 49 species were sampled from 26 wetlands across the Western Cape and examined for avian malarial infections. Infections were categorized by genus of malarial pathogen and by bird species infected. Using ocular diagnosis, 183 (18%) birds were infected, compared to 221 (23%) birds diagnosed with PCR. Plasmodium spp. were found to be the predominant cause of infection using both techniques, followed by Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, respectively. Although outcomes from both techniques were strongly correlated, PCR was superior in terms of its sensitivity and expediency. PCR also has wider applicability for users with varying experience in malarial diagnostics, further endorsing molecular diagnostics as the default technique for in-depth analysis of avian malaria epidemiology.",

We measured the effects of supplemental food on activity and browsing patterns during seasons of scarce natural food resources in 2008 and 2009 for a herd of six animals in the Fathala Reserve (Senegal). In response to the provision of high-quality pods of Acacia albida, animals reduced foraging time in 2008 and allocated it to resting. This pattern corresponds to the animals’ behaviour in captivity without foraging versus vigilance trade-offs and with predictable (in time and space) access to food. In 2009, supplemental feeding had no effect on behaviour and was associated with increased foraging and ruminating times than in 2008, suggesting more limited natural food resources in 2009. We recorded high species diversity in the animals’ natural diet. Supplemental food did not induce changes in browsing pattern at the plant species level, probably due to small individual effect on total nutrient and energy intake. Food supplementation, however, facilitates the animals overcoming unfavourable conditions or alleviates stress with additional rest, and could therefore assist as a conservation intervention to enhance fitness.",

This negative relationship reflected changes in standing biomass of the two dominant filter-feeders (Octomeris angulosa and Perna perna) against that of the dominant grazer (Scutellastra cochlear). On sheltered shores the biomass of trophic groups varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the intertidal gradient studied, with values of grazers and algae decreasing with increased aerial exposure. Similar, but less substantial (P > 0.05) variations were recorded at semi-exposed sites, where the median shell length < 0.05). Multivariate analyses of square-root transformed biomass values separated most of the sheltered Cochlear zone stations from semi-exposed ones.

Only 25 % of pairs laid eggs, and mating appears to have been constrained by low nectar and arthropod energy availability, and the costs associated with the defence of large territories. Reproductive success was directly related to arthropod availability on territories, with pairs not even appearing to attempt breeding if this is low.

Women and children dig up a variety of crabs in the mangrove ecosystem, and in the late 1980s collected as many as 638 000 crabs a year. The red mangrove crab Neosarmatium meinerti de Man, 1884 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Grapsidae: Sesarminae) constituted the major proportion of these catches, while Scylla serrata and Cardisoma carnifex made up the rest. However, subsistence fishing effort and catches have been reduced steadily, declining from about 5000outings p.a. and between 2 and4×105 crabs p.a. in the 1980s, to about 1000 outings and 1.3 × 105 crabs in the late 1990s. CPUE has increased from 66 to 145 crabs/person/outing during this period. Crab densities ranged between 0.35/m2 on the high shore and 11.4/m2 on a densely vegetated island, but it was not clear what factors most affected crab density. Densities inside and outside a ‘sanctuary area’ were not significantly different, although there were significant differences in densities among sites within the ‘sanctuary area’. Stock size within the entire mangrove area of Kosi was estimated as 728 514 N. meinerti, butthis is almost certainly an underestimate of the total stock size. Sex ratios in the N. meinerti population were not significantly different from 1:1 but above 38 mm carapace width (CW) male crabs considerably outnumbered females. Females matured at 24.9 mm CW and mean sizes of crabs captured by subsistence harvesters were 33.4 mm and 31.3 mm CW for males and females, respectively. Instantaneous natural mortality was estimated at M = 2.27 and fishing mortality F = 0.83. The N. meinerti population in the Kosi mangrove system appears to be sustainably exploited.",

The fish utilized a mean river stretch of 1330 m (range = 24– 3787). Nembwe were recorded in a variety of habitats, and the individual variation in movements and habitat use was substantial. All the fish were recorded in the mainstream of the river, but 62% of the fish were recorded in one or more additional main habitat types. During rising and high water, 67% and 71% of the fish, respectively, were recorded in adjacent temporary flooded areas during some or all tracking surveys, but did not undertake long-distance migrations onto the floodplains. It is concluded that although staying within relatively small home ranges, nembwe appears as a species with a variable and flexible habitat utilization.",

To establish whether these interac tions lead to fertilization, five microsatellite loci were used to infer paternity in a honey badger population from the Kgalagadi Transfrontier National Park. In total, 26 individuals comprising 10 cubs, eight known mothers and eight potential fathers were analysed. Exclusion analysis and a likelihood based approach identified the dominant male in the study population as the most likely father of 50% of the cubs (≥80% likelihood confidence). The remaining five cubs were most likely fathered by four different subordi nate males (≥80% likelihood confidence). The results suggest that the brief mating opportunities afforded to subordinate males lead to fertilization, and hence that the dominance hierarchy system of the honey badger is not strong enough to exclude sneak fertil izations.",

Lygodactylus incognitus (cryptic dwarf gecko) and Lygodactylus soutpansbergensis (Soutpansberg dwarf gecko) are range-restricted endemics to the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa, and have recently been shown to be potentially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This prompted us to study the relationship between the thermoregulatory characteristics and environmental temperatures for these syntopic species. Active geckos (i.e. those outside of a refuge) and environmental variables were recorded during scan surveys across two seasons. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict and explain activity based on presence/absence measures and environmental variables for each species. Of the variables measured, air temperature (Ta) was the main predictor of activity for both species. Cryptic dwarf geckos were active in cooler Ta than warmer temperatures in comparison to Soutpansberg dwarf geckos. Cryptic dwarf geckos are thus well adapted to temperate conditions. Soutpansberg dwarf geckos appear well adapted for warmer conditions, as they were more likely to be active at higher Ta. Our findings suggest that both species will alter their daily activity times in response to changing climate, but that the cryptic dwarf gecko is likely to be more negatively impacted than the Soutpansberg dwarf gecko, due to their affinity for cooler temperatures and avoidance of the hottest temperatures exhibited during the study period. Therefore, although these broadly sympatric, syntopic, range-restricted species are closely related and have similar life histories, they occupy different thermal niches and are likely to respond to climate change idiosyncratically. Our findings caution against the overuse of proxy species in predicting species geographic distribution changes in response to climate change.",

In order to achieve this objective, it is important to study the bio-ecology of the fish to ascertain the exploitation status and the potential for culture. Fish were collected monthly from February to November 2018 from three sampling sites (Topo, Akarakumo and Ajido) in Badagry Creek, Lagos, Nigeria using gears like cast net, gill nets and traps. The samples were analysed for length-weight relationship, population parameters and feeding preference. The population dynamics of the stock was assessed by the Von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) using Electronic Length Frequency Analysis. The parameters of VBGM; asymptomatic length (L∞) and growth coefficient (K) were 20.46 cm and 0.62 year−1, respectively. The growth performance index (Ǿ) was 2.41 and the potential longevity (tmax) was 4.84 years. The total, natural and fishing mortalities were 1.06, 0.68 and 0.38 year−1, respectively. The exploitation rate was estimated as 0.36. The length at first maturity (L50) was 13.79 cm and the length at first capture (Lc) was 12.27 cm. E0.1, E0.5 and Emax are 0.60, 0.38 and 0.70, respectively. The dominant food items in the gut of the fish belong to the algae phylum, Chlorophyta. The study showed that S. melanotheron from Badagry Creek are planktivores and the exploitation rate of the fish is currently close to optimum and should be sustained at this level to prevent overexploitation.",

Although both regard individual differences in behaviour as adaptive in their own right, these two developments appear, at first glance, to be opposing approaches to analysing animal behaviour. Personalities consist of suites of behaviours that are correlated across situations (e.g. some animals are consistently more or less aggressive across situations than other animals) and assumes that animals are limited in their response to their environment. By contrast, the biological market approach considers organisms as traders of commodities (e.g. food or grooming) where the exchange rates of commodities changes with time and is influenced by shifts in the abundance and demand for the commodity, as happens in human markets. Biological markets thus view animal behaviour as extremely plastic whereas the putative existence of animal personalities suggests that animal behaviour may be relatively inflexible. However, the two approaches may be more similar than heretofore realized and may be complementary rather than opposing. Here I briefly review each approach and show how animal personalities can arise from a biological market situation.",

There has been little effort to evaluate the genetic structure of grasscutters despite long-term harvesting pressure and over 40 years of grasscutter domestication in West Africa. Our objectives were to quantify the genetic structure of wild grasscutters, and to compare genetic variation from wild samples to those from various farmed samples within south-western Nigeria. We genotyped 145 wild and 88 domesticated individuals at 11 microsatellite loci and present results quantifying regional genetic structuring and the relative patterns of diversity among wild and domesticated grasscutter populations. Our data reflect high differentiation between wild and domesticated grasscutters, and significantly greater allelic richness and gene diversity in the former. Despite this, domesticated populations appear to have similar levels of observed heterozygosity and comparable levels of differentiation among domesticated samples relative to wild samples. This may be the result of high turnover within captive colonies, or frequent infusion of new animals. More detailed molecular and quantitative genetic studies are recommended on this species to be able to understand their natural variation, degree of connectivity and to improve strategies for domestication.",

Bicoxidens, similar to many other endemic soil invertebrates, exhibits low dispersal capabilities and strict microclimate habitat preferences, attributes that often lead to geographic isolation. Given that prolonged geographic isolation often lays the foundation for population genetic differentiation, genetic divergence and possibly speciation, there was good reason to suspect that Bicoxidens may consist of several distinct lineages. On this basis, the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) was used to reconstruct the phylogeny of Bicoxidens and reveal divergent lineages within the genus. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses recovered a paraphyletic Bicoxidens phylogram with divergent lineages present in three species – B. friendi, B. flavicollis and B. brincki – suggesting high genetic diversity within the genus. Bayesian genetic cluster analyses suggested the presence of multiple distinct mitochondrial lineages within the genus with four identified in B. flavicollis alone. It was therefore concluded that the divergent lineages observed among Bicoxidens populations may suggest the presence of hidden species.",

    "abstract": "In many social species physical attributes correlate with dominance rankings and influence the outcomes of dyadic interactions. We investigated the processes that affect white rhinoceros' social behaviour in response to a reduction in horn size asymmetries within a group of subadult individuals. We monitored agonistic social interactions and the orderliness of social rankings between six free ranging rhinoceroses before and after they underwent a second dehorning procedure. We used a modified version of Landau's h' to measure linearity, a score of steepness to measure power asymmetry, and a measure of triangle transitivity to assess relationships in the presence of null dyads. Agonistic social interactions were significantly greater after the monitored dehorning procedure. Hierarchies possessed significant steepness and transitivity prior to the procedure, but not after. Linearity was non-significant and rank order did not correspond with changes in horn size or age. Our results provide the first evidence of a dominance hierarchy among free-ranging white rhinoceroses outside of reproductive competition, but indicate that physical attributes alone do not explain social rankings. Rhinoceroses transitioned to a more egalitarian dominance structure than a despotic one after the procedure, but dominance ranks were only weakly differentiated within the group. Although a reduction in horn asymmetries may increase agonistic behaviours via psychosocial or behavioural changes, drier climatic conditions cannot be ruled out as the causative factor and because the subadult group stayed together, rather than dispersing, any increased fitness costs are likely to be minimal and outweighed by the benefits of group membership.",

Here we consider the effects of an alien invasive tree (Acacia dealbata, 5–8 m tall) on avifaunal numbers, richness and diversity in A. dealbata patches of three sizes relative to adjacent montane grasslands. Analysis of historical aerial photographs showed that A. dealbata first occurred in the area in the late 1930s/early 1940s and has continued to spread, despite some efforts by the landowner to keep it in check. It now covers approximately 11% of the site. This has provided habitat for a number of bird species more characteristic of wooded vegetation types. The number, richness and diversity of birds were greater in A. dealbata patches than the adjacent grasslands of equivalent size. These measures increased with increasing patch size, but more rapidly for A. dealbata patches than grassland ones. Only six of the 48 species of birds recorded were common between the two vegetation types. The most common feeding guild in the A. dealbata patches was insectivores, whereas in the grasslands it was omnivores. Although the invasion of A. dealbata has added to the habitat diversity of the area, thereby facilitating increased avifaunal diversity, if it continues to spread, then the populations and perhaps richness of grassland birds are likely to be negatively affected.",

Pristurus samhaensis from the small islands of Samha (n = 18) and Darsa (n = 24) and P. sokotranus from the main island of Socotra (n = 40) were compared. Like other Pristurus species, P. samhaensis on Samha and P. sokotranus on Socotra were highly myrmecophagous (76.7% and 38.6% ants, respectively). However, ants were absent from the diet of P. samhaensis on Darsa. In contrast to the rich native ant fauna of the other islands, only one ant species was reported for Darsa, Pheidole teneriffana, likely a recently introduced species. Pristurus samhaensis seems to have overcome this scarcity in ant prey by consuming substitute prey, namely Coleoptera and Heteroptera, which are secondary for the other two populations studied. The two P. samhaensis populations inhabiting the small islands displayed less diverse diets compared to that of P. sokotranus from the main island where vegetation structure was more complex. Prey items of P. samhaensis from Darsa were also smaller than those of P. sokotranus from Socotra, those of P. samhaensis from Samha being intermediate. It remains unclear how ancient these differences are, but they are probably too recent to have promoted special morphological and ecological adaptations in these geckos.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFor most of the year, Meyer’s parrots in the Okavango Delta do not form large feeding flocks, and groups larger than two or three are probably the result of opportunistic aggregation at favoured food items after dispersion from communal roosts. Communal roosting likely does not facilitate flocking unless the food resources are close to the roost site, but may function in anti-predator defence. Meyer’s parrots appear to be dependent on riverine forest, Acacia-Combretum marginal woodland and mopane woodland for roost sites in the Okavango Delta. They aggregated more during the breeding season due to their specialist nutritional requirements, and female dependence on food provisioning by the male parrots. Meyer’s parrots may be sedentary in the Okavango Delta, but the possibility of limited local movements in other areas (especially the Zimbabwean highlands) should be investigated.Key words: Meyer’s parrotOkavango Deltacommunal roostflocking dynamics",

    "abstract": "Information on animal diversity and distribution is essential for designing management plans for conservation. This study aimed to investigate primate diversity and species’ distributions in the Maze National Park, southern Ethiopia. The study was conducted during the dry season (January–March) and wet season (June–August) in 2020. Fourteen line transects in four stratified habitats were followed, and 613 individual primates belonging to three species [olive baboon Papio anubis (Lesson, 1827), mantled guereza Colobus guereza (Rüppell, 1835), and vervet monkey Chlorocebus pygerythrus (F. Cuvier, 1821)] were identified. Papio anubis was the most frequently observed primate species in both the dry and wet season in the riverine forest (n = 99 and n = 97, respectively) and in woodland (n = 43 and n = 40, respectively), whereas fewer C. pygerythrus were observed in the riverine forest in both seasons (n = 38 and n = 34 in the dry and wet season, respectively). The highest numbers of primates were recorded in the wet and dry season in the riverine forest (n = 194 and n = 204, respectively), followed by woodland (n = 78 and n = 80, respectively), open grassland (n = 10 and n = 17, respectively), and wooded grassland (n = 8 and n = 18, respectively). During the dry season, the riverine forest habitat had the highest diversity index (H′ = 1.25). These findings will be useful for the urgent prioritisation of primate conservation programmes in the park.",

    "abstract": "Multi-method sampling approaches are becoming increasingly popular for investigating species occurrence at specific sites, as there is a need to accurately monitor species with limited time and resources. In this study, a multi-method comparative approach was used to survey bat species in the foothills of the Drakensberg Mountain range in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. We used historical museum records and species distribution modelling (SDM) to predict which species would likely occur in our study area. We then compared physical capture (by deploying mist nets) with acoustic surveys (using an Anabat bat detector) to assess the bat species assemblages present. Species distribution models predicted eight bat species to occur from the historical checklist of 28 species recorded in the broader region, as no museum records existed for the specific study area. Species detection by acoustic data yielded the highest number of detected species (n = 11) while active trapping yielded nine species from 54 individuals of four families, namely, Laephotis botswanae, L. capensis, Myotis tricolor, Pipistrellus hesperidus, Rhinolophus clivosus, and Tadarida aegyptiaca with molecular confirmation required for Miniopterus fraterculus, R. darlingi and R. swinnyi. These complementary sampling methods may be necessary for accommodating the limitations of each individual method for a more inclusive assessment of bat species richness in a targeted landscape. The present study could be used as a model approach to assess the biodiversity and demographics of other taxa and in other habitats.",

Comparative univariate and multivariate statistical analyses conducted on the two population samples included standard statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, range), multivariate analysis of variance, stepwise discriminant function analysis, cluster analysis and principal component analysis. No significant separation between the two island groups, based on cranial characteristics of adult males, was found.

Trachasina is currently monotypic and is erected to accommodate Trachythyone crucifera (Semper, 1869) which has remained erroneously in Trachythyone for so long, despite several reservations. Trachycucumis differs from Trachythyone in being a warm-water genus with body wall spicules in the form of spinous cross-shaped rods and multilocular plates with one end often prolonged as a spinous handle. The new species, T. plettenbergi differs from Thandar's Trachythyone sp. in the absence of rosette-shaped deposits and the simplicity of the plates. Trachasina, on the other hand, is unique in having 10 equal tentacles and sparsely distributed spicules in the form of spinous crosses, unlike those of Trachycucumis, and simple, thick, smooth, oval plates with few perforations and without any prolongations.Keywords: HolothuroideaDendrochirotidaCucumariidaenew speciesnew genera",

Field mice were trapped for three years in two regions of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, one that experienced a predictable and harsh winter (Mountain Zebra National Park; MZNP) and the other which experienced a milder winter (Thomas Baines Nature Reserve; TBNR). There was no winter inhibition of reproduction at TBNR, while at MZNP female reproductive activity was inhibited but males continued to produce spermatozoa in winter. We interpret this flexibility in the timing of reproduction as supporting an opportunistic reproductive strategy which may be an adaptation to the seasonal and often unpredictable climate of the region.Key words: opportunistic reproductionseasonal reproductionreproductive inhibition",

Petrocephalus bovei mainly feeds on chaoborid larvae, whereas both Marcusenius species preferentially feed on chironomid larvae. This segregation of food items associated with the relative abundance of chironomid larvae may reduce interspecific competition between these three fish species, and may therefore allow their coexistence. Horn's food overlap index revealed highly significant similarities in the trophic spectrum between both Marcusenius species, and for the dry as well as the rainy season.Key words: Mormyridaefeedingcompetitionman-made lakeIvory CoastWest Africa",

Occasional long distance movements suggest changes in foraging area, but these movements take place within a home range, to which the snakes show long-term fidelity. The snakes breed during the southern autumn, March to May. A male adder tracked during the breeding season performed a long, looping excursion well outside its home range. During this sally, through marginal to poor habitats and prime terrain, movements were rapid, with only short spells of inactivity, and little apparent foraging behaviour.

Contrary to our predictions, the faeces did not act as a deterrent to either predator. Tongueflick trials with cotton scent applicators indicated that the skinks showed a heightened predatory response to king cricket faeces over king cricket integument, field cricket integument and an odourless control. We suggest that ‘primary’ defence mechanisms, such as nocturnal behaviour, cryptic colouration and immobility, are more effective than ‘secondary’ defence mechanisms, such as stridulation, kicking and defecation. Given that the noxious faeces already have a demonstrated role in inter- and intrasexual communication, we suggest that the assumed defensive role of the faeces is minor or an epiphenomenon.",

The daily activity pattern of the population peaked between 10:00 and 12:00, reflecting the activity pattern of the more active sex, males. Females were out of cover, active, and feeding at higher temperatures than were males. The high temperatures probably allowed females to complete activities more efficiently, reducing their exposure time and predation risk.

    "abstract": "The Palmiet Estuary is a small, rural estuary in the Western Cape that only closes briefly during dry summers. The system was previously surveyed during 1979 to 1980 and we repeated the survey in April 2015 (mouth closed) and September 2015 (mouth open). Salinity, temperature, pH and oxygen saturation were measured, and invertebrate and fish faunas surveyed. Physico-chemical characteristics have undergone little directional change, apart from an apparent increase in pH, possibly as a result of changes in land use and application of fertilisers and pesticides in the catchment. Invertebrate species richness increased from 31 to 40 species, despite lower sampling effort in 2015. Most changes were among rare species, or were readily explained by changes in mouth condition and water chemistry. We also confirmed a substantial range extension of the tropical crab, Varuna litterata, rediscovered the locally endemic amphipod, Quadrivisio aviceps, and reported several new distribution records. Gastropods had virtually disappeared from the system, whereas the previously unreported bivalve, Brachidontes virgilae, had become abundant. Overall, fish diversity dropped from 19 to 11 species, but this can largely be ascribed to differ- ences in sampling frequency, season and mouth state. Comparisons of samples from like months showed the fish assemblage to have remained fairly stable, despite changes in inflowing water chemistry and infection of fish by the pathogenic water mould, Aphanomyces invadans. Bird abundance and diversity increased substantially. No alien invertebrate or fish species were recorded. Accordingly, in marked contrast to other smaller estuaries in the region, the Palmiet Estuary has remains in relatively good condition.",

Fifteen trained semi-captive elephants, as well as free-ranging elephants roaming under the same ecological conditions, were monitored. Faecal samples were collected over a nine-month period from both groups and these were analysed using an enzyme immunoassay detecting faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) with a 5β-α-ol-11-one structure. Elephants that participated in elephant-back-safari (EBS) activities showed significant decreases in fGCM concentrations when EBS were discontinued. Similarly, fGCM concentrations of the trained semi-captive individuals that did not participate in EBS showed decreased steroid concentrations over the same time. Overall, fGCM concentrations of the trained semi-captive herd and the free-ranging herd did not differ significantly. The collected data will help to better understand the physiological and behavioural requirements of semi-captive elephants with frequent exposure to humans. The findings will also help to optimise management strategies for wild elephant populations and elephants living in controlled environments on reserves exposed to wildlife tourism.",

However, there is increasing evidence of song production on migration routes and high-latitude feeding grounds. Within a breeding ground and season, males share songs that progressively change over time. Song production on migration routes leads to the cultural transmission and sharing of songs. This is the first assessment of song structure in humpback whales recorded near Cape Town, South Africa. Song was identified in recordings made between 9 September 2016 and 21 October 2016 on a moored hydrophone located in Fish Hoek, False Bay. Thirty-nine song sessions were recorded, consisting of nine distinct units, forming ten themes. Themes occasionally overlapped in time, indicating multiple simultaneous singers. They were repeated on multiple days with consistent patterns in theme transition, demonstrating song sharing amongst individuals. Convergence on a similar song structure suggests singing whales originate from the same breeding stock. We propose that an unknown proportion of these whales continue to sing beyond the recognised breeding season. These data support previous studies that found that singing is not restricted to low-latitude breeding sites.",

To date, genetic studies have largely been limited to single specimens per taxon and a scattered geographical distribution. A recent study focusing on South African Cercopithecus monkeys showed that populations can be divided into three distinct genetic entities. Our current study aims to add new mtDNA and microsatellite data from a coastal population (Vamizi Island) in Mozambique to compare to existing data from South Africa. Our additional data allowed analysis of the number and timing of radiation events of Cercopithecus monkeys in southern Africa. Here we propose the occurrence of a single, north-south radiation event during the mid-Pleistocene along the Afromontane forest belt and that after the Last Glacial Maximum, samango populations reradiated into (re)established coastal forests on a more local scale. Our population genetic data support this pattern for both Mozambican, as well as South African samango monkey populations. By including mtDNA sequence data from Cercopithecus across Africa, we also discuss the hypothesis that the 'Kingdon Line' may explain the divergence of two major species in Africa within the C. mitis/nictitans group: C. albogularis and C. mitis.",

Over this period, the pride consisted of between four and 11 lions with a paired coalition of adult males during the first three years and a single adult male for the next three years. We recorded shorter than normal interbirth intervals, high birth rates of 1.3 cubs/lioness/year, very high cub survival rates, and subadults leaving the pride at young ages. This translated into substantially faster growth rates than are typical in large lion populations in ecologically similar circumstances such as Kruger National Park, but are similar to those of lions in Serengeti National Park. These demographic characteristics were probably induced initially by a lack of intense intraspecific competition and high prey availability, but population stability was maintained through the removal of young subadults by management. Interestingly, variability in conception rates between lionesses resulted in lower growth rates than have been found in other similar reintroduced lion populations. These demographic traits characterize many of the small reintroduced lion populations, and call for appropriate management to avoid the consequences of high predator densities.",

Mean isopod abundances and biomasses ranged between 0 and 4791 ind/m2 and 0 and 9.65 mg/dwt/m2 in the West Kleinemonde Estuary and between 0 and 108 ind/m2 and 0 and 0.318 mg/dwt/m2 in the nearby East Kleinemonde Estuary. In the Kasouga Estuary, the values ranged between 0 and 3650 ind/m2 and 0 and 5.105 mg/dwt/m2. Temporal changes in the abundance and biomass of E. hylocoetes within the three systems was primarily linked to mouth phase, with populations crashing when the mouth was open and to a lesser extent, seasonality. In all three estuaries maximum abundance and biomass was recorded in the middle reaches, which could be ascribed to the presence of submerged macrophytes. E. hylocoetes demonstrates strong sexual dimorphism, with males being significantly larger than females (P < 0.05). Sex ratios were skewed in favour of females in all three estuaries. Females were encountered carrying young from an overall length of 2.5 mm throughout the year",

We investigated the role of bushclumps as refugia for small mammals, and examined the effect of a limited number of abiotic and biotic factors on their richness, diversity and abundance. Small mammals were surveyed using Sherman small mammal traps at two sites in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa (Mountain Zebra National Park and Kwandwe Private Game Reserve). Soil hardness and seed abundance, inside and outside bushclumps, were determined. Trap success was significantly higher inside bushclumpsthan in areas outside, and species diversity and the abundance of small mammals were greater within bushclumps compared tooutside. Bushclumps also had significantly softer soil and a higher concentration of seeds. We conclude that bushclumps provide a concentrated source of food and protection from predators for small mammals, and are thus used significantly more than adjacent open areas. The conservation of bushclumps is therefore important for the overall maintenance of ecosystem functioning.",

Amietia vertebralis tadpoles on the other hand are characterized by having five or more labial tooth rows in the lower jaw, tail mottling that is confined to the upper half of the tail musculature, a dorsal fin that originates at the body-tail junction but retains a low profile, rising abruptly to reach a maximum depth at about 40% of the tail length, and an average tail length of 1.5 times body length.

It is emended to be the Agulhas Bank, over much of which T. declivis is common and may, in places, be hugely abundant, forming Turritella-dominated benthic communities.

Two-choice and multiple-choice experiments were conducted using 10 animals of mixed sex for each experiment to compare bait preference of germinated and non-germinated grains. The results of the two-choice tests revealed that both germinated cereals and pulses were preferred to non-germinated by the test animals. The differences between the quantities consumed were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The results of Duncan's post hoc multiple comparison tests of germinated grain consumption by R. rattus were categorized into three subsets. The first subset consisted of pearl millet, Bengal gram, ragi and paddy. The second and third subsets consisted of green gram and black gram, respectively. It is concluded that by considering the cost of all four grains (in the first subset) any one of the cheapest among them in the germinated form could be recommended or used as a bait base for any of the two rodenticides for the management of R. rattus. Based on these results, germinated paddy was chosen (as it is the cheapest among the grains) for the laboratory toxicity studies. The acute toxicity tests (2% zinc phosphide) resulted in 100% mortality of rats under both no-choice and two-choice (germinated paddy with poison versus plain non-germinated paddy bait) tests. A powder formulation of bromadiolone (0.005%)-treated bait yielded 100% mortality of rats in no-choice tests, but only 60% mortality in two-choice tests. These results suggest that the 2% zinc phosphide with germinated paddy as a bait base was preferred over a powder formulation of bromadiolone (0.005%).

Growth lines of this species are too indistinct and irregular to be of any use. This study, therefore, adopted a more direct method of monitoring the shell length of individuals, by caging them in situ. Shell measurements were taken from the individuals in cages and the surrounding environment at monthly intervals for one year. Thereafter, salinities decreased below their tolerance range and the experiment was terminated. Caged and uncaged animals had a shell length of 31.0 ± 4.5 and 31.7 ± 2.3 mm after a year of growth, respectively. An overall growth rate of 0.049 ± 0.059 mm/d was derived for the caged animals.

Collected copepod specimens were fixed and preserved in 70% ethanol and studied with the stereo- and light microscopes. Most of the examined hosts (38) were infected with symbiotic siphonostomatoids. Ten different species representing five families were identified. Of these, seven represent new host records while four are new geographical records. The highest prevalences (>60%) were calculated for Eudactylina oliveri and Pupulina cliffi on M. eregoodootenkee and M. kuhlii while E. oliveri also exhibited the highest mean intensity values on these hosts.Key words: CopepodaSiphonostomatoidaMobulidaeSouth Africa",

We also compared the incidence of solitary individuals between the sexes and different seasons.We surveyed suitable rocky areas at two sites in the Graafwater district, South Africa, and all O. cataphractus individuals found, whether in groups or solitary, were marked and released back into their crevices. The areas were resurveyed after one month, three months and four months to compare crevice fidelity of solitary and group-living individuals. We found that solitary individuals were significantly less loyal to their rock shelters than individuals living in groups, and that solitary females appeared to be less loyal than solitary males. We found no significant difference in the frequency of solitary adult males in and outside of the mating season. Solitary adult males were significantly smaller in mean body size than group-living adult males, but did not have more scars or other deformities than the latter. We found no significant difference in the frequencies of solitary individuals during the wet and the dry seasons, or in the frequencies of solitary adult males versus solitary adult females recorded during any of the surveys. The significantly lower crevice fidelity displayed by solitary than group-living individuals supports the notion that being in a group must be the optimal situation for individuals of this relatively slow-moving cordylid. Our finding that solitary adult males were significantly smaller in mean body size than group-living adult males also suggests that the exclusion of less competitive males from groups may in part be responsible for the occurrence of solitary males.Key words: Cordylidaemark-recapturecrevicefidelitysexual differencesseasonal differencescompetitive exclusion",

On 19 of the trips a series of overlapping photographs were taken of the northern side of Black Rocks and the percentage of seals, which exhibited fresh white shark bite wounds recorded. A total of 53 sharks and 28 fresh shark-inflicted injuries were recorded on seals over the course of the study period. The maximum number of sharks sighted per hour (1.2) was in July and the highest percentage of shark bitten seals in November (0.6%). There was no significant relationship between the monthly sighting rate of sharks and the percentage of shark bitten seals (P = 0.40). The percentage of shark-inflicted injuries observed on seals increased with seal size. Most injuries were observed in the forebody (37.5%) and lower body regions (37.5%). Very few injuries (6.3%) were observed in the head and neck region. The low number of bite-inflicted injuries observed suggests that white sharks attack seals infrequently at Black Rocks.",

The Egyptian free-tailed bat, Tadarida aegyptiaca, is one of the most widespread of the molossids and is therefore an excellent model to study the variation in reproduction through latitudinal changes. Bats were collected during 2008 and 2009 from Pretoria (25°S), South Africa. In males, spermatogenesis was already underway in January (summer) and spermatozoa were first noted in the epididymis during May (late autumn), where they are stored until the end of September. From September, the testes showed little spermatogenic activity and possibly remained quiescent until early summer. In females, follicular development started prior to January with large Graafian follicles present in June. Ovulation, copulation and subsequent fertilization occurred in late August (spring). When compared to the same species from a low temperate latitude (33°S) it is apparent that spermatogenesis and follicular development were initiated earlier in the year at 25°S. We propose that the seasonal monoestry displayed by T. aegyptiaca at 25°S may be the norm throughout their distributional range and that a latitudinal difference of just eight degrees could influence the timing of events in the reproductive cycle of a free-tailed bat.",

The two most widely distributed species are H. granulatus and H. obscurus, the former occurring especially in the west and the other in the east, but their distributions overlap; in two instances they have been recorded from the same site. All species have a preference for rock outcrops, which are largely disjunct, and their regular prey comprises small ant species. Fieldwork over a period of 15 years indicated a very low dispersal rate; therefore one would expect localized ‘island’ populations rather than widely dispersed species. This means that the current species delimitations which lump geographically widespread populations may be incorrect. Mitochondrial DNA of specimens from each of 20 different localities across South Africa were analysed to test the hypothesis. Five of these localities did not yield results, but 14 yielded DNA from specimens which proved to belong to Horus and a fifteenth turned out to be a misidentified pseudoscorpion unrelated to Horus. The results were unequivocal: populations from each locality or group of closely-spaced localities were genetically distinct from any other one tested, and the greater the distance between localities, the greater the genetic differences (i.e. significant isolation by distance). This means that the current species delimitations for Horus are incorrect. It will require detailed micro-anatomical study to identify new characteristics on which species delimitations can be based in future.",

Subsequently this has been refuted and it is now hypothesized that these differences reflect whether the plants are pollinated by occasional or specialist nectarivores (feeding niche hypothesis). The volumetric intake, sugar preference and sugar concentration preference of the Cape white-eye (Zosterops virens), a small occasional nectarivore that also feeds on fruit and insects, was determined. This was done over a range of concentrations of both hexose and sucrose sugars using equicaloric solutions in pairwise choice tests. Birds exhibited no significant sugar type preference at any sugar concentration, but showed a preference for the lowest concentration (10%) of both hexose and sucrose solutions when presented with a range of sugar concentrations. The birds were able to meet energy demands on a dilute diet by adjusting volumetric intake and did not lose body mass. A significant preference for the 10% hexose and sucrose solutions may suggest that these occasional birds exert a selective pressure on the plants they pollinate to produce dilute nectar.Key words: bird pollinationCape white-eyeoccasional nectarivoresugar preferences",

The aim of this study was to determine whether the four species are spatially separated in terms of the microhabitat each species occupies, allowing them to occur in sympatry in this structurally simple system with a limited number of potential niches. The habitat preferences of the four species were investigated on the farm Gansfontein in the southwestern parts of the Tankwa Karoo Basin. The area was surveyed by walking transects through different habitat types and recording all active lizards. For each lizard observed, the species was identified and a photograph was taken of its microhabitat. At the end of the sampling period the microhabitats in which lizards were found were sorted into distinct types on the basis of substrate composition. During the survey, only one individual of N. tessellata was recorded, but sample sizes for the other three species were sufficiently large to provide a clear perspective of habitat segregation among the three species. The results showed that the three species are spatially separated at the study site, with P. lineo-ocellata being restricted to rocky areas, P. laticeps preferring gravel substrates and M. knoxii frequenting sandy areas. Although only anecdotal information is available, all indications are that the observed spatial separation of the three species is mainly the result of historical adaptation to the different substrate types.",

Native fish density was estimated in five pools and three riffles both above and below a 2 m-high waterfall that acts as a barrier to M. dolomieu. Both native species were relatively abundant (mean ± S.E. fish/100 m2: 152.10 ± 19.16–10.33 ± 6.06) at sites above the waterfall where M. dolomieu was absent, but absent or scarce (0–0.53±0.38 fish/100m2) at sites below it with M. dolomieu. There were no significant differences in measured environmental variables between sites above and below the waterfall, and M. dolomieu is thus implicated as the main factor responsible for the differences in native fish densities. These findings highlight the critical role of waterfalls in excluding non-native fishes from native fish refugia in the CFR.",

This study compared the alarm calls of the social buff-streaked chat, Oenanthe bifasciata, to the asocial African stonechat, Saxicola torquata. Spring traps were used to capture birds in the foothills of the Drakensberg Mountains, and pairs and groups were housed separately in outdoor aviaries. Both species were exposed to latex snakes and raptor models presented individually at 1 m, 5 m and 10 m respectively, while alarm calls were recorded. Analyses of the acoustic variables revealed that both call rate and duration decreased when the predator was further away. Larger groups of buff-streaked chats increased their raptor alarm call rate (39 calls in five minutes) and reduced the frequency of their end-pulses (for both predators) by 0.6 kHz. Hence, large groups present a louder, perhaps more formidable mob to discourage attack; softer end-pulses may minimize cues to the callers’ location, and higher call rates during high-risk situations reflect the response urgency required to escape aerial predation. African stonechats were quieter, a strategy, perhaps, to reduce detection. Group size may therefore influence the perception of threat, where larger and louder groups become more conspicuous for aerial predation.",

    "abstract": "Populations of Hippopotamus amphibius have declined throughout Africa in recent years, and are expected to decline further. An understanding of the population genetics of individual populations of hippos is necessary for effective management. To that end, we sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region or D-loop from 37 H. amphibius, from six herds in the central region of Kruger National Park (KNP), Republic of South Africa. We amplified a 453 bp segment by PCR, and identified 21 polymorphic sites and seven haplotypes. All of these haplotypes are private alleles, not found in other populations of hippos from southern Africa. Overall nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.01739, and haplotype diversity (hd) was 0.8273, within the range observed in other parts of Africa. Mismatch analysis conformed more closely to a model of constant population size than either rapid demographic or spatial expansion. An analysis of molecular variance demonstrated no significant differentiation among herds, and Mantel tests showed no significant relationship between geographic and genetic distance among herds separated by up to 47 km (measured as Euclidean [x,y] distance) or 77 km (measured along rivers). Over this range, the population appears to be a single panmictic unit. A test of the hypothesis that calves are more likely to share a mtDNA haplotype with an adult female in the same herd than an adult female from a different herd was not significant.",

We collected data on nest sites and usage for 42 nests over three breeding seasons in the communal areas surrounding the Matobo National Park. For the active nests in the breeding seasons of 2008/9 and 2009/10 the mean nearest neighbour distances were 4.41 km and 3.53 km, respectively. Most nests were found in granite crevices (67%) while the remainder were found in five different tree species. Most nests (90%) were in areas of subsistence crop farming, the remainder (10%) were found in forests and open savannas. The high breeding density of the southern ground hornbill in the communal areas surrounding the Matobo National Park in Zimbabwe could be attributed in part to traditional Ndebele culture which, for the most part, protects this species.

    "abstract": "Mass mortalities of the ascidian Pyura stolonifera occurred along the Tsitsikamma coast in May 1991 and again in February 2012, following infection of large proportions of the population with a white microbial growth. P. stolonifera appeared to be the only species affected, with the outer tunic the main site of infection. No signs of pollution or algal blooms were observed, but large variations in climatic conditions were associated with both events. The 1991 mortalities occurred during a warm spell in autumn, when there was a rapid increase in the daily air temperatures. Similarly, the February 2012 event occurred after abnormally high air temperatures of January 2012 declined sharply due to a cold-water upwelling event in early February. These findings are compared with those of other marine disease and mortality studies.",

Formerly, the Arabian house bats were referred to similar-looking white-bellied S. leucogaster, which differs from S. dinganii mainly by the colour of ventral pelage. We reassessed the taxonomic status of house bats from southwestern Yemen using genetic and morphological analyses. The Yemeni specimens clustered within two distantly related mitochondrial lineages of African Scotophilus: East African S. aff. dinganii, which is a paraphyletic group to S. dinganii s.str. from South Africa, andWest African S. leucogaster. This taxonomic assignation was based on published sequences of reference museum specimens. Differences in external and cranial measurements also indicated the presence of two distinct taxa in Yemen. The Yemeni and comparative Ethiopian populations of S. aff. dinganii showed close morphological similarity to the type specimen of S. nigrita colias from Kenya. Because the Yemeni and Ethiopian yellow-bellied house bats cannot be synonymized with S. dinganii, the designation S. colias is tentatively suggested for this particular East African and Yemeni lineage of the S. dinganii complex. However, final correspondence of this name with the respective populations or applicability of some of other available names must yet be explored. Based on environmental differences of the Yemeni localities of origin, S. colias appears to be ecologically delimited to mountainous habitats, while S. leucogaster to harsh lowland deserts. This is consistent with known habitats of African populations of both species.",

Sampling was conducted biannually over two years during summer and winter, using selective sampling gear to target estuarine-associated marine species. During this period the East Kleinemonde Estuary opened more frequently than the West Kleinemonde Estuary and it also experienced a greater number of bar overwash events when larval recruitment can occur. The timing of mouth opening and the frequency of marine overwash events did not influence species richness of marine-spawning species but had a pronounced effect on abundances (catch-per-unit-effort) of species. The species composition of both estuaries was similar, but the catch-per-unit-effort in the East Kleinemonde Estuary was more than three times greater than that of the West Kleinemonde Estuary. The East Kleinemonde also supported a greater proportion of immature individuals of Rhabdosargus holubi and Monodactylus falciformis, and the length frequency distributions of both these species differed significantly between the two estuaries. The larger fish sizes in the West Kleinemonde Estuary were attributed to the prolonged mouth closure that resulted in the trapping of larger juveniles and mature fish within the estuary.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the hypothesis that the regular use of the southern harvester termite, Microhodotermes viator, as food source by the armadillo lizard, Ouroborus cataphractus, originated as an adaptation to survive the summer dry season in a climatic regime where rainfall is highly seasonal. To do so, we determined the most important climatic predictors of the geographical range of this species. Climatic data were obtained for 130 localities where O. cataphractus is known to occur and 168 adjacent localities where it is known to be absent. For each locality, data for 10 climatic variables were extracted from the South African Atlas of Agrohydrology and Climatology database. We constructed a forward stepwise logistic regression model of the probability of O. cataphractus occurrence, based on the set of 10 climatic variables. The best model included, in order of importance, average monthly summer rainfall, mean annual precipitation, average monthly solar radiation, and the ratio of winter rainfall over summer rainfall as most significant predictors. The selected model predicted 88.80% of the presences correctly and 85.52% of the absences. In essence, O. cataphractus is restricted to the winter rainfall zone of South Africa, excluding the high-rainfall southwestern section. We postulate that the highly predictable seasonal rainfall and the ameliorating effect of the Atlantic Ocean on climates in the Namaqualand region, in particular, have provided a unique selective regime for the origin of group-living in O. cataphractus. Dependence on M. viator as food source developed to survive the summer-autumn period of low food availability and resulted in the evolution of heavy armour and group-living behaviour. The moderate winters and early spring temperatures allowed full capitalization on high arthropod abundance during winter–spring, thereby overriding the negative impacts of armour and group-living on foraging efficiency at the home crevice.",

Examination of the type material clearly shows that the name is referable to the southern African species. The Australian species must henceforth be known as Turritella captiva Hedley, 1987, a name previously regarded as a junior synonym of T. declivis. The original type locality 'China Seas' is erroneous, as was often the case with material collected during the voyage of the Samarang. It is emended to be the Agulhas Bank, over much of which T. declivis is common and may, in places, be hugely abundant, forming Turritella-dominated benthic communities. Such communities have been recorded in other parts of the world and are frequently associated with seasonal upwelling events, but have not previously been documented off South Africa.Key words: Turritella declivistaxonomydistributionSouth Africa",

Field studies on post-metamorphic anurans from tropical Australia have correlated increased prevalence with cool winter temperatures, but similar studies are lacking from Africa. We monitored the seasonality of amphibian chytrid in the Highveld of South Africa through microscopic examination of common river frog (Amietia angolensis ) tadpoles over 12 months.Within the study area Bd was found to be widespread, but largely limited to riverine systems. The seasonal infection pattern was inconsistent with the findings of past studies, which showed that prevalence usually peaks during the cooler months of the year. This study indicates that infection levels increased during spring in the Grassland Biome, when temperatures favoured optimum thermal growth of the fungus and when streams reached minimum flow levels.",

Although the prevalence of these items was low, with sun spiders recorded in nine and scorpion remains in one of 246 scats, our observations suggest that aardwolves opportunistically feed on larger prey than previously thought. However, our observations do not suggest that aardwolves utilized these large prey items as alternatives to their main food resource during periods of food scarcity.

The aim of the study was to record ectoparasite species that occur on this non-indigenous population and to compare the parasite abundance and prevalence at three different times during 2011. Forty-six warthogs were culled in autumn (15), winter (16) and spring (15). Each individual warthog was screened for ectoparasites for 7–10 minutes by 3–4 persons. Parasites were removed using forceps and stored in 70% ethanol. Ticks were identified by an expert taxonomist, while fleas and lice were identified using published books containing their respective taxonomic keys. A single flea (Echidnophaga larina) and louse (Haematopinus phacocheri) species and three tick species (Hyalomma truncatum, Rhipicephalus gertrudae and Rhipicephalus simus) were recovered from 46 warthogs. The louse and flea were the most abundant ectoparasitic taxa, while the ticks had lower mean abundances. This is the first record of the tick R. gertrudae on warthogs in South Africa. Temporal variation in parasite abundance was observed. The louse was most abundant during spring and summer, while the flea preferred cooler and drier winter conditions. Hyalomma truncatum and R. gertrudae both preferred warmer spring conditions. In general, parasite species richness in the non-indigenous host population was low, which could support the parasite release hypothesis.",

All three otomyine rodents display a gastro-intestinal system well suited to a wholly herbivorous diet, with a well-developed caecum and relatively long large intestine. Despite the broad similarity in the gross gastro-intestinal anatomy between the species examined in this study and their mesic-occurring otomyine counterparts, the results suggest an elongation of the large intestine, with a concurrent reduction in the size of the small intestine in the arid-occurring species. We argue that this trend may be related to water conservation and is supported by the distribution of the three species, with P. littledalei, which occurs in the most arid areas of the three, having the longest large intestine.",

Exclusion analysis and a likelihood-based approach were employed to assess paternity using genetic data, although low genetic diversity in the Addo elephant population limited the power of these techniques. However, GAA could be excluded as father of a minimum of 34 % of calves, and was the most likely father of a maximum of only 28 % of calves. Behavioural data support the genetic data, since there is no indication that GAA monopolizes mating opportunities.

This suggests that these communities were more resilient than previously assumed.

Previous workers already identified P. lineo-ocellata and M. knoxii as sit-and-wait foragers and N. tessellata as an active forager. We recorded data on three foraging variables: movements per minute, proportion of time spent moving, and proportion of attacks on prey whilst moving, for juveniles and adults of P. laticeps. By comparing the foraging data obtained for P. laticeps to those for other lacertid species, we were able to demonstrate that adult P. laticeps are ambush foragers. We also noted a significant ontogenetic shift in foraging behaviour in P. laticeps, and, due to a significantly higher frequency of short brief movements, we classified juveniles as mixed foragers. The sharing of an ambush foraging strategy by at least three of the four lacertid species co-occurring on the Tankwa plains, suggests considerable overlap along the trophic dimension of ecological space. This overlap presumably promotes occupation of separate microhabitats by the three ambush foragers in the Tankwa Karoo Basin.",

Estimating survival in wild populations is of key importance when understanding population dynamics and life-history evolution. However, data are lacking for a large and charismatic group of lizards, the chameleons. We conducted a Robust Design (RD) capture–mark–recapture (CMR) experiment on the Cape dwarf chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, at two nested sites within the Cape Town Metropolitan Area, South Africa, in order to estimate survival and movement of adults in and around an isolated 3.5 ha patch of suitable habitat. Over a nine-week period, 97 individuals were identified in 379 captures from five primary capture sessions with three secondary events each. Analysis of CMR data provided evidence that smaller chameleons have a substantially lower survival per 10-day period than larger chameleons. RD analysis showed that males were more prone to temporary emigration than females, while open multi-strata analysis revealed that smaller chameleons more readily moved between the sites than larger chameleons. Our findings offer first important insights into chameleon survival and life-history dynamics, which suggest a more vagile subadult population and the possibility of male biased dispersal. Our results have implications for managing the conservation of threatened chameleon populations in highly fragmented urban habitats.",

One of the most curious aspects of this species flock is the large number (8) of piscivorous species. Cyprinids are not well designed for piscivory (i.e. small slit-shaped pharyngeal cavity, lack of teeth in the oral jaws, lack of a stomach), which raises the question how well adapted these labeobarbs actually are to function as piscivores? In this study we analyse the kinematics of prey capture (by varied combinations of suction, swimming and jaw protrusion) among Lake Tana’s piscivorous labeobarbs. Suction feeding kinematics were similar to values reported for other piscivorous fish species. A detailed analysis of several Labeobarbus species displayed distinct types of techniques (overswimming, velocity/volume suction with jaw protrusion) suited to capture elusive prey in different macro-habitats. Lake Tana’s Labeobarbus species evolved a wide range of piscivorous predation techniques, a unique scenario for cyprinid fishes.Key words: Adaptive radiationEvolutionFunctional morphologyPredationTrophic segregation",

Dusky dolphin sighting rates varied considerably between years, but were generally higher in areas with lower hake availability and sandier shores (mostly straighter coastline). Large groups of 50–200 dusky dolphins were only seen in St Helena Bay, the site of a wind-driven upwelling zone. Heaviside’s dolphins were found in shallower, cooler water than dusky dolphins and were more likely to be seen during brighter phases of the moon (when nocturnal light conditions may influence the vertical migration patterns of prey) and in areas of high hake abundance. Near-shore fishing activity was higher in the northern half of the study area and clustered around harbours. Set netting occurred only at Yzerfontein and St Helena Bay, but due to changes in the industry is currently thought to be a low threat to the population. Interactions between Heaviside’s and dusky dolphins were usually neutral and sympatry appears to be mediated by differences in overall range and the type and size of prey species taken.",

Two clades can be identified through maximum likelihood, bayesian and network analyses: the first one is limited to the Korup National Park, while the second one has a broad geographical distribution in west-Central Africa. The second clade can be further divided into three sub-clades. The results of neutrality tests and mismatch distributions indicate that a population expansion occurred in these sub-clades. During the middle or upper Pleistocene, the west-Central African populations of P. misonnei may have been isolated in four different forest refugia, followed by population expansion and secondary contact during more humid periods. High genetic diversity was observed in the region of the Bakossi highlands, and the Cameroon Volcanic Line limits the geographical distribution of clades. Thus it seems likely that this volcanic line has in the past constituted a barrier that prevented the east–west exchange between P. misonnei populations through the expansion of the montane forest habitat. Our results also highlight the role of the Sanaga and Ogooué-Ivindo rivers in shaping P. misonnei genetic structure.Key words: Africaforest refugiamammalphylogeographyriver",

Aggression may therefore be favoured by sexual selection, the strength of which can be assessed using repeatability of aggressive behaviour. Here, we tested the hypotheses that male swordtails, Xiphophorus sp., are consistent in the aggressive and mating behaviours exhibited and in the time spent at a close distance to females (female attendance), and that aggressive males gain increased opportunity to attempt copulation compared to their less aggressive conspecifics (sneak frequency). As predicted, aggression between males, and male display and sneak frequency were repeatable. However, male aggression was not significantly correlated with sneak frequency. The function of aggression in this species is not clear-cut and may have an indirect female access function through formation of dominance hierarchies or defence of resources. A surprising finding highlighted by this study was the contradictory results for consistency in female contact, with high repeatability scores indicating consistency in behaviour but the within-subjects component of repeated measures ANOVA showing differences in female contact between trials. The possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.",

Although similar in size to C. pumilus, the AFS specimens differed in several features, most notably the degree of skull flattening, a feature shared with S. petrophilus. The AFS specimens also lacked the flap of skin joining the ears, a feature of C. pumilus. These differences suggest that the bats from AFS are S. petrophilus rather than C. pumilus.

Bulinus senegalensis, Bulinus forskalii, Bulinus globosus, Biomphalaria pfeifferi and Lymnaea natalensis occurred throughout the study area and are potential intermediate hosts for schistosomes. Only Biomphalaria pfeifferi was found to be naturally infected with Schistosoma mansoni at nearly all sites in the rice fields. Infection rates were high and varied among sites (21.0–68.6%) and months (14.8–76.6%). Bulinus forskalii was scarce in, and Bulinus truncatus absent from, the study area. Our data are compared with published data for this area as well as for northern Cameroon.",

Comparison of the ratio of shell length to aperture length (L/AL), plotted against shell length (L) in a scatter diagram, showed a 47% overlap between the dimensions of the Nchout Monoun sample and those from KwaZulu-Natal. From previous observations on the diploid chromosome number, single electrophoretic bands on HBDH and IDH enzyme systems, euphallic genital system, arrowhead-shaped mesocones and the characteristic features of the shell, we conclude that Bulinus sp. from Nchout Monoun is closely related to B. natalensis.",

These localized extinctions and \nreduction in population sizes undermine the ability of species to evolve and adapt to changing \nenvironments as a result of genetic erosion. The genetic consequences of the widespread \nreduction of population sizes as a result of social strife in sub-Saharan Africa are not well \ndocumented. Here we review past molecular genetic data that are relevant to understanding of \nthe genetic effects of war and social strife on Africa's wildlife. Uganda was probably one of the \nworst affected countries. Before 1972, Uganda had large herds and a variety of mammals. \nHowever, following the breakdown of law and order, some large mammals were exterminated \nwhile other populations were decimated. Recent results of genetic surveys in five large \nmammals in Uganda (the common warthog, savanna elephant, savanna buffalo, common \nhippopotamus and Uganda kob) suggest a substantial erosion of genetic diversity in the \nelephants and warthogs of Queen Elizabeth National Park. Although the rest of the studied \nmammals show no direct loss of genetic diversity, strong genetic differentiation was observed \namong most populations separated by even short geographical distances, indicating an \nincrease in the 'between' component of genetic diversity that could have been accelerated by \ngenetic erosion due to decrease in population sizes.",

In order to understand the effects of elevated temperature on African reptile physiology and health, additional research is required. We studied the physiological stress response of sungazer lizards (Smaug giganteus) facing elevated temperatures within captivity. Control animals (1M, 2F) were kept at 30 °C throughout the 13-week study period. Test animals (1M, 2F) were exposed to 30 °C for four weeks (stage 1), 39 °C for six weeks (stage 2) and 30 °C for three weeks (stage 3). Faecal samples were collected from both control and test animals to monitor faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations as a proxy of physiological stress. Although the fGCM levels of control females remained constant, test females showed an acute fGCM increase following the increase and subsequent decrease of temperatures. The test male had significantly higher fGCM levels during stage 3, compared with stage 1 and 2. The control male, although displaying constant fGCM levels throughout the study, had higher fGCM levels than the test male. The results indicate that a considerable temporal increase in environmental temperature did not lead to chronically elevated adrenocortical activity in sungazer lizards. It is likely that inherent traits within the species allow the species to adapt to such changes. Furthermore, the endangered status of the species and limited availability of study animals restricted the sample size in this study to a few, captive-based lizards. Therefore, although our results are an important addition to reptile conservation, they should be extrapolated to free-ranging populations with caution. Future research should consider the effects of chronically elevated temperature in relation to water and food shortages, as well as interindividual variation in physiological responses.",

The total sample of 87 lizards, consisted of 26 adult males, 49 adult females and 12 juveniles. Size at sexual maturity was determined as 60 mm snout–vent length (SVL) for both sexes. Generation glands were found to be present in males only and the number present was significantly correlated to body size. Both adult males and adult females possessed active femoral glands, but males had significantly more than females. Females were found to reach larger body sizes than males, but adult males had relatively larger heads than females. No significant difference in scar frequency was found between male and female samples. The female-biased SSD in P. nebulosus and its sister species, P. capensis, is tentatively ascribed to fecundity selection for offspring to be large at birth in order to survive in a predictable unfavourable environment at high altitudes. Variation in SSD among montane cordylids is discussed and the need for more comprehensive data is highlighted.",

First, all three genetic systems (X-DNA, Y-DNA and mtDNA) agree that the earliest divergence separates West African from Central African species, consistent with a major faunal transition zone in the vicinity of the Cross River. Second, the X-DNA and mtDNA trees reveal polyphyly of C. cephus lineages.

This family is poorly studied and more research is necessary, particularly as certain estrildid species have been highlighted as data-deficient whilst others are potentially of conservation concern. The South African Bird Ringing scheme (SAFRING) has longevity records for 23 of the 27 southern Africa estrildid species. The maximum longevity record was 10.9 years (Blue Waxbill Uraeginthus angolensis). The overall average longevity for an individual is 3.7 years (SD = 2.5). The low longevity values make sense given the low mass (6.3–22.7 g) of estrildids. Coupled with large clutch sizes of four eggs on average, as well as potentially low surivival, estrildids may counter low longevity by breeding at an early age and double-brooding.",

    "abstract": "Grazing by large mammals alters vegetation physiognomy, consequently changing habitat suitability for small mammal communities. We investigated the response of terrestrial small mammals to grazing by wild and domesticated ungulates at the boundary of a protected area (Telperion Nature Reserve) and surrounding cattle ranches in Mpumalanga, South Africa over two seasons. Fifteen paired grids were set on either side of the boundary fence at which small mammals were trapped in Sherman live traps placed flat on the ground. A total of 11 760 trap nights resulted in the capture of 187 animals belonging to 14 species (11 rodents, two shrews and one elephant shrew). The small mammal communities in grasslands grazed by domesticated or wild ungulates were similar in abundance, species richness, diversity and demographic parameters, likely due to the fact that vegetation structure of the two grazing systems was also similar. We used generalised linear models to show that rock and grass cover were plausible predictors of small mammal abundance in this system. Rock cover showed a positive relationship with small mammal abundance whilst grass cover showed a negative relationship. Our observations suggest that at the scale of our study and with the current stocking densities, wild and domesticated ungulates have similar impacts on the small mammal community.",

Marion Island (46°54‘S, 37°45‘E) is host to a relatively small breeding population of southern elephant seals, which like its counterparts in the southern Indian and southern Pacific Oceans, have declined precipitously over the past few decades. An intensive mark–recapture study, which commenced in 1983, has yielded a long time-series of resight data on this population. We used the program MARK to estimate adult female survival in this population from resight data collected over the period 1986–1999. Including concurrent population counts as covariates significantly improved our mark–recapture models and suggests density dependent population regulation to be operational in the population. Although predation may have been involved, it is far more likely that density dependent regulation has been based on a limited food supply. A significant increase in adult female survival was evident which is likely to have given rise to recent changes in population growth.Key words: density dependencesouthern elephant sealsMarion Islandpopulation regulation",

For us to adopt a similar approach on the South African east coast, it is necessary to catalogue both the normal appearance and toxin-mediated changes in our local brown mussel Perna perna. In this study. the gill filaments from five healthy, adult brown mussels were studied by light and transmission electron microscopy. Special attention was paid to filament architecture, ennervation of filaments, number and type of cells populating filament epithelia and variations in epithelial cell morphology and cilia ultrastructure. Filament shape was maintained by thickened chitin and strategically placed smooth myocytes. The epithelium was populated with eight morphologically distinctive non-secretory, mucus secreting or sensory cell types in various stages of differentiation. Unmyelinated nerves were situated beneath six cell types. Significant differences in filament architecture and epithelial cell morphology were found between M. edulis and P. perna. It is hoped that this comprehensive descriptionption of normal P. perna gill filaments will provide a morphological baseline for local pollution impact studies.",

The western half of the study site has areas next to buildings, on the edge of the forest, where guerezas supplement their diet with soil, and it has more human foot traffic which might reduce predation levels; these factors might be partially responsible for holding the number of guereza groups in the western half steady while forest degradation takes its toll on guerezas in the eastern half. This decline in guerezas is of particular concern since it took place in an area of forest that has not decreased in size and because guerezas are among the least sensitive primates to forest degradation.",

We compared the nitrogen requirements of this species on two different protein sources: pollen and casein. Pollen is an important source of nitrogen for specialist flower-feeding mammals in Australia. However, its value for a generalist rodent species such as A. namaquensis had not previously been assessed. Casein is often used as the source of protein in studies of wildlife nutrition, as the use of a single purified protein makes it easier for researchers to compare their results with those from other studies. The apparent digestibility of casein was significantly higher than that of pollen, 75.6 % vs 58.4 %, but the biological value was significantly lower, 39 % vs 49 %. As a result of the lower biological value the truly digestible maintenance nitrogen requirements of A. namaquensis on the casein diet were almost double those on the pollen diet (158 mg N/day vs 66 mg N/day). When these values are compared with those for other non-ruminants on natural diets, the pollen values match those predicted for a 60 g animal, while the casein values exceed the predictions. Because purified proteins, like casein, are unlikely to match an animal's amino acid requirements closely, they may overestimate the nitrogen requirements of wild animals.",

The time spent at a perch when the bird attempts prey capture should be shorter than give-up times when birds are taking the first thing detected. Hence, survival distribution functions and non-parametric rank statistics were used to test for differences between give-up and attempt perches. Since an exponential model appropriately described the perch survival distribution function, the time that a bird leaves a perch is independent from time already at the location. At any given time during a search for prey items, the probability that a kingfisher stayed at a perch was significantly lower when the bird made an attempt at the item than if it gave up on a location. Additionally, there were no relationships between search time and perch height, sally distance and handling times. This may be explained by an energetic trade-off with large prey handling costs, opportunistic feeding of the more abundant small prey items, or prey-specific familiarity by local kingfishers.",

The records show that B. reticulatus is well represented only in a central area in South Africa. However, as it is a specialized inhabitant of ephemeral, seasonal habitats and might not be active for more than a few months each year, it maynot be found unless searched for specifically. It could therefore be more widespread than indicated by its scattered records at present. The samples on record were collected mainly in streams and in habitats with seasonal water and either sandyor muddy substrata. Although infection rates of 40 % and 75 % were recorded for the parental specimens and their F1 generation, respectively, it is concluded that B. reticulatus would probably not play a major role in the transmission of urinary bilharzia under natural conditions on account of the relatively short lifespan and shedding period of infected snails, and the nature of their habitats.",

Pond 4 was a permanent pond that always contained fish. Only three species bred in it and the relative abundance of tadpoles was always low.

    "abstract": "In lizards, pheromonal cues are important for mate recognition and are expected to diverge during the speciation process. We tested for divergence in pheromonal mate and species recognition between male flat lizards (Platysaurus broadleyi) belonging to the same population, a different population, and a sister species. Males were given a choice between two refuges, an odourless control and one of the following: a conspecific female from the same population (sympatric), a conspecific female from a distant population (allopatric), and a female from their sister species (heterospecific), P. capensis. Males chose refuges treated with the scent of a heterospecific over an odourless control refuge but showed no preference for refuges that were scented with female conspecific (allopatric or sympatric) cues over the control. These results were consistent in the breeding and non-breeding seasons. In a second experiment males were offered a choice of female scents between sympatric and allopatric conspecifics; an allopatric conspecific and a heterospecific; and a sympatric conspecific and a heterospecific. Males showed a trend of preferring heterospecific over conspecific refuges and allopatric over sympatric conspecific-scented refuges, but these results were not significant at alpha <0.05. Contrary to our original expectations, these experiments do not provide any evidence for a pheromonal pre-mating isolation mechanism within this species complex. However, our results suggest a preference for novel female scents by males, consistent with selection for genetic diversity.",

Point count surveys were conducted throughout the Overberg using distance sampling techniques. We calculated bird density and extrapolated this to a population range estimate of between 203 000 and 368 000 individuals. Using generalised linear modelling of habitat variables from the point counts, we found that the birds prefer short vegetation, regardless of habitat type or cover. Broad-scale habitat association patterns were examined using SABAP2 data to determine if reporting rate (a measure of abundance) was correlated with the proportion of natural habitat within each pentad, finding that reporting rates were lower for areas with large patches of natural vegetation and extensive road access. It remains inconclusive whether agricultural practices benefited Agulhas long-billed larks, or whether these practices mimic historical ecological processes, but the population appears secure and even increasing with the status quo.",

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to validate the periodicity of growth zone deposition in asteriscus otolith of L. tsanensis and L. platydorsus. A total of 723 and 496 asteriscus otolith pairs from L. tsanensis and L. platydorsus, respectively, were examined. Binary- circular models, based on edge analysis (EA) and linear-circular models, based on marginal increment analysis (MIA) were employed to validate the rate of growth zone deposition. The results of EA indicate that there is an annual growth zone deposition for L. tsanensis and L. platydorsus. For both species, the highest proportion of translucent zones was detected between October and January, with a peak in January. The results of the MIA corroborated this for both species. In addition, the lowest marginal increment ratio (MIR) was recorded in January for both species. The annual growth zone deposition in asteristicus otoliths of these species is likely caused by the relatively low water temperature coinciding with the peak breeding activity of the species.",

    "abstract": "Extended nursing periods have been observed in some pinniped species. Here, we document multiple cases of such prolonged nursing in Cape fur seals in Namibia. Over three separate visits to the Cape Cross breeding colony, we observed five unusual nursing interactions. These included animals of estimated age from one to over three years suckling on awake and permitting females. One of these observations included two individuals (juvenile and pup) suckling simultaneously. In three out of five cases, the female sniffed the large suckling animal, and the lack of aggression suggested mutual recognition. We suggest that the most likely scenario for these observations is that the larger animals might be the mothers' offspring from the previous year maintaining contact over at least three years. Such prolonged nursing may occur in cases where the year's pup is not born, dies or is outcompeted by older siblings, which can result in large energetic advantages for the offspring, by maintaining a feeding relationship with mothers over more than one year. We suggest that animals that extend suckling over more than one year may increase their overall success, although possibly inhibiting their mother's pregnancy in a given year. Under poorer conditions, investing more in an older calf may also be more cost effective to the mother than risking a new pregnancy. However, further detailed investigation is necessary to explain extended nursing in this socially complex mammal.",

Teratological occurrences can be due to genetic or environmental conditions. Ocular teratologies are common in hypogean spiders. This communication reports on the occurrence of ocular teratologies of the South African endemic spider family, Stasimopidae. A total of 212 spiders from various museum collections were examined for cases of ocular teratologies. Six females and one male were found to display some form of teratology. The species found to exhibit these were Stasimopus patersonae, S. robertsi, S. insculptus peddiensis, S. griswoldi, and three unidentified specimens. The teratologies range from reduced eye size to numerous additional eyes. The exact cause of the teratologies is unknown. They could, however, be linked to embryonic trauma or developmental issues, juvenile injury, or unusual environmental conditions during embryonic development. The spiders all survived to adulthood, as in hypogeal spiders eye sight is not the most relied on sense. Understanding the causes of teratologies is important as it may enable researchers to predict the effect of increasing chemical use and global climate change on the embryology of spiders.",

    "abstract": "An animal's ability to traverse a landscape and utilise available resources is vital for its survival. The movement patterns of an animal provide insight into space use, activity patterns and ecological requirements that are imperative for successful farming and wildlife management practices. Home ranges are often used as a measurement of space use, which provides a quantitative value of an animal's movement patterns in relation to various biological factors. A factor that is often overlooked in the analysis of movement patterns is the effect of moon phase, despite its known impact on the activity and hunting success of nocturnal predators. We live-trapped, radio-collared and monitored five black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park, South Africa, between 2018 and 2019 to determine the impact of various environmental factors on movement patterns. Annual home ranges varied between individuals, were larger in subadults and overlapped between three jackals. Space use and travel velocity suggested a crepuscular activity pattern with a reliance on nocturnal activity and limited diurnal activity. Individual space use suggested variation between moon phases, although overall variation was negligible. Jackals travelled farther during new moon, compared with full moon, with the most notable difference between 23:00 and 04:00. Our results suggest that jackal behaviour does not align with the predation risk hypothesis. Space use and travel velocities varied between seasons, possibly because of differences in activity during mating and pupping periods. Our study confirms the flexibility in jackal space use and suggests a possible relationship with moon phase. To properly understand movement patterns at an individual and population level, we encourage additional research about jackals and various environmental factors via multidisciplinary collaborations.",

Males were significantly larger in mass, culmen, head, tarsus, wing and tail length than females. Males with larger mass were larger in all morphometric measurements than those with smaller mass.

We undertook the study in Eastern Kenya for a period of 16 months that represented three breeding cycles. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in egg fertility rates between egg laying cycles in the SC group. However, the egg fertility rate of the WL group was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the SC group. There were no significant differences in the hatch rate of eggs (P > 0.05) or the keet survival rates between the WL and SC groups. These results clearly show that low egg fertility rate is a key limiting factor in the reproductive success of helmeted guinea fowl kept in semi-confined spacesKey words: egg fertilityhatch ratehelmeted guinea fowlkeet survivalNumida meleagrissemi-confinement",

First, we tested existing passerine microsatellite loci for cross-species amplification success in a small sample of rock firefinches and identified 10 loci that were seemingly polymorphic and easy to score. Secondly, we developed and characterized three microsatellite loci de novo from the rock firefinch genome. In a larger sample of individuals from three populations, one locus initially interpreted as polymorphic was monomorphic. Among the polymorphic loci, the number of alleles ranged between 2 and 15 and the expected heterozygosity between 0.08 and 0.91 within populations. Two loci had high estimated null allele frequency in at least one population. The microsatellites amplified very well (80% success) in five other African finch species and each locus was confirmed as polymorphic in at least one species. We conclude that these microsatellite markers will be useful for population genetic studies in the rock firefinch and other closely related African finches.Key words: population geneticsmicrosatelliteprimerLagonosticta sanguinodorsalis",

Certain groups of mammals, such as rabbits and hares, show a flexible phenotype (phenotypic plasticity) with respect to renal physiology that enables them to inhabit a variety of bioclimatic regions.We investigated kidney morphology in the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, located on two isolated islands off the coast of the Western Cape South Africa, at sites with varying water and food availability, to ascertain whether these populations demonstrate differences in renal morphology that would link to differential renal physiology. In summer, Dassen Island is more restricted in available water and plants than Robben Island; we tested the prediction that rabbits from Dassen Island would be physiologically more suited to waterlimited conditions. Our data showed that O. cuniculus exhibits phenotypic plasticity, with Dassen Island rabbits displaying renal adaptations more suited to survival in drier environments, such as an increased relative medullary thickness and a higher predicted maximal urineconcentrating ability. This suggests increased renal performance in the Dassen Island population with the consequent increased ability to concentrate urine and conserve body water.",

The pear-shaped glands (about 120 µm long×70 µm maximum diameter) open via a pore, and are multicellular with three types of secretory cell that surround a central lumen. The glands of this minute pulmonate limpet are similar in structure to its larger relatives, suggesting that they are defensive in function.",

However, little is known about assimilation efficiency of invasive fruit by indigenous and invasive avian species. We investigated whether indigenous Knysna (Tauraco corythaix) and Purple-crested (Gallirex porphyreolophus) Turacos and invasive alien Rose-ringed Parakeets (Psittacula krameri) met their energy demands when fed fruits of four fleshy- fruited invasive alien plant species: Solanum mauritianum, Cinnamomum camphora, Psidium guajava and Morus alba. Birds were fed single-fruit diets for two consecutive days and energetic parameters were calculated for all fruit diets. Our results showed that generally both invasive and indigenous avian species managed to gain their daily energy requirements from fruits of the four respective invasive plants, suggesting that they can meet their energetic demands by feeding on them only. The exception was P. krameri, which did not feed on S. mauritianum fruit. These findings may explain why fruits of invasive alien plants are attractive to most avian frugivores and highlight the role of avian frugivores in their dispersal.",

Roosts were in large tall mopane trees with a mean diameter at breast height (dbh) of 57.4 ± 1.64 cm, a mean height of 16.5 ± 0.42 m, and with a mean cavity entrance height of 10.0 ± 0.05 m.

Human disturbance was low in both areas, but browsing of African elephant Loxodonta africana was evident by large areas of stunted mopane woodland recorded in non-roost areas. We recommend that the current Liwonde National Park vegetation map be updated to highlight areas of stunted mopane woodland unsuitable for Lilian's Lovebird roosts. The impact of elephant browsing on large mopane trees should be assessed to understand its impact on the availability of suitable cavities for lovebirds and other tree cavity reliant vertebrate species.",

This study compared the alarm calls of the social buff-streaked chat, Oenanthe bifasciata, to the asocial African stonechat, Saxicola torquata. Spring traps were used to capture birds in the foothills of the Drakensberg Mountains, and pairs and groups were housed separately in outdoor aviaries. Both species were exposed to latex snakes and raptor models presented individually at 1 m, 5 m and 10 m respectively, while alarm calls were recorded. Analyses of the acoustic variables revealed that both call rate and duration decreased when the predator was further away. Larger groups of buff-streaked chats increased their raptor alarm call rate (39 calls in five minutes) and reduced the frequency of their end-pulses (for both predators) by 0.6 kHz. Hence, large groups present a louder, perhaps more formidable mob to discourage attack; softer end-pulses may minimize cues to the callers’ location, and higher call rates during high-risk situations reflect the response urgency required to escape aerial predation. African stonechats were quieter, a strategy, perhaps, to reduce detection. Group size may therefore influence the perception of threat, where larger and louder groups become more conspicuous for aerial predation.",

In summer, Dassen Island is more restricted in available water and plants than Robben Island; we tested the prediction that rabbits from Dassen Island would be physiologically more suited to waterlimited conditions. Our data showed that O. cuniculus exhibits phenotypic plasticity, with Dassen Island rabbits displaying renal adaptations more suited to survival in drier environments, such as an increased relative medullary thickness and a higher predicted maximal urineconcentrating ability. This suggests increased renal performance in the Dassen Island population with the consequent increased ability to concentrate urine and conserve body water.",

Secondly, we developed and characterized three microsatellite loci de novo from the rock firefinch genome. In a larger sample of individuals from three populations, one locus initially interpreted as polymorphic was monomorphic. Among the polymorphic loci, the number of alleles ranged between 2 and 15 and the expected heterozygosity between 0.08 and 0.91 within populations. Two loci had high estimated null allele frequency in at least one population. The microsatellites amplified very well (80% success) in five other African finch species and each locus was confirmed as polymorphic in at least one species.

Fourteen non-pregnant and one pregnant female and 24 male spiny mice were wild-caught and subsequently monitored under controlled conditions. Thirteen of the 14 non-pregnant females revealed elevated faecal progestagen metabolite concentrations with eight individuals showing indications of a luteal phase. Two females showed two post-ovulatory luteal phases with estimated cycle lengths of 16 and 18 days, respectively. The pregnant female had an elevated (231%) mean faecal progestagen metabolite level compared with the overall mean baseline hormone concentration determined for the 14 non-pregnant females. Males exposed to a long photoperiod, simulating summer-related breeding activity, exhibited a 47.8% increase in faecal androgen metabolite levels compared with males exposed to a short photoperiod. Collectively, the data demonstrated that reproductive endocrine function can be monitored in male and female spiny mice by measuring respective faecal hormone metabolites.",

Roost temperatures were measured by placing i-Button® temperature loggers at known roosts, either in man-made structures or vegetation. Temperatures varied across different roosts, but roost temperatures were generally higher than ambient temperatures. Roosts in man-made structures had higher temperatures than those in natural vegetation.

Bat-eared fox fed on the greatest number of prey categories (n = 116) and had the greatest dietary niche breadth (4.71), while aardwolf utilised the fewest prey categories (n = 28) and had the lowest dietary niche breadth (1.19) when analysing the proportion of each prey category in the diet at the genus level. Temminck’s pangolin was the only species that was observed to feed exclusively on ants and termites. The diets of Temminck’s pangolin and aardvark showed a moderate degree of overlap (dietary niche breadth 0.49–0.57), but overlap was low between all other species pairs (0.01–0.26) when analysing the proportion of each prey item in the diet at the genus level. The results suggest that these myrmecophages have low to moderate dietary overlap, which combined with the high abundance of ants and termites and differences in their feeding ecologies, likely reduces interspecific competition.",

Anurans were inventoried in five types of habitats in four municipalities. Visual and auditory detections were used to observe, count and/or catch specimens at night, aided by headlamps. Five physico-chemical parameters were simultaneously measured. Species were determined using identification keys, authenticated by specialists at the Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science's Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin. Our study observed 28 species, with several species living in degraded forests. Afrixalus fulvovittatus (Cope 1860) was recorded for the first time in Benin; and the taxonomic status of three anuran species, Sclerophrys sp., Hyperolius sp. and Arthroleptis sp., still require clarification. Among the species inventoried, Hyperolius torrentis is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN category. Anuran distribution was closely related to ambient air temperature and soil humidity, with abundance increasing with low ambient air temperature and high soil humidity. We note the importance of protecting these organisms' habitats in order to maintain the optimal environment for their growth and breeding.",

The area was charaderized by mixing of the Angola Current surface waters with the northernmost subsurface waters of the Benguela Current. During the sampling period there was a continuous flow of water from Angola, giving rise to a strong thermocline between 20 and 40 m depth. A total of 17 species of medusae were captured, of which Aglaura hemistoma, Liriope tetraphylla, and Solmundella bitentaculata were the most abundant. Both the number of species and the number of individuals were higher on the second than on the first day of sampling, chiefly in the 20-0 stratum. Differences in abundance appeared to be related to the patch size of each species. The depth diistribution of the medusae population was charaderized by the existence of two assemblages, one associated with each current, and by the presence of the thermocline, which acted as a boundary between the two water masses and did not facilitate migratory movements of the .most abundant species. The non-migratory distribution pattern of most of the species was attributable to the high concentration of potential prey items and to the absence of predators in the layer above the thermocline throughout the sampling period.",

Territorial pairs reduce potential intersexual competition for food by removing prey In differing relative proportions: males take more limpets and whelks while females take a greater proportion of polychaetes and small unshelled items.

The early spermatid is characterized by a large nucleus and perinuclear cytoplasm containing numerous mitochondria and proacrosomal vesicles. By mid-spermiogenesis the nuclear chromatin begins to condense, the proacrosomal vesicles coalesce to form the acrosome and the mitochondria are reduced to five in number. At this stage the tail first appears. During late spermiogenesis the acrosome elongates and invaginates on its adnuclear surface. The structure of the sperm of P. perna is therefore similar to that of other mytilaceans, thus supporting the contention that sperm ultrastructure could be used in studies on bivalve phylogeny.",

Owing to reabsorp tion of pectoral spines with increasing fish size, and the relatively low number of spines that could be aged reliably, only otoliths were used to age fish. The maximum age for B. nyasensis was estimated at 14 years. There was no difference in growth rate between males and females. Age at 50 % maturity for females and males was estimated at seven and four years, respec tively. The age of fish was validated using marginal zone analysis. The results need further validation, however, owing to the high percentage of samples having opaque marginal zones in all months, the failure to explain the occurrence of peak marginal zones in particular months and the high percentage of otoliths that were rejected. The hypothesis of rapid fish growth in the first year and slow growth during subsequent years was supported by results from stomach content analysis. Smaller fish that were found inshore were predominantly piscivorous while larger fish that were found in offshore regions were mostly zooplanktivorous. The utilization of zooplankton in offshore areas suggests that B. nyasensis relies on the pelagic food web in Lake Malawi.",

B. friendi differs by having three median processes on the telocoxite giving the gonopod a T-shape.",

Field mice were trapped for three years in two regions of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, one that experienced a predictable and harsh winter (Mountain Zebra National Park; MZNP) and the other which experienced a milder winter (Thomas Baines Nature Reserve; TBNR). There was no winter inhibition of reproduction at TBNR, while at MZNP female reproductive activity was inhibited but males continued to produce spermatozoa in winter.

Lemniscomys striatus is characterized by a local structured pattern similar to that of N. minutoides. These new results further support the scenario of historical and ongoing fragmentation of the local savanna landscape which commenced in the upper Pleistocene, despite the repetitive savanna expansion episodes as documented by the landscape history. Geographic barriers most likely comprising forested areas, which prevent the mixing of local savanna rodent populations, must have persisted in this region. The presence of these barriers could not have been inferred from global paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental analyses alone.",

Survival analyses taking into account trap-happiness effects were conducted using the program MARK. Abundance of D. ferrugineus was generally low within all our study grids, but it was lowest in fallow land compared to primary rainforest. Numbers of reproductively active females captured were not different between habitats but were larger during the rainy seasons. Daily movements of females, but not of males, were smaller in fallow land. Capture-mark-recapture analyses showed recapture probabilities to vary highly between grids and years. Survival probability in the primary forest was higher than in fallow land with a difference of 0.084 over a period of four weeks. This is possibly linked to the higher abundance of the main food source (insects and termites); however, other explanations are discussed in the text.",

We studied social interactions within groups of bushveld gerbil Gerbillhcus leucogaster mothers and their weaned offspring in captivity. We examined groups (n = 8) over several weeks to assess whether mothers and juveniles tolerate one another beyond weaning, and to investigate behavioural influences surrounding the onset of dispersal. Each group was placed in a series of interconnecting tanks, allowing juveniles free movement between tanks but restricting the movement of the mother. In two of the eight groups the mother produced a second litter during the study; mothers in these two groups appeared to be less tolerant of their first litter compared to mothers in the remaining groups. The remaining groups showed very high levels of tolerance throughout the study, both between mothers and their offspring, and between siblings. Juveniles began showing independence from the mother around weaning, but although independent behaviour increased with juvenile age, there was no clear breakdown of the mother—offspring bond. In nature, offspring probably disperse passively at around five to six weeks old if no subsequent litter is born. However, the high tolerance within these groups suggests that dispersal could be delayed under particular circumstances.",

(family Molossidae) in southeastern Africa. Chaerephon pumilus s.l. comprised two cytochrome b lineages separated by a mean genetic distance of 0.7% (0.1–1.4%), consistent with intraspecific variability. The C. pumilus s.l. clade was paraphyletic, containing a nested C. leucogaster (Madagascar) clade. As well as the expected four mitochondrial control region lineages, we identified a new strongly-supported clade from the Durban area. Indices of diversity and neutrality, combined with a ragged multimodal mismatch distribution, are inconsistent with demographic expansion of a single C. pumilus s.l. population in southeastern Africa, and suggest that the control region lineages are stable units at demographic equilibrium. Dating analyses suggest that these lineages were established during the late Pleistocene, between 60 000 and 13 000 years ago. We found no evidence to support our hypothesis that the sympatric genetic lineages of C. pumilus s.l. are associated with distinct sonotypes, as discriminant function analysis based on four echolocation parameters could not discriminate between the four clades. We hypothesise that the different genetic lineages may be distinguished by differences in social communication and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The greater cane rat is a recently domesticated monogastric herbivore, and the importance of the caecum in the functioning of its digestive tract has frequently been mentioned. However, no data are available on caecal fermentative activity of this animal and research on the digestive physiology was only performed in adult animals. The present work was initiated to describe some parameters of the digestive tract anatomy and to study caecal fermentation of the growing cane rat. Thirty 40-day-old weaned cane rats were used in this experiment. Six of them were immediately euthanased and 12 were housed in a collective pen for gastrointestinal tract (GIT) parameters measurements. Twelve others were kept in individual cages to record growth and food intake. Captive cane rats received a pelleted diet containing 12.5% of crude protein and 16.7% of lignocellulose. Six of the 12 collectively housed animals were euthanased on day 82 and a further six on day 103. The growth rate increased with age (P < 0.01) with a linear growth curve (P < 0.001) while the feed intake (g/kg body weight) did not vary (P > 0.05). The caecum represented the largest compartment of the digestive tract constituting more than 40% of total GIT contents. Acetate was the most abundant short-chain fatty acid with more than 70% of the total, followed by propionate (less than 25%) and butyrate (around 5%). Short-chain fatty acid profiles varied with age: when age increased, the acetate proportion increased (P < 0.01), the propionate proportion decreased (P < 0.001) and the butyrate proportion remained unchanged (P > 0.05). The propionate/butyrate ratio showed a decrease with an increase in age (P = 0.05). Ammonia concentrations did not vary with age (P > 0.05). It is concluded that the caecum is an important site of fermentation in the growing cane rat.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether the four species are spatially separated in terms of the microhabitat each species occupies, allowing them to occur in sympatry in this structurally simple system with a limited number of potential niches. The habitat preferences of the four species were investigated on the farm Gansfontein in the southwestern parts of the Tankwa Karoo Basin. The area was surveyed by walking transects through different habitat types and recording all active lizards. For each lizard observed, the species was identified and a photograph was taken of its microhabitat. At the end of the sampling period the microhabitats in which lizards were found were sorted into distinct types on the basis of substrate composition. During the survey, only one individual of N. tessellata was recorded, but sample sizes for the other three species were sufficiently large to provide a clear perspective of habitat segregation among the three species. The results showed that the three species are spatially separated at the study site, with P. lineo-ocellata being restricted to rocky areas, P. laticeps preferring gravel substrates and M. knoxii frequenting sandy areas. Although only anecdotal information is available, all indications are that the observed spatial separation of the three species is mainly the result of historical adaptation to the different substrate types.",

Mean±S.E.M. colony size was 8.7±2.2 (range 6–16,n=33). The occurrence of plural breeding and small group size is consistent with the predictions of the aridity food distribution hypothesis for social species inhabiting mesic habitats. The sex ratio of the population was skewed towards females at 1.2:1. The mean mass of adult males was 63.0 ± 18.3 g (range 36.7–110.3, n=87) while that for adult females was 52.9±11.8 g (range 35.1–77.8, n=86). Pregnant and lactating females were found throughout the study period from February 2009 to February 2010, indicating an aseasonal pattern of breeding in this species. Autopsy of individuals (n=288) from the 33 colonies revealed a total of 19 pregnant females. Nine of these were in the latter stages of pregnancy and mean litter size was determined as 2.7 pups (range 1–4). Collectively, these new data reveal that Fukomys anselli share many similarities in life history and reproductive traits with the phylogentically closely related giant Zambian mole-rat, Fukomys mechowii.",

    "abstract": "Frugivores feed on fruits and nectars that contain different types of sugars in different proportions, which provide these animals with energy. Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) has a high glucose intake irrespective of sugar concentration of nectar. It is not known how these bats regulate their blood plasma glucose concentrations in order to avoid the negative effects associated with hyperglycemia. Fruit bats have a high amount of sugar intake in a short period of time which could cause a glucose challenge and it is therefore necessary to determine whether these bats are able to regulate their blood plasma glucose concentrations within normal concentrations. This study investigated the diel variations in blood plasma glucose concentrations of E. wahlbergi. Epomophorus wahlbergi‘s blood plasma glucose concentration was lower (5.24 ± 0.38 mmol/l) at 18:00 before feeding and increased during/after feeding (8.19 ± 1.24 mmol/l) but bats appeared to regulate it within limits. Their range in concentrations was higher than the normal mammalian blood plasma glucose concentrations range. Consequently these bats appear to regulate their blood plasma glucose concentration, although at a range higher than normal mammalian levels, and thus reduce the negative consequences associated with hyperglycemia.",

In order to assess whether these animals possess an endogenous rhythm of locomotor activity that entrains to the light: dark cycle, they were subjected to three distinct light cycles: an LD cycle (12 h light/12 h dark), a DD cycle (constant darkness) and a DL light cycle (an inverse of the LD light cycle). All eight individuals studied exhibited entrainment of their activity to the light cycles. Under LD, the total percentage of activity during the dark phase was 93.7 ± 1.8%. Activity was distributed throughout the night (mean peak activity 22:46 ± 0:14). All eight animals expressed distinct endogenous free-running rhythms of locomotor activity (mean τ = 23:55 ± 0:36). During constant darkness, animals still displayed more activity during the subjective night (75.6 ± 0.4%). Under the DL light cycle, the total percentage of activity was 92.7 ± 1.8% during the dark phase. In conclusion, the daily locomotor activity rhythm of Wagner’s gerbil is strongly entrained by the light:dark cycle with the most activity concentrated during the night and consequently this desert-dwelling mammal may thus be considered truly nocturnal.",

Here we investigate the nature of gustatory organs in a terrestrial caecilian, Boulengerula boulengeri (Herpelidae), from Tanzania using standard light and scanning electron microscopy. We found only taste bud type organs to be present in B. boulengeri. These occur mainly in the mucosa of the front part of the oral cavity, usually near the teeth. Our results suggest that B. boulengeri possesses only one type of gustatory organ during its ontogeny.",

In this study, the diet of two rodent pest species, Mastomys natalensis and Gerbilliscus vicinus, coexisting in fallow land in central Tanzania were studied to assess the degree of diet differentiation among them. Dietary niche breadth of G. vicinus was greater than that of M. natalensis in all stages of the maize cropping seasons. The rodent species studied overlapped considerably in the food items consumed ranging from niche overlap (Ojk) of 0.77–0.89. Grains/seeds featured high in the diet of M. natalensis while plant material occurrence was high in G. vicinus. These two food categories may have contributed to differences in diet partitioning, which may, in turn, facilitate their coexistence in fallow land.",

Between January 2010 and October 2011, 22 boat trips were made to Black Rocks to chum for white sharks. On 19 of the trips a series of overlapping photographs were taken of the northern side of Black Rocks and the percentage of seals, which exhibited fresh white shark bite wounds recorded. A total of 53 sharks and 28 fresh shark-inflicted injuries were recorded on seals over the course of the study period. The maximum number of sharks sighted per hour (1.2) was in July and the highest percentage of shark bitten seals in November (0.6%). There was no significant relationship between the monthly sighting rate of sharks and the percentage of shark bitten seals (P = 0.40). The percentage of shark-inflicted injuries observed on seals increased with seal size. Most injuries were observed in the forebody (37.5%) and lower body regions (37.5%). Very few injuries (6.3%) were observed in the head and neck region. The low number of bite-inflicted injuries observed suggests that white sharks attack seals infrequently at Black Rocks.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of foraging strategy in resource partitioning among the four species, allowing them to co-occur in a structurally simple system with a limited number of potential niches. Previous workers already identified P. lineo-ocellata and M. knoxii as sit-and-wait foragers and N. tessellata as an active forager. We recorded data on three foraging variables: movements per minute, proportion of time spent moving, and proportion of attacks on prey whilst moving, for juveniles and adults of P. laticeps. By comparing the foraging data obtained for P. laticeps to those for other lacertid species, we were able to demonstrate that adult P. laticeps are ambush foragers. We also noted a significant ontogenetic shift in foraging behaviour in P. laticeps, and, due to a significantly higher frequency of short brief movements, we classified juveniles as mixed foragers. The sharing of an ambush foraging strategy by at least three of the four lacertid species co-occurring on the Tankwa plains, suggests considerable overlap along the trophic dimension of ecological space. This overlap presumably promotes occupation of separate microhabitats by the three ambush foragers in the Tankwa Karoo Basin.",

Minimum values recorded for mean tubule diameters of adults were already attained by some yearlings at 16 and 17 months of age. Although yearling males were observed to display sexual interest in females, probably few participate in breeding because of competition from older, larger males. As indicators of sexual function, testes mass and seminiferous tubule diameter showed a regular seasonal fluctuation, first becoming manifest among yearlings. However, the mean and maximum values of these parameters continued to increase until about three years of age.",

This study investigates whether pale chanting-goshawks in the Little Karoo, South Africa, show a preference for spider retreats as nest-lining and how this preference impacts on the abundance and distribution of Stegodyphus retreats within chanting-goshawk territories. In spite of an average 37 retreats per 2.2 km2pale chanting-goshawk territory, the birds selected few spider retreats (18 % of those provided during experimental manipulations). The highest proportion of spider retreats (38 %) were found within 223 m of chanting-goshawk nests, probably being moved there over time by nesting birds. Given a choice between sheepskin, active spider retreats, cushion stuffing and cotton waste, the birds preferred sheepskin (53 % by volume) although sheep are not farmed in the study area. These findings demonstrate that the pale chanting-goshawks were searching for soft insulating material to line the nest rather than spider retreats per se. Although spider retreats were used less often than other man-introduced materials, e.g. cattle dung and fabric, it is still not known how the availability of these alternative materials influence long-term trends in the use of Stegodyphus retreats by these birds.",

Females were monotocous and consecutive pregnancies were separated by a non pregnant period (30–50 days) similar in length to the period of lactation. Young were relatively large at birth (8% of adult body weight) but were altricial and only emerged from the burrow at weaning. Towards the end of lactation, many females mated again (20% of all females were both lactating and in early pregnancy) and annual fecundity was probably two but never more than three. For a rodent, albeit a large one, this is a very slow rate of reproduction and we propose that the ricochetal locomotion (jumping on the hind legs) and semi-fossorial life style of the springhare will have resulted in decreased juvenile and adult mortality, and increased longevity, and that these factors have shaped the evolution of the life history of the springhare.",

We collected Meriones from eight localities in Tunisia, and obtained mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and nuclear (IRBP) gene sequence data for 37 and 13 specimens, respectively, belonging to two species: M. shawi and M. libycus. We also optimised three microsatellite markers previously described in M. unguiculatus to obtain a finer analysis of their genetic diversity and geographic structure, given their wide distribution. Phylogenetic inferences of cyt b and IRBP data for these species, in the context of other gerbillin data, corroborate their taxonomic affinities reported by previous studies. High cyt b haplotype diversity was observed in both species (25 haplotypes in 29 and 27 sequences for M. shawi and M. libycus, respectively) with little geographical structure for M. shawi but three divergent groups in M. libycus. The average microsatellite diversity within each population was high (HO ≥ 0.6, HE ≥ 0.8) with M. libycus populations attaining the highest values. Population differentiation was moderate for several population pairs (Fst ≥ 0.1), the highest being between M. shawi populations. However, genetic distance among populations was not significantly correlated with geographic distance in either M. shawi or M. libycus. Our results contribute to a better characterisation of Tunisian Meriones species, suggesting high geographic structure in mtDNA of M. libycus populations within North Africa.",

The bean weevil, Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say), and cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius), were identified. Acanthoscelides obtectus, recognised as the main pest of beans, was found in all ten localities sampled, whereas C. maculatus, recognised as the main pest of pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan) and chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), was found in two of the ten. Better knowledge of the diversity of bruchids present in the RC will make it possible to propose effective control methods with little impact on environmental and human health.",

Out of sixty-eight local Bt isolates, four showed LC50 values ranging from 13.8–15.6 ppm, similar to LC50 recorded against the reference Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti-H14) (13.0 ppm). Seventeen isolates were more toxic than the Bti-H14 by 1.3–11.1 fold (LC50 values 1.17–9.9 ppm vs 13.0 ppm). Two isolates were less toxic than Bti-H14, showing LC50 values of 39.4 and 24.1 ppm, respectively. Additionally, the TCs from HRM1 and HS1 showed promising larvicidal toxicity, with HS1 being 2.74 fold more toxic than HRM1. Larval morphological features and body size were altered upon HS1 toxin-treatment. This study suggests that there is a new effective local Bt strain, and TCs toxin complexes could be used as eco-friendly biocontrol agents that might contribute to controlling mosquito-borne diseases. The synergistic effect of the Bt-TCs combination on mosquito larvae should be further investigated.",

The 900 m long beach on Cousine Island, Seychelles, supports a nesting population of approximately 70–130 hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata nests each season. Seasonal and storm-related erosion and accretion cycles on Cousine Island have the potential of destroying 50% or more of all turtle egg clutches on the island in a single nesting season. Observed crab predation rates had reached 90–100% in preferred nesting beach zones in previous years. This has resulted in intensive management measures to minimise turtle egg and nest losses. We investigated the distribution and population density of ghost crabs and the morphology of the beach across the different beach area zones and across the turtle-nesting season during 2014–2015. Crab burrow numbers varied between beach zone areas and across the season and were highest on the backshore. Crab density correlated negatively with available beach area, and we found that crab density increased in the presence of turtle nests. When examining beach dynamics, we found them to be cyclical and found the nesting beach prone to higher levels of erosion than accretion with significant changes in beach width throughout the season. The mean vertical beach elevation drop on Cousine Island was higher than what hawksbill turtles have been reported to prefer. We suggest the continuation of beach elevation monitoring and management to use the beach morphology data to assist with hawksbill turtle nest translocations to minimise nest losses and maximise hatchling recruitment success.",

Leopard populations are difficult to enumerate across any landscapes, though there have been strides to improve upon this, particularly in South Africa. This study aimed to determine the population density of leopards in the Magaliesberg mountain range of the North West province in 2015 and provided a longitudinal comparison of these camera-trapping sites. It appraises the efficacy of interventions aimed at improving the status quo of zero leopards found during a prior survey in 2011. Such interventions included a moratorium on sport hunting of the species, and the reintroduction of four individuals, two of each sex, into this area. Camera trapping over 10 months detected seven unique individuals, including one juvenile and six adults, consisting of four males and three females, half of which were previously reintroduced or progeny thereof. A Bayesian capture-recapture abundance model indicated a population of 5–7 individuals occurring within 1 480 km2 of available habitat, yielding a density estimate of 0.34–0.47 adult leopards per 100 km2, which is a relatively low estimate, likely due to population suppression from anthropogenic pressures surrounding the site (i.e., snaring). This study demonstrates that large carnivore populations can recolonise their former range via targeted interventions within topographical refugia.",

This cryptic species is not evenly distributed throughout its restricted range and appears to have very specific habitat requirements. Its endangered status reflects the necessity for a conservation management programme, which to date has not been comprehensive. A primary hindrance to such initiatives has been the lack of informationpertaining to its habitat requirements. We assessed various soil and vegetation parameters, at each population site, in areas where the animals were found to be present or absent. A multiple logistic regression model highlighted the importance of soil hardness (governed by soil particle size distribution), in combination with the cover provided by trees, as the two ecological factors that best explained habitat suitability for Juliana’s golden mole at the three localities. An IndVal analysis failed to identify any plant species that could reliably act as an indicator of habitat suitability for this fossorial mammal. These results have important implications for the conservation of the species.Key words: Neamblysomus julianaegolden molessmall mammalshabitat suitabilityhabitat requirementsdistribution",

Five species bred in it in 2000/01, but breeding activity was curtailed once it was invaded by catfish, Clarias gariepinus, some of which were found with frog remains in their stomachs. The pond did not overflow in the following season, and was therefore not invaded by fish; although only four species bred in it their relative abundance was considerably higher. Pond 4 was a permanent pond that always contained fish. Only three species bred in it and the relative abundance of tadpoles was always low.

Behavioural dominance has previously been assessed in this species using an ordinal ranking procedure and it was found to possess a non-linear dominance hierarchy. The determination of dominance using ordinal ranking is often subjective and cannot deal with ties in rank. This study adapts an objective and robust cardinal assessment method to assign dominance indices to individuals. These indices are then ordered to assign a final rank to each individual within a colony. The non-linear, exponential decay model provided the best fit to data from average cardinal dominance index versus final rank and revealed that colonies contain a single behaviourally-dominant individual. However, final rank could not be predicted on the basis of body mass, sex or assumed reproductive status and is not always statistically significant due to the inherent variation. We propose that the cardinal method of dominance assessment, with the adaptations made in this study, be used in future dominance-related assessments for other bathyergids and social organisms in general.",

Coleoptera were the most common prey ingested both in summer and early spring for all species, followed by Hymenoptera for all species in summer.

Farmers in the area believe small mammals provide a service as an alternative food source, other than sheep, for predators. We assessed the validity of this reported ecosystem service. A total of 10 species and 219 individuals were recorded during this survey of 3600 trap-nights, with a total trap success rate of 6.1%. Significantly more individuals were caught during the winter than in summer. Vegetation transformation had a negative impact on small mammal diversity. Density, diversity and distribution were correlated with vegetation and landscape structural diversity. Management decisions that reduce vegetation structure and cover will have a negative impact on small mammal density and diversity. Ensuring the conservation of small mammals may have the benefit of providing an alternative food source to predators, a valuable ecosystem service to farmers.Key words: small mammalsecosystem servicesbiodiversity conservationland transformationhabitat structure",

    "abstract": "In most monogamous breeding systems males demonstrate a high degree of paternal care. With the significant costs of this parental investment, it is clearly in the interests of males to raise only their own offspring. It has therefore been predicted, but never observed in the field, that if the female of a monogamous male is promiscuous, he will desert her and attempt to breed with an alternative female. Here we report a case of such a mate desertion in the aardwolf Proteles cristatus. We suggest, however, that mate desertion should occur only rarely in response to female promiscuity. This is because a cuckolded male may still be raising some of his own offspring, and should desert only on the rare occasions when an alternative receptive female is exclusively available to himself.",

Gerrhosaur diets vary from insectivorous to omnivorous with a very large plant portion. The omnivorous G. validus responds strongly to chemical cues from prey and food plants. Because plants form a far smaller fraction of the diet of G. nigrolineatus, which is generally considered to be an insectivore, a correspondence between diet and chemosensory responsiveness predicts that G. nigrolineatus should respond strongly to prey chemicals, but more weakly than G. validus to plant food chemicals. Chemical stimuli were presented on cotton swabs. The lizards performed more tongue-flicks and bit more swabs bearing prey chemicals than control stimuli, but no strong responses were elicited by chemical stimuli from romaine lettuce, banana, or dandelion, plants that are highly palatable to herbivorous lizards. The contrast between responses to plant chemical stimuli by the two species of gerrhosaurs suggests that responsiveness to plant chemicals is adjusted to dietary plant intake, appearing in tandem with consumption of a diet having a large plant component. Additional observations suggest that movement triggers attack on prey and that airborne chemicals may contribute to detection of food chemicals.",

A decrease in rectal temperature, despite the increase in heat production, is interpreted as indicative of poor insulative properties of the down. Preliminary data on the ontogeny of thermoregulation indicate that penguin chicks may attain mature thermoregulatory abilities at a mass of approximately 400g.",

Here, we aimed to increase our knowledge on its population biology in a riverine Combretum forest of the Albany Thicket Biome, South Africa. Data were collected between February 2006 and June 2007 by means of a monthly live-trapping and nest-box monitoring programme, but complementary information on reproduction was opportunistically obtained in 2008–2011 and 2017. During the main study period, the dormouse population showed a steady increase from winter to spring, and a peak of 16 ind. ha−1 in summer, as a result of the influx of juveniles. Winter mortality and/or spring dispersal accounted for the disappearance of 55% of subadults. The annual adult:juvenile ratio was 1.08, whereas the overall sex ratio was 1.94 females per one male. In females, reproductive activity was observed from September to end January (spring– summer). The pattern observed in males was similar, because dormice with descended testes were exclusively found from October to end January. Parturition occurred from the second half of October to the beginning of December, but observations made in 2009 and 2011 indicated that births can take place as late as mid-February. Litters (n = 15) consisted of an average (± SD) of 3.88 ± 0.81 young. We provide evidence that some females can give birth to two litters during the same breeding period, with a 5- to 6-week interval, hence indicating the occurrence of post-partum mating in woodland dormice. Multi-year data from different habitat types are needed in order to confirm and advance our knowledge on this species’ population biology and dynamics.",

Sensitive to changes in both habitat quality and vertebrate diversity, dung beetles are ideal taxa for monitoring ecosystem health. The current study provides the first documentation of dung beetle diversity on the Central African island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea, which lies off of mainland Cameroon and is characterised by a rugged topology and an elevation of more than 3 000 m. Dung beetles were sampled from three elevations (at ∼102 m, 623 m and 1 000 m) along an elevational transect, using pitfall traps baited with human dung. A total of 32 species were captured and identified. Species diversity and composition were similar to that recorded on the mainland site of Mount Cameroon, which is part of the same volcanic chain as Bioko Island. Species richness and abundance declined with increasing elevation, consistent with the inverse relationship between diversity and elevation commonly observed in other systems. Elevational preferences were apparent in several species, suggesting ecological segregation between species along the elevational gradient. The current study also provides valuable baseline data that can be used to monitor changes in ecosystem functioning and community structure, important given the potential long-term impacts of excessive bushmeat hunting on ecosystem health of Bioko Island.",

The large-sized form differs from the Mai-Ndombe dwarf sprat in several morphological characters and resembles the smalltoothed pellonula Pellonula leonensis Boulenger, 1916, but in barcoding analysis appears more closely related to the bluntnosed sawtooth pellonuline Potamothrissa obtusirostris (Boulenger, 1909). This large-sized form is probably a species new to science but will remain undescribed for now, and is here referred to as Pellonulinae sp. BIG. A slender clupeoid, also from Lake Mai-Ndombe, has recently been referred to as the Lake Tumba dwarf sprat Nannothrissa parva (Regan, 1917), which would be the first record of this species from that lake. Specimens of a slender clupeoid collected from Lake Mai-Ndombe for this study were identified as the losera fangtooth pellonuline Odaxothrissa losera Boulenger, 1899. This is the first confirmed occurrence of this species in Lake Mai-Ndombe, whereas the presence of N. parva could not be confirmed. The phylogenetic analysis strongly supports the genus Nannothrissa as currently delimited, here barcoded for the first time, but also confirms the previously reported mismatch between morphological classification and molecular data in this group. We further note that the Mai-Ndombe dwarf sprat attains a larger size than the maximum size noted in the original description in 1976, and it is suggested that an intense beach-seine fishery that utilises mosquito nets might have led to a population decline followed by decreased intraspecific competition, enhancing individual growth. For the same reason, Pellonulinae sp. BIG might have been less common previously and so remained undetected until now.Keywords: Congo BasinDorosomatidaeinland watersNannothrissaOdaxothrissa loseraPellonula leonensisPellonulinaephylogeny",

Four different Eulophidae species were found: Citrostichus phyllocnistoides (Narayanan), representing 81.82% of the identified parasitoids, Semielacher petiolatus (Girault) (9.40%) and the native species Pnigalio pectinicornis (L.) (2.82%). Cirrospilus ingenuus Gahan (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is a new report for the parasitoid entomofauna of P. citrella in the country, representing 5.96% of the identified parasitoids. It has probably spread naturally from other Mediterranean regions. Predation by generalist predators is the main mortality factor of CLM (up to 59.11% of the mortality was caused by natural enemies), followed by parasitism (oviposition) (22.47%) and host-feeding (18.42%). Second and third instar larvae of the CLM were the preferred stages for parasitism. Host-feeding and generalist predators' attacks were most common on first and second instars. Data highlighting the ability for C. phyllocnistoides to develop and disperse clearly predominates in Tunisian citrus orchards. Citrostichus phyllocnistoides may compete with S. petiolatus, exerting a complementary action to that of C. phyllocnistoides, particularly earlier in the season when the densities of the latter species are low. Further studies focusing on inter-specific relationships between these two exotic parasitoids are needed in order to test whether the observed field results could have been estimated from laboratory assays. This will be helpful in critically evaluating the results of the classical biological control programme developed against CLM in Tunisia.Keywords: Cirrospilus ingenuuscitrusconservation-biological-controlnatural enemiesPhyllocnistis citrellaTunisia",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe two species of Arenicolidae, Arenicola marina and Arenicolides ecaudata, are common along the Norwegian coast. Juveniles and anterior fragments are often encountered when grab sampling, making traditional morphological characteristics insufficient for species identification. This study examined the robustness of the characteristics and development of branchiae in juvenile specimens of Arenicolides ecaudata (n = 109) and Arenicola (n = 44) (A. marina and Arenicola sp.) and additional specimens to assess geographic and bathymetric distribution. Neuropodia were discovered to be efficient in distinguishing the species. Branchiae of A. ecaudata appear when specimens measure between 7–13 mm, while in A. marina they appear in specimens measuring between 3–5 mm. The ring formula in anterior chaetigers is a key characteristic in differentiating between Arenicola species. This characteristic alone is insufficient for reliable species identifications, as study findings corroborated error rates in identification based on the ring formula. The bathymetric range of both species has increased considerably. Arenicola marina was documented at 194 m depth and A. ecaudata at 387 m depth. DNA barcodes with the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene were produced for three specimens of Arenicolides ecaudata, representing the first publicly available COI barcode sequences for this species. Five specimens of Arenicola marina, with similar sequences to specimens from other north-eastern Atlantic localities were also barcoded in BOLDsystems.Keywords: environmental assessmentDNA barcodingdevelopment patternsdistribution",

    "abstract": "AbstractApproximately 300 individuals of Neutraclinostomum intermedialis from three localities in the Northern Province of South Africa were screened using allozyme electrophoresis. The aim was to determine genetic diversity and divergence within and between populations. The within population heterozygosity values (H = 0.5–3.0 %) were generally higher than the value of 0.7 % previously estimated for this species from a single population. The mean Fst value of 0.69 indicated marked structuring among the populations studied. Genetic distances (Nei 1972) between populations ranged from 0–0.09 and the clustering of populations closely reflected their geographical distribution and linkage to specific river systems. One locus of malate dehydrogenase, E.C.1.1.1.37 (MDH-2), provided a fixed allelic difference between populations from two river systems (the Limpopo and Olifants river systems). We discuss patterns of geographical genetic diversity in N. intermedialis, with reference to the constraints of habitat and host specificity.Key words: Platyhelminthesparasiteallozyme electrophoresisgeographical genetic variability",

    "abstract": "Tadarida aegyptiaca (mean body mass 13.5 g) is a fast flying insectivorous bat that hunts in open areas for extended periods, covering extensive distances during its foraging bouts. Whole blood samples taken from the wing arteries were analysed for 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, oxygen affinity and pH. The mean oxygen affinity of T. aegyptiaca blood with a P50-value 38.3 mm Hg (5.1 kPa) is lower than that of similar-sized bats but not as low as the P50-values of 48.5 mm Hg (6.4 kPa) in two mice species. This indicates that oxygen affinity of the blood in T. aegyptiaca and other bats is designed to facilitate both effective binding of oxygen with haemoglobin at the alveolar/blood capillary interface and oxygen offloading in the tissues. Haematocrits (54–60 %) and levels of 2,3 DPG (2.36–3.30 mM l–1) were higher, and blood pH (7.106–7.229) lower, than those reported for terrestrial species of a similar size, but within the range of values reported for other bats. We conclude that adequate delivery of oxygen to tissues with high metabolic demands during flight is facilitated primarily by an elevated haematocrit and a reduced blood pH in response to elevated levels of metabolic by-products such as 2,3-DPG (from the citrate acid cycle) and CO2 (leading to increased concentrations of H+ ions).",

The study was conducted over five years in the Little Karoo, South Africa. Although, polyandrous males participated equally in building nests, provisioning prey and incubating, in the fertility window the dominant alpha males copulated 31–5 days before the females laid, whereas subordinate beta males only copulated 5–3 days before laying. If this copulation timing by alpha males was indicative of a high reproductive skew, alpha males breeding as full sibs could skew paternity in their favour (ratio 68:32) and produce 0.69 offspring equivalents. Under this scenario, they compensated beta males with indirect fitness benefits by allowing them to produce 0.54 offspring equivalents, equal to monogamous males. Alternatively, if beta males controlled reproduction while breeding with non-relatives under a high skew scenario, they would have to restrain themselves to avoid eviction and produce 0.28 offspring equivalents to allow the fitness of alpha males at least to equal that of monogamous males. I suggest that alpha males and their females altered their reproductive roles to accommodate beta males, thereby increasing their inclusive fitness, whereas beta males tolerated subordination to acquire reproductive skills that non-breeder males do not have access to.",

Bats were collected from two localities in Limpopo Province. Female rusty bats are seasonal monestrous breeders, initiating copulation in mid-autumn (April), storing sperm until the time of ovulation in late winter (August), and giving birth to twins in late spring (November). The period April until mid-August was characterized by sperm storage and increased follicular development. During mid-August the females ovulated and excess sperm were discarded. Females released between three and five ova, while a maximum of two embryos implanted successfully. Only a single embryo implanted per uterine horn. Embryo movement through the Fallopian tubes appeared to be a rapid process. Redundant embryos were resorbed before implantation. The period from the end of August until mid-November was marked by pregnancy. Females invariably carried twins (one foetus in each uterine horn). Large-scale follicle atresion, and very low levels of follicle development, characterized the period end of August until March. High incidences of polyovular follicles were recorded for all months of the year. No obvious form of reproductive asymmetry was recorded in the rusty bat.",

However, histopathology of fish inhabiting this polluted dam is scantly explored. The current study aimed to investigate the histopathology of the gills and liver of Labeo rosae from Loskop Dam. Alkaline pH was observed throughout the study with most metal concentrations exceeding the water quality guideline for aquatic ecosystems. Regressive changes were the most prominent lesions for both organs with gills showing relatively more pathologies than the liver. Epithelial lifting was 100% prevalent during both seasons in the gills whereas a significant expansion of lipofuscin-laden melanomacrophages (MMCs) showed 100% prevalence in the liver. Gills were significantly different in their prevalence of histopathology between the two seasons, which was not the case for liver. The histopathology recorded in this study shows that the health of L. rosae at Loskop Dam was compromised. Given the exacerbating pollution level in the upper Olifants River, these findings serve as a warning to conservation authorities and emphasise the necessity for regular monitoring of fish health at Loskop Dam to assess pollution levels using fish health as a sensitive indicator to altering pollution levels.",

Fish specimens in less polluted sites had better condition and shapes, regardless of sex, compared with those in more polluted sites of the lake. Most lungfish collected had a total length of 45–55 cm. Irrespective of sex of fish and level of pollution at collection sites, samples (n = 26) collected inshore (1 063.42 g ± 109.32 SE) were heavier than those collected (n = 11) offshore (680.09 g ± 108.85 SE), F(1, 35) = 6.288, p = 0.019.

    "abstract": "Animals that share suitable rock ledges located on near-vertical cliff faces are compelled to interact when using this scarce resource. Because interspecific and exploitative competition for suitable ledges may have a vital influence on the survival and reproduction of Verreaux’s Eagles (Aquila verreauxii) and Chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), an investigation into the reciprocal rock-ledge usages by the two species will improve our understanding of this trait. In this study, we used camera traps stationed at four eagle nests to study interspecific interactions at nest sites. At the first two eagle nests, no baboons were recorded, and two young birds fledged successfully. At the third nest, the baboons only slept on the nest once the fledgling successfully left the nest. At the fourth nest, the eagles did not breed and the birds (eight visits) and baboons (three visits) used the nest interchangeably over a 28-day period. Whereas the cliff-ledge provided a secure nest site for the Verreaux’s Eagles in the breeding season, for Chacma baboons sleeping on an inaccessible ledge may limit predation by terrestrial predators (e.g. by leopard Panthera pardus). This alternating usage of cliff ledges suggests that the two species probably co-use this limited cliffside resource to increase their own fitness.",

    "abstract": "Threats to ecosystems are ever increasing from different drivers mostly being linked to anthropogenic activities. This has brought about various measures to restore/protect the wildlife in these areas. Considering the background of most protected areas in East Africa, small mammals have been given least attention, compared with large mammals, although they play a fundamental role in maintaining ecosystem health. It is therefore necessary to understand how small mammals are distributed in any given ecosystem as a baseline information to enable holistic and informed management. We investigated the diversity and distribution of small mammals in the Selous ecosystem, Tanzania. Two methods were used; Capture Mark Recapture (CMR) using grids of 70 m x 70 m and random placement of havahart traps in the selected habitats. Between July 2018 and June 2020, a total of 887 individuals belonging to 20 species were captured in 28 224 trap nights with 3% trap success. The small mammal species captured consisted of rodents (91.8%), Macroscelidea (3.9%), Carnivores (2.4%) Eulipotyphla (1.6%), and Primates (0.3%). Acomys ngurni (36%) and Aethomys chrysophilus (17%) were the most captured species, whereas Atilax paludinosus (0.23%), Helogale pervula (0.23%), Rattus rattus (0.23%) and Galerella sanguinea (0.11%) were the least contributing species. Acomys ngurui and Lemniscomys rosalia were the most distributed species occurring in all four habitats, whereas Cricetomys ansorgei, Rattus rattus, Mungos mungo and Genetta genetta had low occurrence. Grammomys selousi is reported for the first time in the northern part of the Rufiji River. Acomys ngurni abundance differed significantly (χ2 = 12, df = 3, p = 0.007) between the four habitats being higher in the seasonal riverine forest and across seasons (χ2 = 6, df = 2, p = 0.049), with more individuals occurring in the wet season. The Sable Forest habitat had the highest species diversity (H' = 2.065) and the lowest diversity (H' = 1.506) was recorded in perennial riverine forest/thickets. The highest species diversity (H' = 1.65) was recorded in the dry season and the lowest diversity in the wet season (H' = 1.445). Most small mammals were associated with seasonal riverine forest than other habitats. Overall, the results from this study show that, the park is rich in small mammal fauna. Therefore, considerations in updating the General Management Plan (GMP) and other plans to include the small mammals in the park management actions is recommended.",

This study aimed to describe the age and growth of one of these species, the Cape knifejaw, Oplegnathus conwayi, which is endemic to the southern and eastern coasts of South Africa. Monthly biological samples were collected through research spearfishing (n = 170) and augmented by recreational spearfishers' catches (n = 135). The results indicated that the O. conwayi population sex ratio was skewed towards males (1M:0.6F). The length- and age-frequency distributions were similar between sexes. Oplegnathus conwayi is a relatively slow-growing species, with a maximum-recorded age of 27 years. No significant differences were observed between male and female growth, with the overall population growth curve being best described as L(t) = 697.15(1 − e−0.06(t−6.30)). The slow growth observed in this species is characteristic of a species that is vulnerable to overexploitation, and accordingly a precautionary approach to future management is recommended.",

A study was conducted on the population status and diurnal activity pattern of T. s. decula in Maze National Park, Ethiopia, from January to July 2020 during the wet and dry seasons. Data were collected using randomly sampled blocks covering a total area of 34 km2. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and compared with Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests. The average population size throughout both the wet and the dry season was 21 ± 8, of which 10.5 ± 3.5, 4.0 ± 2.0 and 6.5 ± 2.5 were adults, subadults and juveniles. There was a significant difference (χ2 = 3.4, df = 4, p < 0.05) in the T. s. decula population between the two seasons. The sex ratio of adult males to adult females was 0.56:1 and 0.75:1 in the dry and the wet seasons, respectively, indicating a population predominated by females. The mean group size was and 2.00 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The riverine forest had the greatest number of individuals and hence highest density and population distribution per square kilometre; however, distribution between the habitats did not vary significantly (F = 2.71, df = 4, p = 0.16). The overall density of the population was very low in the sampled blocks, with the population density not exceeding one per 1.7 km2. The dominant activity pattern of T. s. decula was feeding followed by resting and running/ fighting. Even though its population was predominantly female, a good indicator for future breeding success, the low numbers and density of common T. s. decula due to the high impact of illegal hunting and predation, especially of subadults, indicates a vulnerable population requiring enhanced conservation efforts.",

We counted ticks on Homopus signatus signatus during each spring in the years 2001–2004, and evaluated tick frequencies in relation to tortoise anatomy, climate and microhabitat. Tortoises hosted Ornithodoros compactus and O. savignyi, and ticks seemed to prefer the hindlimbs, avoid the shell, and use the forelimbs and neck in intermediate frequencies. The number of ticks on the neck and forelimbs did not differ among males, females and juveniles, but for the hindlimbs and all body parts, males and females usually had similar tick numbers and adults often had more ticks than juveniles. The number of ticks on the hindlimbs correlated with the body size of male and female tortoises, whereas the number of ticks on the forelimbs correlated with juvenile body size. Males and females had similar incidences of ticks despite sexual dimorphism in body size (female size > male size), and this may be due to the relatively large shell openings (soft skin exposure) of males compared to females. Body condition and microhabitat had no effect on the number of ticks. It is unclear why tick numbers on H. s. signatus increased in dry years. The adverse effects of drought on mammals may have caused ticks to switch from mammals to tortoises when preferred hosts were no longer available.",

In South Africa, partly to promote the conservation of the species, white rhinos have been introduced into areas where they did not occur historically (i.e. where they are considered extralimital). Few studies have investigated the conservation contribution of extralimital white rhinos to the overall national herd. We aimed to determine whether the white rhinos introduced to a private game reserve in the Eastern Cape province have been successful from a reproductive perspective. We calculated inter-calving intervals, age at first calving, sex ratios of calves, and recruitment rates for white rhinos at a single site between 1992 and 2019. The average net annual population growth rate for the population was 10%, which is higher than the recommended 5% by the Biodiversity Management Plan for white rhinos. Trends in density-dependent parameters such as age at first calving and inter-calving intervals also indicated that the study population is still well below the density at which ecological constraints may manifest. We demonstrate that an extralimital white rhino population in the Eastern Cape can be successful from a reproductive perspective.",

    "abstract": "AbstractResearch on amphibian parasites has been on the increase because of the noticeable decline of amphibians. Studies on these parasites have been limited to their prevalence and infection patterns, and there is still a dearth of knowledge on the phenotypic variations. To characterise and investigate the genetic variability and relatedness of amphibian nematode parasites, two nematode parasites–suspected Cosmocerca sp. and suspected Rhabdias sp.–of the toad Schlerophrys regularis were investigated. One hundred and sixty-eight S. regularis were collected from three study areas: Ikorodu, Ojota and Badagry. Intestines were dissected to obtain the enteric parasites, and lungs were washed in saline solution. Parasites were labelled according to the location of collection (Badagry 5A-5I, Ikorodu 5J–5O, Ojota 5P and 5S) and were then preserved for further identification. Eighteen parasites were identified morphologically using standard keys and by amplification of the 18S small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA sequence. Phylogenetic analysis was done using the Neighbour-Joining method. From the sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis, the suspected Cosmocerca sp. shared the closest genetic relatedness with Aplectana chamaeleonis isolate AC3 with 100% similarities while the suspected Rhabdias sp. shared the closest genetic relatedness with Rhabditoides regina isolate DF5012 with 100% similarities. Based on location, four Aplectana chamaeleonis (5E, 5F, 5G, 5H) and five Rhabditoides regina (5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5I) were from Badagry, four Aplectana chamaeleonis (5J, 5M, 5N, 5O) and two Rhabditoides regina (5K, 5L) from Ikorodu, one Aplectana chamaeleonis (5S) and two Rhabditoides regina (5P, 5Q) from Ojota. We report that Rhabditoides regina, a parasite known to be associated with insects, was recovered in the lungs of toads. Further investigations to resolve the complexities of superfamily Cosmocercoidea are recommended. Relatedness was not influenced by collection location as parasites were not unique to a specific environment.Keywords: amphibiansAplectanaintestineslungsparasitesRhabditoides",

In South Africa, global changes threaten the persistence of an assemblage of dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion) located in a biodiversity hotspot. We used ecological niche modelling to assess the combined effect of climate change and habitat transformation on these species and assessed their susceptibility in a vulnerability framework under optimistic and pessimistic change scenarios. Although our models showed a gain in suitable climatic space for all coastal species in some scenarios, considerable losses were predicted for most species under the most pessimistic change scenarios. Bradypodion ngomeense, for example is predicted to incur a complete loss of climatic suitability by 2050. The vulnerability framework predicts inland species to be more adversely affected by climate change than coastal species. However, no species show resilience to the combined effects of climate change and habitat transformation. Our models predicted a loss of climatically suitable habitat for most species in protected areas. These findings highlight the importance of a protected area network design to remain a step ahead of these anticipated changes.Keywords: Africabiodiversity declinesBradypodionconservation planningglobal changeniche modellingreptilesspecies distribution modellingvulnerability",

Yet there is almost no systematic analysis of pancake tortoise predation, and its consequences on the tortoise populations. Using camera trapping and visual encounter surveys, we recorded the animals visiting the crevices inhabited by pancake tortoises, as well as their surroundings. From our data, we propose which visitors were potential predators, and consider predator impacts on the species. We suggest ten species (21.3%) as potential predators, among the 47 visiting the tortoise crevices between July 2020 and November 2022. We encountered six adult pancake tortoises killed and eaten by unknown predators. Four of six eggs laid by pancake tortoises in May−June 2022 were also depredated. The white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda) and the honey badger (Mellivora capensis) were recorded probing rock crevices inhabited by pancake tortoises, with their behaviour suggesting potential predation upon tortoises. We recorded the rock monitor lizard (Varanus albigularis) and common dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula) digging pancake tortoise nest sites. This study significantly advances our understanding of the predation risk to the critically endangered pancake tortoise.Keywords: camera trappingcarnivorescritically endangeredpredation riskpredator-prey relationshipturtles",

Data were collected using the capture-mark-recapture technique in three representative habitat types (grassland, bushland and riverine forest) from November 2021 to August 2022. Descriptive statistics and indices for diversity and evenness were used to analyse the data. A total of 679 rodents and insectivores were collected during a span of 2 646 trap nights. Of these, 534 (76.64%) individuals were newly captured, while 145 (23.36%) were recaptures. Overall trap success was 20.18%. Five species of rodents were captured: four from the family Muridae (Mastomys natalensis, Arvicanthis niloticus, Rattus rattus and Lemniscomys macculus) and one (Xerus rutilus) from the family Sciuridae; and one insectivore species (Elephantulus rufescens) from the family Macroscelididae. Mastomys natalensis (178; 33.3%) was the most abundant, while X. rutilus (1; 0.2%) and E. rufescens (1; 0.2%) were the least abundant. Small mammal species varied significantly with habitat types (χ2 = 6.101, df = 2, p ≤ 0.05), with the highest count in the bushland habitat (197; 36.89 %) and the lowest in riverine forest (152; 28.46%). The bushland and riverine forest habitats supported the highest (H' = 1.04) and the lowest (H' = 0.506) diversity of small mammal species, respectively. A relatively high number of small mammal species were caught during the wet season (n = 336) compared to the dry season (n = 198). Future studies using more trapping grids covering additional habitat types and genetic analyses for small mammal species confirmation are necessary for a better understanding of the Park's small mammal fauna.",

Therefore, our study provides additional morphological details based on examining type specimens and newly collected materials from South Africa and the Republic of Congo.Keywords: Africapolychaetessystematics",

    "abstract": "The effects of food supplementation on a population of Lemniscomys rosalia were studied experimentally in a grassland habitat in Swaziland. Food was added bi-weekly to two I-ha grids, while a single I-ha grid served as the control. Rodent traps were set monthly over a 12 month period. Food supplementation may have affected the density of L. rosalia, but did not affect any other features of the population. Breeding commenced in September and ended in April (males) and May (females). Recruitment of juveniles occurred between January and March. Adult mean body mass increased from a low in winter (June/July) to a high in late summer (February). The drop in mean body mass in autumn was due to the disappearance of heavy adults and entry of the lighter subadults into the population. Mean survival of L. rosalia was low; 81% of all captured individuals disappeared within four months. An unscheduled fire burnt part of the study area and hence allowed an assessment of the effect of fire on L. rosalia. The fire did not cause undue mortality of L rosalia, however, burnt areas were avoided for three months until grass cover had sufficiently increased.",

    "abstract": "The behaviour of polyandrous and monogamous pale chanting goshawks Melierax canarus was investigated to determine if co-breeders, by defending the territory and nest contents, helped to increase the fitness of polyandrous trios. Polyandrous trios consisted of a female and male breeder, as well as a subordinate co-breeding male. Pale chanting goshawk males performed most of the interspecific territorial maintenance duties, as well as participating in aggressive intraspecific interactions against other males on territory borders. Intraspecific territorial interactions were almost exclusively recorded in high-quality habitat, Karroid Broken Veld, and probably functioned in the defence of foraging habitat and potential mates. In this habitat, males of polyandrous families largely occupied exclusive sections of a territory, It is suggested that the cost of defending territories in Karroid Broken Veld was offset by the co-breeder's contribution to high-risk, intraspecific territorial defence, During the nestling period females of polyandrous trios stayed at nesting sites for longer periods than did monogamous females and all males, enabling these females to guard the nest and act as sentinels. Predation of nestlings was recorded at the nests of monogamous pairs, but not at those of polyandrous trios. Co-breeders did not guard the nesting site but contributed directly to nest defence by either coming to the female's aid when solicited, or attacking potential predators when present at the nesting site. Co-breeders may also have helped indirectly, through activities such as provisioning prey to females that relieved them of their hunting duties. We suggest that the female's nest guarding and the resulting lower nest predation may hold reproductive and fitness benefits for polyandrous breeders.",

Frugivores may have difficulties in maintaining their protein requirements since fruit are generally high in sugar content but low in protein content. Some studies have found that fruit bats obtain most of their food protein when feeding on a variety of fruits. We investigated if E. wahlbergi prefers additional protein to sugar-only nectar solutions. They were offered equicaloric 15% glucose solutions with varying protein concentrations (2.58, 5.68, 7.23 g soy protein/kg H2O) and a solution with no protein. This was repeated using 15% sucrose instead of glucose solutions. Epomophorus wahlbergi's volumetric intake of the respective glucose and sucrose solutions varied among individual bats, with total volumetric intake being highest for solutions with no protein. This suggests they have low protein dietary requirements, which may be a response to the low-protein fruit available in the wild. Alternatively they may supplement their diet by actively preying on insects, but this needs to be investigated.",

Spent cocoons from this species are currently being utilized in a local silk industry. An understanding of the recolonization dynamics of a particular harvested site, and of the population genetic effects of such dispersal, are crucial for designing a scientifically-based harvesting strategy. I link morphological estimates of flying ability to microsatellite genotyping in the determination of dispersal ability of this species. Morphological results suggest that the moth is a poor disperser with high wing loadings and males are better fliers than females. There is a significant effect of isolation-by-distance. Spatial population genetic analyses of microsatellite data further indicate lower and upper bounds on dispersal of 90 m and 50 km. The combined evidence suggests male-biased dispersal over several dozen kilometers with females that do not disperse over large distances. I discuss the potential influences of large population size fluctuations on patterns of genetic diversity and the implications for the inference of dispersal in my study species.Key words: isolation by distanceLepidopteramicrosatellitespopulation cyclesspatial autocorrelation",

This was compared to pollution levels using a pollution load index (PLI) calculated for metals present. Laboratory exposures to cadmium were done to verify biomarker responses. The PLIs for the sites correlated with the levels of anthropogenic activities and effluent inflow. The highest pollution was at Muizenberg, with human habitation on the shore level, a fishing harbour and informal settlements. These specimens had shorter NRR times, indicating more damage than those from sites with lower pollution. The DI results also correlated with pollution levels. This study provided evidence that P. exigua has potential for monitoring environmental pollution, using biomarkers, especially in southern coastal areas due to its distribution.Key words: Parvalustra exiguaheavy metalspollution load indexneutral red retention assaylysosomal destabilization assaybiomarkers",

These taxa have been the subject of taxonomic controversy for some time, due to variability in the classical morphological characters used for taxonomic recognition. In this study we investigated skull size and shape variation in the genus Psammomys by using geometric morphometrics to evaluate the extent of intra- and interspecific shape variation and explicitly tested for the impact of allometric shape variation on species discrimination. Eleven populations of the two species from 10 localities in Tunisia were studied. Statistical analyses of size and shape showed large size variation within P. obesus, but no shape differences were revealed among populations of this species. Interspecific analysis revealed that P. vexillaris had the smallest skull. Principal component analysis and Procrustes distances showed good discrimination between the two species after removal of the allometric component of shape variation. The results obtained show that allometric-related shape variation could mask discrimination between the two Psammomys species. This finding might explain the uncertainty in classification of these species in the past. The interspecific allometric-free phenotypic differences observed may be associated with adaptive processes linked to the different environmental and trophic preferences of the two species.",

    "abstract": "Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat, Epomophorus wahlbergi, feeds on a range of fruit, nectar, pollen and flowers. Frugivores may have difficulties in maintaining their protein requirements since fruit are generally high in sugar content but low in protein content. Some studies have found that fruit bats obtain most of their food protein when feeding on a variety of fruits. We investigated if E. wahlbergi prefers additional protein to sugar-only nectar solutions. They were offered equicaloric 15% glucose solutions with varying protein concentrations (2.58, 5.68, 7.23 g soy protein/kg H2O) and a solution with no protein. This was repeated using 15% sucrose instead of glucose solutions. Epomophorus wahlbergi’s volumetric intake of the respective glucose and sucrose solutions varied among individual bats, with total volumetric intake being highest for solutions with no protein. This suggests they have low protein dietary requirements, which may be a response to the low-protein fruit available in the wild. Alternatively they may supplement their diet by actively preying on insects, but this needs to be investigated.",

We investigated whether morphological measurements could be used to discriminate between sexes of this species, with a sample of birds captured in two forest types on Mt Cameroon. We used discriminant function analysis based on a combination of traits to develop models to discriminate between sexes. The sex of birds predicted from these models was compared with molecular sexing of the same individuals. Discriminant analysis revealed that a discriminant function incorporating wing length, tail length and bill height allowed 74% of western mountain greenbuls to be sexed correctly based on morphometric measurements alone. Sex ratios varied between montane and lowland forests, with the former having a higher proportion of males (70.5 and 54.6%, respectively), but the difference was not statistically significant. Cloacal sizes did not differ between males and females, and males do not developlarge cloacal protuberances while breeding. This is in agreement with low predicted levels of sperm competition in this species. We show that sexing based on morphology has its limitations, but can still provide some insight if DNA analysis is not available.",

This was compared to pollution levels using a pollution load index (PLI) calculated for metals present. Laboratory exposures to cadmium were done to verify biomarker responses. The PLIs for the sites correlated with the levels of anthropogenic activities and effluent inflow. The highest pollution was at Muizenberg, with human habitation on the shore level, a fishing harbour and informal settlements. These specimens had shorter NRR times, indicating more damage than those from sites with lower pollution. The DI results also correlated with pollution levels. This study provided evidence that P. exigua has potential for monitoring environmental pollution, using biomarkers, especially in southern coastal areas due to its distribution.",

An understanding of the recolonization dynamics of a particular harvested site, and of the population genetic effects of such dispersal, are crucial for designing a scientifically-based harvesting strategy. I link morphological estimates of flying ability to microsatellite genotyping in the determination of dispersal ability of this species. Morphological results suggest that the moth is a poor disperser with high wing loadings and males are better fliers than females. There is a significant effect of isolation-by-distance. Spatial population genetic analyses of microsatellite data further indicate lower and upper bounds on dispersal of 90 m and 50 km. The combined evidence suggests male-biased dispersal over several dozen kilometers with females that do not disperse over large distances. I discuss the potential influences of large population size fluctuations on patterns of genetic diversity and the implications for the inference of dispersal in my study species.",

The areas were resurveyed after one month, three months and four months to compare crevice fidelity of solitary and group-living individuals. We found that solitary individuals were significantly less loyal to their rock shelters than individuals living in groups, and that solitary females appeared to be less loyal than solitary males. We found no significant difference in the frequency of solitary adult males in and outside of the mating season. Solitary adult males were significantly smaller in mean body size than group-living adult males, but did not have more scars or other deformities than the latter. We found no significant difference in the frequencies of solitary individuals during the wet and the dry seasons, or in the frequencies of solitary adult males versus solitary adult females recorded during any of the surveys. The significantly lower crevice fidelity displayed by solitary than group-living individuals supports the notion that being in a group must be the optimal situation for individuals of this relatively slow-moving cordylid. Our finding that solitary adult males were significantly smaller in mean body size than group-living adult males also suggests that the exclusion of less competitive males from groups may in part be responsible for the occurrence of solitary males.",

The volumetric intake, sugar preference and sugar concentration preference of the Cape white-eye (Zosterops virens), a small occasional nectarivore that also feeds on fruit and insects, was determined. This was done over a range of concentrations of both hexose and sucrose sugars using equicaloric solutions in pairwise choice tests. Birds exhibited no significant sugar type preference at any sugar concentration, but showed a preference for the lowest concentration (10%) of both hexose and sucrose solutions when presented with a range of sugar concentrations. The birds were able to meet energy demands on a dilute diet by adjusting volumetric intake and did not lose body mass. A significant preference for the 10% hexose and sucrose solutions may suggest that these occasional birds exert a selective pressure on the plants they pollinate to produce dilute nectar.",

The annual Acacia seed consumption by rodents in a South African savanna ecosystem was analysed by using estimates of rodent population densities, diet composition, seed predation by captive rodents and published estimates of field metabolic rates. Total seed consumption was estimated to represent 1,6- 4,1% of the annual seed crop of A. tonilis, 0,7-0,9% of the annual seed crop of A. nilatica and 9,3-25,0% of the annual seed crop of A. karroa. Granivory of A. nilatica seeds by rodents may have a negligible effect upon seedling recruitment.

Skin of P. namaquensis, however, has approximately half of the tensile strength 01 that of p, bibromi. As in other skini?½losing forms, the morphological basis for weakness lies in the bilayering of the dermis and the presence of zones of weakness within the upper layer of the dermis. Field experience suggests that P. namaquensis does not lose the skin as easily as most geckos exhibiting regional integumentary loss.

However, several Texas ranches maintain populations that provide a hedge against extinction and that can provide suitable stock for conservation projects, including reintroduction. For these initiatives, there is a critical need for information on spatial requirements of male dama gazelles. This is especially the case, because population increase is hindered by aggressive behaviour of males kept within limited areas. Adult males kill other males. We report on the spatial distribution and interaction potential (interanimal distances) of male eastern dama gazelles (N. dama ruficollis) from a population living on 8 996 ha of fenced rangeland in West Texas, USA. We fitted five males with GPS-radio collars and tracked their positions every 3 h for one year. Adult males (n = 3) maintained annual 95% Kernel Home Ranges (KHR) averaging 1 783 ha with 50% core areas averaging 440 ha. Average distance between adults with adjacent home ranges was 2.8 to 4.6 km, with only four contacts within 20 m recorded. Subadult males (n = 2) had more diffuse home ranges and a common core area. They only associated in a loose bachelor group for part of the time. Their space use can overlap with that of adult males. When spatial requirements are met, problems caused by aggression can be minimised. Small sample size prevents definite recommendations, but results point to productive avenues for additional study to enhance management of other ex situ populations.",

    "abstract": "Floral nectar is an important attractant and reward for visitors, and is often produced in synchrony with peak activity of pollinators. Aloe peglerae flowers in winter, and previous studies have shown that it is pollinated primarily by diurnal generalist birds, with small mammals making additional contributions to pollination at night. Nectar produced during the day is the main attractant and reward for birds, but the nectar rewards available to small mammals are unknown. This paper investigates nectar availability in Aloe peglerae, because small mammals may be feeding on remaining, or freshly produced, nectar at night. Nectar availability over a 24-hour period was measured in screened and unscreened plants (n = ten plants per treatment), and the associated partitioning of visits by diurnal birds and nocturnal small mammals assessed. Nectar is constantly available over 24-hours, but in different quantities. Nectar volume of screened (nectar availability) and unscreened (standing crop) plants, is significantly higher early in the morning after sunrise, compared with all other sampling periods during the 24-hour period. Nectar concentration did not vary over 24-hours, averaging 11.5 ± 0.4% w/w (unscreened) across the entire 24-hour period. Peaks in visits by different guilds occurred at periods (i.e. diurnal birds and nocturnal small mammals) when nectar availability was high. Aloe peglerae has higher daytime nectar production, when its primary pollinators are most active, but the continual, albeit reduced, nectar availability at night attracts small mammals. Mobile diurnal birds, and less-mobile nocturnal small mammals, both rely on this nectar resource during dry and cold South African winters and, in turn, are important pollinators for this Critically Endangered Aloe species.",

Given that the Central African forests exhibit heterogeneity in the distribution of environmental characteristics and forms distinct ecoregions, the question arises as to how this newly discovered population compares with other populations in Central Africa and particularly in the Congolian lowland forests. We reviewed the distribution records of this species and examined and compared new and available genetic data (mitochondrial DNA). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of two evolutionary lineages differing by 2.0% in 16S rRNA. One lineage occurs in and around the southern Cameroon Highlands, but its distribution southwards is poorly documented. The other lineage includes the western, central and eastern populations of the Congo Basin, suggesting certain biogeographic connectivity across the Congolian forests. These results support the hypothesis of limited biogeographic barriers to the distribution of lizards in the Congolian lowland forests, but this remains to be tested using additional independent markers, denser sampling and multiple species.",

    "abstract": "The genetic diversity of the Ethiopian endemic Ankober Serin Crithagra ankoberensis was studied in two populations at Simien Mountains National Park and Guassa Community Conservation Area using five microsatellite markers. Blood samples were taken from 16 and 14 birds, respectively. Three molecular markers resulted in relatively low, though noticeable differences between the two populations. The analysis also showed the presence of shared alleles, indicating current gene flow between the two populations. Two markers from Simien Mountains National Park and two markers from Guassa Community Conservation Area revealed obvious deviations from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. We interpret these deviations in both populations as limited population size and restricted gene flow. The genetic differentiation between the two populations thus could be explained by their geographical separation (more than 360 km), reinforced by barriers, such as steep mountains, deep valleys and extensive plains (isolation by distance). On the other hand, a stepping-stone mechanism between geographically intermediate populations across small distances might explain the observed gene flow. Further studies are needed to better reconstruct the biogeographic history and conservation needs of the Ankober Serin populations in Ethiopia.",

Previous studies of seed predation in southern Africa have largely been conducted in desert ecosystems. However, this woodland-savanna habitat is more mesic and has relatively predictable rainfall patterns. The experiment was conducted in grassy and woody microhabitats in the hot, dry season and early wet season, and followed a year in which precipitation was 69 % of the long-term average. Birds removed the greatest quantity of seeds, followed by ants and then rodents. Previous studies in northern hemisphere mesic environments emphasize the importance of rodents and minor role of invertebrates in seed predation. Although our site appears to have more in common with southern hemisphere desert sites than with northern hemisphere mesic sites, we recognize that our results are likely to reflect a lower limit of consumption by rodents.",

The author has developed his own grouping system with which all the soils from the South African soil classification system are grouped into fourteen distinctive soil groups. This totally new concept for South African soils and the key on how to do this is well thought out. This book compares well with any book written in the U.S.A. or Europe and is quite unique in the way the author strikes a relationship between animals and soils. There have been no previous attempts in the literature to illustrate the contribution of animals to soil formation so clearly as this book.",

John's appointment as Director of the Mammal Research Institute (MRI), a then semi-autonomous centre housed in the Department of Zoology heralded a new and exciting era at the University of Pretoria. In taking over the reins from Waldo Meester (the first director of the MRI), John thrust the MRI into the international arena of mammal research.

This species is endemic to the Ngele mistbelt forest in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. In recent years the forest has been severely impacted by anthropogenic activities such as logging of indigenous trees, construction of a national highway, commercial timber plantations and introduction of alien plant species, resulting in habitat fragmentation and potential range contraction for the species. A total of 35 specimens were collected from five sample sites (logs) in the Ngele Forest and sequenced for a partial fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit one (COI) locus. In addition, the sex ratio at each sample sites was determined. A highly skewed sex ratio was detected within sites and only three males were present among the 35 O. roseus specimens. The results reveal the presence of 11 haplotypes and moderate genetic differentiation between the five sampled sites. In addition, it is evident that samples from the same log represented a mixture of haplotypes and did not comprise a single maternal haplotype. The results further suggest that gene flow between individuals occurs in the interior of the forest. Conservation implications of the present study are briefly discussed.",

Thirty-five specimens of K. polyzonus werecollected from three ‘melanistic’ and eight ‘non-melanistic’ sample localities. Partial sequence data were derived for two mitochondrial DNA loci (16S rRNA and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase component 2 (ND2)) and analysed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. In addition, a haplotype network was constructed using TCS and an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was conducted. The derived topologies were highly congruent and showed that melanistic and non-melanistic populations were interdigitated on all tree topologies and a number of haplotypes were shared between melanistic and non-melanistic specimens.

The Egyptian free-tailed bat, Tadarida aegyptiaca, is one of the most widespread of the molossids and is therefore an excellent model to study the variation in reproduction through latitudinal changes. Bats were collected during 2008 and 2009 from Pretoria (25°S), South Africa. In males, spermatogenesis was already underway in January (summer) and spermatozoa were first noted in the epididymis during May (late autumn), where they are stored until the end of September. From September, the testes showed little spermatogenic activity and possibly remained quiescent until early summer. In females, follicular development started prior to January with large Graafian follicles present in June. Ovulation, copulation and subsequent fertilization occurred in late August (spring). When compared to the same species from a low temperate latitude (33°S) it is apparent that spermatogenesis and follicular development were initiated earlier in the year at 25°S. We propose that the seasonal monoestry displayed by T. aegyptiaca at 25°S may be the norm throughout their distributional range and that a latitudinal difference of just eight degrees could influence the timing of events in the reproductive cycle of a free-tailed bat.",

The closest correlations between these five parameters can be seen between the surface and the volume of the nests. The regressions between these two parameters are identical for both species; the addition of a first cap decreases the volume/surface ratio but a second or third cap does not alter this ratio further. Three apparent age classes have been attributed to the nests based on their external appearance: recent, eroded, and dilapidated. The great density (1297 nests/ha) and abundance of the nests that are dilapidated but still occupied by a declining population clearly suggests that the pressure from predation is weak. This study suggests that the environmental conditions are more influential than the species in shaping the mounds and tentative population dynamics of the termite mounds of Bondoé are outlined.",

The two most widely distributed species are H. granulatus and H. obscurus, the former occurring especially in the west and the other in the east, but their distributions overlap; in two instances they have been recorded from the same site. All species have a preference for rock outcrops, which are largely disjunct, and their regular prey comprises small ant species. Fieldwork over a period of 15 years indicated a very low dispersal rate; therefore one would expect localized ‘island’ populations rather than widely dispersed species. This means that the current species delimitations which lump geographically widespread populations may be incorrect. Mitochondrial DNA of specimens from each of 20 different localities across South Africa were analysed to test the hypothesis. Five of these localities did not yield results, but 14 yielded DNA from specimens which proved to belong to Horus and a fifteenth turned out to be a misidentified pseudoscorpion unrelated to Horus. The results were unequivocal: populations from each locality or group of closely-spaced localities were genetically distinct from any other one tested, and the greater the distance between localities, the greater the genetic differences (i.e. significant isolation by distance). This means that the current species delimitations for Horus are incorrect. It will require detailed micro-anatomical study to identify new characteristics on which species delimitations can be based in future.",

Two-choice and multiple-choice experiments were conducted using 10 animals of mixed sex for each experiment to compare bait preference of germinated and non-germinated grains. The results of the two-choice tests revealed that both germinated cereals and pulses were preferred to non-germinated by the test animals. The differences between the quantities consumed were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The results of Duncan’s post hoc multiple comparison tests of germinated grain consumption by R. rattus were categorized into three subsets. The first subset consisted of pearl millet, Bengal gram, ragi and paddy. The second and third subsets consisted of green gram and black gram, respectively. It is concluded that by considering the cost of all four grains (in the first subset) any one of the cheapest among them in the germinated form could be recommended or used as a bait base for any of the two rodenticides for the management of R. rattus. Based on these results, germinated paddy was chosen (as it is the cheapest among the grains) for the laboratory toxicity studies. The acute toxicity tests (2% zinc phosphide) resulted in 100% mortality of rats under both no-choice and two-choice (germinated paddy with poison versus plain non-germinated paddy bait) tests. A powder formulation of bromadiolone (0.005%)-treated bait yielded 100% mortality of rats in no-choice tests, but only 60% mortality in two-choice tests. These results suggest that the 2% zinc phosphide with germinated paddy as a bait base was preferred over a powder formulation of bromadiolone (0.005%). However, a field efficacy study is required before a final bait formulation recommendation is made.",

We quantified the packing and dispersion of sympatric animalivorous bats based on flight and echolocation parameters at two urban rivers in Durban, South Africa. We used null models to test if the observed phenotypic patterns deviated significantly from the random patterns expected in the absence of competition or prey defences at ensemble and functional group scales. As we predicted, species packing increased in the species-rich ensemble comprising many morphologically similar species that grouped together, with a few morphologically distinct species dispersed further away. Furthermore, we found evidence that competition influenced flight patterns of the open-air bats at the species-rich river ensemble, and prey defences influenced echolocation patterns of coexisting bats at the ensemble and functional group scales. However, non-deterministic processes such as habitat structure and the physics of sound and flight probably mediated these deterministic processes to influence the phenotypic structure of sympatric bats in urban landscapes.",

In a locality where C. nanum and C. boettgeri occur sympatrically the parasite has been found in both species. This finding of a Polystoma sp. in two closely related host species questions the strict host-specificity generally ascribed to the genus, but supports the hypothesis that host-specificity is determined by the oncomiracidium's ability to recognize the tadpole as a suitable host. This is the first polystome to be described from the genus Cacosternum and the ninth species of Polystoma from South Africa. The species is distinguished by its huge haptor and suckers relative to the body size. The haptor length/body length ratio of 0.38 is by far the largest for the known southern African polystomes. The prevalence of infection with P. channingi n.sp. was 25% for C. nanum and 40% for C. boettgeri, while the mean intensity of infections in adult frogs was 1.5 for C. boettgeri and 1.0 for C. nanum.",

These morphological characters are, however, often plesiomorphic and difficult to interpret in an evolutionarily meaningful way. Recent molecular studies have provided some clarity at lower-taxonomic levels, but studies giving resolution to deeper levels of the soricid phylogeny are lacking. By constructing the most taxonomically inclusive molecular phylogeny for this cosmopolitan family, this study aims to test the utility of the routinely used mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to resolve the higher-level relationships within the Soricidae. Given the life history characteristics of shrews (high metabolic rate in Soricinae, small body size, fast generation time and generally short life span), the metabolic theory predicts accelerated nucleotide turnover in this family. By examining the molecular evolution of the cytochrome b molecule, this study identifies both lineage- and codon-specific mutational rate differences.We suggest that codon-specific mutational rate patterns are best explained by unique selective regimes operating on the different codon positions, while lineage-specific rate variation among genera belonging to Soricidae may reflect differences in the mode and speed of speciation events which generated species.",

The book was compiled by two accomplished University of Cape Town professors, who have sought out specialist contributions from 19 other taxonomic experts, providing in-depth understanding of each group and adding significantly to the credibility of the book.",

Females were either kept in isolation, allowed only olfactory and auditory contact or in physical contact with a male. Basal LH as well as pituitary challenged LH blood samples were collected after six hours. Post-challenge LH levels were significantly elevated compared to baseline levels in both species. However, neither basal nor post-challenge LH levels differed significantly between treatments for females of either species. At the same time, while baseline LH was comparable between the two species, post-challenge levels were significantly greater for the solitary species. Our findings negate a modulatory role of male cues on LH levels but suggest increases in pituitary sensitivity in the solitary species. This could enhance reproductive success in species with only sporadic encounters between the sexes and merits further studies in other species.",

The locality of the material described herein comes from Ngaia Forest, Meru County, Kenya, approximately 420 km, northwest of the Tana Delta.

    "abstract": "Social behaviour has been implicated in the natal dispersal of several small mammal species. We studied social interactions within groups of bushveld gerbil Gerbilliscus leucogaster mothers and their weaned offspring in captivity. We examined groups (n = 8) over several weeks to assess whether mothers and juveniles tolerate one another beyond weaning, and to investigate behavioural influences surrounding the onset of dispersal. Each group was placed in a series of interconnecting tanks, allowing juveniles free movement between tanks but restricting the movement of the mother. In two of the eight groups the mother produced a second litter during the study; mothers in these two groups appeared to be less tolerant of their first litter compared to mothers in the remaining groups. The remaining groups showed very high levels of tolerance throughout the study, both between mothers and their offspring, and between siblings. Juveniles began showing independence from the mother around weaning, but although independent behaviour increased with juvenile age, there was no clear breakdown of the mother–offspring bond. In nature, offspring probably disperse passively at around five to six weeks old if no subsequent litter is born. However, the high tolerance within these groups suggests that dispersal could be delayed under particular circumstances.",

We studied survival and movement patterns of D. ferrugineus in both habitats. Capture-mark-recapture was used to study the effects of habitat on rodent life history both in primary rainforest and fallow land. Survival analyses taking into account trap-happiness effects were conducted using the program MARK. Abundance of D. ferrugineus was generally low within all our study grids, but it was lowest in fallow land compared to primary rainforest. Numbers of reproductively active females captured were not different between habitats but were larger during the rainy seasons. Daily movements of females, but not of males, were smaller in fallow land. Capture-markrecapture analyses showed recapture probabilities to vary highly between grids and years. Survival probability in the primary forest was higher than in fallow land with a difference of 0.084 over a period of four weeks. This is possibly linked to the higher abundance of the main food source (insects and termites); however, other explanations are discussed in the text.",

In addition to having a very low number of protozoal species, little is known about temporal (seasonal) variation and geographic variation in protozoan diversity. Forty-one warthogs were harvested over a two-year period (2003–2005) from a wildlife area owned by the South African Air force (Ditholo). Additional samples were obtained from three animals at a farm near Northam (2004), plus three animals from a game ranch (Knapdaar) near Ellisras (2010). Several physical parameters of the digestive tract were measured, i.e. pH, temperature, organ length, weight of organ contents, dry matter, density and digesta in vitro gas production. Samples were collected from the caecum and colon for protozoal counts. In the animals from Ditholo and Northam, Telamodinium onyx was present in 42 of the 44 animals and was the predominant species. Megadinium aethiopicum was observed in 33 animals and Teratodinium sphaeredon was present in 10 of the warthogs. Blepharoconus krugerensis was present in four animals. A single species of both Cyclopostidae and Isotricha were present in two separate animals. In the warthogs harvested at Knapdaar, T. onyx, M. aethiopicum and B. krugerensis were present in all three animals, while M. sphaeredon was present in only two. Unexpectedly, the species Blepharosphaera intestinalis and Charonina equi were found in all three animals. Concentration of protozoans in caecum/colon fluid averaged about 25 × 103 per ml. In conclusion, the larger number of animals studied established that there can be considerable protozoan diversity among animals and that both seasonal and geographic variation occur.",

In addition, lion populations are generally declining. In recent reports, in Ghana the lion has been declared functionally extinct, if not completely eradicated, and recent surveys have made conclusions as to the probable extinction of lions in Mole National Park (MNP) in Ghana’s Northern Territory. The aim of this report is to highlight the lion’s continued presence in MNP, an area that must continue to be considered for species conservation, and therefore studied carefully. In April 2011, a young male lion was filmed using camera traps, and a roar was clearly audible. The choice of where to place the camera traps (n = 20) was based on a habitat suitability model developed using lion records collected over 41 years. Additional records support our data, which demonstrate that MNP could possibly still be considered as an area designated for lion conservation in West Africa, even considering the significant findings based on molecular biology that prove that lions in West and Central Africa are clearly differentiated from other African lions.",

Both cytochrome b and D-loop sequences show C. leucogaster to be nested within C. pumilus sensu lato, with Malagasy C. pumilus forming a sister group to African C. pumilus and Malagasy C. leucogaster. Four distinct D-loop clades are found in southern African populations, all of which occur sympatrically in the greater Durban area of KwaZulu-Natal Province, whilst two of the Durban clades also characterize 1) northern KwaZulu-Natal and low-lying (<600 m) areas of Swaziland, and 2) ‘inland’ populations comprising the Kruger National Park and higher-lying (>600 m) areas of Swaziland. Clades from low-lying areas show evidence of historical demographic expansion around 3300–13 000 years ago (KwaZulu-Natal coastal clade, Clade A1) to 14 700–60 000 years ago (Durban clade, Clade B1), whilst the inland clade (Clade B2a) was demographically more stable. The origin of these clades can be explained by sea level and vegetation changes hypothesized to follow the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) after 18 000 years ago. Sympatric clades are shown to differ significantly in the proportional width of the braincase, and ongoing work will test evidence for acoustic and other morphological differences between them.",

Females were either kept in isolation, allowed only olfactory and auditory contact or in physical contact with a male. Basal LH as well as pituitary challenged LH blood samples were collected after six hours. Post-challenge LH levels were significantly elevated compared to baseline levels in both species. However, neither basal nor post-challenge LH levels differed significantly between treatments for females of either species. At the same time, while baseline LH was comparable between the two species, post-challenge levels were significantly greater for the solitary species. Our findings negate a modulatory role of male cues on LH levels but suggest increases in pituitary sensitivity in the solitary species. This could enhance reproductive success in species with only sporadic encounters between the sexes and merits further studies in other species.",

No significant differences (P = 0.43 to 0.54) were obtained for the growth rates of male and female E. hylocoetes under the suite of temperature/salinity combinations. Among the variables considered, temperature was identified as the most important in influencing the growth rates of the isopod. Elevated temperatures promoted faster initial growth in both males and females. Salinity had no significant influence on the growth rates of males and females. Males (25.77 ± 3.40 weeks) lived significantly longer (P < 0.001) than females (21.52 ± 3.00 weeks), allowing males (8.08 ± 0.25 mm mean body length) to attain a significantly larger size than females (6.59 ± 0.25 mm) under experimental conditions. Females, however, attained sexual maturity (at 2.5 mm body length) 2–4 weeks earlier than males (5.5 mm in length). It is suggested that the faster growth rates at the higher temperature/salinity combinations allow the isopod to reach sexual maturity at an earlier stage than those at the lower combinations.",

In this study, we test this hypothesis using comparative phylogeography with another species of savanna rodent, Lemniscomys striatus, using nested clade analysis (NCA) on cytochrome b sequences of 53 individuals, particularly checking for vicariance patterns in the Lopé National Park region. Lemniscomys striatus is characterized by a local structured pattern similar to that of N. minutoides. These new results further support the scenario of historical and ongoing fragmentation of the local savanna landscape which commenced in the upper Pleistocene, despite the repetitive savanna expansion episodes as documented by the landscape history. Geographic barriers most likely comprising forested areas, which prevent the mixing of local savanna rodent populations, must have persisted in this region. The presence of these barriers could not have been inferred from global paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental analyses alone.",

    "abstract": "Two coexisting species of African molossids, the little free-tailed bat, Chaerephon pumilus, and the Angolan free-tailed bat, Mops condylurus, were studied in the lowveld of Swaziland. Nine C. pumilus and five M. condylurus, all non-lactating females, were radio-tracked in order to investigate their habitat utilization. The results confirmed that both of these species selected to forage over sugarcane fields instead of over the other habitats available in the area: savanna, riparian forest and urban areas. Foraging ranges were relatively large with C. pumilus travelling on average a maximum of 4.2 km from the roost and M. condylurus covering 4.8 km. The mean activity areas ranged from 976 ha (minimum convex polygon) to 1319 ha (95% kernel) for C. pumilus and from 1190 ha (MCP) to 1437 ha (95% kernel) for M. condylurus. Interspecific differences in the mean activity area or maximum distance travelled were not found. The results of this study suggest that these species have a potential role as pest-controlling agents over sugarcane fields.",

Behavioural dominance has previously been assessed in this species using an ordinal ranking procedure and it was found to possess a non-linear dominance hierarchy. The determination of dominance using ordinal ranking is often subjective and cannot deal with ties in rank. This study adapts an objective and robust cardinal assessment method to assign dominance indices to individuals. These indices are then ordered to assign a final rank to each individual within a colony. The non-linear, exponential decay model provided the best fit to data from average cardinal dominance index versus final rank and revealed that colonies contain a single behaviourally-dominant individual. However, final rank could not be predicted on the basis of body mass, sex or assumed reproductive status and is not always statistically significant due to the inherent variation. We propose that the cardinal method of dominance assessment, with the adaptations made in this study, be used in future dominance-related assessments for other bathyergids and social organisms in general.",

The present study conducted conservation priority assessments for 221 South African terrestrial mammal species using existing data sources. These data sources included regional IUCN Red List assessments, regional geographic distributions, relative endemism, taxonomic distinctiveness, relative body mass and human density. These components were in turn subjected to two quantitative conservation priority assessment techniques in an attempt to determine regional conservation priorities for South African terrestrial mammals. The top 22 mammal species (i.e. the top 10% of assessed species) identified by both regional conservation priority assessment techniques to be of conservation priority, consistently identified 13 South African terrestrial mammal species to be of high conservation priority. Seven of the 13 species were from the order Afrosoricida, two species from the order Eulipotyphla, with one species each from the orders Chiroptera, Lagomorpha, Pholidota, and Rodentia. More importantly, 12 of the 13 mammal species were also listed as threatened in the 2004 Red Data Book of South African Mammals. These results suggest that the two conservation priority assessment techniques used in the present study may represent a practical and quantitative method for determining regional conservation priorities, and include measures that represent vulnerability, conservation value, and threat.",

Virtually all females larger than 59 mm appeared to be in some stage of reproduction, suggesting that females reproduce every year once they reach sexual maturity. Egg size ranged from 17–19mm long. Egg size was not correlated with maternal SVL. We found adult females with ready-to-lay eggs during the warmer months of the year, but not during winter and spring. The smallest sexually mature male was 72 mm SVL. Virtually all males larger than this size displayed at least semi-turgid testes and most adult male testes were at least semi-turgid for much of the year. The only significant decrease in testicular activity was in mid-winter (June–August), thus, spermatogenesis is closely tied to female follicular development and ovulation. Velvet geckos are largely insectivorous (92%) and feed on a broad spectrum of prey. Their diet was dominated both numerically (34%) and volumetrically (22%) by beetles. Lepidoptera were the next most important prey category, suggesting that they exploit both terrestrial and flying invertebrates. They are unusual among lizards because they feed on millipedes. Males and females had very similar diets which may be explained by their lack of sexual dimorphism, although females tended to eat a greater volume of prey. Interestingly, less than half (37%) of the lizards examined contained prey items, suggesting that most individuals were not in positive energy balance. We also found evidence of prey size selection as a function of gape size, such that larger geckos took advantage of larger prey items.",

    "abstract": "In lizards, pheromonal cues are important for mate recognition and are expected to diverge during the speciation process. We tested for divergence in pheromonal mate and species recognition between male flat lizards (Platysaurus broadleyi) belonging to the same population, a different population, and a sister species. Males were given a choice between two refuges, an odourless control and one of the following: a conspecific female from the same population (sympatric), a conspecific female from a distant population (allopatric), and a female from their sister species (heterospecific), P. capensis. Males chose refuges treated with the scent of a heterospecific over an odourless control refuge but showed no preference for refuges that were scented with female conspecific (allopatric or sympatric) cues over the control. These results were consistent in the breeding and non-breeding seasons. In a second experiment males were offered a choice of female scents between sympatric and allopatric conspecifics; an allopatric conspecific and a heterospecific; and a sympatric conspecific and a heterospecific. Males showed a trend of preferring heterospecific over conspecific refuges and allopatric over sympatric conspecific-scented refuges, but these results were not significant at alpha <0.05. Contrary to our original expectations, these experiments do not provide any evidence for a pheromonal pre-mating isolation mechanism within this species complex. However, our results suggest a preference for novel female scents by males, consistent with selection for genetic diversity.",

Therefore, we assessed this from the literature and first-hand observations to determine which species use Hamerkop nests and their associated behaviours. We found at least 20 avian species using Hamerkop nests for breeding in 18 African countries. The Barn Owl Tyto alba was the most commonly reported species using Hamerkop nests. Six species actively usurp nests from Hamerkop pairs. Nine species nested inside the nest chamber, and eight nested on top of the structure.

In Critically Endangered species these records are even more important, owing to their potential impacts on small and/or declining populations. Here we present a case of natural mortality that occurred when a 20-day old Hooded Vulture nestling fell from its nest in Limpopo province, South Africa, which is a new cause of mortality for the Critically Endangered Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus throughout its range. We also compile all known causes of mortality for Hooded Vultures from the scientific and grey literature. The carcass of this nestling was found on the ground below the nest some 25 days later. This cause of mortality is previously undocumented for this vulture species, and it was recorded on a series of photographs taken by a camera trap in the nest tree. We believe this cause of mortality to be uncommon when compared to other threats faced by this species.Keywords: anthropogenic mortalitynatural mortalityHooded Vulturenestling falling from nestcamera trapSouth Africa",

To assess the possible role of dietary calcium, we have measured bone calcium concentrations in female and male long-fingered bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) through a full reproductive cycle. The results indicate that winter was not a period of calcium stress and, therefore, that seasonal changes in insect abundance and dietary calcium availability are not a satisfactory explanation for the occurrence of delayed implantation in the long-fingered bat. Bone calcium concentrations of females did not differ significantly throughout pregnancy. indicating that the insects available in winter and early summer were sufficient to meet the calcium demands of pregnancy. Lactating females had the lowest bone calcium concentrations of all specimens, supporting the suggestion that lactation is indeed a period of severe calcium stress in aerial insectivores. We conclude that parturition is probably timed so that lactation coincides with the period of maximal insect abundance and corresponding dietary calcium availability.",

Macroscelidea, and Rodentia were analysed using museum point locality data and a geographic information system (GIS).

Species richness of the target species is highest in the south-western parts of the country, and hotspots of endemism cOincide with those of species richness. However, Red Data Book species hotspots are confined to the north-eastern parts of the country. One species richness hotspot in the Succulent Karoo contains no existing reserves, whereas all Red Data Book species hotspots are protected. In general, all target species are well protected within existing reserves, but those found in the Succulent and Nama-Karoo, especially the Namaqua dune molerat (Bathyergus janetta) , the riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis), Brants' whistling rat (Parotomys brantsit), and the pygmy rock mouse (Petromyscus collinus) , are threatened by a paucity of reserves in these biomes. A heuristic reserve selection algorithm was used to identify a more representative reserve system for the protection of all target species. Ten representative reserves were identified, six of which already contain existing reserves. An analysis of biome specificity of all species revealed that Myomyscus verreauxii is endemic to the fynbos, Bathyergus janetta to the Succulent Karoo, Zelotomys woosnami to the arid savanna, and Steatomys parvus to the savanna woodlands. No species are endemic to the Nama-Karoo or grasslands, although several species do show strong preferences for these habitats. It is recommended that hotspots, representative reserves, and species that are currently not protected, be awarded more protection. and that existing reserves which coincide with hotspots and representative reserves be managed for their mammal fauna. It is also recommended that the Red Data Book status of four species, and six subspecies, should be changed.",

Detailed histological examination of gonadal development showed that they are rudimentary hermaphrodites, males and females maturing after a non-functional intersexual stage. The breeding season is restricted to between January and June, and observations suggest that they are group spawners with pelagic eggs. Maturity was reached at 300 mm fork length or approximately 5,5 years old. P. grande is primarily herbivorous, feeding selectively on rhodophytes found on inshore reefs down to approximately 20 m. Minor dietary components included hydrozoans, octocorals and other small invertebrates. Macroalgal degradation by gut endosymbionts or the utilization of macroalgal epibionts was not evident, suggesting that storage and extracellular carbohydrates of the macroalgae were utilized in the diet. The importance of P. grande to the inshore recreational angling fishery, together with certain aspects of its biology, underline the need for conservation measures aimed at ensuring the sustain ability of this resource.",

    "abstract": "An electrophoretic allozyme study of the fiscal shrike Lanius collaris, a widely distributed sub-Saharan passerine, was undertaken to investigate altitudinal variation in genetic structure within this species. It is a sedentary bird with limited dispersal so that subpopulations may be expected to show genetic isolation by distance, which may have been enhanced by Pleistocene glaciation effects. The study area was a linear altitudinal transect of four localities in the eastern half of South Africa, which ranged from sea level to an altitude of 1800 m, with the geographic distance between the furthest subpopulations being 300 km. Fourteen (40%) of the 35 electrophoretic loci examined were polymorphic. The mean percentage of polymorphic loci within populations, mean heterozygosity and mean number of alleles per locus were 0.519, 0.272 and 1.60, respectively. These values were much higher than those reported for most other avian species. The negative FIS and FIT values indicated a small excess of heterozygotes. The populations are only weakly differentiated genetically (FST = 0.076). Rogers’ (1972) mean genetic distance (D) was 0.094, and Nei’s (1978) mean unbiased genetic distance was 0.019. A phenogram (unweighted pair group method) and a phylogenetic tree (distance Wagner network), both based on Rogers’ (1972) distance, showed some degree of geographical subgrouping. The high mean value for the effective number of migrants (Nm) among demes indicated that 3.04 individuals were exchanged among demes per generation. The mean value for local genetic differentiation (FST) and Nm indicated levels of gene flow between the different localities of fiscal shrike subpopulations. The Mantel test indicated that there was no significant relationship between the FST values and the geographical distances between sample pairs. This study showed that the isolation-by-distance model of subpopulation structure is inappropriate for these birds. Juvenile natal dispersal distances, female divorce rates (every three years) and the distance of travel of females (although low) appear to be sufficient to maintain high levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity. These levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity, together with large amounts of gene flow and the general lack of spatial autocorrelation imply that the populations of L. collaris may be subject to high rates of random drift. High values of sample heterozygosity suggest that fiscal shrike subpopulations have been stable for a long period and that genetic diversity has accumulated within populations. The rates of migration suggest that the ‘subpopulations’ of fiscal shrike act more or less as a single population extending over at least 300 km.",

In this study, we assessed invertebrate drift in two rivers, i.e. Njoro and Kamweti, that differ in the level of anthropogenic disturbances, between February and March, 2016. The aim was to evaluate the effect of river sampling duration (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 min) and sampling period (day or night) on invertebrate drift densities. The 5-minute sampling period resulted in significantly higher mean drift densities than the other time intervals in both rivers. The highest mean drift density (2.0 ± 0.9 individuals m−3) was recorded at the Njoro River during the day, whereas the lowest drift density (0.3 ± 0.2 individuals m−3) was recorded at the Kamweti River during the day. A strong nocturnal drift pattern was noted at the less disturbed river (Kamweti). The present results suggest that anthropogenic perturbations influence invertebrate drift densities, and sampling duration and sampling period are important factors to consider when sampling invertebrate drift.",

The reproductive cycle is characterized by a three-month period of delayed implantation and the total length of pregnancy may be as much as 10 months. A histochemical study of the gonadotrophs and mammotrophs of the anterior pituitary, in conjunction with assays of LH-like, progesterone-like and prolactin-like immunoreactivity in the plasma suggest that during delayed implantation the gonadotrophs were inactive while the mammotrophs were active and plasma PRL-like immunoreactivity high. We interpret this as indicating that, in the straw-coloured fruit bat, implantation was inhibited by high levels of prolactin and, as such, the endocrine control of delayed implantation may be quite different from that described for other mammals.Key words: MegachiropteraReproductionMammotrophGonadotroph",

I tested the model using data for the raucous toad, Bufo rangeri, collected nightly over three breeding seasons. The numbers of active males and fertilizable females were correlated in two of the three breeding seasons. The OSR, defined as the average ratio of sexually active males to fertilizable females, decreased throughout each season, except for the first, when it rose to a peak before decreasing. The OSR fluctuated towards the end of the season in two of the three seasons, and rose again at the end in only one. Although the equal-performance assumption was violated, the temporal pattern of the OSR in this species complied largely with that predicted by the active–inactive model. Reasons for deviations from the model’s predictions are discussed. Despite the lack of data on mortality rates, this study represents the most comprehensive test of the model yet, as tests on other species have been based on data collected intermittently, as opposed to nightly, over only two breeding seasons.",

The sulcus acusticus of both species is archaesulcoid but mesial in M. macrolepidotus and ostio-caudal in P. catostoma. The crista inferior in M. macrolepidotus is ridge-like and well defined posteriorly and anteriorly, whereas in P. catostoma it is clearly defined posteriorly and disappears anteriorly. The otoliths of both species do not have a rostrum, antirostrum or an excisura.

    "abstract": "Associations between animals of different species have been observed for a large variety of taxa. These polyspecific groups are thought to provide advantages to at least one of the species involved, especially foraging benefits or reduced predation risk. In the case of primate-bird associations, both foraging benefits and reduced predation risk have been suggested. We investigated whether flocks of Crested Guineafowl (Guttera edouardi) join groups of samango monkeys (Cercopithecus albogularis schwarzi) and examined benefits to the birds. Using behavioural data, we tested (1) whether Crested Guineafowl associate with samango monkeys for a longer period of time than can be expected by chance, using a movement simulation model, and (2) whether Crested Guineafowl show differences in foraging and predation risk behaviour and habitat selection in relation to vegetation cover in the presence of samango monkeys. Observations were done in the Soutpansberg Mountain Range, South Africa. We found that (1) Crested Guineafowl join samango monkeys for a longer period of time than expected by chance, and (2) Crested Guineafowl show significantly less sentinel behaviour with samango monkeys present. These findings suggest that the birds experience reduced predation risk in the presence of the monkeys. Our study is the first to report association between Crested Guineafowl and samango monkeys and contributes to understanding why birds and primates associate.",

A total of 908 regurgitated pellets were collected from underneath one nest tree in north-eastern South Africa, over a 24-month period. A total of 26 prey species were identified, of which 17 comprised bats and nine were birds. Seven prey species qualified as common in the diet (≥11 individuals): Pipistrellus hesperidus, Tadarida aegyptiaca, Scotophilus dinganii, Zosterops virens, Chaerephon pumilus, Afronycteris nana and Laephotis capensis. Most prey individuals were clutter-edge foragers: 41 individuals (67%) were birds, and 181 (42%) were bats. The Bat Hawks therefore foraged predominantly adjacent to vegetation. Future studies should examine the environmental factors that drive the abundance of insects in these habitats and the foraging techniques that birds and bats employ to prey upon them, to ultimately increase our understanding of the foraging framework that flying Bat Hawks exploit when hunting these flying animals.",

In our previous paper (Mabika et al. 2019) we provided information on the seasonal occurrence of metazoan parasites of H. vittatus. This communication provides endohelminth infection statistics of male and female H. vittatus across two seasons not previously included. A total of 80 H. vittatus individuals consisting of 56 females and 24 males were examined for endohelminth parasites during the period October 2014–July 2015 in the Sanyati basin, Lake Kariba. Parasites were recovered from the abdominal cavity, mesentery and intestines. Most of the parasites were harboured in the abdominal cavity in both sexes. Parasite infection was more prevalent during the dry season in comparison to the rainy season for both sexes. Contracaecum larval infection was significantly higher in female (84%) than in male tigerfish (24%), whereas larval cestode infections were significantly higher in male tigerfish (59%) than female fish (16%). The mean condition factor of the male tigerfish (1.68) was not significantly higher than that of the female (1.64). The results of the study indicate that female tigerfish were more suitable hosts to Contracaecum larval infection than the male fish. Further parasitological and histopathological research on tigerfish is recommended to contribute to knowledge on endohelminth diversity and conservation.",

Some feedings adaptations are descriptionbed, among them the ability to reach most points of the feeding around among twig and leaves by clinging in almost every body position even to weak supports and by hovering, 'Zirkeln' (enlarging of crevices by introduction of the closed bill which then opens and presses its edges part), intake of liquids by licking and examination of shallow cavities with the tip of the tongue. Some aspects of the Bock structure, clumping and allopreening are discussed. The agonistic behaviour patterns are descriptionbed. While fighting is still of a relatively general passerine pattern, threat and submissive postures are partly ritualized. Threat postures consist of bill-opening, pivoting, wing-dropping and bill-clattering, each of them manifesting increasing aggressive tendencies in this order. Submission is expressed by becoming motionless and, in higher intensity, by fluffing, whereby certain plumage areas, crown and back, are already Buffed maximally in low intensity displays and re-direct the aggressive tendencies of an eventual partner towards allopreening, Only a few observations were made on courtship behaviour. Horizontal wing-quivering is the usual approach of males to their potential mates whose aggressive tendencies are cut off by the offer of the male', head and neck. Plumage for allopreening. The descriptionbed postures are compared with what is known of comparable behaviour of other Zosterops species.",

    "abstract": "The cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus) is a wild animal recently domesticated in Africa for meat production. The effect of dietary fibre levels on the digestive health and growth in the young cane rat remains largely unknown. Dietary fibre intake, however, seems to play an important role in its digestive functioning. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary fibre intake on young cane rats. The estimated optimal dietary fibre content of pelleted diets, which optimised growth without impairing health in young T. swinderianus was examined. The feed intake, growth and health of young cane rats were assessed for four diets with dietary fibre levels set at 7, 12, 20 and 24% acid detergent fibre (ADF) on four groups of 18 animals each. Growth was best with the 12% ADF diet followed by 20% ADF diet, with average live weights reaching 1 404 g and 1 325 g, respectively, at 114 days of age. In contrast and compared with the 12% ADF diet, the 24% ADF diet resulted in a 9% weight reduction. Additionally, the 7% ADF diet led to a 33% mortality rate due to enteritis (without diarrhoea), but was associated with inflammation in the stomach and small intestine. We conclude that the optimal fibre content for growing cane rats fed on complete pelleted diets would be between 12% and 20%.",

It is distinctive in the form of its calcareous ring and body wall plates in combination, and appears to be closely related to S. rapax (Koehler & Vaney, 1908) from the Bay of Bengal, differing from it in having elongated, rather than spherical multi-layered plates. If the calcareous ring were not fragmented the species could well be referred to the genus Pseudothyone Panning, 1949 of the subfamily Sclerodactylinae, closely allied to P. mosaica (Koehler & Vaney, 1910) from the Persian Gulf. The remarkable similarity in the body wall deposits of genera currently classified in two separate subfamilies challengesthe use of the calcareous ring to separate subfamilies, since it demands a degree of evolutionary convergencewhich hardly seems probable. Of the eleven nominal species of Stolus, eight are keyed and a table provided to compare the three similar species - S. kilberti, S. rapax and P. mosaica.",

We use a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite markers to evaluate genetic variation within and between two populations of bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis Desmarest, 1822) in South Africa. The bat-eared fox is a small canid occurring in southern and eastern Africa. The species is currently not threatened with extinction, but a lack of information on genetic diversity has been identified as a deficit for its future conservation. We observed low to moderate genetic differentiation between the two geographically separated populations, but neither mitochondrial nor nuclear microsatellite markers suggested that there have been dispersal barriers between them. Similar genetic diversity within both populations was contrasted by interpopulational differences in relatedness variation among males and females. A high genetic relatedness within both populations, indicated by mitochondrial data, is likely caused by a common historical origin or a combination of species-specific social organization and environmental dispersal constraints. We call for further research on the genetic divergence of bat-eared fox populations as well as on the genetic consequences of interactions between environmental characteristics and social organization in this species.",

We aimed to assess the degree of intersexual and seasonal differences in morphological and reproductive aspects, as well as their experienced predation pressure. Morphological analyses confirmed that the species exhibits sexual dimorphism, evidenced by a larger body size for females and larger heads and longer limbs for males. However, tail autotomy (used as an estimation of predation rate) was found to be similar for both sexes and seasonally stable. Overall, the reproductive cycles of males and females were synchronised across the seasons, for an optimal breeding period during spring and summer, but males showed certain spermatogenic activity throughout the whole year.",

In January, 1977, two pools were censused for fish, then poisoned using the ichthyocide 'pronoxfish' and all fish collected. Forty species in 21 families were obtained from the two stations. The accuracy of visual estimates varied with the species of fish. Secretive and cryptically coloured types, as well as species which Inhabit crevices, were underestimated, between 0 and 86% being counted. Other fish with protective colours but that occur more openly and do not react adversely to divers, as well as schooling species, were also underestimated, but up to 100% of the total were observed. Those which occur singly or in small groups in the water column were counted more accurately, with 57 to 100% of the actual number being seen. Correction factors were calculated from these data and applied to a census taken of one pool in May. Comparisons of corrected and actual numbers Indicate that these factors were relatively accurate for non-secretive species. The factors will, however, vary for each species, from observer to observer, depending on their personal experience, and from area to area.",

Results on behavioural thermoregulation (response to thermal gradient) suggest it to be of greatest significance in H. areolatus. Physiological thermoregulation was studied in terms of individual capacities to control thermal conductance. All three species showed definite capacities to thermoregulate by altering conductance. H. areolatus appears to possess greatest physiological control of conductance and has a higher maximum preferred temperature than the other two species studied. Large specimens of G. pardalis show little physiological control of heat flux and this decreases with Increasing size. C. angulata has a greater degree of control over conductance than G. pardalis. It is concluded that size alone can not explain all the different thermoregulatory characteristics. The study demonstrates the need for a holistic theory of physiology and ecology of thermoregulation in tortoises.",

In order to obtain more information on this, its reproductive systems were studied. Existing literature on the topic is either contradictory or scant. The investigation was done by examining the gross anatomy and histology, using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The male reproductive system consists of two pairs of testes in segments 10 and 11 and two pairs of seminal vesicles in segments 11 and 12. In mature worms the developing spermatozoa are released by the testis into the body cavities of segments 10 and 11. The seminal vesicles in a particular segment receive developing spermatozoa from the lumen of the preceding segment. Two pairs of ciliated sperm funnels also occur in segments 10 and 11 and become the ciliated vasa deferentia carrying the sperm. The vasa deferentia on each side fuse to form only one vas deferens. These vasa deferentia reach the pair of prostatic glands in segment 18, each joining the prostatic duct and opening via the ventral male openings adjacent to each other on segment 18. Associated with the male openings are retractable penial chaetae. The cellular composition and organelle distribution of some organs and structures are also descriptionbed. The positions of the female reproductive structures are illustrated diagrammatically in this paper.",

The fish have affinities with the tropics in summer, while in winter many warm-temperate species increase in numbers. In comparison with the fauna of soft substrates, that of rocks has a higher percentage of stenohaline and estuarine forms, and a more restricted distribution. The rocky habitat in estuaries favours greater specialization with respect to salinity tolerance. A high percentage of the biomass of invertebrates in soft substrates consists of detritivores, and the biomass is related to the organic content of the substrate. Mangrove mud has the highest organic content and supports the highest biomass, but few species can tolerate the conditions there. Mangroves are probably the major primary producers in the system.",

Beak measurements were used to estimate dorsal mantle lengths and wet masses of cephalopods taken by penguins. The dominant cephalopod taken by penguins was the same species as that harvested by commercial fisheries. Despite an overlap in the size range of squid taken by penguins and trawlers, penguins tended to take smaller squid and did not take the larger squid landed by trawlers. The seasonal occurrence of squid in the penguin diet in 1976 and 1977 was the opposite of the abundance of squid in the area as reflected by trawler landings. This is explained in terms of the abundance and preference for other prey items. It is suggested that penguins take fish in preference to squid because of the relatively higher energy content and food value of fish.",

Alhough pale chanting goshawks demonstrate a clear preference for perching on the highest available perches, the availability of perches is of more importance than height because these birds hunt almost exclusively from perches, move regularly between them, and an increased number of perches increases the area of habitat accessible for effective hunting. In Succulent Karoo, pale chanting goshawks occupied areas where perch density (16 natural and 122 artificial/25 ha) was significantly higher than in unoccupied areas (8 natural and 12 artificial/25 ha). The high proportion of cover formed by natural perches (trees and shrubs; 36%) and the low proportion of open ground (42%) resulted in Closed Spekboomveld being unsuitable for pale chanting goshawks, relative to the adjacent Open Spekboomveld that supported goshawks by offering a less restricted view of the ground and prey (perch cover 18% and open ground 49%). In Karroid Broken Veld, the combination of perch availability (3 026/25 ha) and open ground (62%) may provide the most suitable conditions for hunting rodent prey near cover or in the open. We suggest that such habitat may also provide a pathway, through fitness benefits gained, in the development of delayed dispersal and cooperative breeding in pale chanting goshawk families.",

Two extinct taxa, Procavia antiqua and P. transvaalensis , have been previously reported to occur at the site in deposits postdating 1,8 million years before the present (B.P.). The extant taxon, P. capensis , has been reported in the most recent deposits, thought to include the Terminal Pleistocene. However, statistical analyses of teeth suggest that P. antiqua and P. capensis are conspecific. P. transvaalensis differs from P. capensis by being larger and more hypsodont. The coexistence of these taxa in palaeoenvironments of the Sterkfontein valley is attributed to dietary differences: P. transvaalensis being dependent primarily on grass foliage in grassland habitats, P. capensis being a generalist, feeding on a range of different kinds of vegetation in rocky habitats. Hypoconid-metaconid distances, previously used by Broom to distinguish taxa, are shown to be related to individual age. Crown height data of molars are used to generate age distributions, and incisors are used to obtain sex ratios, Predation on adults of P. transvaalensis , Irom populations associated with a sex ratio biased towards males. may have contributed to the decline in relative abundance and ultimate extinction of this species towards the end of the Pleistocene. Predators can have included leopards, black eagles and/or hominids.",

Instead, they possess osteoderms that have presumably evolved from crossopterygian fish scales and these may indicate a close evolutionary link between caecilians and the first animals to live on dry land (Bennett & Wake 1974). They also usually possess only a single, complex, and highly vascularized lung and both these features have led to the supposition that caecilians do not employ cutaneous respiration and that they may exhibit a low rate of evaporative water loss. In point of fact, however, caecilians are very rare animals and very little is known of their physiology. Very few studies on their respiration have been performed (see Bennett & Wake 1974) and all of these suffer from very small sample sizes. For these reasons we examined oxygen consumption (V02), carbon dioxide production (VC02), respiratory patterns, and evaporative water loss (EWL) in the caecilian Scolecomorphus kirki.",

This sample was dominated by females (many with brood pouches containing nauplii) with Stage 2 ovarian development. Stomach analyses showed that the majority of specimens had stomachs full of phytoplankton-derived material.

Although almost all species were found to feed on a variety of foods, with consequent dietary overlaps, quantitative analysis of the results showed that distinct preferences for specific food types considerably ameliorated the effects of such overlaps. Partitioning within the major food categories, differences in relative population sizes, spatial and temporal differences in feeding and shifts in diet following inputs of seasonally occurring foods, all tended further to reduce effective competition between species. The results are discussed in the broader context of colonization of the Pongolo system by a tropical fish community in circumstances where the principles of island biogeography may be expected to apply.",

Size frequency analyses of the populations sampled and growth ring lengths were used to construct a growth curve for D. hepatica. The calculated growth rate was slow, with D. hepatica reaching a shell length of approximately 16,3 mm and a dry tissue mass of ca. 44 mg after three years. The potential life span of the bivalve was estimated to be 8 i?½ 9 years.

Sparidae and Serranidae were represented by juveniles of inshore species. The findings are discussed in relation to previous studies of intertidal pools in the eastern and western Cape, and it is concluded that shallow rocky inter- and infratidal areas are important nursery areas for numerous inshore fishes, including some species caught by recreational line fishermen. The results from this study suggest that previous intertidal studies have over-emphasized the importance of rock pools as nursery areas.",

The speed achieved by O. plana is probably the highest yet recorded for any pedestrian insect. Relative speeds of the three tenebrionids are related to leg length and muscle mass, and to behavioural thermoregulation.
