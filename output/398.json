    "abstract": "Climate change is transforming aquatic ecosystems. Coastal waters have experienced progressive warming, acidification, and deoxygenation that will intensify this century. At the same time, there is a scientific consensus that the public health, recreation, tourism, fishery, aquaculture, and ecosystem impacts from harmful algal blooms (HABs) have all increased over the past several decades. The extent to which climate change is intensifying these HABs is not fully clear, but there has been a wealth of research on this topic this century alone. Indeed, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) approved in September 2019 was the first IPCC report to directly link HABs to climate change. In the Summary for Policy Makers, the report made the following declarations with \"high confidence\": In addition, the report specifically outlines a series of linkages between heat waves and HABs. These statements about HABs and climate change and the high levels of confidence ascribed to them provides clear evidence that the field of HABs and climate change has matured and has, perhaps, reached a first plateau of certainty. While there are well-documented global trends in HABs being promoted by human activity, including climate change, individual events are driven by local, regional, and global drivers, making it critical to carefully evaluate the conditions and responses at appropriate scales. It is within this context that the first Special Issue on Climate Change and Harmful Algal Blooms is published in Harmful Algae.",

    "abstract": "Marine and freshwater ecosystems are warming, acidifying, and deoxygenating as a consequence of climate change. In parallel, the impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on these ecosystems are intensifying. Many eutrophic habitats that host recurring HABs already experience thermal extremes, low dissolved oxygen, and low pH, making these locations potential sentinel sites for conditions that will become more common in larger-scale systems as climate change accelerates. While studies of the effects of HABs or individual climate change stressors on aquatic organisms have been relatively common, studies assessing their combined impacts have been rare. Those doing so have reported strong species- and strain-specific interactions between HAB species and climate change co-stressors yielding outcomes for aquatic organisms that could not have been predicted based on investigations of these factors individually. This review provides an ecological and physiological framework for considering HABs as a climate change co-stressor and considers the consequences of their combined occurrence for coastal ecosystems. This review also highlights critical gaps in our understanding of HABs as a climate change co-stressor that must be addressed in order to develop management plans that adequately protect fisheries, aquaculture, aquatic ecosystems, and human health. Ultimately, incorporating HAB species into experiments and monitoring programs where the effects of multiple climate change stressors are considered will provide a more ecologically relevant perspective of the structure and function of marine ecosystems in future, climate-altered systems.",

Population is also projected to increase, amplifying the demands for food, fuel, water and sanitation, which, in turn, escalate nutrient pollution. Global projections of nutrient pollution, however, are less certain than those of climate as there are regionally decreasing trends projected in Europe, and stabilization of nutrient use in North America and Australia. In this review of the effects of eutrophication and climate on harmful algae, some of the complex, subtle, and non-intuitive effects and interactions on the physiology of both harmful and non-harmful taxa are emphasized. In a future ocean, non-harmful diatoms may be disproportionately stressed and mixotrophs advantaged due to changing nutrient stoichiometry and forms of nutrients, temperature, stratification and oceanic pH. Modeling is advancing, but there is much yet to be understood, in terms of physiology, biogeochemistry and trophodynamics and how both harmful and nonharmful taxa may change in an uncertain future driven by anthropogenic activities.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are diverse phenomena involving multiple. species and classes of algae that occupy a broad range of habitats from lakes to oceans and produce a multiplicity of toxins or bioactive compounds that impact many different resources. Here, a review of the status of this complex array of marine HAB problems in the U.S. is presented, providing historical information and trends as well as future perspectives. The study relies on thirty years (1990–2019) of data in HAEDAT - the IOC-ICES-PICES Harmful Algal Event database, but also includes many other reports. At a qualitative level, the U.S. national HAB problem is far more extensive than was the case decades ago, with more toxic species and toxins to monitor, as well as a larger range of impacted resources and areas affected. Quantitatively, no significant trend is seen for paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) events over the study interval, though there is clear evidence of the expansion of the problem into new regions and the emergence of a species that produces PSTs in Florida – Pyrodinium bahamense. Amnesic shellfish toxin (AST) events have significantly increased in the U.S., with an overall pattern of frequent outbreaks on the West Coast, emerging, recurring outbreaks on the East Coast, and sporadic incidents in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the long historical record of neurotoxic shellfish toxin (NST) events, no significant trend is observed over the past 30 years. The recent emergence of diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) in the U.S. began along the Gulf Coast in 2008 and expanded to the West and East Coasts, though no significant trend through time is seen since then. Ciguatoxin (CTX) events caused by Gambierdiscus dinoflagellates have long impacted tropical and subtropical locations in the U.S., but due to a lack of monitoring programs as well as under-reporting of illnesses, data on these events are not available for time series analysis. Geographic expansion of Gambierdiscus into temperate and non-endemic areas (e.g., northern Gulf of Mexico) is apparent, and fostered by ocean warming. HAB-related marine wildlife morbidity and mortality events appear to be increasing, with statistically significant increasing trends observed in marine mammal poisonings caused by ASTs along the coast of California and NSTs in Florida. Since their first occurrence in 1985 in New York, brown tides resulting from high-density blooms of Aureococcus have spread south to Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, while those caused by Aureoumbra have spread from the Gulf Coast to the east coast of Florida. Blooms of Margalefidinium polykrikoides occurred in four locations in the U.S. from 1921–2001 but have appeared in more than 15 U.S. estuaries since then, with ocean warming implicated as a causative factor. Numerous blooms of toxic cyanobacteria have been documented in all 50 U.S. states and the transport of cyanotoxins from freshwater systems into marine coastal waters is a recently identified and potentially significant threat to public and ecosystem health. Taken together, there is a significant increasing trend in all HAB events in HAEDAT over the 30-year study interval. Part of this observed HAB expansion simply reflects a better realization of the true or historic scale of the problem, long obscured by inadequate monitoring. Other contributing factors include the dispersion of species to new areas, the discovery of new HAB poisoning syndromes or impacts, and the stimulatory effects of human activities like nutrient pollution, aquaculture expansion, and ocean warming, among others. One result of this multifaceted expansion is that many regions of the U.S. now face a daunting diversity of species and toxins, representing a significant and growing challenge to resource managers and public health officials in terms of toxins, regions, and time intervals to monitor, and necessitating new approaches to monitoring and management. Mobilization of funding and resources for research, monitoring and management of HABs requires accurate information on the scale and nature of the national problem. HAEDAT and other databases can be of great value in this regard but efforts are needed to expand and sustain the collection of data regionally and nationally.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing concern that accelerating environmental change attributed to human-induced warming of the planet may substantially alter the patterns, distribution and intensity of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Changes in temperature, ocean acidification, precipitation, nutrient stress or availability, and the physical structure of the water column all influence the productivity, composition, and global range of phytoplankton assemblages, but large uncertainty remains about how integration of these climate drivers might shape future HABs. Presented here are the collective deliberations from a symposium on HABs and climate change where the research challenges to understanding potential linkages between HABs and climate were considered, along with new research directions to better define these linkages. In addition to the likely effects of physical (temperature, salinity, stratification, light, changing storm intensity), chemical (nutrients, ocean acidification), and biological (grazer) drivers on microalgae (senso lato), symposium participants explored more broadly the subjects of cyanobacterial HABs, benthic HABs, HAB effects on fisheries, HAB modelling challenges, and the contributions that molecular approaches can bring to HAB studies. There was consensus that alongside traditional research, HAB scientists must set new courses of research and practices to deliver the conceptual and quantitative advances required to forecast future HAB trends. These different practices encompass laboratory and field studies, long-term observational programs, retrospectives, as well as the study of socioeconomic drivers and linkages with aquaculture and fisheries. In anticipation of growing HAB problems, research on potential mitigation strategies should be a priority. It is recommended that a substantial portion of HAB research among laboratories be directed collectively at a small sub-set of HAB species and questions in order to fast-track advances in our understanding. Climate-driven changes in coastal oceanographic and ecological systems are becoming substantial, in some cases exacerbated by localized human activities. That, combined with the slow pace of decreasing global carbon emissions, signals the urgency for HAB scientists to accelerate efforts across disciplines to provide society with the necessary insights regarding future HAB trends.",

    "abstract": "Toxin production by harmful cyanobacteria blooms (CyanoHABs) constitutes a major, worldwide environmental threat to freshwater aquatic resources that is expected to expand in scale and intensity with global climate change. Extensive literature exists on the most frequently encountered cyanotoxin, microcystin, in freshwater environments. Yet, the expansion of microcystin producing CyanoHABs and the transport of contaminated inland waters to estuarine and coastal marine waters has only recently received attention. This paper synthesizes information on the salinity tolerance of microcystin producing cyanobacteria and summarizes available case reports on microcystin presence in estuarine and coastal waters. We highlight a potential food-borne exposure route to humans by reviewing the growing body of evidence that shows microcystins can accumulate in coastal seafood. These cases reinforce the importance of freshwater nutrient reduction and the need for freshwater management efforts to look beyond lacustrine and riverine systems. Events reviewed here likely only represent a small proportion of cases where microcystins affect estuarine and coastal waters. We strongly suggest increased monitoring and research efforts to understand, react to, and prevent ecological and health problems associated with the growing problem of toxic CyanoHABs in coastal environments.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HAB) are recurrent phenomena in northern Europe along the coasts of the Baltic Sea, Kattegat-Skagerrak, eastern North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. These HABs have caused occasional massive losses for the aquaculture industry and have chronically affected socioeconomic interests in several ways. This status review gives an overview of historical HAB events and summarises reports to the Harmful Algae Event Database from 1986 to the end of year 2019 and observations made in long term monitoring programmes of potentially harmful phytoplankton and of phycotoxins in bivalve shellfish. Major HAB taxa causing fish mortalities in the region include blooms of the prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina leadbeateri in northern Norway in 1991 and 2019, resulting in huge economic losses for fish farmers. A bloom of the prymesiophyte Prymnesium polylepis (syn. Chrysochromulina polylepis) in the Kattegat-Skagerrak in 1988 was ecosystem disruptive. Blooms of the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis spp. have caused accumulations of foam on beaches in the southwestern North Sea and Wadden Sea coasts and shellfish mortality has been linked to their occurrence. Mortality of shellfish linked to HAB events has been observed in estuarine waters associated with influx of water from the southern North Sea. The first bloom of the dictyochophyte genus Pseudochattonella was observed in 1998, and since then such blooms have been observed in high cell densities in spring causing fish mortalities some years. Dinoflagellates, primarily Dinophysis spp., intermittently yield concentrations of Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DST) in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, above regulatory limits along the coasts of Norway, Denmark and the Swedish west coast. On average, DST levels in shellfish have decreased along the Swedish and Norwegian Skagerrak coasts since approximately 2006, coinciding with a decrease in the cell abundance of D. acuta. Among dinoflagellates, Alexandrium species are the major source of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST) in the region. PST concentrations above regulatory levels were rare in the Skagerrak-Kattegat during the three decadal review period, but frequent and often abundant findings of Alexandrium resting cysts in surface sediments indicate a high potential risk for blooms. PST levels often above regulatory limits along the west coast of Norway are associated with A. catenella (ribotype Group 1) as the main toxin producer. Other Alexandrium species, such as A. ostenfeldii and A. minutum, are capable of producing PST among some populations but are usually not associated with PSP events in the region. The cell abundance of A. pseudogonyaulax, a producer of the ichthyotoxin goniodomin (GD), has increased in the Skagerrak-Kattegat since 2010, and may constitute an emerging threat. The dinoflagellate Azadinium spp. have been unequivocally linked to the presence of azaspiracid toxins (AZT) responsible for Azaspiracid Shellfish Poisoning (AZP) in northern Europe. These toxins were detected in bivalve shellfish at concentrations above regulatory limits for the first time in Norway in blue mussels in 2005 and in Sweden in blue mussels and oysters (Ostrea edulis and Crassostrea gigas) in 2018. Certain members of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia produce the neurotoxin domoic acid and analogs known as Amnesic Shellfish Toxins (AST). Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia were common in the North Sea and the Skagerrak-Kattegat, but levels of AST in bivalve shellfish were rarely above regulatory limits during the review period. Summer cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea are a concern mainly for tourism by causing massive fouling of bathing water and beaches. Some of the cyanobacteria produce toxins, e.g. Nodularia spumigena, producer of nodularin, which may be a human health problem and cause occasional dog mortalities. Coastal and shelf sea regions in northern Europe provide a key supply of seafood, socioeconomic well-being and ecosystem services. Increasing anthropogenic influence and climate change create environmental stressors causing shifts in the biogeography and intensity of HABs. Continued monitoring of HAB and phycotoxins and the operation of historical databases such as HAEDAT provide not only an ongoing status report but also provide a way to interpret causes and mechanisms of HABs.",

    "abstract": "Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 results in higher equilibrium concentrations of dissolved CO2 in natural waters, with corresponding increases in hydrogen ion and bicarbonate concentrations and decreases in hydroxyl ion and carbonate concentrations. Superimposed on these climate change effects is the dynamic nature of carbon cycling in coastal zones, which can lead to seasonal and diel changes in pH and CO2 concentrations that can exceed changes expected for open ocean ecosystems by the end of the century. Among harmful algae, i.e. some species and/or strains of Cyanobacteria, Dinophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, and Ulvophyceae, the occurrence of a CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) is the most frequent mechanism of inorganic carbon acquisition in natural waters in equilibrium with the present atmosphere (400 μmol CO2 mol−1 total gas), with varying phenotypic modification of the CCM. No data on CCMs are available for Raphidophyceae or the brown tide Pelagophyceae. Several HAB species and/or strains respond to increased CO2 concentrations with increases in growth rate and/or cellular toxin content, however, others are unaffected. Beyond the effects of altered C concentrations and speciation on HABs, changes in pH in natural waters are likely to have profound effects on algal physiology. This review outlines the implications of changes in inorganic cycling for HABs in coastal zones, and reviews the knowns and unknowns with regard to how HABs can be expected to ocean acidification. We further point to the large regions of uncertainty with regard to this evolving field.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms present substantial challenges to managers and threaten ecological and public health. Although the majority of cyanobacterial bloom research and management focuses on factors that control bloom initiation, duration, toxicity, and geographical extent, relatively little research focuses on the role of loss processes in blooms and how these processes are regulated. Here, we define a loss process in terms of population dynamics as any process that removes cells from a population, thereby decelerating or reducing the development and extent of blooms. We review abiotic (e.g., hydraulic flushing and oxidative stress/UV light) and biotic factors (e.g., allelopathic compounds, infections, grazing, and resting cells/programmed cell death) known to govern bloom loss. We found that the dominant loss processes depend on several system specific factors including cyanobacterial genera-specific traits, in situ physicochemical conditions, and the microbial, phytoplankton, and consumer community composition. We also address loss processes in the context of bloom management and discuss perspectives and challenges in predicting how a changing climate may directly and indirectly affect loss processes on blooms. A deeper understanding of bloom loss processes and their underlying mechanisms may help to mitigate the negative consequences of cyanobacterial blooms and improve current management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Excess nutrient loading often promotes harmful algal blooms. Despite many past studies, few algal bloom control methods show clear, long-term improvements in water quality. For example, chemical treatments are often used to control algal blooms because they can cause large, rapid declines in algal abundance. However, these effects are often transient requiring future treatments that increase costs and risks to water quality. Moreover, empirical tests of repeated applications or combinations of different treatments are rare, even with their common use across industries, like aquaculture and drinking water. To rigorously test the effects of single or combined treatments on water quality in a eutrophic aquaculture pond, copper sulfate pentahydrate (henceforth called copper) and Phoslock were used independently (full dose) or combined (each at half dose) in a 56-day field experiment conducted in a hypereutrophic aquaculture pond. The two copper-containing treatments caused rapid declines (-83%) in algal abundance the day after treatment followed by very large (2,617%) increases after another five days. In contrast, zooplankton were reduced by 43% in the copper treatment but minimally affected (+1%) by the combined treatment the day after application. To further show that copper treatment is the mechanism responsible for the negative effects on zooplankton and phytoplankton, half of the mesocosms for all four treatments were treated with a full dose of copper on day 13 and similar effects on phytoplankton were observed as when copper was initially applied. The combined treatment was more effective at controlling phytoplankton than the copper only treatment, in part, because of lesser negative effects on zooplankton. Overall, this experiment further highlights the long-term, negative effects that chemical treatments, like copper, have on non-target taxa, such as beneficial zooplankton, which limits their potential for ecological and sustainable control of harmful algal blooms.",

    "abstract": "Red tides – discolorations of the sea surface due to dense plankton blooms – occur regularly in coastal and offshore waters along much of the world's coastline. Red tides often cause large-scale mortalities of fish and shellfish and significant losses to the aquaculture and tourist industries of many countries. Therefore, understanding and predicting the mechanisms controlling the outbreak, persistence, spread, and decline of red tides are important concerns to scientists, officials, industry, and the public. With increasing knowledge of red-tide species and red-tide events, new mechanisms have been discovered. Based on the nutrition and behaviors of red-tide organisms and biological interactions among them, red-tide outbreaks can be categorized into a hierarchy of four generation mechanisms (GM1–GM4). In the simplest, GM1, all phototrophic red-tide species were treated as exclusively autotrophic organisms without the ability to swim. However, this GM cannot explain red-tide outbreaks in oligotrophic surface waters offshore. Vertical migration (considered in GM2) and mixotrophy (GM3) enable red-tide flagellates to acquire growth factors from nutrient-rich deep waters or co-occurring prey, respectively. In natural environments, all red tides occur by those species outgrowing co-occurring organisms; red-tide species dominate communities by eliminating other species or reducing their abundances. Thus, GM4 contains the direct biological interactions (i.e., inhibition by physical contact or chemical effects) and indirect biological interactions (i.e., acquiring resources faster than others) that can affect the dominance of red-tide species under given conditions. Correctly choosing one of these four GMs for red tides dominated by one causative species is important because the accuracy of predictions may be outweighed by the costs and time required to acquire the relevant information. In this study, mechanisms describing the outbreak, persistence, and decline of red tides were reviewed, the advantages and limitations of each mechanism were evaluated, and insights about the evolution of the mechanisms were developed.",

    "abstract": "Microcystis and Anabaena (Dolichospermum) are among the most toxic cyanobacterial genera and often succeed each other during harmful algal blooms. The role allelopathy plays in the succession of these genera is not fully understood. The allelopathic interactions of six strains of Microcystis and Anabaena under different nutrient conditions in co-culture and in culture-filtrate experiments were investigated. Microcystis strains significantly reduced the growth of Anabaena strains in mixed cultures with direct cell-to-cell contact and high nutrient levels. Cell-free filtrate from Microcystis cultures proved equally potent in suppressing the growth of nutrient replete Anabaena cultures while also significantly reducing anatoxin-a production. Allelopathic interactions between Microcystis and Anabaena were, however, partly dependent on ambient nutrient levels. Anabaena dominated under low N conditions and Microcystis dominated under nutrient replete and low P during which allelochemicals caused the complete suppression of nitrogen fixation by Anabaena and stimulated glutathione S-transferase activity. The microcystin content of Microcystis was lowered with decreasing N and the presence of Anabaena decreased it further under low P and high nutrient conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that strong allelopathic interactions between Microcystis and Anabaena are closely intertwined with the availability of nutrients and that allelopathy may contribute to the succession, nitrogen availability, and toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms.",

    "abstract": "Sea surface temperatures in the world's oceans are projected to warm by 0.4–1.4 °C by mid twenty-first century causing many tropical and sub-tropical harmful dinoflagellate genera like Gambierdiscus, Fukuyoa and Ostreopsis (benthic harmful algal bloom species, BHABs) to exhibit higher growth rates over much of their current geographic range, resulting in higher population densities. The primary exception to this trend will be in the tropics where temperatures exceed species-specific upper thermal tolerances (30–31 °C) beyond which growth slows significantly. As surface waters warm, migration to deeper habitats is expected to provide refuge. Range extensions of several degrees of latitude also are anticipated, but only where species-specific habitat requirements can be met (e.g., temperature, suitable substrate, low turbulence, light, salinity, pH). The current understanding of habitat requirements that determine species distributions are reviewed to provide fuller understanding of how individual species will respond to climate change from the present to 2055 while addressing the paucity of information on environmental factors controlling small-scale distribution in localized habitats. Based on the available information, we hypothesized how complex environmental interactions can influence abundance and potential range extensions of BHAB species in different biogeographic regions and identify sentinel sites appropriate for long-term monitoring programs to detect range extensions and reduce human health risks.",

    "abstract": "Bloom-forming cyanobacteria Planktothrix agardhii and P. rubescens are regularly involved in the occurrence of cyanotoxin in lakes and reservoirs. Besides microcystins (MCs), which inhibit eukaryotic protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, several families of bioactive peptides are produced, thereby resulting in impressive secondary metabolite structural diversity. This review will focus on the current knowledge of the phylogeny, morphology, and ecophysiological adaptations of Planktothrix as well as the toxins and bioactive peptides produced. The relatively well studied ecophysiological adaptations (buoyancy, shade tolerance, nutrient storage capacity) can partly explain the invasiveness of this group of cyanobacteria that bloom within short periods (weeks to months). The more recent elucidation of the genetic basis of toxin and bioactive peptide synthesis paved the way for investigating its regulation both in the laboratory using cell cultures as well as under field conditions. The high frequency of several toxin and bioactive peptide synthesis genes observed within P. agardhii and P. rubescens, but not for other Planktothrix species (e.g. P. pseudagardhii), suggests a potential functional linkage between bioactive peptide production and the colonization potential and possible dominance in habitats. It is hypothesized that, through toxin and bioactive peptide production, Planktothrix act as a niche constructor at the ecosystem scale, possibly resulting in an even higher ability to monopolize resources, positive feedback loops, and resilience under stable environmental conditions. Thus, refocusing harmful algal bloom management by integrating ecological and phylogenetic factors acting on toxin and bioactive peptide synthesis gene distribution and concentrations could increase the predictability of the risks originating from Planktothrix blooms.",

    "abstract": "The increased frequency and intensity of drought with climate change may cause an increase in the magnitude and toxicity of freshwater cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CHABs), including Microcystis blooms, in San Francisco Estuary, California. As the fourth driest year on record in San Francisco Estuary, the 2014 drought provided an opportunity to directly test the impact of severe drought on cyanobacteria blooms in SFE. A field sampling program was conducted between July and December 2014 to sample a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables at 10 stations in the freshwater and brackish reaches of the estuary. The 2014 Microcystis bloom had the highest biomass and toxin concentration, earliest initiation, and the longest duration, since the blooms began in 1999. Median chlorophyll a concentration increased by 9 and 12 times over previous dry and wet years, respectively. Total microcystin concentration also exceeded that in previous dry and wet years by a factor of 11 and 65, respectively. Cell abundance determined by quantitative PCR indicated the bloom contained multiple potentially toxic cyanobacteria species, toxic Microcystis and relatively high total cyanobacteria abundance. The bloom was associated with extreme nutrient concentrations, including a 20-year high in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and low to below detection levels of ammonium. Stable isotope analysis suggested the bloom varied with both inorganic and organic nutrient concentration, and used ammonium as the primary nitrogen source. Water temperature was a primary controlling factor for the bloom and was positively correlated with the increase in both total and toxic Microcystis abundance. In addition, the early initiation and persistence of warm water temperature coincided with the increased intensity and duration of the Microcystis bloom from the usual 3 to 4 months to 8 months. Long residence time was also a primary factor controlling the magnitude and persistence of the bloom, and was created by a 66% to 85% reduction in both the water inflow and diversion of water for agriculture during the summer. We concluded that severe drought conditions can lead to a significant increase in the abundance of Microcystis and other cyanobacteria, as well as their associated toxins.",

The objective of this scoping review was to use an established methodology and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting framework to map the evidence for associations between marine HABs and observed both acute and chronic human health effects. A systematic and reproducible search of publications from 1985 until May 2019 was conducted using diverse electronic databases. Following de-duplication, 5301 records were identified, of which 380 were included in the final qualitative synthesis. The majority of studies (220; 57.9%) related to Ciguatera Poisoning. Anecdotal and case reports made up the vast majority of study types (242; 63.7%), whereas there were fewer formal epidemiological studies (35; 9.2%). Only four studies related to chronic exposure to HABs. A low proportion of studies reported the use of human specimens for confirmation of the cause of illness (32; 8.4%). This study highlighted gaps in the evidence base including a lack of formal surveillance and epidemiological studies, limited use of toxin measurements in human samples, and a scarcity of studies of chronic exposure. Future research and policy should provide a baseline understanding of the burden of human disease to inform the evaluation of the current and future impacts of climate change and HABs on human health.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHAB) are thought to be increasing globally over the past few decades, but relatively little quantitative information is available about the spatial extent of blooms. Satellite remote sensing provides a potential technology for identifying cyanoHABs in multiple water bodies and across geo-political boundaries. An assessment method was developed using MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery to quantify cyanoHAB surface area extent, transferable to different spatial areas, in Florida, Ohio, and California for the test period of 2008 to 2012. Temporal assessment was used to evaluate changes in satellite resolvable inland waterbodies for each state of interest. To further assess cyanoHAB risk within the states, the World Health Organization's (WHO) recreational guidance level thresholds were used to categorize surface area of cyanoHABs into three risk categories: low, moderate, and high-risk bloom area. Results showed that in Florida, the area of cyanoHABs increased largely due to observed increases in high-risk bloom area. California exhibited a slight decrease in cyanoHAB extent, primarily attributed to decreases in Northern California. In Ohio (excluding Lake Erie), little change in cyanoHAB surface area was observed. This study uses satellite remote sensing to quantify changes in inland cyanoHAB surface area across numerous water bodies within an entire state. The temporal assessment method developed here will be relevant into the future as it is transferable to the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3A/3B missions.",

    "abstract": "Fjordic coastlines provide sheltered locations for finfish and shellfish aquaculture, and are often subject to harmful algal blooms (HABs) some of which develop offshore and are then advected to impact nearshore aquaculture. Numerical models are a potentially important tool for providing early warning of such HAB events. However, the complex topography of fjordic shelf regions is a significant challenge to modelling. This is frequently compounded by complex bathymetry and local weather patterns. Existing structured grid models do not provide the resolution needed to represent these coastlines in their wider shelf context. In a number of locations advectively transported blooms of the ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi are of particular concern for the finfish industry. Here were present a novel hydrodynamic model of the coastal waters to the west of Scotland that is based on unstructured finite volume methodology, providing a sufficiently high resolution hydrodynamical structure to realistically simulate the transport of particles (such as K. mikimotoi cells) within nearshore waters where aquaculture sites are sited. Model–observation comparisons reveal close correspondence of tidal elevations for major semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents. The thermohaline structure of the model and its current fields are also in good agreement with a number of existing observational datasets. Simulations of the transport of Lagrangian drifting buoys, along with the incorporation of an individual-based biological model, based on a bloom of K. mikimotoi, demonstrate that unstructured grid models have considerable potential for HAB prediction in Scotland and in complex topographical regions elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "This review summarizes current knowledge on mechanical (artificial mixing, hypolimnetic aeration, dredging, and sonication) and biological (biomanipulation, macrophytes, and straws) methods for the management of cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water sources. Emphasis has been given to (i) the mechanism of cyanobacterial control, (ii) successful and unsuccessful case studies, and (iii) factors influencing successful implementation. Most mechanical and biological control strategies offer long-term control. However, their application can be cost-prohibitive and treatment efficacy is influenced by source water geometry and continual nutrient inputs from external sources. When artificial mixing and hypolimnetic oxygenation units are optimized based on source water characteristics, observed water quality benefits included increased dissolved oxygen contents, reduced internal loading of nutrients, and lower concentrations of reduced ions . Treatment efficacy during oxygenation and aeration was derailed by excessive sedimentation of organic matter and sediment characteristics such as low Fe/P ratios. Dredging is beneficial for contaminated sediment removal, but it is too costly to be a practical bloom control strategy for most systems. Sonication control methods have contradictory findings requiring further research to evaluate the efficacy and applicability for field-scale control of cyanobacteria. Biological control methods such as biomanipulation offer long-term treatment benefits; however, investigations on the mechanisms of field-scale cyanobacterial control are still limited, particularly with the use of macrophytes and straws. Each control method has site-specific strengths, limitations, and ecological impacts. Reduction of external nutrient inputs should still be a significant focus of restoration efforts as treatment benefits from mechanical and biological control were commonly offset by continued nutrient inputs.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms produce nuisance metabolites (e.g., cyanotoxins and T&O compounds) thereby posing water quality management issues for aquatic sources used for potable water production, aquaculture, and recreation. A variety of in-lake/reservoir control measures are implemented to reduce the abundance of nuisance cyanobacteria biomass or decrease the amount of available phosphorous (P). This paper critically reviews the chemical control strategies implemented for in-lake/reservoir management of cyanobacterial blooms, i.e., algaecides and nutrient sequestering coagulants/flocculants, by highlighting (i) their mode of action, (ii) cases of successful and unsuccessful treatment, (iii) and factors influencing performance (e.g., water quality, process control techniques, source water characteristics, etc.). Algaecides generally result in immediate improvements in water quality and offer selective cyanobacterial control when peroxide-based alagecides are used. However, they have a range of limitations: causing cell lysis and release of cyanotoxins, posing negative impacts on aquatic plants and animals, leaving behind environmentally relevant treatment residuals (e.g., Cu in water and sediments), and offering only short-term bloom control characterized by cyanobacterial rebound. Coagulants/flocculants (alum, iron, calcium, and lanthanum bentonite) offer long-term internal nutrient control when external nutrient loading is controlled. Treatment performance is often influenced by background water quality conditions, and source water characteristics (e.g., surface area, depth, mixing regimes, and residence time). The reviewed case studies highlight that external nutrient load reduction is the most fundamental aspect of cyanobacterial control. None of the reviewed control strategies provide a comprehensive solution to cyanobacterial blooms.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on economies, public health, ecosystems, and aquaculture across the globe have all increased in recent decades, and this has been acutely the case in China. Here, we review the history of HABs and HABs research in China, as well as recent trends in HABs and future prospects of HAB science in China. The most updated analyses demonstrated that the number of HAB events, the number of HAB species, the aerial coverage of HABs, and the impacts of HABs in Chinese waters during the 21st century were all higher than that during the last two decades of the 20th century. The increase in the number of HABs in China has been significantly correlated with the increased discharge of ammonium and total phosphorus into coastal waters (p < 0.01 for both). Notable newly recognized events this century have included chronic HABs caused by Prorocentrum donghaiense and Karenia mikimotoi, a paralytic shellfish poisoning event caused by Gymnodinium catenatum that sickened 80 people, brown tides caused by Aureococcus anophagefferens, green tides caused by Ulva prolifera, golden tides caused by Sargassum horneri, and the disruption of a nuclear power plant caused by a bloom of Phaeocystis globosa. A series of key discoveries regarding HABs has been made this century including documentation of nearly all known HAB toxins in Chinese waters, discovery of novel cyst-formation and/or life stages of multiple HABs-causing species, identification of the chemical and physical oceanographic drivers of multiple HABs including those formed by P. donghaiense, K. mikimotoi, and U. prolifera, and the successful mitigation of HABs via the use of modified clay approaches. Future research prospects highlighted include the use of macroalgae as a means to prevent, mitigate, and control (PCM) HABs and the process by which multi-disciplinary studies involving molecular approaches (omics), remote in situ detection, artificial intelligence, and mega-data analyses might be used to develop refined and realistic HAB forecasting platforms. Collectively, this review demonstrates the significant evolution of HAB science since the 20th century in China and demonstrates that while HABs in China are complex and widespread, recent and on-going discoveries make the development of detailed understanding and effective measures to mitigate the negative effects of HABs a hopeful outcome in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying the species present in an ecosystem is vital to lake managers and successful bioassessment programs. This is particularly important when monitoring cyanobacteria, as numerous taxa produce toxins and can have major negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Increasingly, DNA-based techniques such as metabarcoding are being used for measuring aquatic biodiversity, as they could accelerate processing time, decrease costs and reduce some of the biases associated with traditional light microscopy. Despite the continuing use of traditional microscopy and the growing use of DNA metabarcoding to identify cyanobacteria assemblages, methodological comparisons between the two approaches have rarely been reported from a wide suite of lake types. Here, we compare planktonic cyanobacteria assemblages generated by inverted light microscopy and DNA metabarcoding from a 379-lake dataset spanning a longitudinal and trophic gradient. We found moderate levels of congruence between methods at the broadest taxonomic levels (i.e., Order, RV=0.40, p < 0.0001). This comparison revealed distinct cyanobacteria communities from lakes of different trophic states, with Microcystis, Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum dominating with both methods in eutrophic and hypereutrophic sites. This finding supports the use of either method when monitoring eutrophication in lake surface waters. The biggest difference between the two methods was the detection of picocyanobacteria, which are typically underestimated by light microscopy. This reveals that the communities generated by each method currently are complementary as opposed to identical and promotes a combined-method strategy when monitoring a range of trophic systems. For example, microscopy can provide measures of cyanobacteria biomass, which are critical data in managing lakes. Going forward, we believe that molecular genetic methods will be increasingly adopted as reference databases are routinely updated with more representative sequences and will improve as cyanobacteria taxonomy is resolved with the increase in available genetic information.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms have serious adverse effects on human and environmental health. In Latin America, one of the main world's freshwater reserves, information on this phenomenon remains sparse. To assess the current situation, we gathered reports of cyanobacterial blooms and associated cyanotoxins in freshwater bodies from South America and the Caribbean (Latitude 22° N to 45° S) and compiled the regulation and monitoring procedures implemented in each country. As the operational definition of what is a cyanobacterial bloom remains controversial, we also analyzed the criteria used to determine the phenomena in the region. From 2000 to 2019, blooms were reported in 295 water bodies distributed in 14 countries, including shallow and deep lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. Cyanotoxins were found in nine countries and high concentrations of microcystins were reported in all types of water bodies. Blooms were defined according to different, and sometimes arbitrary criteria including qualitative (changes in water color, scum presence), quantitative (abundance), or both. We found 13 different cell abundance thresholds defining bloom events, from 2 × 103 to 1 × 107 cells mL−1. The use of different criteria hampers the estimation of bloom occurrence, and consequently the associated risks and economic impacts. The large differences between countries in terms of number of studies, monitoring efforts, public access to the data and regulations regarding cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins highlights the need to rethink cyanobacterial bloom monitoring, seeking common criteria. General policies leading to solid frameworks based on defined criteria are needed to improve the assessment of cyanobacterial blooms in Latin America. This review represents a starting point toward common approaches for cyanobacterial monitoring and risk assessment, needed to improve regional environmental policies.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms produce many toxic secondary metabolites called cyanotoxins. The most studied group of cyanotoxins are microcystins (MC), with over 300 congeners reported. MC-LR is the most studied congener because of its abundance and toxicity. Recent toxicology studies suggest that more hydrophobic MC congeners such as MC-LA, MC-LF, and MC-LW may be less abundant but up to seven times more toxic than MC-LR, whereas, MC-RR's toxicity is only one-fifth that of MC-LR. Hence, understanding the environmental stressors that change the MC congener profile is critical to assessing the negative impact on environmental and human health. A two-year field and experimental study investigated seasonal and spatial changes of MC congener profiles in the western basin of Lake Erie. Both studies showed that nitrogen enrichment favored the production of nitrogen-rich MC-RR (C49H75N13O12). The field study showed that nitrogen depletion favored the low-nitrogen MC-LA (C46H67N7O12). MC-LR (a medium N level, C49H75N10O12) accounted for ∼30% to 50% of the total MC concentration and was stable across nitrogen concentrations. Using the relative toxicity and concentrations of each MC congener, both LC-MS/MS and ELISA overestimated the toxicity early bloom (July) and underestimated it late bloom (September). On 24 July 2019, highly toxic MC-LW and MC-LF were detected at nearshore stations with relative toxicity exceeding drinking water standards. This study demonstrated that the less toxic, high nitrogen MC-RR dominated under nitrogen-replete conditions in the early season, whereas the more toxic, less nitrogen MC-LA dominated under nitrogen-limited conditions later in the season.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of freshwater harmful algal bloom toxins impacting the coastal ocean is an emerging threat, and the potential for invertebrate prey items to concentrate toxin and cause harm to human and wildlife consumers is not yet fully recognized. We examined toxin uptake and release in marine mussels for both particulate and dissolved phases of the hepatotoxin microcystin, produced by the freshwater cyanobacterial genus Microcystis. We also extended our experimental investigation of particulate toxin to include oysters (Crassostrea sp.) grown commercially for aquaculture. California mussels (Mytilus californianus) and oysters were exposed to Microcystis and microcystin toxin for 24h at varying concentrations, and then were placed in constantly flowing seawater and sampled through time simulating riverine flushing events to the coastal ocean. Mussels exposed to particulate microcystin purged the toxin slowly, with toxin detectable for at least 8 weeks post-exposure and maximum toxin of 39.11ng/g after exposure to 26.65μg/L microcystins. Dissolved toxin was also taken up by California mussels, with maximum concentrations of 20.74ng/g after exposure to 7.74μg/L microcystin, but was purged more rapidly. Oysters also took up particulate toxin but purged it more quickly than mussels. Additionally, naturally occurring marine mussels collected from San Francisco Bay tested positive for high levels of microcystin toxin. These results suggest that ephemeral discharge of Microcystis or microcystin to estuaries and the coastal ocean accumulate in higher trophic levels for weeks to months following exposure.",

    "abstract": "Dinophysis acuta is a frequent seasonal lipophilic toxin producer in European Atlantic coastal waters associated with thermal stratification. In the Galician Rías, populations of D. acuta with their epicentre located off Aveiro (northern Portugal), typically co-occur with and follow those of Dinophysis acuminata during the upwelling transition (early autumn) as a result of longshore transport. During hotter than average summers, D. acuta blooms also occur in August in the Rías, when they replace D. acuminata. Here we examined a 30-year (1985–2014) time series of D. acuta from samples collected by the same method in the Galician Rías. Our main objective was to identify patterns of distribution and their relation with climate variability, and to explain the exceptional summer blooms of D. acuta in 1989–1990. A dome-shaped relationship was found between summer upwelling intensity and D. acuta blooms; cell maxima were associated with conditions where the balance between upwelling intensity and heating, leading to deepened thermoclines, combined with tidal phase (3 days after neap tides) created windows of opportunity for this species. The application of a generalized additive model based on biological (D. acuta inoculum) and environmental predictors (Cumulative June–August upwelling CUIJJA, average June–August SSTJJA and tidal range) explained more than 70% of the deviance for the exceptional summer blooms of D. acuta, through a combination of moderate (35,000–50,000 m3 s−1 km−1) summer upwelling (CUIJJA), thermal stratification (SSTJJA > 17 °C) and moderate tidal range (∼2.5 m), provided D. acuta cells (inoculum) were present in July. There was no evidence of increasing trends in D. acuta bloom frequency/intensity nor a clear relationship with NAO or other long-term climatic cycles. Instead, the exceptional summer blooms of 1989–1990 appeared linked to extreme hydroclimatic anomalies (high positive anomalies in SST and NAO index), which affected most of the European Atlantic coast.",

    "abstract": "Blooms of toxin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa occur regularly in freshwater systems throughout California, but until recently potential impacts in the coastal ocean have been largely ignored. Twenty-one sites in and around Monterey Bay were surveyed for evidence of microcystin toxin (2010–2011) at the land–sea interface. Following this initial survey four major watersheds in the Monterey Bay area were surveyed (2011–2013) for microcystin concentration, nutrients, alkalinity and water temperature to identify potential environmental factors correlated with the abundance of microcystin at the land–sea interface. During the first year microcystin was detected in 15 of 21 sites. Data from years two and three were analyzed by principal components analysis and mixed effects model. Results indicated that coastal nutrient loading (nitrate, phosphate silicate, ammonium, urea), were statistically significant predictors of the microcystin concentrations in the watersheds with clear evidence for seasonality at some sites. Microcystin was frequently at highest concentration in the autumn; however, at some locations high levels of toxin were measured during spring. Because this toxin has the ability to biomagnify and persist within food webs, elevated levels within the watershed may decrease potential for health and survival of wildlife and humans exposed to freshwater and marine waters. The widespread occurrence of microcystin at low to moderate levels throughout the year and throughout the sampled watersheds demonstrates the potential difficulty for management.",

    "abstract": "San Francisco Bay (SFB) is a eutrophic estuary that harbors both freshwater and marine toxigenic organisms that are responsible for harmful algal blooms. While there are few commercial fishery harvests within SFB, recreational and subsistence harvesting for shellfish is common. Coastal shellfish are monitored for domoic acid and paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), but within SFB there is no routine monitoring for either toxin. Dinophysis shellfish toxins (DSTs) and freshwater microcystins are also present within SFB, but not routinely monitored. Acute exposure to any of these toxin groups has severe consequences for marine organisms and humans, but chronic exposure to sub-lethal doses, or synergistic effects from multiple toxins, are poorly understood and rarely addressed. This study documents the occurrence of domoic acid and microcystins in SFB from 2011 to 2016, and identifies domoic acid, microcystins, DSTs, and PSTs in marine mussels within SFB in 2012, 2014, and 2015. At least one toxin was detected in 99% of mussel samples, and all four toxin suites were identified in 37% of mussels. The presence of these toxins in marine mussels indicates that wildlife and humans who consume them are exposed to toxins at both sub-lethal and acute levels. As such, there are potential deleterious impacts for marine organisms and humans and these effects are unlikely to be documented. These results demonstrate the need for regular monitoring of marine and freshwater toxins in SFB, and suggest that co-occurrence of multiple toxins is a potential threat in other ecosystems where freshwater and seawater mix.",

    "abstract": "Almost every summer, dense blooms of filamentous cyanobacteria are formed in the Baltic Sea. These blooms may cause problems for tourism and ecosystem services, where surface accumulations and beach fouling are commonly occurring. Future changes in environmental drivers, including climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances, may further enhance these problems. By compiling monitoring data from countries adjacent to the Baltic Sea, we present spatial and temporal genus-specific distribution of diazotrophic filamentous cyanobacteria (Nostocales) during four decades (1979-2017). While the summer surface salinity decreased with a half up to one unit, the surface temperature in July-August increased with 2-3 °C in most sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, during the time period. The biovolumes of the toxic Nodularia spumigena did not change in any of the sub-basins during the period. On the other hand, the biovolume of the non-toxic Aphanizomenon sp. and the potentially toxic Dolichospermum spp. increased in the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, along with the decreased salinity and elevated temperatures, but Aphanizomenon sp. decreased in the southern parts despite decreased salinity and increased temperatures. These contradictory changes in biovolume of Aphanizomenon sp. between the northern and southern parts of the Baltic Sea may be due to basin-specific effects of the changed environmental conditions, or can be related to local adaptation by sub-populations of the genera. Overall, this comprehensive dataset presents insights to genus-specific bloom dynamics by potentially harmful diazotrophic filamentous cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea.",

    "abstract": "Harmful blooms formed by planktonic microalgae (HABs) in both freshwater and coastal waters regularly lead to severe mortalities of fish and invertebrates causing substantial economic losses of marine products worldwide. The mixotrophic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum is one of the most important microalgae associated with fish kills. Here 26 strains of P. parvum with a wide geographical distribution were screened for the production of prymnesins, the suspected causative allelochemical toxins. All investigated strains produced prymnesins, indicating that the toxins play an important role for the organism. The prymnesins can be classified into three types based on the length of the carbon backbone of the compound and each algal strain produced only one of these types. Biogeographical mapping of the prymnesin distribution indicated a global distribution of each type. In addition, phylogenetic analyses based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences revealed monophyletic origin of all prymnesin types and clades could therefore be defined based on the toxic compound. It might be that evolution of new species within the P. parvum species complex is driven by changes in toxin type or that they are a result of it. Such a correlation between chemotype and phylotype has never been documented before for a harmful microalga. Chemotaxonomy and ITS-type classification may thus be used to further delimit the P. parvum species complex.",

    "abstract": "In the present study the geographical distribution, abundance and composition of Gambierdiscus was described over a 600 km longitudinal scale in the Canary Islands. Samples for cell counts, isolation and identification of Gambierdiscus were obtained from five islands (El Hierro, Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote). Average densities of Gambierdiscus spp. between 0 and 2200 cells g−1 blot dry weight of macrophyte were recorded. Morphological (light microscopy and SEM techniques) and molecular analyses (LSU and SSU rDNA sequencing of cultures and single cells from the field) of Gambierdiscus was performed. Five Gambierdiscus species (G. australes, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. excentricus and G. silvae), together with a new putative species (Gambierdiscus ribotype 3) were identified. These results suggest that some cases of CFP in the region could be associated with the accumulation of ciguatoxins in the marine food web acquired from local populations of Gambierdiscus. This unexpected high diversity of Gambierdiscus species in an area which a priori is not under risk of ciguatera, hints at an ancient settlement of Gambierdiscus populations, likely favored by warmer climate conditions in the Miocene Epoch (when oldest current Canary Islands were created), in contrast with cooler present ones. Currently, warming trends associated with climate change could contribute to extend favorable environmental conditions in the area for Gambierdiscus growth especially during winter months.",

    "abstract": "The 2015 U.S. West Coast domoic acid event was caused by a massive harmful algal bloom (HAB) that consisted mostly of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia australis. It was unprecedented in its toxicity and geographic extent and resulted in extended and widespread closures of the lucrative commercial Dungeness crab and popular recreational razor clam fisheries. The fishery closures led to federal fisheries disaster declarations and generated an economic shock for coastal communities that depend on access to these marine resources. This study reports on the socioeconomic impacts of the 2015 HAB across 16 fishing communities on the U.S. West Coast using primary survey data. The survey instrument, deployed in the summer of 2017, collected information on sociodemographic and economic factors hypothesized to confer resilience or vulnerability to HABs, data quantifying individual impacts, and the coping and adaptive actions taken by individuals to deal with the event. The vast majority of survey participants (84%) were negatively impacted by the 2015 HAB, but individuals employed in fishing-related occupations experienced greater financial, emotional, and sociocultural impacts than those employed in other sectors. Further, those employed in fishing-related occupations were less likely to recover financial losses suffered as a result of the event. This study identifies the pathways through which HABs affect fishery-dependent and fishery-associated sectors of U.S. West Coast communities. The understanding gained can help inform efforts to prepare for future HABs, mitigate their socioeconomic impacts, and aid recovery.",

    "abstract": "The toxic diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia is a growing presence in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), where regionally unprecedented levels of domoic acid (DA) in 2016 led to the first Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning closures in the region. However, factors driving GOM Pseudo-nitzschia dynamics, DA concentrations, and the 2016 event are unclear. Water samples were collected at the surface and at depth in offshore transects in summer 2012, 2014, and 2015, and fall 2016, and a weekly time series of surface water samples was collected in 2013. Temperature and salinity data were obtained from NERACOOS buoys and measurements during sample collection. Samples were processed for particulate DA (pDA), dissolved nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, silicic acid, and phosphate), and cellular abundance. Species composition was estimated via Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), a semi-quantitative DNA finger-printing tool. Pseudo-nitzschia biogeography was consistent in the years 2012, 2014, and 2015, with greater Pseudo-nitzschia cell abundance and P. plurisecta dominance in low-salinity inshore samples, and lower Pseudo-nitzschia cell abundance and P. delicatissima and P. seriata dominance in high-salinity offshore samples. During the 2016 event, pDA concentrations were an order of magnitude higher than in previous years, and inshore-offshore contrasts in biogeography were weak, with P. australis present in every sample. Patterns in temporal and spatial variability confirm that pDA increases with the abundance and the cellular DA of Pseudo-nitzschia species, but was not correlated with any one environmental factor. The greater pDA in 2016 was caused by P. australis - the observation of which is unprecedented in the region - and may have been exacerbated by low residual silicic acid. The novel presence of P. australis may be due to local growth conditions, the introduction of a population with an anomalous water mass, or both factors. A definitive cause of the 2016 bloom remains unknown, and continued DA monitoring in the GOM is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms responsible for mass mortalities of marine organisms have been rare in Hokkaido, northern Japan, although fish-killing blooms have been frequently reported from western Japanese coasts. In September-November 2021, a huge and prolonged cold-water bloom occurred along the Pacific coast of eastern Hokkaido, and was associated with intensive mortalities of sea urchin, fish, octopus, shellfish, etc. In this study, morphology and phylogeny of the dominant and co-occurring unarmored dinoflagellates of the Kareniaceae in the bloom were examined by using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and molecular phylogeny inferred from ITS and LSU rDNA (D1-D3) sequences. Morphological observation and molecular phylogeny showed that the dominant species was Karenia selliformis, with co-occurrences of other kareniacean dinoflagellates, Kr. longicanalis, Kr. mikimotoi, Karlodinium sp., Takayama cf. acrotrocha, Takayama tuberculata and Takayama sp. The typical cell forms of Kr. selliformis in the bloom were discoid, dorsoventrally flattened, and 35.3-43.6 (39.4 ± 2.1) µm in length, which was larger than the cell sizes in previous reports. Transparent cells of Kr. selliformis, lacking chloroplasts or having a few shrunken chloroplasts and oil droplets, were also found. Cells of Kr. selliformis showed morphological variation, but the species could be distinguished from other co-occurring Karenia species by the nucleus positioned in the hypocone and chloroplasts numerous (46-105) in number and small (2.9-4.6 µm) in diameter. Cell density of Kr. selliformis exceeding 100 cells mL-1 was recorded in the temperature range of 9.8-17.6 °C. The rDNA sequences determined from Kr. selliformis in the blooms of Hokkaido, Japan in 2021 were identical to those from the bloom in Kamchatka, Russia in 2020.",

    "abstract": "Phaeocystis is a globally widespread marine phytoplankton genus, best known for its colony-forming species that can form large blooms and odorous foam during bloom decline. In the North Sea, Phaeocystis globosa typically becomes abundant towards the end of the spring bloom, when nutrients are depleted and the share of mixotrophic protists increases. Although mixotrophy is widespread across the eukaryotic tree of life and is also found amongst haptophytes, a mixotrophic nutrition has not yet been demonstrated in Phaeocystis. Here, we sampled two consecutive Phaeocystis globosa spring blooms in the coastal North Sea. In both years, bacterial cells were observed inside 0.6 - 2% of P. globosa cells using double CARD-FISH hybridizations in combination with laser scanning confocal microscopy. Incubation experiments manipulating light and nutrient availability showed a trend towards higher occurrence of intracellular bacteria under P-deplete conditions. Based on counts of bacteria inside P. globosa cells in combination with theoretical values of prey digestion times, maximum ingestion rates of up to 0.08 bacteria cell-1 h-1 were estimated. In addition, a gene-based predictive model was applied to the transcriptome assemblies of seven Phaeocystis strains and 24 other haptophytes to assess their trophic mode. This model predicted a phago-mixotrophic feeding strategy in several (but not all) strains of P. globosa, P. antarctica and other haptophytes that were previously assumed to be autotrophic. The observation of bacterial cells inside P. globosa and the gene-based model predictions strongly suggest that the phago-mixotrophic feeding strategy is widespread among members of the Phaeocystis genus and other haptophytes, and might contribute to their remarkable success to form nuisance blooms under nutrient-limiting conditions.",

    "abstract": "The Chesapeake Bay, along the mid-Atlantic coast of North America, is the largest estuary in the United States and provides critical habitat for wildlife. In contrast to point and non-point source release of pesticides, metals, and industrial, personal care and household use chemicals on biota in this watershed, there has only been scant attention to potential exposure and effects of algal toxins on wildlife in the Chesapeake Bay region. As background, we first review the scientific literature on algal toxins and harmful algal bloom (HAB) events in various regions of the world that principally affected birds, and to a lesser degree other wildlife. To examine the situation for the Chesapeake, we compiled information from government reports and databases summarizing wildlife mortality events for 2000 through 2020 that were associated with potentially toxic algae and HAB events. Summary findings indicate that there have been few wildlife mortality incidents definitively linked to HABs, other mortality events that were suspected to be related to HABs, and more instances in which HABs may have indirectly contributed to or occurred coincident with wildlife mortality. The dominant toxins found in the Chesapeake Bay drainage that could potentially affect wildlife are microcystins, with concentrations in water approaching or exceeding human-based thresholds for ceasing recreational use and drinking water at a number of locations. As an increasing trend in HAB events in the U.S. and in the Chesapeake Bay have been reported, additional information on HAB toxin exposure routes, comparative sensitivity among species, consequences of sublethal exposure, and better diagnostic and risk criteria would greatly assist in predicting algal toxin hazard and risks to wildlife.",

For this reason, there is a high interest in understanding and predicting D. acuminata blooms. This study assesses the environmental conditions and develops a sub-seasonal (7 - 28 days) forecast model to predict D. acuminata cells abundance in the Lyngen fjord located in northern Norway. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained to predict future D. acuminata cells abundance by using the past cell concentration, sea surface temperature (SST), Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR), and wind speed. Cells concentration of Dinophysis spp. are measured in-situ from 2006 to 2019, and SST, PAR, and surface wind speed are obtained by satellite remote sensing. D. acuminata only explains 40% of DST variability from 2006 to 2011, but it changes to 65% after 2011 when D. acuta prevalence reduced. The D. acuminata blooms can reach concentration up to 3954 cells l−1 and are restricted to the summer during warmer waters, varying from 7.8 to 12.7 °C. The forecast model predicts with fair accuracy the seasonal development of the blooms and the blooms amplitude, showing a coefficient of determination varying from 0.46 to 0.55. SST has been found to be a useful predictor for the seasonal development of the blooms, while the past cells abundance is needed for updating the current status and adjusting the blooms timing and amplitude. The calibrated model should be tested operationally in the future to provide an early warning of D. acuminata blooms in the Lyngen fjord. The approach can be generalized to other regions by recalibrating the model with local observations of D. acuminata blooms and remote sensing data.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria can reach high densities in eutrophic lakes, which may cause problems due to their potential toxin production. Several methods are in use to prevent, control or mitigate harmful cyanobacterial blooms. Treatment of blooms with low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising emergency method. However, effects of H2O2 on cyanobacteria, eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton have mainly been studied in controlled cultures and mesocosm experiments, while much less is known about the effectiveness and potential side effects of H2O2 treatments on entire lake ecosystems. In this study, we report on three different lakes in the Netherlands that were treated with average H2O2 concentrations ranging from 2 to 5 mg L−1 to suppress cyanobacterial blooms. Effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton communities, on cyanotoxin concentrations, and on nutrient availability in the lakes were assessed. After every H2O2 treatment, cyanobacteria drastically declined, sometimes by more than 99%, although blooms of Dolichospermum sp., Aphanizomenon sp., and Planktothrix rubescens were more strongly suppressed than a Planktothrix agardhii bloom. Eukaryotic phytoplankton were not significantly affected by the H2O2 additions and had an initial advantage over cyanobacteria after the treatment, when ample nutrients and light were available. In all three lakes, a new cyanobacterial bloom developed within several weeks after the first H2O2 treatment, and in two lakes a second H2O2 treatment was therefore applied to again suppress the cyanobacterial population. Rotifers strongly declined after most H2O2 treatments except when the H2O2 concentration was ≤ 2 mg L−1, whereas cladocerans were only mildly affected and copepods were least impacted by the added H2O2. In response to the treatments, the cyanotoxins microcystins and anabaenopeptins were released from the cells into the water column, but disappeared after a few days. We conclude that lake treatments with low concentrations of H2O2 can be a successful tool to suppress harmful cyanobacterial blooms, but may negatively affect some of the zooplankton taxa in lakes. We advise pre-tests prior to the treatment of lakes to define optimal treatment concentrations that kill the majority of the cyanobacteria and to minimize potential side effects on non-target organisms. In some cases, the pre-tests may discourage treatment of the lake.",

    "abstract": "Modified clay compounds are used globally as a method of controlling harmful algal blooms, and their use is currently under consideration to control Karenia brevis blooms in Florida, USA. In 1400 L mesocosm tanks, chemical dynamics and lethal and sublethal impacts of MC II, a polyaluminum chloride (PAC)-modified kaolinite clay, were evaluated over 72 hours on a benthic community representative of Sarasota Bay, which included blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), sea urchin (Lytechinus variegatus), and hard clam (Mercenaria campechiensis). In this experiment, MC II was dosed at 0.2 g L−1 to treat bloom-level densities of K. brevis at 1 × 106 cells L−1. Cell removal in MC II-treated tanks was 57% after 8 hours and 95% after 48 hours. In the water column, brevetoxin analogs BTx-1 and BTx-2 were found to be significantly higher in untreated tanks at 24 and 48 hours, while in MC II-treated tanks, BTx-3 was found to be higher at 48 hours and BTx-B5 was found to be higher at 24 and 48 hours. In MC II floc, we found no significant differences in BTx-1 or BTx-2 between treatments for any time point, while BTx-3 was found to be significantly higher in the MC II-treated tanks at 48 and 72 hours, and BTx-B5 was higher in MC II-treated tanks at 24 and 72 hours. Among various chemical dynamics observed, it was notable that dissolved phosphorus was consistently significantly lower in MC II tanks after 2 hours, and that turbidity in MC II tanks returned to control levels 48 hours after treatment. Dissolved inorganic carbon and total seawater alkalinity were significantly reduced in MC II tanks, and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) was significantly higher in the MC II-only treatment after 2 hours. In MC II floc, particulate phosphorus was found to be significantly higher in MC II tanks after 24 hours. In animals, lethal and sublethal responses to MC II-treated K. brevis did not differ from untreated K. brevis for either of our three species at any time point, suggesting MC II treatment at this dosage has negligible impacts to these species within 72 hours of exposure. These results appear promising in terms of the environmental safety of MC II as a potential bloom control option, and we recommend scaling up MC II experiments to field trials in order to gain deeper understanding of MC II performance and dynamics in natural waters.",

    "abstract": "Due to climate changes and eutrophication, blooms of predominantly toxic freshwater cyanobacteria are intensifying and are likely to colonize estuaries, thus impacting benthic organisms and shellfish farming representing a major ecological, health and economic risk. In the natural environment, Microcystis form large mucilaginous colonies that influence the development of both cyanobacterial and embedded bacterial communities. However, little is known about the fate of natural colonies of Microcystis by salinity increase. In this study, we monitored the fate of a Microcystis dominated bloom and its microbiome along a French freshwater-marine gradient at different phases of a bloom. We demonstrated changes in the cyanobacterial genotypic composition, in the production of specific metabolites (toxins and compatible solutes) and in the heterotrophic bacteria structure in response to the salinity increase. In particular M. aeruginosa and M. wesenbergii survived salinities up to 20. Based on microcystin gene abundance, the cyanobacteria became more toxic during their estuarine transfer but with no selection of specific microcystin variants. An increase in compatible solutes occurred along the continuum with extensive trehalose and betaine accumulations. Salinity structured most the heterotrophic bacteria community, with an increased in the richness and diversity along the continuum. A core microbiome in the mucilage-associated attached fraction was highly abundant suggesting a strong interaction between Microcystis and its microbiome and a likely protecting role of the mucilage against an osmotic shock. These results underline the need to better determine the interactions between the Microcystis colonies and their microbiome as a likely key to their widespread success and adaptation to various environmental conditions.",

In addition to toxins, the composition and abundance of toxic phytoplankton and general environmental characteristics of the seawater (surface temperature and salinity) were also monitored. During the 2014-2019 study period, only lipophilic toxins were detected (78 positive tests out of 446 runs), of which okadaic acid (OA) predominated in 97 % of cases, while dinophysistoxin-2 and yessotoxins only gave a positive result in one sampling event each. The number of samples that did not comply with the EC Regulation for the OA group was 17 or 3.8 % of all tests performed, all of which took place from September to November, while a few positive OA tests were also recorded in December, April, and May. This toxicity pattern was consistent with the occurrence pattern of the five most common DSP-producing dinoflagellates, which was supported by the development of warm and thermohaline stratified waters: Dinophysis caudata, D. fortii, D. sacculus, D. tripos and Phalacroma rotundatum.

CHABs in estuaries often originate from upstream locations with longer hydraulic residence times (e.g., reservoirs, static channels). These locations also accumulate higher concentrations of benthic overwintering cells that serve as inoculum for subsequent year's blooms. We investigated overwintering Microcystis seed stock in the hydrologically complex upper San Francisco Estuary also known as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to quantify total Microcystis in the sediments that was available to inoculate summertime blooms. To study bloom origin and succession, DNA from discrete water and sediment samples was PCR amplified using cyanobacteria-specific 16S-23S ITS rDNA primers. Results confirmed the hypothesis that static peripheral areas have the highest seed stock and generally the highest Microcystis concentrations in surface water. We also confirmed high genetic diversity of the Microcystis population in the Delta with 36 unique genotypes detected in the sediment and water column. This study demonstrates that overwintering cells should be considered when investigating Microcystis dynamics across large estuarine systems.",

    "abstract": "The identification of a new suite of toxins, called azaspiracids (AZA), as the cause of human illnesses after the consumption of shellfish from the Irish west coast in 1995, resulted in interest in understanding the global distribution of these toxins and of species of the small dinoflagellate genus Azadinium, known to produce them. Clonal isolates of four species of Azadinium, A. poporum, A. cuneatum, A. obesum and A. dalianense were obtained from incubated sediment samples collected from Puget Sound, Washington State in 2016. These Azadinium species were identified using morphological characteristics confirmed by molecular phylogeny. Whereas AZA could not be detected in any strains of A. obesum, A. cuneatum and A. dalianense, all four strains of A. poporum produced a new azaspiracid toxin, based on LC–MS analysis, named AZA-59. The presence of AZA-59 was confirmed at low levels in situ using a solid phase resin deployed at several stations along the coastlines of Puget Sound. Using a combination of molecular methods for species detection and solid phase resin deployment to target shellfish monitoring of toxin at high-risk sites, the risk of azaspiracid shellfish poisoning can be minimized.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely quantification of widespread harmful algal bloom (HAB) distribution is crucial to respond to the natural disaster, minimize the damage, and assess the environmental impact of the event. Although various remote sensing-based quantification approaches have been proposed for HAB since the advent of the ocean color satellite sensor, there have been no algorithms that were validated with in-situ quantitative measurements for the red tide occurring in the Korean seas. Furthermore, since the geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) became available in June 2010, an algorithm that exploits its unprecedented observation frequency (every hour during the daytime) has been highly demanded to better track the changes in spatial distribution of red tide. This study developed a novel red tide quantification algorithm for GOCI that can estimate hourly chlorophyll-a (Chl a) concentration of Cochlodinium (Margalefidinium) polykrikoides, one of the major red tide species around Korean seas. The developed algorithm has been validated using in-situ Chl a measurements collected from a cruise campaign conducted in August 2013, when a massive C. polykrikoides bloom devastated Korean coasts. The proposed algorithm produced a high correlation (R2=0.92) with in-situ Chl a measurements with robust performance also for high Chl a concentration (300mg/m3) in East Sea areas that typically have a relatively low total suspended particle concentration (<0.5mg/m3).",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-nitzschia H. Peragallo (1900) is a globally distributed genus of pennate diatoms that are important components of phytoplankton communities worldwide. Some members of the genus produce the neurotoxin domoic acid, so regular monitoring is in place. However, the identification of toxic members in routine samplings remains problematic. In this study, the diversity and seasonal occurrence of Pseudo-nitzschia species were investigated in the Gulf of Trieste, a shallow gulf in the northern Adriatic Sea. We used time series data from 2005 to 2018 to describe the seasonal and inter-annual occurrence of the genus in the area and its contribution to the phytoplankton community. On average, the genus accounted for about 15 % of total diatom abundance and peaked in spring and autumn, with occasional outbreaks during summer and large inter-annual fluctuations. Increased water temperature and decreased salinity positively affected the presence of some members of the genus, while strong effects could be masked by an unsuitable definition of the species complexes used for monitoring purposes. Therefore, combining morphological (TEM) and molecular analyses by sequencing the ITS, 28S and rbcL markers, eight species were identified from 83 isolated monoclonal strains: P. calliantha, P. fraudulenta, P. delicatissima, P. galaxiae, P. mannii, P. multistriata, P. pungens and P. subfraudulenta. A genetic comparison between the isolated strains and other strains in the Mediterranean was carried out and rbcL was inspected as a potential barcode marker in respect to our results. This is the first study in the Gulf of Trieste on Pseudo-nitzschia time series from a long-term ecological research (LTER) site coupled with molecular data. We show that meaningful ecological conclusions can be drawn by applying integrative methodology, as opposed to the approach that only considers species complexes. The results of this work will provide guidance for further monitoring efforts as well as research activities, including population genetics and genomics, associated with seasonal distribution and toxicity profiles.",

    "abstract": "Application of low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a relatively new and promising method to selectively suppress harmful cyanobacterial blooms, while minimizing effects on eukaryotic organisms. However, it is still unknown how nutrient limitation affects the sensitivity of cyanobacteria to H2O2. In this study, we compare effects of H2O2 on the microcystin-producing cyanobacterium Microcystis PCC 7806 under light-limited but nutrient-replete conditions, nitrogen (N) limitation and phosphorus (P) limitation. Microcystis was first grown in chemostats to acclimate to these different experimental conditions, and subsequently transferred to batch cultures where they were treated with a range of H2O2 concentrations (0-10 mg L−1) while exposed to high light (100 µmol photons m−2 s−1) or low light (15 µmol photons m−2 s−1). Our results show that, at low light, N- and P-limited Microcystis were less sensitive to H2O2 than light-limited but nutrient-replete Microcystis. A significantly higher expression of the genes encoding for anti-oxidative stress enzymes (2-cys-peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin A and type II peroxiredoxin) was observed prior to and after the H2O2 treatment for both N- and P-limited Microcystis, which may explain their increased resistance against H2O2. At high light, Microcystis was more sensitive to H2O2 than at low light, and differences in the decline of the photosynthetic yield between nutrient-replete and nutrient-limited Microcystis exposed to H2O2 were less pronounced. Leakage of microcystin was stronger and faster from nutrient-replete than from N- and P-limited Microcystis. Overall, this study provides insight in the sensitivity of harmful cyanobacteria to H2O2 under various environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Blooms of dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum are widely distributed in estuarine and coastal waters and have been found to cause fish kills worldwide. K. veneficum has a mixed nutritional mode and relies on both photosynthesis and phagotrophy for growth; it is a mixotroph. Here, a model of mixotrophic growth of K. veneficum (MIXO) was developed, calibrated with previously-reported laboratory physiological data, and subsequently embedded in a 3D-coupled hydrodynamic (ROMS)-biogeochemical (RCA) model of eutrophic Chesapeake Bay, USA. The resulting ROMS-RCA-MIXO model was applied in hindcast mode to investigate seasonal and spatial distributions. Simulations showed that K. veneficum blooms occurred during June-August and were confined to the upper and middle Bay, consistent with long-term field observations. Autotrophic growth dominated in spring but heterotrophic growth dominated during the summer. The number of prey ingested by K. veneficum varied from 0.1 to 0.6 day-1 and the food vacuole content reached up to 50% of the core mixotroph biomass. The ingestion rate increased with prey density and also when P:N ratio fell below ∼0.03 (N:P ∼ 33), indicating that K. veneficum only switched to mixotrophic feeding in P-deficient waters when sufficient prey were available; this occurred during the summer months. The digestion rate increased with both the food vacuole content and temperature. The modeling analysis affirms K. veneficum as a phagotrophic 'alga' which is primarily photosynthetic but switches to mixotrophic feeding under nutrient deficient conditions.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a threat to human health, local economies, and coastal ecosystems. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were fitted using a 24-y database in order to predict future occurrences of three distinct species of HABs on the Canadian East Coast, the dinoflagellates Dinophysis acuminata and D. norvegica, and the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia seriata. GAMMs produced for each species were combined with two downscaled climate simulations (MPI-ESM-LR and CanESM2) under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 over the 21st century. D. acuminata, D. norvegica, and P. seriata GAMMs were fitted using sea surface salinity and sea surface temperature, with wind speed averaged over seven days added to the P. seriata model. GAMMs succeeded at various degrees at reproducing past HAB events, with D. acuminata and D. norvegica being accurately modelled, and P. seriata producing less precise model results. Both climate simulations lead to similar conclusions in regards to the spatio-temporal shift in occurrences of the three studied species. D. acuminata and D. norvegica blooms (≥ 1000 cells L − 1) are predicted to increase in the future, whereas P. seriata bloom events (≥ 5000 cells L − 1) will tend to stabilise/decrease overall on the Canadian East Coast. Dinophysis blooms are most likely to increase in the St. Lawrence Estuary. Pseudo-nitzschia blooms will move to the northeastern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and will increase in the Bay of Fundy/Gulf of Maine regions. On average, earlier blooms and larger seasonal windows of opportunity are predicted across all species investigated. We conclude that changes in D. acuminata, D. norvegica, and P. seriata bloom dynamics and their spatial distributions could threaten aquaculture industries and ecosystem health on Canada's East Coast in localities and during seasons which were not previously impacted by these species.",

    "abstract": "Climate change-related ocean warming and reduction in Arctic sea ice extent, duration and thickness increase the risk of toxic blooms of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella in the Alaskan Arctic. This algal species produces neurotoxins that impact marine wildlife health and cause the human illness known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). This study reports Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) concentrations quantified in Arctic food web samples that include phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic clams, benthic worms, and pelagic fish collected throughout summer 2019 during anomalously warm ocean conditions. PSTs (saxitoxin equivalents, STX eq.) were detected in all trophic levels with concentrations above the seafood safety regulatory limit (80 μg STX eq. 100 g-1) in benthic clams collected offshore on the continental shelf in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas. Most notably, toxic benthic clams (Macoma calcarea) were found north of Saint Lawrence Island where Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) are known to forage for a variety of benthic species, including Macoma. Additionally, fecal samples collected from 13 walruses harvested for subsistence purposes near Saint Lawrence Island during March to May 2019, all contained detectable levels of STX, with fecal samples from two animals (78 and 72 μg STX eq. 100 g-1) near the seafood safety regulatory limit. In contrast, 64% of fecal samples from zooplankton-feeding bowhead whales (n = 9) harvested between March and September 2019 in coastal waters of the Beaufort Sea near Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) and Kaktovik were toxin-positive, and those levels were significantly lower than in walruses (max bowhead 8.5 μg STX eq. 100 g-1). This was consistent with the lower concentrations of PSTs found in regional zooplankton prey. Maximum ecologically-relevant daily toxin doses to walruses feeding on clams and bowhead whales feeding on zooplankton were estimated to be 21.5 and 0.7 μg STX eq. kg body weight-1 day-1, respectively, suggesting that walruses had higher PST exposures than bowhead whales. Average and maximum STX doses in walruses were in the range reported previously to cause illness and/or death in humans and humpback whales, while bowhead whale doses were well below those levels. These findings raise concerns regarding potential increases in PST/STX exposure risks and health impacts to Arctic marine mammals as ocean warming and sea ice reduction continue.",

The cyanobacteria management \"pendulum\" has progressively shifted from prevention to mitigation, with management considerations often put forth after bloom formation. A universal system (i.e., one-size-fits-all management) fails to provide a management path forward due to the inherent complexities of each lake. A tailored management plan is needed: the right species at the right time in the right place (i.e., the three Rs). The three Rs represent a customizable management strategy that is flexible and informed by advances in scientific understanding to lower cyanobacteria-associated risks. Identifying thresholds in risk tolerance, where thresholds are defined by community collectives, is essential to frame cyanobacteria management targets and to decide on what management interventions are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The holopelagic brown macroalgae Sargassum natans and Sargassum fluitans form essential habitats for attached and mobile fauna which contributes to a unique biodiversity in the Atlantic Ocean. However, holopelagic Sargassum natans (genotype I & VIII) and Sargassum fluitans (genotype III) have begun forming large accumulations with subsequent strandings on the western coast of Africa, the Caribbean and northern Brazil, threatening local biodiversity of coastal ecosystems and triggering economic losses. Moreover, stranded masses of holopelagic Sargassum may introduce or facilitate growth of bacteria that are not normally abundant in coastal regions where Sargassum is washing ashore. Hitherto, it is not clear how the holopelagic Sargassum microbiome varies across its growing biogeographic range and what factors drive the microbial composition. We determined the microbiome associated with holopelagic Sargassum from the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt to coastal stranding sites in Mexico and Florida. We characterized the Sargassum microbiome via amplicon sequencing of the 16S V4 region hypervariable region of the rRNA gene. The microbial community of holopelagic Sargassum was mainly composed of photo(hetero)trophs, organic matter degraders and potentially pathogenic bacteria from the Pseudomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Vibrionaceae. Sargassum genotypes S. natans I, S. natans VIII and S. fluitans III contained similar microbial families, but relative abundances and diversity varied. LEfSE analyses further indicated biomarker genera that were indicative of Sargassum S. natans I/VIII and S. fluitans III. The holopelagic Sargassum microbiome showed biogeographic patterning with high relative abundances of Vibrio spp., but additional work is required to determine whether that represents health risks in coastal environments. Our study informs coastal management policy, where the adverse sanitary effects of stranded Sargassum might impact the health of coastal ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Along the Italian coasts, toxins of algal origin in wild and cultivated shellfish have been reported since the 1970s. In this study, we used data gathered by the Veterinary Public Health Institutes (IZS) and the Italian Environmental Health Protection Agencies (ARPA) from 2006 to 2019 to investigate toxicity events along the Italian coasts and relate them to the distribution of potentially toxic species. Among the detected toxins (OA and analogs, YTXs, PTXs, STXs, DAs, AZAs), OA and YTX were those most frequently reported. Levels exceeding regulatory limits in the case of OA (≤2,448 μg equivalent kg−1) were associated with high abundances of Dinophysis spp., and in the case of YTXs (≤22 mg equivalent kg−1) with blooms of Gonyaulax spinifera, Lingulodinium polyedra, and Protoceratium reticulatum. Seasonal blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. occur all along the Italian coast, but DA has only occasionally been detected in shellfish at concentrations always below the regulatory limit (≤18 mg kg−1). Alexandrium spp. were recorded in several areas, although STXs (≤13,782 µg equivalent kg−1) rarely and only in few sites exceeded the regulatory limit in shellfish. Azadinium spp. have been sporadically recorded, and AZAs have been sometimes detected but always in low concentrations (≤7 µg equivalent kg−1). Among the emerging toxins, PLTX-like toxins (≤971 μg kg−1 OVTX-a) have often been detected mainly in wild mussels and sea urchins from rocky shores due to the presence of Ostreopsis cf. ovata. Overall, Italian coastal waters harbour a high number of potentially toxic species, with a few HAB hotspots mainly related to DSP toxins. Nevertheless, rare cases of intoxications have occurred so far, reflecting the whole Mediterranean Sea conditions.",

Here we tested whether this increase in microcystin provided M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 with a fitness advantage during colder-temperature growth by comparing cell concentration, cellular physiology, reactive oxygen species damage, and the transcriptomics-inferred metabolism to a non-toxigenic mutant strain M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 ΔmcyB. Photo-physiological data combined with transcriptomic data revealed metabolic changes in the mutant strain during growth at 19 °C, which included increased electron sinks and non-photochemical quenching. Increased gene expression was observed for a glutathione-dependent peroxiredoxin during cold treatment, suggesting compensatory mechanisms to defend against reactive oxygen species are employed in the absence of microcystin in the mutant. Our observations highlight the potential selective advantages of a longer-term defensive strategy in management of oxidative stress (i.e., making microcystin) vs the shorter-term proactive strategy of producing cellular components to actively dissipate or degrade oxidative stress agents.",

    "abstract": "Toxic cyanobacterial blooms impose a health risk to recreational users, and monitoring of cyanobacteria and associated toxins is required to assess this risk. Traditionally, monitoring for risk assessment is based on cyanobacterial biomass, which assumes that all cyanobacteria potentially produce toxins. While these methods may be cost effective, relatively fast, and more widely accessible, they often lead to an overestimation of the health risk induced by cyanotoxins. Monitoring methods that more directly target toxins, or toxin producing genes, may provide a better risk assessment, yet these methods may be more costly, usually take longer, or are not widely accessible. In this study, we compared six monitoring methods (fluorometry, microscopy, qPCR of 16S and mcyE, ELISA assays, and LC-MS/MS), of which the last three focussed on the most abundant cyanotoxin microcystins, across 11 lakes in the Netherlands during the bathing water season (May-October) of 2019. Results of all monitoring methods significantly correlated with LC-MS/MS obtained microcystin levels (the assumed 'golden standard'), with stronger correlations for methods targeting microcystins (ELISA) and microcystin genes (mcyE). The estimated risk levels differed substantially between methods, with 78 % and 56 % of alert level exceedances in the total number of collected samples for fluorometry and microscopy-based methods, respectively, while this was only 16 % and 6 % when the risk assessment was based on ELISA and LC-MS/MS obtained toxin concentrations, respectively. Integrating our results with earlier findings confirmed a strong association between microcystin concentration and the biovolume of potential microcystin-producing genera. Moreover, using an extended database consisting of 4265 observations from 461 locations across the Netherlands in the bathing water seasons of 2015 - 2019, we showed a strong association between fluorescence and the biovolume of potentially toxin-producing genera. Our results indicate that a two-tiered approach may be an effective risk assessment strategy, with first a biomass-based method (fluorometry, biovolume) until the first alert level is exceeded, after which the risk level can be confirmed or adjusted based on follow-up toxin or toxin gene analyses.",

    "abstract": "Fish-killing harmful algal blooms (HABs) threaten fisheries and aquaculture globally. In May and June 2019, the haptophyte Chrysochromulina leadbeateri formed the most devastating fish-killing algal bloom ever recorded in Northern Norway. Despite the severe impact of HABs on farmed fish, our understanding of their toxic mechanisms is limited. Here, we investigated the ichthyotoxicity of C. leadbeateri by using the gill epithelial cell line ASG-10 from Atlantic salmon. Extracts of C. leadbeateri showed potent hemolytic activity towards Atlantic salmon red blood cells, and toxicity to the ASG-10 cells with an EC50 of 3.41 × 106 algal cells mL-1 measured by the Alamar Blue viability assay. Furthermore, lower extract concentrations increased caspase-3/7 activity, suggesting induction of apoptosis, while higher concentrations of the extract showed compromised cell membrane integrity. No intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction was observed. Exposure to C. leadbeateri extracts cultured under different irradiances or with putrescine supplementation to the algal medium did not increase the toxicity. Exposure of living C. leadbeateri cells to ASG-10 did not show any cytotoxicity from imaging or barrier integrity impairment, but the activity of leaked dead-cell proteases revealed a concentration-dependent effect on the ASG-10 cells. Furthermore, incubation of C. leadbeateri in culture with putrescine for 72 h resulted in increased dead-cell proteases leaked from the ASG-10 cells compared to cultures without putrescine. Our findings suggest that living C. leadbeateri cells exert sublethal effects on Atlantic salmon gill cells. Additionally, putrescine seems to increase the ichthyotoxicity of living C. leadbeateri towards ASG-10 cells.",

    "abstract": "Though freshwater harmful algal blooms have been described and studied for decades, several important dynamics remain uncertain, including the relationships among nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton growth, and cyanotoxin production. To identify when and where nutrients limit phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, and cyanotoxins, we conducted in situ bioassay studies. We added nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or N + P across various seasons in water collected from three locations across Utah Lake, one of the largest freshwater lakes in the western U.S. This shallow, hypereutrophic lake provides a powerful testbed for quantifying nutrient-growth-toxin interactions. We assessed a range of parameters over time, including photopigment concentrations, phytoplankton abundance (cell counts), cyanotoxins, and nutrient concentrations. Despite high background nutrient concentrations in lake water, phytoplankton abundance and composition were strongly affected by nutrient addition. Phosphorus limitation was more common in the spring, with N limitation and N + P limitation becoming more common in the fall. Nutrient additions were positively associated with cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Aphanocapsa, Dolichospermum, Merismopedia, Aphanizomenon spp.), eukaryotes (Aulacoseira, Desmodesmus spp.), and two taxonomical categories of phytoplankton (i.e., unicellular and colonial green algae). When detected, anatoxin-a was positively associated with Aphanizomenon and negatively associated with Microcystis spp. However, overall cyanotoxin concentrations were not associated with cyanobacterial cell density but varied seasonally. These findings highlight the importance of considering seasonal nutrient availability dynamics and provide insights into specific nutrient targets, species, and cyanotoxins that play a significant role in the health and management of similar eutrophic lake environments around the world.",

    "abstract": "The species Karlodinium armiger occasionally co-occurs with Karlodinium veneficum during harmful algal blooms. The only toxin of this species described so far is karmitoxin, a highly ichthyotoxic compound very similar to the karlotoxins produced by K. veneficum. However, information on K. armiger is limited and based on a single Mediterranean strain (K-0668), with few studies investigating its toxicity. Given the high intraspecific variability known in K. veneficum, it was a significant achievement when two additional strains of K. armiger (MD-D6 and MD-D7) were isolated from the Labrador Sea in 2017, enabling comparative studies within this species. The toxicity of these three strains was assessed using the fish gill cell line RTgill-W1 and the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina. An untargeted metabolomics approach using high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, along with a computational workflow, provided insights into the metabolomic differences between the strains. Despite being cultivated under identical conditions, the metabolomic profiles and toxicological properties were distinct, even between MD-D6 and MD-D7, which were isolated from the same water sample. While MD-D7 did not exhibit significant toxicity, MD-D6 showed high toxicity and lytic potential, similar to K-0668. Interestingly, karmitoxin was only detected in K-0668, and neither karlotoxins nor any known analogs were detected in any strain. Within this comprehensive workflow, some molecules were found in MD-D6 that share the same chemical space as karmitoxin, making them interesting targets for further research. In conclusion, this study evaluated the toxicological and metabolic variability in three different strains of K. armiger and identified some putative toxin candidates in MD-D6.",

    "abstract": "Benthic cyanobacterial proliferations are an emerging concern globally due to their potential for toxin production and subsequent negative environmental and health impacts. Microcoleus is a common mat-forming genus reported to produce potent neurotoxin, anatoxin-a, ingestion of which has been associated with animal mortalities. Six different unialgal monoclonal strains of Microcoleus were isolated from streams in California and grown in batch culture for 49 days. The four toxic strains were identified using a polyphasic approach as belonging to the species Microcoleus anatoxicus, which expands its known distribution throughout the Klamath River and Rock Creek watersheds in northern California. The non-toxic strains from the Eel River belonged to Microcoleus sp. 1. Maximum toxin production occurred during the exponential growth phase, and peaked 6-13 days later in more toxic strains, with a persistently higher fraction of extracellular toxins compared to less toxic strains, which had maximum toxin concentrations at day 13. The proposed mechanism of toxin release into culture medium was through damage to the cell walls of unhealthy filaments. Peak toxin production was energetically expensive for all M. anatoxicus strains, evidenced by reduced specific growth rates at the time of peak toxin production, followed by quick recovery of cell division. Despite this, more toxic strains achieved faster maximum growth rates than the less toxic and non-toxic strains under luxurious nutrient culture conditions. Differential toxin and growth rate responses of M. anatoxicus strains from wide geographical ranges under the same laboratory-controlled conditions suggest high intraspecific variation, which may represent challenges for harmful algal blooms mitigation. More toxic strains have the potential to proliferate and consistently release extracellular anatoxins into the environment. This study provides a baseline to understanding the growth and toxin kinetics of two commonly occurring Microcoleus species in northern California which may help benthic harmful cyanobacteria management.",

At this time, large numbers of the biotoxin-producing phytoplankton genus Dinophysis was observed around the Shetland Islands. Analysis indicated this increase was not due to in situ growth but coincided with a change in the prevalent wind direction. A previous large bloom of Dinophysis during 2006 also coincided with a similar change in the prevalent wind patterns. Wind direction and speed in the North East Atlantic and the North Sea is strongly influenced by the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) with a positive relationship between it and wind direction. It has been noted that a positive trend in the NAO is linked to climate change and predictions suggest there will be an increasingly westward component to prevalent wind directions in the North Sea which could lead to an increase in the occurrence of these harmful algal blooms. Analysis of wind patterns therefore offers a potential method of early warning of future bio-toxicity events.",

    "abstract": "Cell abundances and distributions of Alexandrium catenella resting cysts in recent sediments were studied along time at two locations in the Chilean Inland Sea exposed to different oceanographic conditions: Low Bay, which is much more open to the ocean than the more interior and protected Ovalada Island. The bloom began in interior areas but maximum cyst concentrations were recorded in locations more open to the ocean, at the end of the Moraleda channel. Our results showed a time lapse of around 3 months from the bloom peak (planktonic population) until the number of resting cysts in the sediments reached a maximum. Three months later, less than 10% of the A. catenella cysts remained in the sediments. Maximum cyst numbers in the water column occurred one month after the planktonic peak, when no cells were present. The dinoflagellate assemblage at both study sites was dominated by heterotrophic cysts, except during the A. catenella bloom. CCA analyses of species composition and environmental factors indicated that the frequency of A. catenella blooms was associated with low temperatures, but not with salinity, chlorophyll a concentration, and predator presence (measured as clam biomass). However, resting cyst distribution was only related to cell abundance and location. The occurrence of A. catenella cysts was also associated with that of cysts from the toxic species Protoceratium reticulatum. By shedding light on the ecological requirements of A. catenella blooms, our observations support the relevance of encystment as a mechanism of bloom termination and show a very fast depletion of cysts from the sediments (<3 months), which suggest a small role for resting cyst deposits in the recurrence of A. catenella blooms in this area.",

    "abstract": "Abundance and distribution of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense species complex resting cyst were investigated in the eastern Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea for the first time. Sediment samples (top 0–3 cm depth) were collected from the continental shelf of the eastern Bering Sea (17 stations) and the Chukchi Sea (13 stations) together with a long core sample (top 0–21 cm depth) from one station in the Chukchi Sea during 2009–2012. The cysts were enumerated using the primuline staining method. Species identification of the cysts was carried out with multiplex PCR assay and the plate morphology of vegetative cells germinated from cysts in the both areas. Alexandrium cysts were widely detected in the both areas, ranging from not detected (<1 cysts cm−3) to 835 cysts cm−3 wet sediment in the eastern Bering Sea and from not detected (<1 cysts cm−3) to 10,600 cysts cm−3 in the Chukchi Sea, and all isolated cysts were genetically and morphologically identified as the North American clade A. tamarense. Their cysts were mainly distributed in the shallow continental shelf where the water depth was less than 100 m in both areas. The cysts were detected from the deep layer (18–21 cm depth of sediment core) of the long core sample. The present study confirmed the abundant existence of A. tamarense with wide range of distribution in these areas. This fact suggests that A. tamarense vegetative cells have appeared in the water column in the both areas. Furthermore, these abundant cyst depositions indicate that this species originally distributed in the Arctic and subarctic regions and well adapted to the environments in the marginal ice zone.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that both marine and limnic microalgal species often consist of several genetically distinct populations. This is also valid for the nuisance freshwater algae Gonyostomum semen, which originates from acidic, brown water swamp lakes, but can nowadays also be found in clearer lakes with close to neutral pH. We hypothesized that the observed genetic differentiation among G. semen lake populations, reported in earlier studies, is connected to adaptation to local environmental conditions. In the present study we performed controlled laboratory experiments to test whether 12 strains originating from five lakes varied in their response to five to six different pHs, light intensities and DOC concentrations. Overall, growth (0.01–0.37 day−1) was observed over a wide range of light intensities and pHs, demonstrating high potential for photoacclimation and extensive plasticity of individual strains. Moreover, we found similar growth rates and consistent growth optima for specific pHs by strains from the same lake, suggesting genetic differentiation of populations into distinct phenotypes. However, observed strain specific preferences did not always reflect environmental conditions in the lakes of origin and provided limited evidence for the hypothesized local adaptation. Instead, the observed phenotypic differentiation may indicate resilient effects of founder events. We suggest that the wide phenotypic plasticity in this species enables it to thrive in fluctuating and variable environments, and may play a role in its ability to colonize new habitats.",

    "abstract": "Elevated seawater temperatures are linked to the development of harmful algal blooms (HABs), which pose a growing threat to marine birds and other wildlife. During late 2015 and early 2016, a massive die-off of Common Murres (Uria aalge; hereafter, murres) was observed in the Gulf of Alaska coincident with a strong marine heat wave. Previous studies have documented illness and death among seabirds resulting from exposure to the HAB neurotoxins saxitoxin (STX) and domoic acid (DA). Given the unusual mortality event, corresponding warm water anomalies, and recent detection of STX and DA throughout coastal Alaskan waters, HABs were identified as a possible factor of concern. To evaluate whether algal toxins may have contributed to murre deaths, we tested for STX and DA in a suite of tissues obtained from beach-cast murre carcasses associated with the die-off as well as from apparently healthy murres and Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla; hereafter, kittiwakes) sampled in the preceding and following summers. We also tested forage fish and marine invertebrates collected in the Gulf of Alaska in 2015-2017 to evaluate potential sources of HAB toxin exposure for seabirds. Saxitoxin was present in multiple tissue types of both die-off (36.4 %) and healthy (41.7 %) murres and healthy kittiwakes (54.2 %). Among birds, we detected the highest concentrations of STX in liver tissues (range 1.4-10.8 μg 100 g-1) of die-off murres. Saxitoxin was relatively common in forage fish (20.3 %) and invertebrates (53.8 %). No established toxicity limits currently exist for seabirds, but concentrations of STX in birds and forage fish in our study were lower than values reported from most other bird die-offs in which STX intoxication was causally linked. We detected low concentrations of DA in a single bird sample and in 33.3 % of invertebrates and 4.0 % of forage fish samples. Although these results do not support the hypothesis that acute exposure to STX or DA was a primary factor in the 2015-2016 mortality event, additional information about the sensitivity of murres to these toxins is needed before we can discount their potential role in the die-off. The widespread occurrence of STX in seabirds, forage fish, and invertebrates in the Gulf of Alaska indicates that algal toxins should be considered in future assessments of seabird health, especially given the potential for greater occurrence of HABs in the future.",

    "abstract": "The human dimensions of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are becoming increasingly apparent as they grow in frequency and magnitude in some regions of the world under changing ocean conditions. One such region is the U.S. West Coast, where HABs of toxigenic species of Pseudo-nitzschia have been found to coincide with or closely follow periods of warming. In 2015, the region experienced a massive HAB of Pseudo-nitzschia that was associated with the 2014-16 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave. The HAB event delayed the opening of the lucrative commercial Dungeness crab fishery for up to 5 months and closed the popular recreational razor clam fishery, resulting in fishery failures and disaster declarations and causing significant sociocultural and economic impacts to coastal communities. Here, management actions are examined that were taken by federal and state government agencies and responses of coastal residents to this extreme HAB event using a disaster risk management framework consisting of four phases: 1) prediction and early warning, 2) event response, 3) recovery and reconstruction, and 4) mitigation and prevention. Clear differences in management actions at the state level were evident in California, Oregon, and Washington during every phase, producing vastly different perceptions of management by coastal residents. A history of trusted relationships and coordination among agencies and with the fishing industry in Washington State was associated with more transparent and accepted management responses. The examination found that additional education, outreach, and trust-building exercises would provide benefits to communities affected by extreme HAB events. Our findings contribute to an understanding of climate change adaptation in coastal communities dependent on fishery resources.",

    "abstract": "Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is prevalent around the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes of the world and impacts many Pacific island communities intrinsically linked to the reef system for sustenance and trade. While the genus Gambierdiscus has been linked with CFP, it is commonly found on tropical reef systems in microalgal assemblages with other genera of toxin-producing, epiphytic and/or benthic dinoflagellates - Amphidinium, Coolia, Fukuyoa, Ostreopsis and Prorocentrum. Identifying a biomarker compound that can be used for the early detection of Gambierdiscus blooms, specifically in a mixed microalgal community, is paramount in enabling the development of management and mitigation strategies. Following on from the recent structural elucidation of 44-methylgambierone, its potential to contribute to CFP intoxication events and applicability as a biomarker compound for Gambierdiscus spp. was investigated. The acute toxicity of this secondary metabolite was determined by intraperitoneal injection using mice, which showed it to be of low toxicity, with an LD50 between 20 and 38 mg kg-1. The production of 44-methylgambierone by 252 marine microalgal isolates consisting of 90 species from 32 genera across seven classes, was assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. It was discovered that the production of this secondary metabolite was ubiquitous to the eight Gambierdiscus species tested, however not all isolates of G. carpenteri, and some species/isolates of Coolia and Fukuyoa.",

Allelochemicals from the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum have deleterious effects on diatoms, inhibiting metabolism and photosynthesis and therefore give a competitive advantage to the dinoflagellate. The precise mechanisms of allelochemical interactions and the molecular target of allelochemicals remain however unknown. To understand the mechanisms, the short-term effects of A. minutum allelochemicals on the physiology of the diatom Chaetoceros muelleri were investigated. The effects of a culture filtrate were measured on the diatom cytoplasmic membrane integrity (polarity and permeability) using flow-cytometry and on the photosynthetic performance using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. Within 10 min, the unknown allelochemicals induced a depolarization of the cytoplasmic membranes and an impairment of photosynthesis through the inhibition of the plastoquinone-mediated electron transfer between photosystem II and cytochrome b6f. At longer time of exposure, the cytoplasmic membranes were permeable and the integrity of photosystems I, II and cytochrome b6f was compromised. Our demonstration of the essential role of membranes in this allelochemical interaction provides new insights for the elucidation of the nature of the allelochemicals. The relationship between cytoplasmic membranes and the inhibition of the photosynthetic electron transfer remains however unclear and warrants further investigation.",

Over the past decade, blooms of algae that produce the neurotoxins domoic acid (DA) and saxitoxin (STX) and documented concurrent seabird mortality events have increased bicoastally in the United States. We conducted a retrospective analysis of HAB related mortality events in California, Washington, and Rhode Island between 2007 and 2018 involving 12 species of seabirds, to document the levels, ranges, and patterns of DA and STX in eight sample types (kidney, liver, stomach, intestinal, cloacal, cecal contents, bile, blood) collected from birds during these events. Samples (n = 182) from 83 birds were examined for DA (n = 135) or STX (n = 17) or both toxins simultaneously (n = 30), using ELISA or LCMS at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA-NMFS) Wildlife Algal-toxin Research and Response Network (WARRN-West) or the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). DA or STX was detected in seven of the sample types with STX below the minimum detection limit in blood for the three samples tested. DA was found in 70% and STX was found in 23% of all tested samples. The ranges of detectable levels of DA and STX in all samples were 0.65–681,190.00 ng g−1 and 2.00–20.95 ng g−1, respectively. Cloacal contents from a Pacific loon (Gavia pacifica) collected in 2017 from Ventura County, California, had the highest maximum level of DA for all samples and species tested in this study. The highest level of STX for all samples and species was detected in the bile of a northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) collected in 2018 from San Luis Obispo County, California. DA detections were consistently found in gastrointestinal samples, liver, bile, and kidney, whereas STX detections were most frequently seen in liver and bile samples. Co-occurring HAB toxins (DA and STX) were detected in white-winged scoters (Melanitta deglandi) in 2009, a Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) in 2015, and a northern fulmar and common murre (Uria aalge) in 2018. This article provides DA and STX tissue concentrations and patterns in avian samples and shows the utility of various sample types for the detection of HAB toxins. Future research to understand the pharmacodynamics of these toxins in avian species and to establish lethal doses in various bird species would be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Recurrence and severity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing due to a number of factors, including human practices and climate change. Sensitive and robust methods that allow for early and expedited HAB detection across large landscape scales are needed. Among the suite of HAB detection tools available, a powerful option exists in genetics-based approaches utilizing environmental sampling, also termed environmental DNA (eDNA). Here we provide a detailed methodological review of three HAB eDNA approaches (quantitative PCR, high throughput sequencing, and isothermal amplification). We then summarize and synthesize recently published eDNA applications covering a variety of HAB surveillance and research objectives, all with a specific emphasis in the detection of two widely problematic freshwater species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Prymnesium parvum. In our summary and conclusion we build on this literature by discussing ways in which eDNA methods could be advanced to improve HAB detection. We also discuss ways in which eDNA data could be used to potentially provide novel insight into the ecology, mitigation, and prediction of HABs.",

    "abstract": "Red tides and associated fisheries damage caused by the harmful raphidophyte Chattonella were reassessed based on the documented local records for 50 years to understand the distribution and economic impacts of the harmful species in the Western Pacific. Blooms of Chattonella with fisheries damage have been recorded in East Asia since 1969, whereas they have been only recorded in Southeast Asia since the 1980s. Occurrences of Chattonella have been documented from six Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, with mass mortalities mainly of farmed shrimp in 1980–1990s, and farmed fish in 2000–2010s. These occurrences have been reported with the names of C. antiqua, C. marina, C. ovata, C. subsalsa and Chattonella sp., owing to the difficulty of microscopic species identification, and many were not supported with molecular data. To determine the distribution of C. marina complex and C. subsalsa in Southeast Asia, molecular phylogeny and microscopic observation were also carried out for cultures obtained from Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, Philippines, Russia, Singapore and Thailand. The results revealed that only the genotype of C. marina complex has been detected from East Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Russia), whereas both C. marina complex (Indonesia and Malaysia) and C. subsalsa (Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) were found in Southeast Asia. Ejection of mucocysts has been recognized as a diagnostic character of C. subsalsa, but it was also observed in our cultures of C. marina isolated from Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, and Russia. Meanwhile, the co-occurrences of the two harmful Chattonella species in Southeast Asia, which are difficult to distinguish solely based on their morphology, suggest the importance of molecular identification of Chattonella genotypes for further understanding of their distribution and negative impacts.",

    "abstract": "Although there is growing evidence that benthic cyanobacteria represent a significant source of toxins and taste and odour (T&O) compounds in water bodies globally, water utilities rarely monitor for them. Benthic cyanobacteria grow in an array of matrices such as sediments, biofilms, and floating mats, and they can detach and colonize treatment plants. The occurrence of compounds produced by benthic species across matrix and climate types has not been systematically investigated. Consequently, there is a lack of guidance available to utilities to monitor for and mitigate the risk associated with benthic cyanobacteria. To assess toxin and T&O risk across climatic zones and provide guidance to water utilities for the monitoring of benthic mats, two field surveys were conducted across three continents. The surveys examined the occurrence of six secondary metabolites and associated genes, namely, geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), anatoxin-a, saxitoxin, microcystin, and cylindrospermopsin, in benthic environmental samples collected across three climates (i.e., temperate, sub-tropical, and tropical) and a range of matrix types. Existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and qPCR assays and were used to measure compound concentrations and their associated genes in samples. A novel qPCR assay was designed to differentiate the production of MIB by actinobacteria from that of cyanobacteria. MIB occurrence was higher in warmer climates than temperate climates. Cyanobacteria in benthic mats were the major producers of taste and odour compounds. Floating mats contained significantly higher concentrations of geosmin and saxitoxins compared to other matrix types. Samples collected in warmer areas contained significantly more saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin than samples collected in temperate climates. While these trends were mainly indicative, they can be used to establish monitoring practices. These surveys demonstrate that benthic mats are significant contributors of secondary metabolites in source water and should be monitored accordingly. Benthic cyanobacteria were the sole producers of T&O in up to 17% of the collected samples compared to actinobacteria, which were sole producers in only 1% of the samples. The surveys also provided a platform of choice for the transfer of methodologies and specific knowledge to participating utilities to assist with the establishment of monitoring practices for benthic cyanobacteria and associated secondary metabolites.",

In this study, a series of ex-situ mesoscale experiments were conducted to first develop and then monitor a Microcystis sp. bloom using a hyperspectral sensor mounted on an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) along with coincident ground sampling efforts including laboratory analyses and in-situ field probes. This approach allowed for the simultaneous evaluation of both bloom physiology (algal growth stages/life cycle) and data collection method on the performance of a suite of 41 spectrally-derived water quality algorithms across three water quality indicators (chlorophyll a, phycocyanin and turbidity) in a controlled environment. Results indicated a strong agreement between Lab and Field-based methods for all water quality indicators independent of growth phase, with regression R2-values above 0.73 for mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and 0.87 for algorithm R2 values. Three of the 41 algorithms evaluated met predetermined performance criteria (MAPE and algorithm R2 values); however, in general, algal growth phase had a substantial impact on algorithm performance, especially those with blue and violet wave bands. This study highlights the importance of co-validating sensor technologies with appropriate ground monitoring methods to gain foundational knowledge before deploying new technologies in large-scale field efforts.",

    "abstract": "This paper summarizes the research conducted by the partners of the EU co-funded CoCliME project to ascertain the ecological, human health and economic impacts of Ostreopsis (mainly O. cf. ovata) blooms in the NW Mediterranean coasts of France, Monaco and Spain. This knowledge is necessary to design strategies to prevent, mitigate and, if necessary, adapt to the impacts of these events in the future and in other regions. Ostreopsis proliferations in the Mediterranean have been related to massive mortalities of benthic organisms and to symptoms of respiratory and cutaneous irritation in humans. A six-year epidemiologic study in a Ostreopsis hot spot in Catalonia and the accumulated experience of the French Mediterranean National Ostreopsis Surveillance Network confirm the main effects of these blooms on human health in the NW Mediterranean. The impacts are associated to direct exposure to seawater with high Ostreopsis cell concentrations and to inhalation of aerosols containing unknown irritative chemicals produced under certain circumstances during the blooms. A series of mild acute symptoms, affecting the entire body as well as the ophthalmic, digestive, respiratory and dermatologic systems have been identified. A main remaining challenge is to ascertain the effects of the chronic exposure to toxic Ostreopsis blooms. Still, the mechanisms involved in the deletereous effects of Ostreopsis blooms are poorly understood. Characterizing the chemical nature of the harmful compounds synthesized by Ostreopsis as well as the role of the mucus by which cells attach to benthic surfaces, requires new technical approaches (e.g., metabolomics) and realistic and standardized ecotoxicology tests. It is also necessary to investigate how palytoxin analogues produced by O. cf. ovata could be transferred through the marine food webs, and to evaluate the real risk of seafood poisonings in the area. On the other hand, the implementation of beach monitoring and surveillance systems in the summer constitutes an effective strategy to prevent the impacts of Ostreopsis on human health. In spite of the confirmed noxious effects, a survey of tourists and residents in Nice and Monaco to ascertain the socioeconomic costs of Ostreopsis blooms indicated that the occurrence of these events and their impacts are poorly known by the general public. In relationship with a plausible near future increase of Ostreopsis blooms in the NW Mediterranean coast, this survey showed that a substantial part of the population might continue to go to the beaches during Ostreopsis proliferations and thus could be exposed to health risks. In contrast, some people would not visit the affected areas, with the potential subsequent negative impacts on coastal recreational and touristic activities. However, at this stage, it is too early to accurately assess all the economic impacts that a potentially increasing frequency and biogeographic expansion of the events might cause in the future.",

    "abstract": "The Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) and eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) are important resource bivalves found in and downstream of waterways afflicted with cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms (CHABs), respectively. This study examined the potential for C. fluminea and C. virginica to become vectors of the hepatotoxin, microcystin, from the CHAB Microcystis. Laboratory experiments were performed to quantify clearance rates, particle selection, and accumulation of the hepatotoxin, microcystin, using a microcystin-producing Microcystis culture isolated from Lake Erie (strain LE-3) and field experiments were performed with water from Microcystis blooms in Lake Agawam, NY, USA. Clearance rates of Microcystis were faster (p<0.05) than those of Raphidocelis for C. fluminea, while C. virginica cleared Microcystis and Tisochrysis at similar rates. For both bivalves, clearance rates of bloom water were slower than cultures and clams displayed significantly greater electivity for green algae compared to wild populations of cyanobacteria in field experiments while oysters did not. In experiments with cultured Microcystis comprised of single and double cells, both bivalves accumulated >3 µg microcystins g - 1 (wet weight) in 24 - 72 h, several orders of magnitude beyond California guidance value (10 ng g - 1) but accumulated only up to 2 ng microcystins g - 1 when fed bloom water dominated by large Microcystis colonies for four days. For Asian clams, clearance rates and tissue microcystin content decreased when exposed to toxic Microcystis for 3 - 4 days. In contrast, eastern oysters did not depurate microcystin over 3 - 4-day exposures and accumulated an order of magnitude more microcystin than clams. This contrast suggests Asian clams are likely to accumulate minor amounts of microcystin by reducing clearance rates during blooms of Microcystis, selectively feeding on green algae, and depurating microcystin whereas oysters are more likely to accumulate microcystins and thus are more likely to be a vector for hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning in estuaries downstream of Microcystis blooms.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) are pervasive sources of stress resulting in neurotoxicity in fish. A member of the widely distributed Microcystis genus of bloom-forming cyanobacteria, Microcystis wesenbergii can be found in many freshwater lakes, including Dianchi Lake (China), where it has become one of the dominant contributors to the lake's recurrent blooms. However, unlike its more well-known counterpart M. aeruginosa, the effects of dense non-microcystin-containing M. wesenbergii blooms are seldom studied. The disturbance of appetite regulation and feeding behaviour can have downstream effects on the growth of teleost fish, posing a significant challenge to aquaculture and conservation efforts. Here we examined the effects of M. wesenbergii blooms on the food intake of Acrossocheilus yunnanensis, a native cyprinid in southern China. This fish species has disappeared in Dianchi Lake, and its reintroduction might be negatively affected by the presence of this newly-dominant Microcystis species. We co-cultured juvenile A. yunnanensis with a non-microcystin-producing strain of M. wesenbergii at initial densities between 5 × 104 and 1 × 106 cells/mL and monitored fish feeding behaviour and changes in neurotransmitter and hormone protein levels. High-density M. wesenbergii cultures increased the feeding rate of co-cultured fish, elevating concentrations of appetite-stimulating signalling molecules (Agouti-related protein and γ-aminobutyric acid), while decreasing inhibitory ones (POMC). These changes coincided with histopathological alterations and reduced somatic indices in brain and intestinal tissues. Given this potential for detrimental effects and dysregulation of food intake, further studies are necessary to determine the impacts of chronic exposure of M. wesenbergii in wild fish.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs), varying in intensity and causative species, have historically occurred throughout the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.; however, phycotoxin data are sparse. The spatiotemporal distribution of phycotoxins was investigated using solid-phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) across 12 shallow, nearshore sites within the lower Chesapeake Bay and Virginia's coastal bays over one year (2017-2018). Eight toxins, azaspiracid-1 (AZA1), azaspiracid-2 (AZA2), microcystin-LR (MC-LR), domoic acid (DA), okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), and goniodomin A (GDA) were detected in SPATT extracts. Temporally, phycotoxins were always present in the region, with at least one phycotoxin group (i.e., consisting of OA and DTX1) detected at every time point. Co-occurrence of phycotoxins was also common; two or more toxin groups were observed in 76% of the samples analyzed. Toxin maximums: 0.03 ng AZA2/g resin/day, 0.25 ng DA/g resin/day, 15 ng DTX1/g resin/day, 61 ng OA/g resin/day, 72 ng PTX2/g resin/day, and 102,050 ng GDA/g resin/day were seasonal, with peaks occurring in summer and fall. Spatially, the southern tributary and coastal bay regions harbored the highest amount of total phycotoxins on SPATT over the year, and the former contained the greatest diversity of phycotoxins. The novel detection of AZAs in the region, before a causative species has been identified, supports the use of SPATT as an explorative tool in respect to emerging threats. The lack of karlotoxin in SPATT extracts, but detection of Karlodinium veneficum by microscopy, however, emphasizes that this tool should be considered complementary to, but not a replacement for, more traditional HAB management and monitoring methods.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms produce toxins that bioaccumulate in the food web and adversely affect humans, animals, and entire marine ecosystems. Blooms of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia can produce domoic acid (DA), a toxin that most commonly causes neurological disease in endothermic animals, with cardiovascular effects that were first recognized in southern sea otters. Over the last 20 years, DA toxicosis has caused significant morbidity and mortality in marine mammals and seabirds along the west coast of the USA. Identifying DA exposure has been limited to toxin detection in biological fluids using biochemical assays, yet measurement of systemic toxin levels is an unreliable indicator of exposure dose or timing. Furthermore, there is little information regarding repeated DA exposure in marine wildlife. Here, the association between long-term environmental DA exposure and fatal cardiac disease was investigated in a longitudinal study of 186 free-ranging sea otters in California from 2001 – 2017, highlighting the chronic health effects of a marine toxin. A novel Bayesian spatiotemporal approach was used to characterize environmental DA exposure by combining several DA surveillance datasets and integrating this with life history data from radio-tagged otters in a time-dependent survival model. In this study, a sea otter with high DA exposure had a 1.7-fold increased hazard of fatal cardiomyopathy compared to an otter with low exposure. Otters that consumed a high proportion of crab and clam had a 2.5- and 1.2-times greater hazard of death due to cardiomyopathy than otters that consumed low proportions. Increasing age is a well-established predictor of cardiac disease, but this study is the first to identify that DA exposure affects the risk of cardiomyopathy more substantially in prime-age adults than aged adults. A 4-year-old otter with high DA exposure had 2.3 times greater risk of fatal cardiomyopathy than an otter with low exposure, while a 10-year old otter with high DA exposure had just 1.2 times greater risk. High Toxoplasma gondii titers also increased the hazard of death due to heart disease 2.4-fold. Domoic acid exposure was most detrimental for prime-age adults, whose survival and reproduction are vital for population growth, suggesting that persistent DA exposure will likely impact long-term viability of this threatened species. These results offer insight into the pervasiveness of DA in the food web and raise awareness of under-recognized chronic health effects of DA for wildlife at a time when toxic blooms are on the rise.",

    "abstract": "Marine biotoxins accumulating in seafood products pose a risk to human health. These toxins are often potent in minute amounts and contained within complex matrices; requiring sensitive, reliable, and robust methods for their detection. The mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cytotoxicity assay (N2a-assay) is a sensitive, high-throughput, in vitro method effective for detecting sodium channel-specific marine biotoxins. The N2a-assay can be conducted to distinguish between specific effects on voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels, caused by toxins that activate (e.g., ciguatoxins (CTXs), brevetoxins (PbTxs)) or block (e.g., tetrodotoxins, saxitoxins) the target NaV. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay to compounds activating the NaV are achieved through the addition of the pharmaceuticals ouabain (O) and veratridine (V). However, these compounds can be toxic to Neuro-2a cells and their application at insufficient or excessive concentrations can reduce the effectiveness of this assay for marine toxin detection. Therefore, during growth incubation, Neuro-2a cells were exposed to O and V, and surviving cells exhibiting a lower sensitivity to O and V (OV-LS) were propagated. OV-LS Neuro-2a cells were selected for 60-80% survival when exposed to 0.22/0.022 mM O/V during the cytotoxicity assay. At these conditions, OV-LS N2a cells demonstrated a 3.5-fold higher survival rate 71% ± 7.9 SD (n = 232), and lower sensitivity to O/V, compared to the original Neuro-2a cells 20% ± 9.0 SD (n = 16). Additionally, OV-LS N2a cells were 1.3-2.6-fold more sensitive for detecting CTX3C 1.35 pg/ml, CTX1B 2.06 pg/ml, and PbTx-3 3.04 ng/ml compared to Neuro-2a cells using 0.1/0.01 mM O/V. Detection of CTX3C in a complex fish matrix using OV-LS cells was 0.0048 pg CTX3C/mg fish tissue equivalent. This work shows the potential for a significant improvement in sensitivity for CTX3C, CTX1B, and PbTx-3 using the OV-LS N2a-assay.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria play a significant role in ecosystem functioning as photosynthetic and CO2 fixing microorganisms. Whether and to what extent cyanophages alter these carbon and energy cycles in their cyanobacterial hosts is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated changes in photosynthetic activity (PSII), expression of genes associated with the light phase of photosynthesis (psbA, petA, ndhK) and carbon metabolism (rbcL, zwf) as well as intracellular ATP and NADHP concentrations in freshwater bloom-forming filamentous cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae infected by cyanophage vB_AphaS-CL131. We found that PSII activity and expression level of rbcL genes, indicating potential for CO2 fixation, had decreased in response to cyanophage adsorption and DNA injection. During the period of viral DNA replication and assembly, PSII performance and gene expression remained at this decreased level and did not change significantly, indicating lack of transcriptional shutdown by the cyanophage. Combined, these observations suggest that although there is little to no interference between cyanophage DNA replication, host transcription and cellular metabolism, A. flos-aquae underwent a physiological state-shift toward lower efficiency of carbon and energy cycling. This further suggest potential cascading effect for co-occurring non-infected members of the microbial community.",

The invasive cyanobacteria Raphidiopsis raciborskii a toxin-producing and bloom-forming species affecting local biodiversity and ecosystem services is currently expanding its range across Europe. We used species distribution models (SDMs) and regional bioclimatic environmental variables, such as temperature and precipitation, to identify suitable areas for the colonization and survival of R. raciborskii, with special focus on the geographic extent of potential habitats in Northern Europe. SDMs predictions uncovered areas of high occurrence probability of R. raciborskii in locations where it has not been recorded yet, e.g. some areas in Central and Northern Europe. In the southeastern part of Sweden, areas of suitable climate for R. raciborskii corresponded with lakes of high concentrations of total phosphorus, increasing the risk of the species to thrive. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict areas at high risk of R. raciborskii colonization in Europe. The results from this study suggest several areas across Europe that would need monitoring programs to determine if the species is present or not, to be able to prevent its potential colonization and population growth. Regarding an undesirable microorganism like R. raciborskii, authorities may need to start information campaigns to avoid or minimize the spread.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) negatively affect ecological, human, and animal health. Traditional methods of validating satellite algorithms with data from water samples are often inhibited by the expense of quantifying cyanobacteria indicators in the field and the lack of public data. However, state recreation advisories and other recorded events of cyanoHAB occurrence reported by local authorities can serve as an independent and publicly available dataset for validation. State recreation advisories were defined as a period delimited by a start and end date where a warning was issued due to detections of cyanoHABs over a state's risk threshold. State reported events were defined as any event that was documented with a single date related to cyanoHABs. This study examined the presence-absence agreement between 160 state reported cyanoHAB advisories and 1,343 events and cyanobacteria biomass estimated by a satellite algorithm called the Cyanobacteria Index (CIcyano). The true positive rate of agreement with state recreation advisories was 69% and 60% with state reported events. CIcyano detected a reduction or absence in cyanobacteria after 76% of the recreation advisories ended. CIcyano was used to quantify the magnitude, spatial extent, and temporal frequency of cyanoHABs; each of these three metrics were greater (r > 0.2) during state recreation advisories compared to non-advisory times with effect sizes ranging from small to large. This is the first study to quantitatively evaluate satellite algorithm performance for detecting cyanoHABs with state reported events and advisories and supports informed management decisions with satellite technologies that complement traditional field observations.",

    "abstract": "Numerous products and techniques are used to combat harmful cyanobacterial blooms in lakes. In this study, we tested nine products, the phosphate binders Phoslock® and Aqual-PTM, the coagulant chitosan, the phosphorus binder and coagulant aluminum salts (aluminum sulphate and sodium aluminate), the copper-based algicides SeClear, Captain® XTR and CuSO4·5H2O, the antibiotic Streptomycin and the oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on their efficiency to manage the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa). To this end, 7 days of laboratory experiments were conducted and effects were determined on chlorophyll-a, photosystem II efficiency (PSII), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and intracellular and extracellular microcystin (MC) concentrations. The algicides, chitosan and H2O2 were the most powerful in reducing cyanobacteria biomass. Biomass reductions compared to the controls yielded: Chitosan (99.8%) > Hydrogen peroxide (99.6%) > Captain XTR (98.2%) > SeClear (98.1%) > CuSO4·5H2O (97.8%) > Streptomycin (86.6%) > Phoslock® (42.6%) > Aqual-PTM (28.4%) > alum (5.5%). Compounds that caused the largest reductions in biomass also strongly lowered photosystem II efficiency, while the other compounds (Phoslock®, Aqual-PTM, aluminum salts) had no effect on PSII, but strongly reduced SRP. Intracellular MC concentration followed the biomass patterns, extracellular MC was generally lower at higher doses of algicides, chitosan and H2O2 after one week. Recovery of PSII was observed in most algicides and chitosan, but not at the highest doses of SeClear and in all streptomycin treatments. Our results revealed that M. aeruginosa can be killed rapidly using several compounds, that in some treatments already signs of recovery occurred within one week. P fixatives are efficient in reducing SRP, and thus acting via resource suppression, which potentially may provide an addition to fast-acting algicides that kill most of the cells, but allow rapid regrowth as sufficient nutrients remain.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms releasing harmful cyanotoxins, such as microcystin (MC) and cylindrospermopsin (CYN), are prominent threats to human and animal health. Constructed wetlands (CW) may be a nature-based solution for bioremediation of lake surface water containing cyanotoxins, due to its low-cost requirement of infrastructure and environmentally friendly operation. There is recent evidence that microcystin-LR (MC-LR) can efficiently be removed in CW microcosms where CYN degradation in CW is unknown. Likewise, the mechanistic background regarding cyanotoxins transformation in CW is not yet elucidated. In the present study, the objective was to compare MC-LR and CYN degradation efficiencies by two similar microbial communities obtained from CW mesocosms, by two different experiments setup: 1) in vitro batch experiment in serum bottles with an introduced CW community, and 2) degradation in CW mesocosms. In experiment 1) MC-LR and CYN were spiked at 100 µg L−1 and in experiment 2) 200 µg L−1 were spiked. Results showed that MC-LR was degraded to ≤1 µg L−1 within seven days in both experiments. However, with a markedly higher degradation rate constant in the CW mesocosms (0.18 day−1 and 0.75 day−1, respectively). No CYN removal was detected in the in vitro incubations, whereas around 50 % of the spiked CYN was removed in the CW mesocosms. The microbial community responded markedly to the cyanotoxin treatment, with the most prominent increase of bacteria affiliated with Methylophilaceae (order: Methylophilales, phylum: Proteobacteria). The results strongly indicate that CWs can develop an active microbial community capable of efficient removal of MC-LR and CYN. However, the CW operational conditions need to be optimized to achieve a full CYN degradation. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the ability of CW mesocosms to degrade CYN.",

In 2018, the death of three dogs along the Wolastoq (also known as the Saint John River) in New Brunswick, Canada, was attributed to anatoxin exposure after they ingested benthic microbial mats found along the shore. Here, we shotgun sequenced the DNA of 15 non-axenic cyanobacterial isolates derived from four anatoxin-containing benthic mat samples associated with the dog deaths. Anatoxins were produced by some of the isolates, but not all. We retrieved near-complete Microcoleus metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the isolates that are closely related to anatoxin-producing Microcoleus from the Cardrona River (New Zealand), although the Microcoleus MAGs from the Wolastoq varied in the presence/absence of the anatoxin-a biosynthesis cluster. Sequence similarity at the genomic level suggests that toxigenic and non-toxigenic Microcoleus MAGs from the Wolastoq belong to the same species but are separate subspecies. The toxigenic and nontoxic Wolastoq Microcoleus subspecies coexisted in the mat samples in similar relative abundance. Overall genomic comparisons revealed that toxigenic Microcoleus MAGs are longer and code for more accessory genes than their non-toxigenic relatives, suggesting a differential responsiveness to changing environments, stress conditions and nutrient availability.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the first evidence that a diverse suite of phycotoxins is not only being actively produced by the toxigenic algal communities in the Canadian Arctic waters, but is also entering the marine food web. We detected measurable amounts of Amnesic Shellfish Toxins (ASTs) and Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PSTs), as well as trace amounts of other lipophilic toxin groups including pectenotoxins, yessotoxins, and cyclic imines, in bivalves collected from the Canadian Beaufort Sea in 2014 and 2018. There appear to be species-specific differences in accumulation and retention of AST by Arctic bivalves, with significantly higher concentrations recorded in Nuculanidae than Propeamussiidae, likely reflecting physiological and allometric differences. We further confirm the omnipresence of potentially toxic taxonomically-versatile phytoplankton communities in the western Canadian Arctic comprising Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima group, P. obtusa, Dinophysis acuminata, Prorocentrum minimum, Alexandrium tamarense, and Gymnodinium spp. Although measurements of actual toxicity levels and profiles of these species at the time of sampling fall outside of the scope of this study, we show that high abundance and competitive success of known AST-producers, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., are possible in Canadian Arctic waters. In 2014, a strong dominance of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. was observed at a few shallow coastal stations, representing nearly 40% of the total phytoplankton cell abundances with > 106 cells/L at the depth of maximum chlorophyll a. We further describe oceanographic conditions conducive to high abundances of toxin-producing algae, indicating that temperature is likely a key factor. Even though measured AST and PST concentrations in bivalve tissue remained well below the Health Canada's levels at which monitored fisheries would close, i.e., 5% and 4%, respectively, their presence demonstrate that phycotoxin accumulation is occurring in food webs of the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Yet, the phycotoxin production controls and trophic transfer mechanisms remain unknown. Canadian Arctic marine ecosystems are rapidly changing and temperatures are expected to continue to increase. Given that these changes simultaneously affect multiple, and often co-occurring, species of primary producers, adaptive capacity is likely to play an important role in the structure of phytoplankton communities in the Canadian Arctic.",

    "abstract": "Summer cyanobacterial blooms exhibit a dynamic interplay between toxic and non-toxic genotypes, significantly influencing the cyanotoxin levels within a lake. The challenge lies in accurately predicting these toxin concentrations due to the significant temporal fluctuations in the proportions of toxic and non-toxic genotypes. Typically, the toxic genotypes dominate during the early and late summer periods, while the non-toxic variants prevail in mid-summer. To dissect this phenomenon, we propose a model that accounts for the competitive interaction between toxic and non-toxic genotypes, as well as seasonal temperature variations. Our numerical simulations suggest that the optimal temperature of the toxic genotypes is lower than that of the optimal temperatures of the non-toxic counterparts. This difference of optimal temperature may potentially contribute to explain the dominance of toxic genotypes at the early and late summer periods, situation often observed in the field. Experimental data from the laboratory align qualitatively with our simulation results, enabling a better understanding of complex interplays between toxic and non-toxic cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) threaten public health and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. In this study, our main goal was to explore the dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms and how microcystins (MCs) move from the Lalla Takerkoust reservoir to the nearby farms. We used Landsat imagery, molecular analysis, collecting and analyzing physicochemical data, and assessing toxins using HPLC. Our investigation identified two cyanobacterial species responsible for the blooms: Microcystis sp. and Synechococcus sp. Our Microcystis strain produced three MC variants (MC-RR, MC-YR, and MC-LR), with MC-RR exhibiting the highest concentrations in dissolved and intracellular toxins. In contrast, our Synechococcus strain did not produce any detectable toxins. To validate our Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) results, we utilized limnological data, including algal cell counts, and quantified MCs in freeze-dried Microcystis bloom samples collected from the reservoir. Our study revealed patterns and trends in cyanobacterial proliferation in the reservoir over 30 years and presented a historical map of the area of cyanobacterial infestation using the NDVI method. The study found that MC-LR accumulates near the water surface due to the buoyancy of Microcystis. The maximum concentration of MC-LR in the reservoir water was 160 µgL−1. In contrast, 4 km downstream of the reservoir, the concentration decreased by a factor of 5.39 to 29.63 µgL−1, indicating a decrease in MC-LR concentration with increasing distance from the bloom source. Similarly, the MC-YR concentration decreased by a factor of 2.98 for the same distance. Interestingly, the MC distribution varied with depth, with MC-LR dominating at the water surface and MC-YR at the reservoir outlet at a water depth of 10 m. Our findings highlight the impact of nutrient concentrations, environmental factors, and transfer processes on bloom dynamics and MC distribution. We emphasize the need for effective management strategies to minimize toxin transfer and ensure public health and safety.",

In August 2022, a harmful algal bloom (HAB) of this species occurred in the lower Oder River (Poland and Germany), which caused mass mortalities of fish and other organisms. This HAB was linked to low discharge of the Oder and mining activities that caused a significant increase in salinity. In this context, we report on the molecular detection and screening of this haptophyte and its toxins in environmental samples and clonal cultures derived thereof. Both conventional PCR and droplet digital PCR assays reliably detected P. parvum in environmental samples. eDNA metabarcoding using the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene revealed a single Prymnesium sequence variant, but failed to identify it to species level. Four clonal cultures established from environmental samples were unambiguously identified as P. parvum by molecular phylogenetics (near full-length 18S rRNA gene) and light microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 marker region) placed the cultured phylotype within a clade containing other P. parvum strains known to produce B-type prymnesins. Toxin-screening of the cultures using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry identified B-type prymnesins, which were also detected in extracts of filter residues from water samples of the Oder collected during the HAB. Overall, our investigation provides a detailed characterization of P. parvum, including their prymnesins, during this HAB in the Oder River, contributing valuable insights into this ecological disaster. In addition, the droplet digital PCR assay established here will be useful for future monitoring of low levels of P. parvum on the Oder River or any other salt-impacted and brackish water bodies.",

    "abstract": "In May–June 2019, the microalga Chrysochromulina leadbeateri caused a massive fish-killing event in several fjords in Northern Norway, resulting in the largest direct impact ever on aquaculture in northern Europe due to toxic algae. Motivated by the fact that no algal toxins have previously been described from C. leadbeateri, we set out to investigate the chemical nature and toxicity of secondary metabolites in extracts of two strains (UIO 393, UIO 394) isolated from the 2019 bloom, as well as one older strain (UIO 035) isolated during a bloom in Northern Norway in 1991. Initial LC–DAD–MS/MS-based molecular networking analysis of the crude MeOH extracts of the cultivated strains showed that their profiles of small organic molecules, including a large number of known lipids, were very similar, suggesting that the same class of toxin(s) were likely the causative agents of the two harmful algal bloom (HAB) events. Next, bioassay-guided fractionation using the RTgill-W1 cell line and metabolomics analysis pointed to a major compound affording [M + H]+ ions at m/z 1399.8333 as a possible toxin, corresponding to a compound with the formula C67H127ClO27. Moreover, our study unveiled a series of minor analogues exhibiting distinct patterns of chlorination and sulfation, together defining a new family of compounds, which we propose to name leadbeaterins. Remarkably, these suspected toxins were detected in situ in samples collected during the 2019 bloom close to Tromsø, thereby consistent with a role in fish kills. The elemental compositions of the putative C. leadbeateri ichthyotoxins strongly indicate them to be long linear polyhydroxylated polyketides, structurally similar to sterolysins reported from a number of dinoflagellates.",

This harmful algal bloom forming species can alter food webs, reduce ecosystem productivity, and lead to economic losses while causing lower aquacultural yields. After the 1990s, N. scintillans abundances have significantly increased by 1.65-fold and a significant prolongation of the bloom window was found (from 27.5 to 98 days in recent decades) off the island of Helgoland, Germany. Significant correlations were found between bloom initiation and nutrients, as well as light availability since these factors lead to increased prey availability. Highest abundances of N. scintillans were associated with water temperatures around 17 °C and wind speed below 6 ms",

    "abstract": "Amphidoma languida, a marine thecate dinoflagellate that produces the lipophilic toxin azaspiracids (AZAs), is primarily found in the Atlantic. Although this species has not been recorded in the Asian Pacific, environmental DNAs related to Am. languida have been widely detected in the region by metabarcoding analysis. Their morphology and AZA production remain unclear. In this study, the morphology, ultrastructure, phylogeny, and AZA production of nine Amphidoma strains isolated from Japan, Malaysia, and Philippines were investigated. Phylogenetic trees inferred from rDNAs (SSU, ITS, and LSU rDNA) showed monophyly of the nine Pacific strains and were sister to the Am. languida clade, including the toxigenic strains from the Atlantic. Cells were ellipsoid, 8.7-16.7 µm in length and 7.4-14.0 µm in width, with a conspicuous apical pore complex. A large nucleus in the hyposome, parietal chloroplast with a spherical pyrenoid in the episome, and refractile bodies were observed. Thecal tabulation was typical of Amphidoma, Po, cp, X, 6', 6'', 6C, 5S, 6''', 2''''. A ventral pore was located on the anterior of 1' plate, beside the suture to 6' plate. The presence of a ventral depression, on the anterior of anterior sulcal plate, was different from Am. languida. A large antapical pore, containing approximately 10 small pores, was observed. Cells were apparently smaller than Am. trioculata, a species possessing three pores (ventral pore, ventral depression, and antapical pore). TEM showed the presence of crystalline structures, resembling guanine crystals, and cytoplasmic invaginations into the pyrenoid matrix. Flagellar apparatus lacking the striated root connective is similar to peridinioids and related dinoflagellates. AZAs were not detected from the Pacific strains by LC-MS/MS. This non-toxigenic Amphidoma species, here we propose as Amphidoma fulgens sp. nov., is widely distributed in the Asian Pacific. Moreover, molecular comparison also suggested that most of the environmental DNA sequences previously reported as Am. languida or related sequences from the Asian Pacific were attributable to Am. fulgens.",

    "abstract": "Ciguatera poisoning is the most prevalent non-bacterial seafood illness globally, with an estimated 10,000 to 50,000 human cases reported annually. While most symptoms are generally mild, some cases can result in severe and long-lasting neurological and psychological damage, and in some instances, even death. The known causative agents of ciguatera poisoning are benthic toxic dinoflagellate species belonging to the genera Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa. These species produce highly potent ciguatoxins that bioaccumulate through the marine food chain, eventually reaching humans through seafood consumption. Although Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa species are widespread in tropical waters worldwide, the full extent of their distribution remains uncertain. This review provides a detailed examination of the ecological dynamics of these dinoflagellates and explores the diverse range of detection methods used to monitor them. These include a focus on molecular techniques for detection, alongside morphological methods, emerging technologies, and a toxin detection overview. Additionally, we offer recommendations on how the field can advance, highlighting novel solutions and next steps for improving detection and monitoring practices. By assessing the strengths and limitations of current approaches and proposing directions for future research, this review aims to support efforts in better understanding and mitigating the risk of ciguatera poisoning.",

    "abstract": "Detecting and quantifying cyanobacteria algal bloom occurrence plays an important role in preventing public health risks and understanding aquatic ecosystem dynamics. Satellite remote sensing has been used as an important data source to estimate cyanobacteria biomass based on pigment concentration. Phycocyanin (PC) is a unique pigment of inland water cyanobacteria and has been widely used as a proxy for cyanobacteria algal biomass. Based on the PC absorption feature around 620 nm, scientific efforts have been made to develop bio-optical models for orbital satellite observations, but proposed PC models limit the retrievals at different concentration ranges and depend on empirical models calibrated for specific aquatic environments. This study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for PC retrieval that efficiently adopts the optimal algorithm for specific PC concentration ranges. An in-situ dataset of 165 samples was collected between November 2020 and December 2021 to support full training and validation of the proposed method. First, a Random Forest algorithm was applied to classify PC-low-concentration waters (0 - ∼14 mg.m-3) and PC-high-concentration waters (∼14.1 - 300 mg.m-3). Then, for each defined class, an individual PC estimation algorithm was calibrated. The final PC-hybrid model was applied to atmospherically corrected Sentinel-3/OLCI imagery derived by three approaches (L2-WFR, 6SV, and ACOLITE). The PC hybrid-model performance was evaluated by comparing the estimated PC concentration from satellite and in situ measurements. The hybrid PC model estimates (median symmetric accuracy (ζ) = 25.35%) outperformed the individual PC algorithms calibrated for the entire range of PC concentration, proving the practical applicability for quantifying PC concentration in optically dynamic waters.",

Despite genomic evidence that it belongs to Group III and so closely related to isolates from Puerto Rico, Malaysia, North America, and Central America, M. polykrikoides blooms in the Chesapeake Bay at warmer temperatures and lower salinities than in coastal ecosystems occupied by its closest relatives. In this study, the effect of temperature and salinity on the growth rate and total cell yield of an M. polykrikoides VA culture isolate were examined and compared with environmental observations made during M. polykrikoides blooms in the Chesapeake Bay. M. polykrikoides group III VA strain grew at 18-32 ̊C and 15-30 salinity. M. polykrikoides group III VA strain grew better at warmer temperatures and lower salinities than other M. polykrikoides strains from related groups, but did not grow at 16 or 34 ̊C or at a salinity of 10. Low salinity and excessively warm temperatures interacted to inhibit M. polykrikoides group III VA strain growth at 32 ̊C and 15 salinity. Temperature and salinity likely interact in estuarine waters to inhibit or promote M. polykrikoides bloom initiation and development. The range of water temperatures observed during M. polykrikoides blooms in the Chesapeake Bay was narrower than what was observed for most of the other dinoflagellate species that bloom there, but the range of salinity was the broadest. M. polykrikoides bloomed at warmer temperatures and higher salinities than most of the other bloom-forming dinoflagellate species in the Bay.",

    "abstract": "Several methods to monitor cyanobacteria exist, based partly on characteristics that differentiate cyanobacteria from other phytoplankton, such as pigmentation and morphology. However, it is not certain whether all methods give similar insights into the development and properties of a cyanobacterial bloom. It is important to understand the level of consistency of measurements, especially in the case of novel methods. In situ imaging flow cytometry provides community composition information at high frequency but has been little used for filamentous bloom-forming cyanobacteria. To understand if different methods agree, we compared multi-year biomass data collected with Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), CytoSense (CS), phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence, and turbidity sensors, light microscopy, and satellite-based Frequency of Cyanobacteria Accumulations (FCA). Continuous high-throughput data was recorded at Utö Atmospheric and Marine Research Station in the Baltic Sea during summers 2018-2022, along with samples for light microscopy and adjacent satellite observations. The IFCB cyanobacteria biomass pattern most closely resembled those of CS and PC fluorescence. IFCB also described the blooms similarly to FCA, and to some extent to turbidity, but differed from Chl a fluorescence. IFCB and light microscopy agreed on the bloom development and species composition but differed concerning exact biomass. Our study demonstrates that both IFCB and CS are suitable for studying filamentous cyanobacteria and that in situ imaging flow cytometry provides valuable support for cyanobacteria monitoring by yielding detailed high-frequency taxon-specific information. Still, the best overall coverage of rapid biological processes such as bloom development is achieved with the parallel use of multiple observation techniques.",

    "abstract": "A key aspect of algal biology is the production of chemicals used for communication and regulation of interactions. Allelopathic chemicals can facilitate competition between algae, influence community composition and drive succession in the phytoplankton. Much is still unknown about the identities of these allelochemicals, and even the ecological relevance of laboratory derived results is often unclear. We sought to evaluate the variability of allelopathy employing a systematic approach. We used Prymnesium parvum as a model to assess species-specificity of allelopathic interactions in laboratory co-cultivations. We assessed the influence of media, ratio of cell densities of the interaction partners and evaluation methods (monitoring of chlorophyll a versus cell density) on the outcome of co-cultivation experiments. Five tested ecologically relevant phytoplankton species, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Emiliania (presently Gephyrocapsa) huxleyi, Florenciella parvula, Ochromonas triangulata, and Pavlova gyrans, exhibited and experienced varying positive and negative allelopathic effects in interactions with P. parvum. Further, we document pronounced effects of variations of laboratory parameters. Among the ten possible bidirectional allelopathic relationships, half of the allelopathic effects were changed by one or more of the variable parameters tested. Allelopathy is thus not only a species-specific trait but additionally depends on the external factors present during the interactions. We support our findings through the identification of interaction patterns from mining the Tara Oceans database for reoccurring trends in natural and laboratory communities. This study strongly supports the notion that allelopathic activity of an alga is not only a species-specific property but also depends on many external parameters that have to be considered and thoroughly documented in future studies of allelopathy.",

    "abstract": "Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a persistent problem that threatens human health and the availability of shellfish resources in Alaska. Regular outbreaks of marine dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium produce paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) that make shellfish consumption unsafe, and impose economic hardships on Alaska's shellfish industry. Phytoplankton and environmental monitoring spanning 2008-2016, and a pilot benthic cyst survey in 2016, were focused in the Juneau region of Southeast Alaska to investigate Alexandrium catenella distributions and conditions favorable to bloom development. Overwintering Alexandrium cysts were found in near-shore sediments throughout the study region. Alexandrium catenella cells were present in the water column across a range of sea surface temperatures (7-15 °C) and surface salinities (S = 4-30); however, an optimal temperature/salinity window (10-13 °C, 18-23) supported highest cell concentrations. Measurable levels of PSTs were associated with lower concentrations (100 cells L-1) of A. catenella, indicating high cell densities may not be required for shellfish toxicity to occur. Several interacting local factors were identified to support A. catenella blooms: 1) sea surface temperatures ≥7 °C; 2) increasing air temperature; 3) low to moderate freshwater discharge; and 4) several consecutive days of dry and calm weather. In combination, these bloom favorable conditions coincide with toxic bloom events during May and June in northern Southeast Alaska. These findings highlight how integrated environmental and phytoplankton monitoring can be used to enhance early warning capacity of toxic bloom events, providing more informed guidance to shellfish harvesters and resource managers in Alaska.",

    "abstract": "Blooms of ichthyotoxic microalgae pose a great challenge to the aquaculture industry world-wide, and there is a need for fast and specific methods for their detection and quantification in monitoring programs. In this study, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays for the detection and enumeration of three ichthyotoxic flagellates: the dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi (Miyake & Kominami ex Oda) Hansen & Moestrup and the two raphidophytes Heterosigma akashiwo (Hada) Hada ex Hara & Chihara and Fibrocapsa japonica Toriumi & Takano were developed. Further, a previously published qPCR assay for the dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum (Ballantine) Larsen was used. Monthly samples collected for three years (Aug 2009–Jun 2012) in outer Oslofjorden, Norway were analysed, and the results compared with light microscopy cell counts. The results indicate a higher sensitivity and a lower detection limit (down to 1 cell L−1) for both qPCR assays. Qualitative and semi-quantitative results were further compared with those obtained by environmental 454 high throughput sequencing (HTS, metabarcoding) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination from the same samplings. All four species were detected by qPCR and HTS and/or SEM in outer Oslofjorden (Aug 2009–Jun 2012); Karlodinium veneficum was present year-round, whereas Karenia mikimotoi, Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica appeared mainly during the autumn in all three years. This is the first observation of Fibrocapsa japonica in Norwegian coastal waters. This species has previously been recorded off the Swedish west coast and German Bight, which may suggest a northward dispersal.",

    "abstract": "Florida red tides are harmful algae blooms caused by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, which occur along Florida's gulf coast almost annually. In recent years Florida red tide blooms have become more common, frequent, and intense. Florida's southwest coast, from Manatee to Collier County, has experienced repeated and prolonged K. brevis blooms since 2011 with the most recent bloom in 2017 lasting 17 months and resulting in both hypoxic and anoxic events. We therefore determined the survival and level of lethargy (e.g., lack of responsiveness or reduction in behavioral reactions) of sublegal stone crabs to K. brevis and hypoxia as both singular and simultaneous stressors. Crabs were randomly assigned to one of six treatments that included: 1) high concentration of toxic K. brevis (> 1 million cells L−1) maintained at normoxic levels (7.2 mg L−1 ± S.D. 0.47 dissolved oxygen), 2) moderate hypoxia (1.6 mg L−1 ± S.D. 0.42 dissolved oxygen) with no K. brevis, 3) moderate hypoxia (1.5 mg L−1 ± S.D. 0.43 dissolved oxygen) with a high concentration of K. brevis, 4) severe hypoxia with no K. brevis (0.69 mg L−1 ± S.D. 0.36 dissolved oxygen), 5) severe hypoxia (0.63 mg L−1 ± S.D. 0.40 dissolved oxygen) with a high concentration of K. brevis, and 6) a normoxic control (7.3 mg L−1 ± S.D. 0.61 dissolved oxygen) with no K. brevis. Survival and stone crab lethargy or responsiveness was monitored every 10–12 h for six days. Crabs simultaneously exposed to K. brevis and severe hypoxia exhibited a 43% decrease in survival and experienced increased lethargy within 24 h relative to the control (7% decrease in survival, no increase in lethargy). The increase in stress level and sluggish behavior during exposure to hypoxia was evident by a general lack of responsiveness or movement which indicates that nearshore populations of stone crabs are unlikely to emigrate away from such conditions suggesting that future harvests may be reduced following prolonged K. brevis blooms and hypoxic events.",

    "abstract": "Summer bivalve shellfish mortalities have been observed in Puget Sound for nearly a century and attempts to understand and mitigate these losses have been only partially successful. Likewise, the understanding of the environmental conditions triggering shellfish mortalities and successful strategies for their mitigation are incomplete. In the literature, phytoplankton have played only a cursory role in summer shellfish mortalities in Washington State because spawning stress and bacteria were thought to be the primary causes. In recent years, the occurrence of Protoceratium reticulatum (Claparede & Lachmann) Buetschli and Akashiwo sanguinea (Hirasaka) Hansen & Moestrup, have been documented by the SoundToxins research and monitoring partnership in increasing numbers and duration and have been associated with declining shellfish health or mortality at various sites in Puget Sound. Blooms of these species occur primarily in summer months and have been shown to cause mass mortalities of shellfish in the U.S. and other parts of the world. In 2016-2017, yessotoxins (YTX) were measured in several species of Puget Sound bivalve shellfish, with a maximum concentration of 2.20 mg/kg in blue mussels, a value below the regulatory limit of 3.75 mg/kg established by the European Union for human health protection but documented to cause shellfish mortalities in other locations around the world. In July 2019, a bloom of P. reticulatum coincided with a summer shellfish mortality event, involving a dramatic surfacing of stressed, gaping Manila clams, suggesting that YTX could be the cause. YTX concentrations in their tissues were measured at a maximum of 0.28 mg/kg and histology of these clams demonstrated damage to digestive glands. A culture of P. reticulatum, isolated from North Bay during this massive bloom and shellfish mortality event, showed YTX reaching 26.6 pg/cell, the highest recorded toxin quota measured in the U.S. to date. Concentrations of YTX in phytoplankton samples reached a maximum of 920 ng/L during a P. reticulatum bloom in Mystery Bay on 13 August 2019 when cell abundance reached 1.82 million cells/L. The highest cellular YTX quota during that bloom that lasted into September was 10.8 pg/cell on 3 Sept 2019. Shellfish producers in Washington State have also noted shellfish larvae mortalities due to A. sanguinea passing through filtration intake systems into hatchery facilities. Early warning of shellfish-killing harmful algal bloom (HAB) presence in Puget Sound, through partnerships such as SoundToxins, provides options for shellfish growers to mitigate their effects through early harvest, movement of shellstock to upland facilities, or enhanced filtration at aquaculture facilities.",

    "abstract": "In the Pacific Northwest, blooms of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia (PN) sometimes produce domoic acid, a neurotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning, leading to a Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) event. The Pacific Northwest (PNW) HAB Bulletin project, a partnership between academic, government, and tribal stakeholders, uses a combination of beach and offshore monitoring data and ocean forecast modeling to better understand the formation, evolution, and transport of HABs in this region. This project produces periodic Bulletins to inform local stakeholders of current and forecasted conditions. The goal of this study was to help improve how the forecast model is used in the Bulletin's preparation through a retrospective particle-tracking experiment. Using past observations of beach PN cell counts, events were identified that likely originated in the Juan de Fuca eddy, a known PN hotspot, and then particle tracks were used in the model to simulate these events. A variety of \"beaching definitions\" were tested, based on both water depth and distance offshore, to define when a particle in the model was close enough to the coast that it was likely to correspond to cells appearing in the intertidal zone and in shellfish diets, as well as a variety of observed PN cell thresholds to determine what cell count should be used to describe an event that would warrant further action. The skill of these criteria was assessed by determining the fraction of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives within the model in comparison with observations, as well as a variety of derived model performance metrics. This analysis suggested that for our stakeholders' purposes, the most useful beaching definition is the 30 m isobath and the most useful PN cell threshold for coincident field-based sample PN density estimates is 10,000 PN cells/L. Lastly, the performance of a medium-resolution (1.5 km horizontal resolution) version of the model was compared with that of a high-resolution (0.5 km horizontal resolution) version, the latter currently used in forecasting for the PNW HAB Bulletin project. This analysis includes a direct comparison of the two model resolutions for one overlapping year (2017). These results suggested that a narrower, more realistic beaching definition is most useful in a high-resolution model, while a wider beaching definition is more appropriate in a lower resolution model like the medium-resolution version used in this analysis. Overall, this analysis demonstrated the importance of incorporating stakeholder needs into the statistical approach in order to generate the most effective decision-support information from oceanographic modeling.",

This article compares the advantages of the macrophyte and artificial substrate methods and discusses which method is more appropriate for use in monitoring programs that focus on toxic BHAB species identification and quantification. The concept of benthic dinoflagellate \"preference\" for specific macrophytes was also reviewed. Examination of data from 75 field studies showed macrophytes with higher surface area per unit biomass harbored higher concentrations of Gambierdiscus cells. There was no definitive evidence that cells were actively selecting one macrophyte over another. This observation supports the use of artificial substrates (AS) as a means of assessing cell abundances in complex habitats because cell counts are normalized to a standardized surface area, not macrophyte biomass. The artificial substrate method represents the most robust approach, currently available, for collecting toxic, benthic dinoflagellates for a cell-based early warning system.",

    "abstract": "To date, the putative shellfish toxin azaspiracid 59 (AZA-59) produced by Azadinium poporum (Dinophyceae) has been the only AZA found in isolates from the Pacific northwest coast of the USA (Western Pacific ocean). Anecdotal reports of sporadic diarrhetic shellfish poisoning-like illness, with the absence of DSP toxin or Vibrio contamination, led to efforts to look for other potential toxins, such as AZAs, in water and shellfish from the region. A. poporum was found in Puget Sound and the outer coast of Washington State, USA, and a novel AZA (putative AZA-59) was detected in low quantities in SPATT resins and shellfish. Here, an A. poporum strain from Puget Sound was mass cultured and AZA-59 was subsequently purified and structurally characterized. In vitro cytotoxicity of AZA-59 towards Jurkat T lymphocytes and acute intraperitoneal toxicity in mice in comparison to AZA-1 allowed the derivation of a provisional toxicity equivalency factor of 0.8 for AZA-59. Quantification of AZA-59 using ELISA and LC-MS/MS yielded reasonable quantitative results when AZA-1 was used as an external reference standard. This study assesses the toxic potency of AZA-59 and will inform guidelines for its potential monitoring in case of increasing toxin levels in edible shellfish.",

    "abstract": "The toxigenic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia australis (Frenguelli), isolated from the California Current System (CCS), was examined in unialgal laboratory cultures to evaluate domoic acid (DA) production and cellular growth as a response to macronutrient limitation. Toxic blooms of P. australis are common in the coastal waters of eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS), including those of the CCS off the west coast of the United States where limitation by macronutrients, specifically silicon as silicic acid [Si(OH)4], or phosphorus as phosphate [PO43-], has been suggested to increase the production of DA by these diatoms. This study used batch cultures grown under conditions of macronutrient sufficiency and limitation, expected during and after a natural upwelling event, to determine whether PO43- or Si(OH)4 deficiency enhances the production of DA and the expected risk of DA toxicity in natural coastal ecosystems. These controlled lab studies demonstrate that despite increases in cell-specific DA concentrations found during the nutrient-limited stationary phase, DA production rates did not increase due to either PO43- or Si(OH)4 limitation, and total DA production rates were statistically greater during the nutrient-replete, exponential growth phase compared to the nutrient-limited, stationary phase. In addition, the relative contribution of particulate DA (pDA) and dissolved DA (dDA) varied markedly with growth phase, where the contribution of pDA to total DA (pDA + dDA) declined from an average of 70% under P- and Si-replete conditions to 49% under P-limited conditions and 39% under Si-limited conditions. These laboratory results demonstrate that macronutrient sufficiency does not regulate the biosynthetic production of DA by this strain of P. australis. This finding, together with a comparative analysis of the various equations employed to estimate DA production, suggests that the current paradigm of increased toxigenicity due to macronutrient limitation be carefully re-examined, particularly when attempting to forecast the toxic threat of DA to coastal ecosystems as a function of macronutrient availability.",

    "abstract": "Floating macroalgae of Sargassum horneri (S. horneri) in the East China Sea (ECS) has increased in recent years, with ocean warming being one of the driving factors. Yet their possible origins, based on a literature review, are unclear. Here, using multi-sensor high-resolution remote sensing data and numerical experiments for the period of 2015-2023, we show two possible origins of the ECS floating S. horneri, one being local near the Zhejiang coast with initiation in January-February and the other being remote (> 800 km from the first) in the Bohai Sea with initiation in June-November. While their drifting pathways are revealed in the sequential remote sensing imagery, numerical experiments suggest that S. horneri from the remote origin (Bohai Sea) can hardly meander through the strong Yangtze River frontal zone, which may serve as a \"wall\" to prevent trespassing of surface floating seaweed to the south of the frontal zone, where S. horneri has a local origin. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Sargassum horneri (S. horneri) is a brown macroalgae (seaweed) abundant in surface waters of the East China Sea (ECS), which can serve as a moving habitat, but can also cause major beaching events and environmental problems. Knowledge of its origins is important to help implement mitigation strategies and understand possible ecological impacts along its drifting pathways. Using high-resolution remote sensing images and numerical experiments, we track floating S. horneri in space and time between 2015 and 2023. Two possible origins are identified, one being far away from the ECS and the other being local, both of which are known to have benthic S. horneri. The study also reveals how S. horneri are transported from their source regions resulting in large-scale distributions previously observed in medium-resolution satellite imagery.",

The data support the hypothesis that the foam originated from a Phaeocystis bloom which if correct would make this accident the first report of human fatalities due to a harmful algal bloom in The Netherlands, and the first globally due to a Phaeocystis bloom. The rarity of massive foam banks and the absence of local real-time plankton monitoring makes it difficult to accurately predict dangerous situations as in 2020.

    "abstract": "The accumulation of domoic acid (DA) and saxitoxins (STX), phycotoxins produced by some species of Pseudo-nitzschia and Alexandrium, respectively, in coastal food webs are a focus of research on the West Coast of the United States due to the deleterious effects they have on coastal ecosystems and economies. Results are presented from the 2007–2012 Monitoring Oregon Coastal Harmful Algae (MOCHA) project, the Oregon coast's first HAB monitoring and research program. Both historical toxin databases and more detailed case-study observations of individual HAB events are compiled to provide the first detailed overview of HAB occurrence in this region. These results are also presented in the context of informing future HAB monitoring in this and other upwelling regimes affected by STX and DA. A 2009–2010 warming event was associated with the greatest HAB activity during the MOCHA project, including anomalously high sea surface temperatures and shellfish harvesting closures due to STX and DA in 2009 and 2010, respectively. In regards to HAB monitoring, it is shown that (1) razor clams are a more sensitive indicator of DA than mussels; (2) water column concentrations of particulate domoic acid greater than 103 ng L−1 can be used as a threshold for early-warning of shellfish DA toxicity and (3) approximately bi-weekly, or shorter, monitoring of Alexandrium in the surf zone and/or offshore can provide advance notice of STX contamination of shellfish. Both of the latter two metrics gain added value when coupled with local wind stress, a proxy of downwelling/relaxation events that facilitate greater interaction between offshore blooms and shellfish.",

    "abstract": "Lake Superior has recently begun experiencing cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Dolichospermum lemmermannii near the Apostle Islands and along the southern shore of the western arm. Little is known about the origin of these blooms. Experiments were conducted during the summers of 2017 and 2018 to identify sources of propagules and characteristics of sites that were potential sources. The 2017 experiments were conducted using a factorial design with three source zones ('River', 'Lake', and 'Harbor'), two nutrient conditions (high and low N:P), and three temperatures (15, 20, and 25°C). At the end of the experiment, cyanobacteria were most abundant from the 'River' and 'Harbor' zones at low N:P and 20 and 25°C, with D. lemmermannii most abundant at 20°C. Subsequently, in 2018 we evaluated 26 specific inland locations from three waterbody types ('River', 'Lake/Pond', and 'Coastal') and explored similarities among those sites that produced cyanobacteria in high abundance when samples were incubated under optimal conditions (low N:P and 25°C). Under these growing conditions, we found high cyanobacteria abundance developed in samples from river sites with low ambient temperatures and high conductivity. Field monitoring showed that Lake Superior nearshore temperatures were higher than rivers. These observations suggest that blooms of D. lemmermannii in Lake Superior are initiated by fluvial seeding of propagules and highlight the importance of warmer temperatures and favorable nutrient and light conditions for subsequent extensive cyanobacterial growth. We argue that the watershed is an important source of biological loading of D. lemmermannii to Lake Superior and that when those cells reach the nearshore where there are warmer water temperatures and increased light, they can grow in abundance to produce blooms.",

    "abstract": "During the spring and summer of 2019, an unprecedented cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (cyanoHAB) was responsible for beach advisories on 25 beaches along the Mississippi Sound for over 3 months. Due to the preceding heavy rainfall and flooding within the Mississippi River watershed, for the first time in history, the Bonnet Carré Spillway (BCS) opened twice in one year during 2019. The coastal cyanoHAB coincided with the second BCS opening. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the potential for using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ocean color standard Cyanobacteria Index (CIcyano) algorithm to characterize the spatial and temporal extent of the 2019 cyanoHAB; (2) to couple the CIcyano data with river discharge, salinity, and modeled-wind data to study the conditions leading to the cyanoHAB and factors aiding the advection and persistence of the bloom within the Mississippi Sound, including a possible relationship to the BCS; (3) to further investigate the relationship with the BCS by repeating the methods using data from 2018, which was a year when the BCS was opened but no evidence of cyanoHABs was reported along the Mississippi coast. Weekly means and monthly frequency CIcyano images, river discharge, salinity, and modeled-wind data from February to September of 2018 and 2019 were analyzed, which coincide with three BCS openings. In March 2018, a cyanobacteria bloom was observed within Lake Pontchartrain coinciding with the BCS opening; however, the month-long bloom was contained to the lake. Two distinct cyanoHABs were observed in 2019 and both blooms were advected into the Mississippi Sound, and likely contributed to the 3-month-long beach water advisories of 2019 along the Mississippi coastline. From March to mid-July 2019, salinity at stations within the Mississippi Sound was consistently near zero indicating high levels of freshwater. During that time, winds were predominantly northwestward, preventing the BCS waters from flushing into the Mississippi Shelf and resulting in BCS waters remaining longer within the estuarine lakes and Mississippi Sound. Although the BCS had an undeniable impact on the presence of the coastal cyanoHAB of 2019, other variables including wind direction, water flow, mixing, and persistence of freshwater within the Sound can determine the intensity and extent of the cyanoHABs. Coupling in situ phytoplankton information from freshwater water bodies to the marine continuum along with water flow, wind data, and satellite imagery could help identify cyanoHABs at early stages and forecast their trajectory and potential impacts on coastal areas.",

    "abstract": "The diatom Pseudo-nitzschia H. Peragallo is perhaps the most intensively researched genus of marine pennate diatoms, with respect to species diversity, life history strategies, toxigenicity, and biogeographical distribution. The global magnitude and consequences of harmful algal blooms (HABs) of Pseudo-nitzschia are particularly significant because of the high socioeconomic impacts and environmental and human health risks associated with the production of the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) among populations of many (although not all) species. This has led to enhanced monitoring and mitigation strategies for toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms and their toxins in recent years. Nevertheless, human adaptive actions based on future scenarios of bloom dynamics and proposed shifts in biogeographical distribution under climate-change regimes have not been implemented on a regional scale. In the CoCliME (Co-development of climate services for adaptation to changing marine ecosystems) program these issues were addressed with respect to past, current and anticipated future status of key HAB genera such as Pseudo-nitzschia and expected benefits of enhanced monitoring. Data on the distribution and frequency of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in relation to DA occurrence and associated amnesic shellfish toxin (AST) events were evaluated in a contemporary and historical context over the past several decades from key northern CoCliME Case Study areas. The regional studies comprised the greater North Sea and adjacent Kattegat-Skagerrak and Norwegian Sea, eastern North Atlantic marginal seas and Arctic gateways, and the Baltic Sea. The first evidence of possible biogeographical expansion of Pseudo-nitzschia taxa into frontier eastern Arctic gateways was provided from DNA barcoding signatures. Key climate change indicators, such as salinity, temperature, and water-column stratification were identified as drivers of upwelling and advection related to the distribution of regional Pseudo-nitzschia blooms. The possible influence of changing variables on bloom dynamics, magnitude, frequency and spatial and temporal distribution were interpreted in the context of regional ocean climate models. These climate change indicators may play key roles in selecting for the occurrence and diversity of Pseudo-nitzschia species within the broader microeukaryote communities. Shifts to higher temperature and lower salinity regimes predicted for the southern North Sea indicate the potential for high-magnitude Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, currently absent from this area. Ecological and socioeconomic impacts of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms are evaluated with reference to effects on fisheries and mariculture resources and coastal ecosystem function. Where feasible, effective adaptation strategies are proposed herein as emerging climate services for the northern CoCLiME region.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins consumed by marine predators through fish prey can be lethal but studies on the resulting population consequences are lacking. Over the past approximately 20 years there have been large regional declines in some harbour seal populations around Scotland. Analyses of excreta (faeces and urine from live and dead seals and faecal samples from seal haulout sites) suggest widespread exposure to toxins through the ingestion of contaminated prey. A risk assessment model, incorporating concentrations of the two major HAB toxins found in seal prey around Scotland (domoic acid (DA), and saxitoxins (STX)), the seasonal persistence of the toxins in the fish and the foraging patterns of harbour seals were used to estimate the proportion of adults and juveniles likely to have ingested doses above various estimated toxicity thresholds. The results were highly dependent on toxin type, persistence, and foraging regime as well as age class, all of which affected the proportion of exposed animals exceeding toxicity thresholds. In this preliminary model STX exposure was unlikely to result in mortalities. Modelled DA exposure resulted in doses above an estimated lethal threshold of 1900 µg/kg body mass affecting up to 3.8 % of exposed juveniles and 5.3 % of exposed adults. Given the uncertainty in the model parameters and the limitations of the data these conclusions should be treated with caution, but they indicate that DA remains a potential factor involved in the regional declines of harbour seals. Similar risks may be experienced by other top predators, including small cetaceans and seabirds that feed on similar prey in Scottish waters.",

    "abstract": "Dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Gambierdiscus are the causative agent of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP). This syndrome, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, has recently been reported also in temperate latitudes. Taxonomic studies of Gambierdiscus have yet to completely couple the morphological features of member species with their genetics. In this study, the cellular and nuclear morphology of a single strain of one species of Gambierdiscus was determined in cells grown under different culture conditions. The results showed a wide-ranging variability of cell sizes, together with a clear relationship between cell size and nuclear morphology. Thus, small cells were associated with round to oval or slightly U-shaped nuclei and large cells with obviously U-shaped nuclei. Most cells exhibited the typical anterio-posteriorly compressed lenticular, shape of Gambierdiscus, with the exception of a few small globular-shaped specimens. In all cells, regardless of their size, the arrangement of the thecal plates was typical of lenticular Gambierdiscus. Dividing cells were consistently the largest. In these cells, nuclear morphology, karyokinesis, and cytokinesis were characterized. Cells underwent division only during the dark period, thus demonstrating their spontaneous synchronized division. Cellular forms related to the sexual cycle were also present in the cultures and included gamete pairs and putative meiotic planozygotes. The effect of the culture medium was studied by means of principal component analyses, which showed a positive correlation between the medium used and nuclear size and shape but not cell size.",

    "abstract": "Alexandrium catenella is a harmful algal bloom (HAB)-forming dinoflagellate that causes significant damage to the cultivation and harvest of shellfish due to its synthesis of paralytic shellfish toxins. To evaluate the potential for macroalgae aquaculture to mitigate A. catenella blooms, we determined the effects of three cultivable macroalgae - Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), Chondrus crispus (Irish moss), and Ulva spp. - on A. catenella in culture- and field-based experiments. Co-culture growth assays of A. catenella exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of each macroalgae showed that all species except low levels of C. crispus caused cell lysis and significant reductions in A. catenella densities relative to control treatments of 17–74% in 2–3 days and 42–96% in ~one week (p<0.05 for all assays). In a toxin accumulation experiment, S. latissima significantly lessened (p<0.05) saxitoxin (STX) accumulation in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), keeping levels (71.80±1.98 µg STX 100 g−1) below US closure limits (80 µg STX 100 g−1) compared to the untreated control (93.47±8.11 µg STX 100 g−1). Bottle incubations of field-collected, bloom populations of A. catenella experienced significant reductions in cell densities of up to 95% when exposed to aquaculture concentrations of all three macroalgae (p<0.005 for all). The stocking of aquacultured S. latissima within mesocosms containing a bloom population of A. catenella (initial density: 3.2 × 104 cells L−1) reduced the population of A. catenella by 73% over 48 h (p<0.005) while Ulva addition caused a 54% reduction in A. catenella over 96 h (p<0.01). Among the three seaweeds, their ordered ability to inhibit A. catenella was S. latissima > Ulva spp. > C. crispus. Seaweeds' primary anti-A. catenella activity were allelopathic, while nutrient competition, pH elevation, and macroalgae-attached bacteria may have played a contributory role in some experiments. Collectively, these results suggest that the integration of macroalgae with shellfish-centric aquaculture establishments should be considered as a non-invasive, environmentally friendly, and potentially profit-generating measure to mitigate A. catenella-caused damage to the shellfish aquaculture industry.",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-nitzschia australis (Frenguelli), a toxigenic pennate diatom capable of producing the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), was examined in unialgal laboratory cultures to quantify its physiological response to ocean acidification (OA) - the decline in pH resulting from increasing partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the oceans. Toxic blooms of P. australis are common in the coastal waters of eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS), including those of the California Current System (CCS) off the west coast of the United States where increased pCO2 and decreased seawater pH are well-known. This study determined the production of dissolved (dDA) and particulate DA (pDA), the rates of growth and nutrient (nitrate, silicate and phosphate) utilization, cellular elemental ratios of carbon and nitrogen, and the photosynthetic response to declining pH during the exponential and stationary growth phases of a strain of P. australis isolated during a massive toxic bloom that persisted for months along much of the U.S. west coast during 2015. Our controlled lab studies showed that DA production significantly increased as pCO2 increased, and total DA (pDA + dDA) normalized to cell density was 2.7 fold greater at pH 7.8 compared to pH 8.1 (control) during nutrient-limited stationary growth. However, exponential growth rates did not increase with declining pH, but remained constant until pH of 7.8 was reached, and then specific growth rates declined by ca. 30%. The toxin results demonstrate that despite minimal effects of OA observed during the nutrient-replete exponential growth phase, the enhancement of DA production, notably the 3-fold increase in particulate DA per cell, with declining pH from 8.1 to 7.8 during the nutrient-depleted stationary phase, supports the hypothesis that increasing pCO2 will result in greater toxic risk to coastal ecosystems from elevated ambient concentrations of particulate DA. The ecological consequences of decreasing silicate uptake rates and increasing cellular carbon quotas with declining pH may potentially ameliorate some negative impacts of OA on Pseudo-nitzschia growth in natural systems.",

    "abstract": "Dinophysis spp. are mixotrophs that are dependent on specific prey, but are also potentially reliant on dissolved nutrients. The extent to which Dinophysis relies on exogenous N and the specific biochemical pathways important for supporting its autotrophic and heterotrophic growth are unknown. Here, the nutritional ecology of Dinophysis was explored using two approaches: 1) 15N tracer experiments were conducted to quantify the concentration-dependent uptake rates and associated kinetics of various N compounds (nitrate, ammonium, urea) of Dinophysis cultures and 2) the transcriptomic responses of Dinophysis cultures grown with multiple combinations of prey and nutrients were assessed via dinoflagellate spliced leader-based transcriptome profiling. Of the N compounds examined, ammonium had the highest Vmax and affinity coefficient, and lowest Ks for both pre-starved and pre-fed cultures, collectively demonstrating the preference of Dinophysis for this N source while little-to-no nitrate uptake was observed. During the transcriptome experiments, Dinophysis grown with nitrate and without prey had the largest number of genes with lower transcript abundances, did not increase abundance of transcripts associated with nitrate/nitrite uptake or reduction, and displayed no cellular growth, suggesting D. acuminata is not capable of growing on nitrate. When offered prey, the transcriptomic response of Dinophysis included the production of phagolysosomes, enzymes involved in protein and lipid catabolism, and N acquisition through amino acid degradation pathways. Compared with cultures only offered ammonium or prey, cultures offered both ammonium and prey had the largest number of genes with increased transcript abundances, the highest growth rate, and the unique activation of multiple pathways involved in cellular catabolism, further evidencing the ability of Dinophysis to grow optimally as a mixotroph. Collectively, this study evidences the key role ammonium plays in the mixotrophic growth of Dinophysis and reveals the precise biochemical pathways that facilitate its mixotrophic growth.",

    "abstract": "Dense blooms of filamentous cyanobacteria are recurrent phenomena in the Baltic Sea, with occasional negative effects on the surrounding ecosystem, as well as on tourism, human health, aquaculture, and fisheries. Establishing a climate service is therefore suggested; including multi-method observations of cyanobacteria biomass, biodiversity, and biogeography, in correspondence to biotic and abiotic factors. Three different approaches were compared for determination of spatial and temporal variability and trends of the blooms; 1) microscopy-based long-term data, 2) satellite remote sensing, and 3) phycocyanin fluorescence mounted on a merchant vessel. Firstly, microscopy-based data on cyanobacteria biomass from the period 2000-2020 showed that the toxin producing genus Nodularia and non-toxic Aphanizomenon both had summer means of 15 µg C L-1, while Dolichospermum was less dominant with a mean of 8 µg C L-1. Some years also the Kattegat was affected by cyanobacteria blooms, likely transported here by ocean currents. Secondly, the satellite remote sensing time series for the period 2002-2020 indicated that near surface blooms were most frequent in the Northern Baltic Proper and that near surface blooms have increased in the Bothnian Sea, starting later in the season than in the Baltic Proper. The largest extents (i.e., total area covered) were observed in 2005, 2008, and 2018. Thirdly, phycocyanin fluorescence from a flow through sensor mounted on a merchant vessel was used as a proxy for cyanobacteria biomass and correlated to cyanobacteria biomass estimated by microscopy. However, the satellite remote sensing data on surface accumulations showed little resemblance to the data on cyanobacteria biomass based on water sampling and microscopy, interpreted as an effect of methods. Sensors on satellites mainly detect surface accumulations of cyanobacteria while the microscopy data was based on samples 0-10 m, thereby comprising a larger community. Data from satellite remote sensing of cyanobacteria was correlated to the phycocyanin fluorescence indicating that similar bio-optical properties are observed. Finally, results from a downscaled ocean climate model (NEMONordic) were used to produce future scenarios for temperature and salinity, which directly affects cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea, supposedly by increasing in abundance and change in species composition. Short-term forecasts can be used together with observations for early warning of cyanobacteria blooms, and we suggest an internationally coordinated cyanobacteria observation and warning system for the Baltic Sea area.",

    "abstract": "Allelopathy is a biological mechanism that can promote harmful algal blooms (HAB) via the inhibition of sympatric phytoplankton. While nutrient loading can also promote HABs, the ability of allelopathy to stimulate HABs via the regeneration of nutrients has yet to be explored. To examine the impacts of allelopathically liberated N on HAB species, a series of experiments were performed using multiple allelopathic HAB species including the dinoflagellates Alexandrium catenella and Margalefidinium polykrikoides, and the pelagophyte, Aureoumbra lagunensis. These HAB species were paired with the cosmopolitan dinoflagellate, Akashiwo sanguinea, that was labeled with 15NO3- or 15NH4+, allowing the release and transfer of N to be traced as a time course during allelopathic interactions. During all experiments, the allelopathic inhibition of Akashiwo was accompanied by increases in cell densities, growth rates, and the δ15N content of the HAB species, evidencing the transfer of N liberated from Akashiwo. The cellular transfer of 15N and release of dissolved N was higher when Akashiwo was grown with 15NO3- compared to 15NH4+ suggesting a differential subcellular-compartmentalization of N sources. Regardless of the type of N, HAB species obtained 60 - 100% of their cellular N from lysed Akashiwo cells and there was an enrichment of the δ15N content of the dissolved NH4+ pool post-lysis of Akashiwo. Collectively, the results demonstrate that beyond facilitating species succession, allelopathy can supply HABs with N and, therefore, is likely important for promoting and sustaining HABs. Given that allelopathy is known to be a dose-dependent process, allelopathy may induce a positive feedback loop, whereby competitors are lysed, N is liberated, HABs are intensified and, in turn, become more strongly allelopathic.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cHABs) are increasing in frequency, intensity and duration in estuaries worldwide. In the upper San Francisco Estuary, also known as the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta (Delta), cHABs have been a topic of concern over the past two decades. In response, managers are urgently working to understand the factors that drive cHABs and identify feasible management options to avert ecological and human health consequences. We used a six year data set to explore relationships between flow parameters, temperature, and Microcystis biovolume to determine the potential for managing large scale hydrodynamic conditions to address Delta cHABs. We also looked at the relationship between Microcystis biovolume and the low salinity zone to see if it could be used as a proxy for residence time, because residence time is positively related to cyanobacteria abundance. We found the low salinity zone is not a useful proxy for residence time in the area of the Delta that experiences the most severe cHABs. Our finding suggest that climatic conditions (i.e., temperature and water year type) have the greatest influence on Microcystis biovolume in the Delta, with higher biovolume during years with lower flow and higher temperatures. Further, there are interannual differences in Microcystis biovolume that cannot be fully explained by flow parameters or temperature, meaning other factors not included in our model may be involved. We conclude that management actions to increase flow may be ineffective at reducing Microcystis to desired levels if water temperatures remain high.",

We reidentified the infection specificity of MaMV-DC among seven other Microcystis strains of different species. In our experiments, MaMV-DC infected three Microcystis strains but did not form plaque in Microcystis lawns. This indicated that MaMV-DC is at least a genus- rather than strain-specific virus. Cyanophage MaMV-DC genes were transcribed in M. aeruginosa FACHB-524, M. flos-aquae TF09, M. aeruginosa TA09 and M. wesenbergii DW09, and the growth of these Microcystis strains was inhibited by the addition of MaMV-DC. The predicted defense of eight Microcystis strains by CRISPR–Cas systems has shown mixed consistency with the infection experiment results, suggesting other defense or anti-defense systems play roles during infection process. Restriction–modification (RM) system analysis revealed an abundance of four types of RM proteins that may play roles in defense against cyanophages.",

    "abstract": "In July 2009, an unusually intense bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella occurred in the Gulf of Maine. The bloom reached high concentrations (from hundreds of thousands to one million cells L−1) that discolored the water and exceeded normal bloom concentrations by a factor of 1000. Using Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery processed to target chlorophyll concentrations (>2 µg L−1), patches of intense A. catenella concentration were identified that were consistent with the highly localized cell concentrations observed from ship surveys. The bloom patches were generally aligned with the edge of coastal waters with high-absorption. Dense bloom patches moved onshore in response to a downwelling event, persisted for approximately one week, then dispersed rapidly over a few days and did not reappear. Coupled physical-biological model simulations showed that wind forcing was an important factor in transporting cells onshore. Upward swimming behavior facilitated the horizontal cell aggregation, increasing the simulated maximum depth-integrated cell concentration by up to a factor of 40. Vertical convergence of cells, due to active swimming of A. catenella from the subsurface to the top layer, could explain the additional 25-fold intensification (25 × 40=1000-fold) needed to reach the bloom concentrations that discolored the water. A model simulation that considered upward swimming overestimated cell concentrations downstream of the intense aggregation. This discrepancy between model and observed concentrations suggested a loss of cells from the water column at a time that corresponded to the start of encystment. These results indicated that the joint effect of upward swimming, horizontal convergence, and wind-driven flow contributed to the red water event, which might have promoted the sexual reproduction event that preceded the encystment process.",

    "abstract": "The effect of rising CO2 levels on cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) is an emerging concern, particularly within eutrophic ecosystems. While elevated pCO2 has been associated with enhanced growth rates of some cyanobacteria, few studies have explored the effect of CO2 and nitrogen availability on diazotrophic (N2-fixing) cyanobacteria that produce cyanotoxins. Here, the effects of elevated CO2 and fixed nitrogen (NO3−) availability on the growth rates, toxin production, and N2 fixation of microcystin, saxitoxin, and anatoxin-a - producing strains of the genus Dolichospermum were quantified. Growth rates of all Dolichospermum spp. were significantly increased by CO2 or both CO2 and NO3− with rates being highest in treatments with the highest levels of CO2 and NO3−for all strains. While NO3− suppressed N2 fixation, diazotrophy significantly increased when NO3−-enriched Dolichospermum spp. were supplied with higher CO2 compared to cultures grown under lower CO2 levels. This suggests that diazotrophy will play an increasingly important role in N cycling in CO2-enriched, eutrophic lentic systems. NO3− significantly increased quotas of the N-rich cyanotoxins, microcystin and saxitoxin, at ambient and enriched CO2 levels, respectively. In contrast, elevated CO2 significantly decreased cell quotas of microcystin and saxitoxin, but significantly increased cell quotas of the N-poor cyanotoxin, anatoxin. N2 fixation was significantly negatively and positively correlated with quotas of N-rich and N-poor cyanotoxins, respectively. Findings suggest cellular quotas of N-rich toxins (microcystin and saxitoxin) may be significantly reduced, or cellular quotas of N-poor toxins (anatoxin) may be significantly enhanced, under elevated CO2 conditions during diazotrophic cyanobacterial blooms. Finally, in the future, ecosystems that experience combinations of excessive N loading and CO2 enrichment may become more prone to toxic blooms of Dolichospermum.",

    "abstract": "The extent and frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms are increasing, owing to the climate change caused by global warming, and some harmful filamentous cyanobacteria that were first reported in the tropics are spreading to temperate regions, such as North America, Europe, and Northeast Asia. Although these exotic invasive cyanobacteria have a high toxigenic potential, they are not targeted in management plans in many countries. This study analyzed the occurrence of and potential toxin and off-flavor secondary metabolite production by invasive nostocalean cyanobacteria in the Nakdong River in Korea, which is a temperate region. The occurrence of four species belonging to three genera of cyanobacteria was confirmed in the Nakdong River. The quantities of cyanobacteria in the Nakdong River were mostly low, fewer than 1,000 cells mL-1. Twenty-four strains belonging to four species in three genera of cyanobacteria were isolated from the Nakdong River. Analysis revealed no off-flavor secondary metabolite production by any of the isolates, and those belonging to Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides, and S. reniformis were identified as nontoxic strains. However, anatoxin-a production was observed in two of the eleven isolates of Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi. Given the sites and the timing of its occurrence, C. issatschenkoi had the highest potential for toxin production among the invasive nostocalean cyanobacteria appearing in the Nakdong River.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the rate of introduction of non-indigenous macroalgae has increased. While invasive seaweeds often outcompete native species for substrata, their direct effects on marine life are rarely described. Here, we describe 'red water' events caused by the decay of blooms of the invasive red seaweed, Dasysiphonia japonica, in Great South Bay, NY, USA, and the ability of water from such events to induce rapid and significant mortality in larval and juvenile fish (Menidia beryllina, Menidia menidia, and Cyprinodon variegatus) and larval bivalves (Mercenaria mercenaria and Crassostrea virginica). All species studied experienced significant (p<0.05) reductions in survival when exposed to macroalgae in a state of decay, seawater in which the alga was previously decayed, or both. Both bivalve species experienced 50-60% increases in mortality when exposed to decaying D. japonica for ∼ one week, despite normoxic conditions. Among fish, significant increases (40-80%) in mortality were observed after 24 h exposure to decayed D. japonica and one-week exposures caused, on average, 90% mortality in larval M. beryllina, 50% mortality in juvenile (∼3 cm) M. menidia, and 50% mortality in larval C. variegatus. All fish and bivalve mortality occurred under normoxic conditions (dissolved oxygen (DO) >7 mg L-1) and low ammonium levels (< 20 µM), with the exception of C. variegatus, which expired under conditions of decayed D. japonica coupled with reduced DO caused by the alga. Screening of water with decayed D. japonica using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed compounds with mass-to-charge ratios matching caulerpin, a known algal toxin that causes fish and shellfish mortality, and several other putative toxicants at elevated levels. Collectively, the high levels of mortality (50-90%) of larval and juvenile fish and bivalves exposed to decaying D. japonica under normoxic conditions coupled with the observation of 'red water' events in estuaries collectively indicate the red seaweed, D. japonica, can create harmful algal blooms (HABs).",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) intoxicate and asphyxiate marine life, causing devastating environmental and socio-economic impacts, costing at least $8bn/yr globally. Accumulation of phycotoxins from HAB phytoplankton in filter-feeding shellfish can poison human consumers, prompting harvesting closures at shellfish production sites. To quantify long-term intoxication risk from Dinophysis HAB species, we used historical HAB monitoring data (2009-2020) to develop a new modelling approach to predict Dinophysis toxin concentrations in a range of bivalve shellfish species at shellfish sites in Western Scotland, South-West England and Northern France. A spatiotemporal statistical modelling framework was developed within the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework to quantify long-term HAB risks for different bivalve shellfish species across each region, capturing seasonal variations, and spatiotemporal interactions. In all regions spatial functions were most important for predicting seasonal HAB risk, offering the potential to inform optimal siting of new shellfish operations and safe harvesting periods for businesses. A 10-fold cross-validation experiment was carried out for each region, to test the models' ability to predict toxin risk at harvesting locations for which data were withheld from the model. Performance was assessed by comparing ranked predicted and observed mean toxin levels at each site within each region: the correlation of ranks was 0.78 for Northern France, 0.64 for Western Scotland, and 0.34 for South-West England, indicating our approach has promise for predicting unknown HAB risk, depending on the region and suitability of training data.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria have a great diversity of natural enemies, such as herbivores and pathogens, including fungal pathogens within the Chytridiomycota (chytrids). While these pathogens have been previously described on a select number of cyanobacterial hosts and are suspected to play a significant ecological role, little is understood about species interactions and how competition between parasites can affect epidemic development and bloom formation. Here, three Planktothrix agardhii isolates from Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie (OH, USA) were challenged in monoculture and polyculture against infection by three isolates (C1, C2, C10) of their obligate chytrid fungal pathogen, Rhizophydiales sp. The chytrid isolates were inoculated as single isolates or a mixture of up to three different isolates. In monoculture, host isolates were characterized as highly susceptible (P. agardhii 1030), moderately susceptible (P. agardhii 1808) or mostly resistant (P. agardhii 1801). Co-infection of chytrid isolates on the highly susceptible host isolate had an additive effect on chytrid prevalence, leading to a culture crash where 2 or 3 chytrid isolates were present. Co-infection of chytrid isolates on the moderately susceptible and mostly resistant isolates had no effect on chytrid infection outcome or prevalence compared to infection with a single isolate. In polyculture, the effect on host growth was most significant in the single chytrid isolate treatment, which was attenuated with the addition of mixed chytrid treatments. Genetic analysis of the resulting population after the experimental period showed a tendency for the chytrid isolate C1 and P. agardhii 1801 to dominate in mixed population samples. Two different interspecific interactions seem to be in play; varied parasite infection strategies allow for the amplification of infection prevalence due to mixed chytrids in a susceptible monoculture, or competition allows for the dominance of a single chytrid isolate in monoculture and the reduction of infection prevalence in a host polyculture. This work thus highlights how interactions between chytrid infections can change the course of epidemic development and harmful algal bloom formation.",

The description of this phage, named LPP-1, led to the extensive investigation of various cyanophages and to the study of their interactions with their cyanobacterial hosts towards controlling blooms. Here, the genomes of LPP-1 and its putative relative, LPP-2 were sequenced. Sequencing these genomes revealed that LPP-1 and LPP-2 are members of a group of short-tailed cyanophages, which are distantly related to the T7-like cyanophages. Most of the phages in this group have the ability to lysogenize their hosts. Their ability to switch between lytic and lysogenic infection may explain the formation of cyanobacterial blooms despite the persistence of their phages. This lysogenic capacity of the LPP-1-like phages occurs despite the lack of an obvious integrase gene within their genomes. Interestingly, we show that LPP-2 integrates into the host genome through an integration site in high proximity to a recombination endonuclease that may have integrase activity. Further understanding of cyanobacterial-phage relationships may provide insight into their population dynamics and suggest novel approaches for control of destructive cyanobacterial blooms.",

    "abstract": "In Fall 2017 a large bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis developed in the Gulf of Mexico. After persisting for months, in Fall 2018 wind and water circulation patterns drove K. brevis towards the east coast of Florida. On September 29, 2018 Palm Beach County, FL beaches were closed due to respiratory and gastrointestinal issues associated with brevotoxins, and effects of brevotoxins were reported from within estuarine segments of the Loxahatchee River Estuary (LRE). This was the first apparent report of a K. brevis bloom impacting inshore portions of the LRE prompting us to question the longevity of K. brevis within a relatively shallow, well-flushed coastal-estuarine system. Within 3 days (October 1, 2018) of the first reported effects of toxins, K. brevis reached over one million cells/L and chlorophyll-a concentrations peaked at 13 µg L−1. Within 11 days (October 9, 2018) both K. brevis and chlorophyll pigment concentrations significantly (p-perm ≤ 0.05) dropped to an average of ≤ 30,000 cells L−1 and < 4 µg L−1 chlorophyll-a, indicating that the bloom had diminished. Using distance-based linear modeling (DistLM) K. brevis abundance alone explained 66% of the variation in a multivariate measure of chlorophylls (driven by carotenoids and chlorophyll-c pigment concentrations), supporting a K. brevis dominated bloom. Following the K. brevis bloom, additional HAB species K. mikimotoi and Pseudo-nitzschia spp singularly explained 6% of the variations in the multivariate measure of chlorophylls. The low explanatory power of individual HAB species, including K. brevis (≤ 0%), signifies the recovery of the phytoplankton population, where non-HAB species likely contributed to the variability in the multivariate measure of chlorophylls and overall chlorophyll-a concentrations (average of 2 µg L−1 during non-bloom conditions). Finally, we evaluated ambient and historical water quality data to assess how these parameters changed before, during, and after the 2018 K. brevis bloom. Temperature, salinity, and nutrients in the LRE were comparable to reports of other K. brevis bloom events along the west coast of Florida. Reduced ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) concentrations and increased tidal amplitude coincided with the end of the bloom in 2018. More work is needed to understand the specific mechanisms constraining K. brevis blooms in tidal estuaries. We suggest that future research focus on water residence times along with nutrient availability in controlling allochthonous HABs in lotic and tidally flushed estuaries. Also, we anticipate this work may stimulate additional efforts to characterize HABs using in situ observations coupled with multivariate measures of chlorophylls, though we recognize much work remains to fully define the value of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Given the effects of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on human and wildlife health, understanding how domoic acid (DA) is accumulated and transferred through food webs is critical for recognizing the most affected marine communities and predicting ecosystem effects. This study combines stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) from bulk muscle tissue with DA measurements from viscera to identify the foraging strategies of important DA vectors and predators in Monterey Bay, CA. Tissue samples were collected from 27 species across three habitats in the summer of 2018 and 2019 (time periods without prominent HABs). Our results highlight an inshore-offshore variation in krill δ13C values and DA concentrations ([DA]; ppm) in anchovies indicating differences in coastal productivity and DA accumulation. The narrow overlapping isotopic niches between anchovies and sardines suggest similar diets and trophic positions, but striking differences in [DA] indicate a degree of specialization, thus, resource partitioning. In contrast, krill, market squid, and juvenile rockfish accumulated minimal DA and had comparatively broad isotopic niches, suggesting a lower capacity to serve as vectors because of potential differences in diet or feeding in isotopically distinct locations. Low [DA] in the liver of stranded sea lions and their generalist foraging tendencies limits our ability to use them as sentinels for DA outbreaks in a specific geographic area. Collectively, our results show that DA was produced a few kilometers from the coastline, and anchovies were the most powerful DA vector in coastal-pelagic zones (their DA loads exceeded the 20 ppm FDA regulatory limits for human consumption), while mussels did not contain detectable DA and only reflect in situ DA, δ13C, and δ15N values. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of combining multiple biogeochemical tracers to improve HAB monitoring efforts and identify the main routes of DA transfer across habitats and trophic levels.",

We present the first synthesis of domoic acid (DA), saxitoxin (STX), okadaic acid (OA), and microcystin detections in the feces and urine of stranded and bycaught southern California cetaceans, over an 18 year period (2001-2018), along with corresponding stomach content data. DA was detected in 13 out of 19 cetacean species, most often in harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) (81.8%, n = 22) and long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis bairdii) (74%, n = 231). Maximum DA concentrations of 324,000 ng/g in feces and 271, 967 ng/ml in urine were observed in D. d. bairdii. DA was detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in male vs. female D. d. bairdii. Higher fecal DA concentrations in D. d. bairdii were associated with a greater proportion of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) in the diet, indicating it may be a primary vector of DA. Fecal DA concentrations for D. d. bairdii off Point Conception were greater than those from animals sampled off Los Angeles and San Diego counties, reflecting greater primary productivity and higher Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance in that region and a greater abundance of E. mordax in the diet. STX was detected at low levels (fecal max = 7.5 ng/g, urine max = 17 ng/ml) in 3.6% (n = 165) of individuals from 3 out of 11 species. The occurrence of E. mordax in 100% of the 3 examined stomachs suggests this species could be a primary vector of the detected STX. OA was detected in 2.4% of tested individuals (n = 85) at a maximum fecal concentration of 422.8 ng/g. Microcystin was detected in 14.3% (n = 7) of tested individuals with a maximum liver concentration of 96.8 ppb.",

These blooms occur naturally but have intensified in many locations globally due to recent climatic changes, including ocean warming. Such changes are especially pronounced in northern regions, where the effects of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) on marine wildlife are of growing concern. In Alaska, seabird mortality events have increased in frequency, magnitude, and duration since 2015 alongside anomalously high ocean temperatures. Although starvation has been implicated as the apparent cause of death in many of these die-offs, saxitoxin (STX) and other PSTs have been identified as possible contributing factors. Here, we describe a mortality event at a nesting colony of Arctic Terns (Sterna paradisaea) near Juneau, Alaska in 2019 and report elevated concentrations of PSTs in bird, forage fish, and mussel samples.

    "abstract": "Pseudo-nitzschia species are one of the leading causes of harmful algal blooms (HABs) along the western coast of the United States. Approximately half of known Pseudo-nitzschia strains can produce domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxin that can negatively impact wildlife and fisheries and put human life at risk through amnesic shellfish poisoning. Production and accumulation of DA, a secondary metabolite synthesized during periods of low primary metabolism, is triggered by environmental stressors such as nutrient limitation. To quantify and estimate the feedbacks between DA production and environmental conditions, we designed a simple mechanistic model of Pseudo-nitzschia and domoic acid dynamics, which we validate against batch and chemostat experiments. Our results suggest that, as nutrients other than nitrogen (i.e., silicon, phosphorus, and potentially iron) become limiting, DA production increases. Under Si limitation, we found an approximate doubling in DA production relative to N limitation. Additionally, our model indicates a positive relationship between light and DA production. These results support the idea that the relationship with nutrient limitation and light is based on direct impacts on Pseudo-nitzschia biosynthesis and biomass accumulation. Because it can easily be embedded within existing coupled physical-ecosystem models, our model represents a step forward toward modeling the occurrence of Pseudo-nitzschia HABs and DA across the U.S. West Coast.",

During two dense blooms (Skeletonema spp. and Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), feeding of juvenile Chinook salmon decreased (n=202, empty stomachs >50%). All collected salmon gills (n=5) were damaged following high levels of mechanically harmful Chaetoceros convolutus in the water column; all collected livers (n=5) showed signs of pathological changes during Octactis speculum bloom. These observations were consistent with effects previously reported from salmon farms, however this agreement must be treated with caution as it is based on a limited number of samples.

Pictures of the isolated vesicles were done with Cryo TEM (Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy). Based on their morphotype the EVs were clustered in five major groups (rounded, rounded electron-dense, lumen electron-dense, double and irregular) and each EV was measured resulting in an average size of 0.36 µm of diameter.

    "abstract": "Some members of the dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium produce toxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning, which causes environmental impacts and large economic losses worldwide. The Outlying Mean Index (OMI) and the Within Outlying Mean Index (WitOMI) were used to examine the ecological niches of three Alexandrium species identifying factors affecting their population dynamics in the Korea Strait (KS). Species niches were divided into seasonal subniches based on species' temporal and spatial patterns, with A. catenella being highest in the spring, A. pacificum in the summer, and A. affine in the autumn. These shifts in abundance are likely due to changes in their habitat preferences and resource availability, as well as the effects of biological constraints. A subniche-based approach, which considers the interactions between the environment and the biological characteristics of a species, was useful in understanding the factors shaping the population dynamics of the individual species. Additionally, a species distribution model was used to predict the phenology and biogeography of the three Alexandrium species in the KS and their thermal niches on a larger scale. The model predicted that, in the KS, A. catenella exists on the warm side of the thermal niche, while A. pacificum and A. affine exist on the cold side, indicating that these species may respond differently to increases in water temperature. However, the predicted phenology was incongruent with the abundance of the species as measured by droplet digital PCR. Overall, the WitOMI analysis and species distribution model can provide valuable insights into how population dynamics are influenced by the integrated interplay of biotic and abiotic processes.",

Here we illustrate rapid changes in vertical and across ría-shelf distributions of diatoms and dinoflagellates (including D. acuminata vegetative and small cells) in Ría de Pontevedra (RP) and Ría de Vigo (RV) during transitions from spin-down to spin-up phases of upwelling cycles. A subniche approach based on a Within Outlying Mean Index (WitOMI) showed that under the transient environmental conditions met during the cruise, both vegetative and small cells of D. acuminata colonized the Ria and Mid-shelf subniches, exhibiting good tolerance and extremely high marginality, in particular the small cells. Bottom-up (abiotic) control overwhelmed biological constraints, and shelf waters became a more favourable environment than the Rías. Contrasting higher biotic constraints inside the Rías were found for the small cells, with a subniche possibly controlled by unsuitable physiological status (notwithstanding the higher density) of the vegetative cell population. Results here on behaviour (vertical positioning) and physiological traits (high tolerance but very specialized niche) of D. acuminata give new insights into the ability of this species to remain in the upwelling circulation system. Higher shelf-ría exchanges in the Ría (RP) with more dense and persistent D. acuminata blooms reveal the relevance of transient event-scales and species- and site-specific characteristics to the fate of these blooms. Earlier statements about simple linear relationships between average upwelling intensities and the recurrence of Harmful algae bloom (HAB) events in the Galician Rías Baixas are questioned.",

Amphidoma languida, a small thecate dinoflagellate of the family Amphidomataceae, is widely distributed in Irish coastal waters and is one of the identified source species of azaspiracids. Irish and North Sea strains of Am. languida have been found to produce as major metabolites AZA-38 and -39 whose structures have only been provisionally elucidated by mass spectrometry and their toxic potential is currently unknown. In order to provide pure AZA-38 and -39 for subsequent structural and toxicological analyses, we present the first successful large-scale culture of Am. languida. A 180 L in house prototype bioreactor was used for culture growth and harvesting in semi-continuous mode for two months. Two different runs of the photobiorector with different light and pH setting showed the highest toxin yield at higher light intensity and slightly higher pH. AZA-38 and -39 cell quota were measured throughout the complete growth cycle with AZA-39 cell quota increasing in proportion to AZA-38 at late stationary to senescence phase. Over two experiments a total of 700 L of culture was harvested yielding 0.45 mg of pure AZA-39. The structure of AZA-39 was elucidated through NMR data analyses, which led to a revision of the structure proposed previously by mass spectrometry. While the spirotetrahydrofuran/tetrahydrofuran of rings A and B has been confirmed by NMR for AZA-39, a methyl is still present in position C-14 and the carboxylic acid chain is different from the structure proposed initially.",

    "abstract": "A bulletin communicating risk of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms to shellfish harvest along the open coast of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (the northeast Pacific Ocean spanning Washington and Oregon) is discussed. This Pacific Northwest Harmful Algal Blooms (PNW HAB) Bulletin is designed for shellfish managers with a focus on the razor clam fishery, but may also be informative to managers of the Dungeness crab fishery since domoic acid accumulation in crabs tends to lag accumulation in razor clams by a couple of weeks. The Bulletin complements beach phytoplankton monitoring programs by alerting coastal shellfish managers about adverse environmental conditions that could be conducive to a toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom. Beach monitoring programs are effective at determining when toxins have arrived at shellfish beaches, but a risk forecast based on near real-time biophysical information can provide managers with additional forewarning about potential future toxin outbreaks. Here, the approaches taken in constructing the risk forecasts, along with the reasoning and research behind them are presented. Updates to a historical PNW HAB Bulletin are described, as are the current workflow and the individual components of the updated Bulletin. Some successes and failures realized throughout the process are also pointed out for the benefit of the broader community. A self-assessment suggests that when the necessary data sources are available, the PNW HAB Bulletin provides an accurate forecast of risk associated with toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms. The Bulletin has proven beneficial to coastal shellfish managers by better informing decisions on sample collection, and harvest limits, openings, extensions, and closures.",

    "abstract": "Rising atmospheric CO2 can intensify harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes. Worldwide, these blooms are an increasing environmental concern. Low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been proposed as a short-term but eco-friendly approach to selectively mitigate cyanobacterial blooms. However, sensitivity of cyanobacteria to H2O2 can vary depending on the available resources. To find out how cyanobacteria respond to H2O2 under elevated CO2, Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 was cultured in chemostats with nutrient-replete medium under C-limiting and C-replete conditions (150 ppm and 1500 ppm CO2, respectively). Microcystis chemostats exposed to high CO2 showed higher cell densities, biovolumes, and microcystin contents, but a lower photosynthetic efficiency and pH compared to the cultures grown under low CO2. Subsamples of the chemostats were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 (0-10 mg·L-1 H2O2) in batch cultures under two different light intensities (15 and 100 μmol photons m-2·s-1) and the response in photosynthetic vitality was monitored during 24 h. Results showed that Microcystis was more resistant to H2O2 at elevated CO2 than under carbon-limited conditions. Both low and high CO2-adapted cells were more sensitive to H2O2 at high light than at low light. Microcystins (MCs) leaked out of the cells of cultures exposed to 2-10 mg·L-1 H2O2, while the sum of intra- and extracellular MCs decreased. Although both H2O2 and CO2 concentrations in lakes vary in response to many factors, these results imply that it may become more difficult to suppress cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes when atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) of the toxic marine dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, commonly called red tides, are an ongoing threat to human health and marine ecosystems in Florida. Clay flocculation is a standard control strategy for marine HABs in China and Korea and is currently being assessed for use in the United States. We evaluated the effects of a PAC-modified clay called Modified Clay II on mortality, eyestalk reflexes, and righting reflexes of 48 adult blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus). Crabs were exposed to clay alone (0.5 g L - 1), untreated K. brevis (1 × 106 cells L - 1), or a combination of K. brevis and clay for eight days. Clay treatment reduced cell concentrations in the water column by 95% after 24 h. We detected no significant differences in mortality, righting reflexes, or eyestalk reflexes between treatments. Our results indicate that the clay alone is not harmful to adult crabs at typical treatment concentrations within the measured time frame, and that treatment of K. brevis with this clay appears to have a negligible impact on crab mortality and the reflex variables we measured. These results suggest that Modified Clay II may be a viable option to treat K. brevis blooms without impacting adult blue crab populations. Additional controlled experiments and field tests are needed to further evaluate the impact of clay on natural benthic communities.",

Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a bacterially produced chemical signal that promotes growth of phytoplankton and plants. Here, we explored the impact of IAA on bloom-forming cyanobacteria and their associated bacteria. Exposure to IAA and its precursor, tryptophan, resulted in a strong growth response in a bloom of the freshwater cyanobacterium, Microcystis. Metatranscriptome analysis revealed the induction of an antioxidant response in Microcystis upon exposure to IAA, potentially allowing populations to increase photosynthetic rate and overcome internally generated reactive oxygen. Our data reveal that co-occurring bacteria within the phycosphere microbiome exhibit a division of labor for supportive functions, such as nutrient mineralization and transport, vitamin synthesis, and reactive oxygen neutralization. These complex dynamics within the Microcystis phycosphere microbiome are an example of interactions within a microenvironment that can have ecosystem-scale consequences.",

    "abstract": "We address the targeted destruction of Karenia brevis using the algaecide calcium peroxide, in tandem with the flocculation and sinking of the species. The specific aspect of the approach is the incorporation of the algaecide within the floc to rapidly kill K. brevis, thus minimizing escape of cells from the floc and reentry to the water column. CaO₂ gradually produces H₂O₂, which diffuses through cell membranes and induces oxidative stress, leading to cell death via excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. The effect of varying doses of calcium peroxide on K. brevis cells was measured with pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry and indicated that doses as low as 30 mg/L when integrated into flocs are effective in suppressing photosynthesis. Cell viability assays also indicate that such low levels are sufficient to cause cell death in a 3-6 hour time period. Thus, the proposed technology involving the incorporation of calcium peroxide in a cationic flocculating agent (polyaluminum chloride, PAC) leads to an inexpensive and scalable technology to mitigate harmful algal blooms of K. brevis.",

    "abstract": "Diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia, known for their potential toxicity, are integral to the phytoplankton community of the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica. Despite their ecological importance, the diversity and toxicity of Pseudo-nitzschia in this region remain underexplored. Globally, these diatoms are notorious for forming harmful algal blooms in temperate and tropical waters, causing significant impacts on marine life, ecosystems, and coastal economies. However, detailed information on the diversity, morphology, and toxicity of Pseudo-nitzschia species in Antarctic waters is limited, with molecular characterizations of these species being particularly scarce. During three research expeditions to the Southern Ocean, monoclonal strains of Pseudo-nitzschia were isolated and cultivated. Stored samples from a fourth expedition, the Brategg expedition, were used to complete the description of particularly P. turgidula. Through electron microscopy and molecular analysis, two novel species were identified—Pseudo-nitzschia meridionalis sp. nov. and Pseudo-nitzschia glacialis sp. nov.—alongside the previously described species P. subcurvata, P. turgiduloides, and P. turgidula. Toxin assays revealed no detectable levels of domoic acid in P. turgiduloides, P. turgidula, P. meridionalis sp. nov. and P. glacialis sp. nov. Conversely, P. subcurvata was reported in a related study to produce domoic acid and its isomer, isodomoic acid C. These findings emphasize the need for comprehensive research on the phytoplankton of Antarctic waters, which is currently a largely uncharted domain. With the looming threat of climate change, understanding the dynamics of potentially harmful algal populations in this region is becoming increasingly critical.",

Although the gene cluster encoding CYN biosynthesis (cyr) has been sequenced, many aspects of CYN regulation are unresolved. This study investigates cyr transcriptional regulation in the cyanobacterium, Raphidiopsis raciborskii AWT205, through in silico analysis, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and DNA-affinity capture assays (DACAs). While in silico analysis identified binding sites for environmentally responsive transcription factors throughout the cyr cluster, DACAs captured the binding of AbrB (a transcription factor that regulates the cyanobacterial response to nitrogen and iron availability) to the cyrD promoter. Surprisingly, the initiating cylindrospermopsin synthetase, CyrA, was also captured by the cyrD promoter probe. This is the first experimental evidence of CYN (and cyanotoxin) autoregulation. Our study is also the most extensive investigation of cyr transcription, concurrently targeting nine cyr genes across three growth stages. We found significant heterogeneity between transcription levels of each cyr gene, which also varied across different growth stages. Surprisingly, the ratio of cyrI (hydroxylase) to cyrJ (sulfotransferase) transcripts was inversely proportional to the ratio of deoxyCYN to CYN. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that transcription of the cyr gene cluster in R. raciborskii AWT205 is driven by multiple promoters and DNA-binding proteins, that can be responsive to changing environmental conditions. However, the production of different CYN variants did not correlate to transcription alone, with additional regulatory mechanisms proposed.",

    "abstract": "Physical disturbance and feeding by macrofauna in the sediment can potentially affect bloom initiation of phytoplankton species that have benthic stages in their life cycle. In this experimental study, we investigated how different species of macrozoobenthos can affect the recruitment of Nodularia spumigena from the sediment to the water column. N. spumigena is a toxic, nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium, which forms large summer blooms in the Baltic Sea. Benthic recruitment from resting stages (akinetes) and vegetative cells deposited on the seafloor have long been suspected to initiate the blooms. We found that, depending on species-specific traits, deposit-feeding macrofauna (an amphipod, Monoporeia affinis, a bivalve, Macoma balthica and an invasive polychaete, Marenzelleria cf. arctia) has the potential to either reduce or facilitate recruitment of this cyanobacterium. Shorter filament length in treatments with fauna than in the treatment without indicates feeding on or mechanical destruction of N. spumigena by the animals. Our results show the importance of an often overlooked aspect of phytoplankton bloom initiation, the role of macrozoobenthos.",

    "abstract": "A number of marine and freshwater harmful algal bloom (HAB) species have colonized new areas and expanded their habitat range in recent years. Nevertheless it is notoriously difficult to establish when colonization first occurred, what the dispersal routes are, and to separate recent invasion from increases in existent but small populations. The freshwater raphidophyte Gonyostomum semen is a nuisance species that has expanded its habitat range and increased in abundance in northern Europe during the past decades. To evaluate to what extent sediments can be used for determining historic occurrence of G. semen, a quantitative real-time PCR method for detecting cysts of this algae was developed. This paper presents a qPCR protocol with a set of primers that are specific to Gonyostomum and with PCR conditions optimized for sediment samples from humic lakes, which are the common habitat of G. semen. With this sensitive method as few as 1.6 cysts per PCR reaction could be reliably quantified, corresponding to 320 cysts per g wet weight sediment. Cysts were present in sediments with ages ranging from years to decades and their persistence allows detection of historic populations up to at least 50 years old. With this qPCR assay it will be possible to trace the presence of G. semen in environments prior to the onset of algae-specific monitoring programs as well as for quantification in water column samples.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) are a global public health threat. While CHABs are often promoted by nutrients, an important and often overlooked influence on bloom dynamics is zooplankton grazing. In the present study, zooplankton grazing and nutrient enrichment experiments were combined with next generation sequencing and fluorometric analyses to quantify differential grazing and nutrient effects on specific cyanobacterial genera across the western basin of Lake Erie. Grazing by two different sized daphnids, Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex, was compared to protozooplankton grazing effects assessed via a dilution approach at sites within the Maumee and Sandusky Bays where Planktothrix, Microcystis, Synechococcus, and Dolichospermum were the dominant genera. Daphnid grazing significantly reduced Synechococcus net growth rates at most sites as well as Planktothrix net growth in Sandusky Bay and Dolichospermum in Maumee Bay. Dilution resulted in significant growth increase of Synechococcus at half of the sites and Planktothrix at most sites evidencing substantial grazing pressure by the protozooplankton community on these genera. In contrast, Microcystis populations were largely unaffected by daphnids and protozooplankton grazing but benefitted from nutrient enrichment more than other CHAB genera. When diatoms were present in moderate abundance, grazing rates by daphnids on diatoms were significantly greater than grazing rates on cyanobacteria. The novel approach used in this study established differences in grazing pressure and nutrient effects on differing taxa and revealed that, while many taxa were grazed by multiple classes of zooplankton (e.g. Planktothrix, Synechococcus, Dolichospermum, diatoms), the lack of grazing pressure on Microcystis coupled with nutrient-enhanced growth in western Lake Erie promotes the occurrence of CHABs of this genus.",

This species is characterized by having a spherical sporangium without papillae and zoospores of 2–3 µm in diameter that are released through 3 discharge pores. Molecular phylogeny based on ribosomal operon showed its sister position to the Dinomyces cluster in Rhizophydiales. Zoospores lack fenestrated cisternae but contain a paracrystalline inclusion, found in a Rhizophydiales representative for the first time. Additionally, the kinetid features are uncommon for Rhizophydiales and only observed in Dinomyces representatives so far. These morphological features and its phylogenetic relationships justify the description of the new genus and speciesParadinomyces triforaminorum gen. nov. sp. nov. belonging to the family Dinomycetaceae. The chytrid was detected during a high-biomass bloom of the dinoflagellate Kryptoperidinium foliaceum. Laboratory experiments suggest this species is highly specific and demonstrate the impact it can have on HAB development. The chytrid co-occurred with three other parasites belonging to Chytridiomycota (Fungi) and Perkinsea (Alveolata), highlighting that parasitic interactions are common during HABs in brackish and marine systems, and these multiple parasites compete for similar hosts.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms are common in the Baltic Sea during summer, and even though several cyanobacteria are toxin producers, many organisms still ingest them as feed. These and other phytoplankton toxins can be detected in blue mussels accumulating over the season, which represents a potential health hazard for shellfish consumers. On a global scale, biotoxins therefore need to be quantified in shellfish before human consumption. We monitored 11 different groups of biotoxins in three blue mussel farms and the composition of 23 potentially toxin producing phytoplankton taxa from March to November 2022. None of the biotoxins were above available health guideline values nor regulated levels. However, the well-known cyanobacterial toxin in the Baltic Sea, nodularin, produced by Nodularia spumigena, was detected in net- and rope-farmed mussels throughout the summer, with the highest concentration of 47 µg kg-1. In contrast, the less studied toxin cylindrospermopsin was only present in mussels in early spring and late fall (surface water temperature approx. 2-10 °C), with the maximum concentration of 19.7 µg kg-1 in April, where Aphanizomenon is a potential producer, but yet not confirmed. Further, Dinophysis acuminata, a potential producer of Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DSTs), was observed above warning levels at two sites with up to 2 400 individuals L-1, although the found concentration of 73 µg kg-1 is below the regulated level for DST group (160 µg kg-1). Altogether emphasizing that high species abundance does not necessarily result in a high toxin accumulation. On the other hand, mussels can serve effectively as indicator species, detecting the presence of novel toxins when producer abundance is low. As no period of the year was completely toxin-free, quantitative analysis is recommended when mussels are to be harvested.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms are increasing worldwide, compromising water bodies and ecosystem services. Among the possible management measures are curative methods, such as hydrogen peroxide, that can suppress cyanobacteria growth. However, the rapid breakdown of H2O2 could limit its effectiveness; thus new formulations (liquid and solid) that are, in theory, more stable have been developed. Here, we tested three new formulations (Oximycin™ P5, Phycomycin® SCP and Lake Guard® Oxy) and traditional peroxides (H2O2 and CaO2) on their capacity to end Microcystis aeruginosa bloom and their effect on microcystin dynamics. In general, all the products controlled M. aeruginosa biomass. The products were comparable mainly in the tests with lower initial Chl-a (150 µg L-1), with slightly less effectiveness of CaO2. At a higher initial bloom concentration (600 µg Chl-a L-1), all the products were effective in reducing Chl-a concentration to zero at a dose of 3 mg H2O2 L-1, except Lake Guard® Oxy and CaO2, which showed an increase in Chl-a by the end of the experiment. This suggests that OximycinTM P5, Phycomycin® SCP, and liquid H2O2 may perform better at lower doses. Nonetheless, at the highest dose tested (10 mg H2O2 L-1), all products were highly effective, with no signs of recovery. After one day of exposure, extracellular MC concentrations were higher in all treatments but reduced to lower levels than the control after nine days, pointing to the degradation of dissolved MCs. There is no obvious top choice in terms of overall efficiency. However, each product may be better suited for different purposes depending on the specific situation and strategy.",

Balneotherapy can cause adverse reactions to the usual doses of application of treatments, that consists of a non-specific clinical picture, the so-called \"thermal crisis\" or \"balneointoxication\". Despite its clinical similarity (gastric discomfort, hepatic congestive outbreaks, cutaneous reactions, etc.) with that observed in acute cyanotoxin poisonings, thermal crisis has never been associated with the abundant growth of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in the mineral water sources. The aim of this work was to verify the hypothetical involvement of cyanotoxins in this clinical picture. Samples from mostly sulphurous water sources, with thermal characteristics ranging from cold to hyperthermal waters were analysed. ELISA (both in solution and in cellular matrix samples), LC-ESI-HRMS (in cellular matrix samples), and analysis of potential toxicity by means of a standardized bioassay were carried out. The toxic effect observed in the toxicity bioassays in one third of the sources may be related to the existence of microcystins and nodularins and even with other cyanobacterial peptides detected. In addition, several responses observed in the toxicity analyses reflect a pattern, probably linked to a type of hormetic response (hormesis is an adaptive response to low levels of stress, characterized by a biphasic dose-response curve).",

    "abstract": "Epibenthic dinoflagellates occur globally and include many toxin-producing species of concern to human health and benthic ecosystem function. Such benthic harmful algal blooms (BHABs) have been well described from tropical and sub-tropical coastal environments, but assessments from north temperate waters, e.g., northern Europe, and polar regions are scarce. The present study addressed the biodiversity and distribution of potentially toxic epibenthic dinoflagellate populations along the west coast of Sweden (Kattegat-Skagerrak) by morphological and molecular criteria. Morphological analysis conducted by light- and electron-microscopy was then linked by DNA barcoding of the V4 region of 18S rRNA gene sequences to interpret taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. The presence of two potentially toxigenic epibenthic dinoflagellates, Prorocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) F.Stein and Coolia monotis Meunier was confirmed, along with a description of their spatial and temporal distribution. For P. lima, one third of the cell abundance values exceeded official alarm thresholds for potentially toxic BHAB events (>1000 cells gr-1 of macroalgae fresh weight). The same species were recorded consecutively for two summers, but without significant temporal variation in cell densities. SEM analyses confirmed the presence of other benthic Prorocentrum species: P. fukuyoi complex, P. cf. foraminosum and P. cf. hoffmannianum. Analyses of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene also indicated the presence P. compressum, P. hoffmannianum, P. foraminosum, P. fukuyoi, and P. nanum. These findings provide the first biogeographical evidence of toxigenic benthic dinoflagellates along the west coast of Sweden, in the absence of ongoing monitoring to include epibenthic dinoflagellates. Harmful events due to the presence of Coolia at shellfish aquaculture sites along the Kattegat-Skagerrak are likely to be rather marginal because C. monotis is not known to be toxigenic. In any case, as a preliminary assessment, the results highlight the risk of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) events caused by P. lima, which may affect the development and sustainability of shellfish aquaculture in the region.",

    "abstract": "Domoic acid, a phycotoxin produced by species of the marine diatom Pseudo-nitzschia, can cause deleterious impacts to marine food webs and human health. Domoic acid and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were surveyed from 2016 to 2021 in the Pacific waters of Canada to assess their occurrences, concentrations, and relationships with physical and chemical conditions. Domoic acid was common, occurring in measurable concentrations in 73% of the 454 samples. It occurred in all regions (west coast of Vancouver Island, Salish Sea, Queen Charlotte Sound / Hecate Strait, deep oceanic NE Pacific), in all years and all seasons. Median concentrations were highest along the west coast of Vancouver Island, and lowest in the oceanic waters of the NE Pacific. Winter had the lowest concentrations; no significant differences occurred between spring, summer, and autumn. High domoic acid concentrations equal to or above 100 ng/L were not common, occurring in about 5% of samples, but in all seasons and all years except 2019. All six Pseudo-nitzschia taxa identified had similar median concentrations, but different frequencies of occurrence. P. cf. australis appeared to be the major contributor to high concentrations of domoic acid. Physico-chemical conditions were described by ten variables: temperature, salinity, density difference between 30 m and the surface (a proxy for vertical stability), chlorophyll a, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, and the ratios nitrate:phosphate, nitrate:silicate, and silicate:phosphate. Statistical analyses, using general linear models, of their relationships with the absence/presence of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. found silicate (negative) to be the most influential variable common in both the west coast of Vancouver Island and Salish Sea regions. Temperature and chlorophyll a were the most influential variables which determined the log10 abundance of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. in both regions. Analyses of the absence/presence of particulate domoic acid per Pseudo-nitzschia cell (excluding P. americana) found chlorophyll a to be the most influential variable common in both regions, whereas no common influential variable determined the log10 concentration of particulate domoic acid per Pseudo-nitzschia cell (excluding P. americana). These results were generally similar to those of other studies from this area, although this study extends these findings to all seasons and all regions of Canada's Pacific waters. The results provide important background information against which major outbreaks and unusual events can be compared. A domoic acid surveillance program during synoptic oceanographic surveys can help to understand where and when it reaches high concentrations at sea and the potential impacts to the marine ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Benthic dinoflagellates that can cause illness, such as ciguatera poisoning (CP), are prevalent around the Pacific but are poorly described in many locations. This study represents the first ecological assessment of benthic harmful algae species in the Kingdom of Tonga, a country where CP occurs regularly. Surveys were conducted in June 2016 in the Tongatapu island group, and in June 2017 across three island groups: Ha'apai, Vava'u, and Tongatapu. Shallow subtidal coastal habitats were investigated by measuring water quality parameters and conducting quadrat surveys. Microalgae samples were collected using either macrophyte collection or the artificial substrate method. Benthic dinoflagellates (Gambierdiscus and/or Fukuyoa, Ostreopsis, and Prorocentrum) were counted using light microscopy, followed by molecular analyses (real-time PCR in 2016 and high throughput sequencing (metabarcoding) in 2017) to identify Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa to species level. Six species were detected from the Tongatapu island group in 2016 (G. australes, G. carpenteri, G. honu, G. pacificus, F. paulensis, and F. ruetzleri) using real-time PCR. Using the metabarcoding approach in 2017, a total of eight species (G. australes, G. carpenteri, G. honu, G. pacificus, G. cheloniae, G. lewisii, G. polynesiensis, and F. yasumotoi) were detected. Species were detected in mixed assemblages of up to six species, with G. pacificus and G. carpenteri being the most frequently observed. Ha'apai had the highest diversity with eight species detected, which identifies this area as a Gambierdiscus diversity 'hotspot'. Vava'u and Tongatapu had three and six species found respectively. Gambierdiscus polynesiensis, a described ciguatoxin producer and proposed causative agent of CP was found only in Ha'apai and Vava'u in 2017, but not in Tongatapu in either year. Ostreopsis spp. and Prorocentrum spp. were also frequently observed, with Prorocentrum most abundant at the majority of sites. In 2016, the highest number of Gambierdiscus and/or Fukuyoa cells were observed on seagrass (Halodule uninervis) from Sopu, Tongatapu. In 2017, the highest numbers of Gambierdiscus and/or Fukuyoa from artificial substrate samples were recorded in the Halimeda dominant habitat at Neiafu Tahi, Vava'u, a low energy site. This raised the question of the effect of wave motion or currents on abundance measurements from artificial substrates. Differences in detection were noticed between macrophytes and artificial substrates, with higher numbers of species found on artificial substrates. This study provides a baseline of benthic dinoflagellate distributions and diversity for Tonga that may be used for future studies and the development of monitoring programmes.",

    "abstract": "While harmful algal blooms (HABs) caused by the obligate-mixotroph, Dinophysis acuminata, have been associated with the ciliate, Mesodinium rubrum, the role of zooplankton grazing in the occurrence of these HABs has been under studied. Here, the dynamics of D. acuminata blooms were tracked within two NY, USA, harbors, over three years (2019-2021) during which grazing by native protozooplankton and introduced copepods (Acartia tonsa) was evaluated experimentally using an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) to quantify plankton between 20 µm and 150µm. During each year, protoozooplankton grazing on Dinophysis was low during the bloom initiation period but exceeded cellular growth rates of Dinophysis during the peak bloom period, suggesting that a lack of grazing permitted bloom initiation but grazing onset facilitated bloom decline. The addition of juvenile Acartia increased Dinophysis growth rates in 10 of 14 experiments with differences being significant during three, bloom peak experiments. This finding suggests juvenile copepods can trigger a trophic cascade, potentially consuming Dinophysis-predators and releasing this HAB from grazer control. In contrast, adult Acartia and other mesozooplankton had minimal effects on Dinophysis densities suggesting that mesozooplankton did not directly impact blooms. Collectively, this study demonstrates that reduced grazing pressure at the onset of blooms facilitates bloom development, enhanced grazing during bloom peak can facilitate bloom decline, and that juvenile copepods can promote blooms via the induction of a trophic cascade.",

    "abstract": "The harmful algal bloom species Alexandrium ostenfeldii has a worldwide distribution from polar to tropical habitats and from oceanic to brackish waters. Among other species of the genus Alexandrium, it is one of the causative organisms of paralytic shellfish toxins, but additionally, A. ostenfeldii has also been shown to produce another class of toxins, cyclic imines. The wide distribution of A. ostenfeldii suggests population-specific adaptations to a multitude of environmental parameters and therefore, variable responses to global change drivers, such as warming and shifts in sea surface salinity. In this study we quantified growth and toxin cell quota of two strains of A. ostenfeldii isolated from the arctic Kongsfjord and two strains from the northern European Baltic Sea at various temperature conditions, to assess the impact of global warming on locally adapted populations. Overall, growth of the arctic strains was detected at temperatures between 7.5 and 20 °C, with a maximum growth rate at 15 °C for both strains. The two strains from the Baltic Sea revealed intraspecific differences concerning their thermal tolerance. One strain showed no growth at 25 °C, while the other still had a positive growth rate at 27 °C. Furthermore, three of the strains were exposed to salinities between 10 and 40, revealing a tolerance to a broad range of salinities. Neither temperature nor salinity affected the qualitative toxin composition of any strain, but we detected novel cyclic imines in three of the four tested strains. Furthermore, different temperatures and salinities led to dynamic shifts in total toxin cell quota. Additionally, we detected novel spirolides in both arctic strains of A. ostenfeldii. These findings suggest that arctic A. ostenfeldii might significantly benefit from global warming, while populations from the Baltic Sea may not, and that the Baltic Sea might become unfavourable for western Baltic A. ostenfeldii due to climate change driven decreasing salinity in this area.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms are detrimental events that affect the quality of water and the normal functioning of ecosystems, especially when dominated by toxin-producing species. Although cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins have been reported in the land-sea interface since the late 80s, genetic evidence on how inland freshwaters influence the cyanobacterial communities in these systems is very scarce to date. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the cyanobacterial communities of an inland freshwater reservoir and an estuary located in an aquaculture-rich coastal area of NW Spain. During 2022 and 2023, a total of six sampling campaigns were carried out surrounding the blooming seasons. Cyanobacterial communities and their potential toxicity were analyzed through metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA gene and PCR-based screening of genes involved in the biosynthesis of cyanotoxins. Results demonstrate that the reservoir likely contributed significantly to the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in the estuary, with more than 80 % of reservoir shared cyanobacterial ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants) belonging to potentially toxic genera. Genes related to microcystins and anatoxins were detected in both systems, accompanied by low toxin concentrations. Most key cyanobacterial genera were consistently dominated by specific ASVs, suggesting the presence of a few genotypes resistant to environmental gradients during transport. These findings highlight the influence of freshwater systems on estuarine cyanobacterial communities and demonstrate the potential of genetic tools for their high-resolution monitoring, useful in water management of ecological and economic risks. Further research is recommended to understand the global impacts of cyanobacterial bloom dispersion towards land-sea interface systems, particularly in economically relevant areas.",

    "abstract": "The haptophyte Prymnesium parvum produces large polyether compounds (prymnesins) with lytic properties that accumulate in the cell or may be released into the surrounding environment. At high cell abundances the prymnesins cause devastating damage to ecosystems. Blooms of P. parvum are frequently reported in inland water bodies and brackish coastal areas, and thus salinity has been suggested as a main regulatory factor in bloom control. However, toxicity has mainly been assessed through bioassay and the effect of abiotic factors on prymnesin production is lacking. Here, we explore the effect of salinity and light on prymnesin production in three strains of P. parvum. We find that P. parvum can grow over a wide range of salinities, but that net production of cellular prymnesin is, contrary to previous suggestions, inhibited at low salinities, presumably due to resources being diverted to deal with hypoosmotic stress. In two of the strains, increased cellular prymnesin quotas during salinity-induced stress were instead due to accumulation of toxins in the cells because of low cell division rates. We further observed intraspecific differences in cell physiology in response to light. We found general negative relationships between growth rate and cellular prymnesin quotas, both within and among strains. Overall, we find large intraspecific variation in cell physiology in response to salinity and light but demonstrate several general patterns. Such broad intraspecific variation may partly explain the success of various strains of P. parvum in a wide range of environments.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the thermal niche of harmful algae is crucial for understanding and projecting the effects of future climate change on harmful algal blooms. The effects of 6 different temperatures (18–32 °C) on the growth, photophysiology, and toxicity were examined in the dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum, and the raphidophytes, Heterosigma akashiwo and Chattonella subsalsa from the Delaware Inland Bays (DIB). K. veneficum and H. akashiwo had skewed unimodal growth patterns, with temperature optima (Topt) at 28.6 and 27.3 °C respectively and an upper thermal niche limit of 32 °C. In contrast, C. subsalsa growth increased linearly with temperature, suggesting Topt and upper thermal boundaries >32 °C. K. veneficum photosystem II (PSII) photochemical efficiency remained stable across all temperatures, while H. akashiwo PSII efficiency declined at higher temperature and C. subsalsa was susceptible to low temperature (~18 °C) photoinactivation. Cell toxicity thermal response was species-specific such that K. veneficum toxicity increased with temperature above Topt. Raphidophyte toxicity peaked at 25–28 °C and was in close agreement with Topt for growth in H. akashiwo but below C. subsalsa maximal growth. The mode of toxicity was markedly different between the dinoflagellate and the raphidophytes such that K. veneficum had greater hemolytic activity while the raphidophytes had pronounced fish gill cell toxicity. These results and patterns of natural abundance for these algae in the DIB suggest that continued ocean warming may contribute to C. subsalsa bloom formation while possibly promoting highly toxic blooms of K. veneficum.",

    "abstract": "Benthic dinoflagellates of the genus Gambierdiscus produce ciguatoxins, compounds that when metabolized in fish and consumed by humans cause ciguatera poisoning (CP). This syndrome, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, has recently been reported also in subtropical-temperate latitudes such as the Canary Islands where CP events have been regularly detected since 2004. This study examined the effect of temperature on the growth of Gambierdiscus isolated from Canary waters: G. australes, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. excentricus, and G. silvae. From the temperature vs. growth curves, the maximum growth (µm), optimum temperature range for growth (Topt), and the temperature yielding maximum growth (Tm) were estimated for each species. The results revealed temperature-dependent differences in the growth parameters. G. caribaeus had the highest Tm and Topt, followed by G. australes, G. carolinianus, G. silvae, and G excentricus. G. australes tolerated the widest range of temperatures (from 15 °C to 29 °C), which may explain its broader geographic distribution, both worldwide and across the Canary archipelago. Neither G. excentricus nor G. silvae survived at 29 °C whereas G. caribaeus reached mean growth rates (± standard deviation) up to 0.19 ± 0.01 div.day-1 at that temperature, followed by G. australes (0.16 ± 0.01 div.day-1) and G. carolinianus (0.14 ± 0.04 div.day-1). G. caribaeus showed no measurable growth at 19°C, whereas G. excentricus and G. silvae along with G. australes appeared as the species better adapted to lower temperatures. In an intraspecific variability study of 12 strains of G. australes, the mean (± standard deviation) of µm and Tm were 0.17 ± 0.01 div.day-1 and 27.7 ± 0.5 °C, respectively. An analysis of the shapes and position of the cell nuclei at the different temperatures showed that nuclei characteristic of vegetative cells appeared mainly at 26 °C but extreme temperatures resulted in nuclei with a more variable morphology. The presence of putative zygotes at extreme temperatures (17 °C, 19 °C and 29 °C) suggests that sexual reproduction is promoted as an adaptive strategy which could play an important role in the expansion of geographic distribution of Gambierdiscus species.",

    "abstract": "Dolichospermum is a cyanobacterial genus commonly associated with toxic blooms in lakes and brackish water bodies worldwide, and is a long-term resident of Lake Stechlin, northeastern Germany. In recent decades, shifts in the phosphorus loading and phytoplankton species composition have seen increased biomass of Dolichospermum during summer blooms from 1998, peaking around 2005, and declining after 2020. Cyanobacteria are known to rapidly adapt to new environments, facilitated by genome adaptation. To investigate the changes in genomic features that may have occurred in Lake Stechlin Dolichospermum during this time of increased phosphorus loading and higher biomass, whole genome sequence analysis was performed on samples of ten akinetes isolated from ten, 1 cm segments of a sediment core, representing a ∼45-year period from 1970 to 2017. Comparison of these genomes with genomes of extant isolates revealed a clade of Dolichospermum that clustered with the ADA-6 genus complex, with remarkable genome stability, without gene gain or loss events in response to recent environmental changes. The genome characteristics indicate that this species is suited to a deep-chlorophyll maximum, including additional light-harvesting and phosphorus scavenging genes. Population SNP analysis revealed two sub-populations that shifted in dominance as the lake transitioned between oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions. Overall, the results show little change within the population, despite diversity between extant populations from different geographic locations and the in-lake changes in phosphorus concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Biotic interactions are a key factor in the development of harmful algal blooms. Recently, a lower abundance of planktonic dinoflagellates has been reported in areas dominated by seagrass beds, suggesting a negative interaction between both groups of organisms. The interaction between planktonic dinoflagellates and marine phanerogams, as well as the way in which bacteria can affect this interaction, was studied in two experiments using a non-axenic culture of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum exposed to increasing additions of eelgrass (Zostera marina) exudates from old and young leaves and to the presence or absence of antibiotics. In these experiments, A. minutum abundance, growth rate and photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), as well as bacterial abundance, were measured every 48 h. Toxin concentration per cell was determined at the end of both experiments. Our results demonstrated that Z. marina exudates reduced A. minutum growth rate and, in one of the experiments, also the photosynthetic efficiency. These results are not an indirect effect mediated by the bacteria in the culture, although their growth modify the magnitude of the negative impact on the dinoflagellate growth rate. No clear pattern was observed in the variation of toxin production with the treatments.",

In this study, we aimed to identify unknown analogs of these emerging toxins in mussels collected in the Ingril lagoon, France. First, untargeted data acquisitions were conducted by means of liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Data processing involved a molecular networking approach, and a workflow dedicated to the identification of biotransformed metabolites. Additionally, targeted analyses by liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry were also implemented to further investigate and confirm the identification of new compounds. For the first time, a series of 13-O-acyl esters of portimine-A (n = 13) were identified, with fatty acid chains ranging between C12:0 and C22:6. The profile was dominated by the palmitic acid conjugation. This discovery was supported by fractionation experiments combined with the implementation of a hydrolysis reaction, providing further evidence of the metabolite identities. Furthermore, several analogs were semi-synthesized, definitively confirming the discovery of these metabolization products. A new analog of pinnatoxin, with a molecular formula of C",

    "abstract": "Sandusky Bay is the drowned mouth of the Sandusky River in the southwestern portion of Lake Erie. The bay is a popular recreation location and a regional source for drinking water. Like the western basin of Lake Erie, Sandusky Bay is known for being host to summer cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) year after year, fueled by runoff from the predominantly agricultural watershed and internal loading of legacy nutrients (primarily phosphorus). Since at least 2003, Sandusky Bay has harbored a microcystin-producing bloom of Planktothrix agardhii, a species of filamentous cyanobacteria that thrives in low light conditions. Long-term sampling (2003-2018) of Sandusky Bay revealed regular Planktothrix-dominated blooms during the summer months, but in recent years (2019-2022), 16S rRNA gene community profiling revealed that Planktothrix has largely disappeared. From 2017-2022, microcystin decreased well below the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Spring TN:TP ratios increased in years following dam removal, yet there were no statistically significant shifts in other physicochemical variables, such as water temperature and water clarity. With the exception of the high bloom of Planktothrix in 2018, there was no statistical difference in chlorophyll during all other years. Concurrent with the disappearance of Planktothrix, Cyanobium spp. have become the dominant cyanobacterial group. The appearance of other potential toxigenic genera (i.e., Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, Cylindrospermopsis) may motivate monitoring of new toxins of concern in Sandusky Bay. Here, we document the regime shift in the cyanobacterial community and propose evidence supporting the hypothesis that the decline in the Planktothrix bloom was linked to the removal of an upstream dam on the Sandusky River.",

    "abstract": "The dinoflagellate Alexandrium pseudogonyaulax, a harmful algal bloom species, is currently appearing in increasing frequency and abundance across Northern European waters, displacing other Alexandrium species. This mixotrophic alga produces goniodomins (GDs) and bioactive extracellular substances (BECs) that may pose a threat to coastal ecosystems and other marine resources. This study demonstrated the adverse effects of A. pseudogonyaulax on four marine trophic levels, including microalgae (Rhodomonas salina), microzooplankton (Polykrikos kofoidii) and mesozooplankton (Acartia tonsa), as well as fish gill cells (RTgill-W1, Oncorhynchus mykiss), ultimately leading to enhanced mortality and cell lysis. Furthermore, cell-free supernatants collected from A. pseudogonyaulax cultures caused complete loss of metabolic activity in the RTgill-W1 cell line, indicating ichthyotoxic properties, while all tested GDs were much less toxic. In addition, cell-free supernatants of A. pseudogonyaulax led to cell lysis of R. salina, while all tested GDs were non-lytic. Finally, reduced egg hatching rates of A. tonsa eggs exposed to cell-free supernatants of A. pseudogonyaulax and impaired mobility of P. kofoidii and A. tonsa exposed to A. pseudogonyaulax were also observed. Altogether, bioassay results suggest that the toxicity of A. pseudogonyaulax is mainly driven by BECs and not by GDs, although further research into factors modulating the lytic activity of Alexandrium spp. are needed.",

The bloom resulted in the death of 14,500 tons of farmed salmon in Nordland and Troms Counties and large economic losses to the aquaculture industry in the region. Fish mortalities due to blooms of this species have occurred before in this region in 1991. Environmental conditions promoting bloom formation and growth of C. leadbeateri are, however, still poorly understood. Here we investigated growth as a function of temperature, salinity and irradiance in combinations using a high throughput experimental set-up. Three strains of C. leadbeateri isolated from the 2019 event and an earlier bloom in 1991 were examined. The highest maximal specific growth rate was found at salinities 28-30 and temperatures between 13 and 15 °C, with growth rate generally increasing with irradiance. The upper temperature tolerance for growth for all strains was at 17-19 °C. Further, analyses of the geographical distribution of C. leadbeateri in previous DNA-based studies compiled in the metaPR2 database revealed several ribotypes, and that a cold-water ribotype of C. leadbeateri caused both the 1991 and 2019 blooms.",

Multilocus and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analyses confirmed that this strain represents a novel Nostocalean genus for which we propose the name Kaarinaea lacus gen. nov., sp. nov., in accordance with the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes. The most intriguing morphological feature exhibited by PCC 9237T is the occasional division of proheterocytes. Based on our observations, we propose a hypothesis for the sequence of events taking place leading to this phenomenon. The other interesting feature includes the unusual heterocyte patterning resulting in the development of heterocytes in series in the old culture followed by its fragmentation at this site. Among the genes involved in heterocyte differentiation and patterning, patC and three homologs of hetP were not found from the genome of PCC 9237T. Furthermore, genomic investigations revealed a variant of heterocyte glycolipid gene cluster with a reduced hglB, but having additional gene coding for a protein with TubCN terminal docking domain. Finally, the presence of a pks2-like gene cluster, whose product may interfere with the cellular differentiation, and an anachelin-like gene cluster demands further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Dissolved oceanic CO2 concentrations are rising as result of increasing atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), which has large consequences for phytoplankton. To test how higher CO2 availability affects different traits of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii, we exposed three strains of the same population to 400 and 1,000 µatm CO2, and measured traits including growth rate, cell volume, elemental composition, 13C fractionation, toxin content, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Strains largely increased their growth rates and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen production with higher pCO2 and showed significant changes in their VOC profile. One strain showed a significant decrease in both PSP and cyclic imine content and thereby in cellular toxicity. Fractionation against 13C increased in response to elevated pCO2, which may point towards enhanced CO2 acquisition and/or a downscaling of the carbon concentrating mechanisms. Besides consistent responses in some traits, other traits showed large variation in both direction and strength of responses towards elevated pCO2. The observed intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity of important functional traits within the same population may help A. ostenfeldii to negate the effects of immediate environmental fluctuations and allow populations to adapt more quickly to changing environments.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms can modify the dynamic of aquatic ecosystems and have harmful consequences for human activities. Moreover, cyanobacteria can produce a variety of cyanotoxins, including microcystins, but little is known about the role of environmental factors on the prevalence of microcystin producers in the cyanobacterial bloom dynamics. This study aimed to better understand the success of Planktothrix in various environments by unveiling the variety of strategies governing cell responses to sudden changes in light intensity and temperature. The cellular responses (photosynthesis, photoprotection, heat shock response and metabolites synthesis) of four Planktothrix strains to high-light or high-temperature were studied, focusing on how distinct ecotypes (red- or green-pigmented) and microcystin production capability affect cyanobacteria's ability to cope with such abiotic stimuli. Our results showed that high-light and high-temperature impact different cellular processes and that Planktothrix responses are heterogeneous, specific to each strain and thus, to genotype. The ability of cyanobacteria to cope with sudden increase in light intensity and temperature was not related to red- or green-pigmented ecotype or microcystin production capability. According to our results, microcystin producers do not cope better to high-light or high-temperature and microcystin content does not increase in response to such stresses.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria can dominate the algal community in wastewater ponds, which can lead to the production of cyanotoxins and their release into the environment. We applied traditional and molecular techniques to identify cyanotoxin hazards and high-risk periods in a tropical wastewater treatment system. Potentially toxic cyanobacteria were identified by microscopy and amplicon sequencing over the course of a year. Toxin gene levels were monitored and compared to toxin production to identify likely toxin producing species and high-risk periods. Cyanobacteria were persistent in the effluent year-round, with Planktothrix and Microcystis the most abundant genera; Microcystis could not be resolved beyond genus using amplicon sequencing, but M. flos-aquae was identified as a dominant species by microscopy. Microcystin toxin was detected for the first time in treated effluent at the beginning of the wet season (December 2018), which correlated with an increase in Microcystis amplicon sequence abundance and elevated microcystin toxin gene (mcyE/ndaF) levels. Concomitantly, microscopy data showed an increase in M. flos-aquae but not M. aeruginosa. These data informed a refined sampling campaign in 2019 and results showed a strong correlation between mcyE/ndaF gene abundance, microcystin toxin levels and Microcystis amplicon sequence abundance. Microscopy data showed that in addition to M. flos-aquae, M. aeruginosa was also abundant in February and March 2019, with highest levels coinciding with toxin detection and toxin gene levels. M. aeruginosa was the most abundant Microcystis species detected in selected treated effluent samples by metagenomics analysis, and elevated levels coincided with toxin production. All microcystin genes in the biosynthesis pathway were detected, but microcystin genes from Planktothrix agardhii were not detected. Gene toxin assays were successfully used to predict microcystin production in this wastewater system. Changes in amplicon sequence relative abundance were a useful indicator of changes in the cyanobacterial community. We found that metagenomics was useful not just for identifying the most abundant Microcystis species, but the detection of microcystin biosynthesis genes helped confirm this genus as the most likely toxin producer in this system. We recommend toxin gene testing for the early detection of potential toxin producing cyanobacteria to manage the risk of toxicity and allow the implementation of risk management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Certain species of marine microalgae produce potent biotoxins that pose a risk to human health if contaminated seafood is consumed, particularly filter feeding bivalve shellfish. In regions where this is likely to occur water and seafood produce are regularly monitored for the presence of harmful algal cells and their associated toxins, but the current approach is flawed by a lengthy delay before results are available to local authorities. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) can be used to measure phytoplankton DNA sequences in a shorter timeframe, however it is not currently used in official testing practices. In this study, samples were collected almost weekly over six months from three sites within a known HAB hotspot, St Austell Bay in Cornwall, England. The abundance of algal cells in water was measured using microscopy and qPCR, and lipophilic toxins were quantified in mussel flesh using LC-MS/MS, focusing on the okadaic acid group. An increase in algal cell abundance occurred alongside an increase in the concentration of okadaic acid group toxins in mussel tissue at all three study sites, during September and October 2021. This event corresponded to an increase in the measured levels of Dinophysis accuminata DNA, measured using qPCR. In the following spring, the qPCR detected an increase in D. accuminata DNA levels in water samples, which was not detected by microscopy. Harmful algal species belonging to Alexandrium spp. and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were also measured using qPCR, finding a similar increase in abundance in Autumn and Spring. The results are discussed with consideration of the potential merits and limitations of the qPCR technique versus conventional microscopy analysis, and its potential future role in phytoplankton surveillance under the Official Controls Regulations pertaining to shellfish.",

Harmful microalgae and their associated toxins also pose a threat to human health since they can cause seafood-borne diseases such as ciguatera. Implementation of DNA-based molecular methods together with appropriate detection strategies in monitoring programs can support the efforts for effective prevention of potential outbreaks. A PCR-lateral flow assay (PCR-LFA) in dipstick format was developed in this work for the detection of two Gambierdiscus species, G. australes and G. excentricus, which are known to produce highly potent neurotoxins known as ciguatoxins and have been associated with ciguatera outbreaks. Duplex PCR amplification of genomic DNA from strains of these species utilizing species-specific ssDNA tailed primers and a common primer containing the binding sequence of scCro DNA binding protein resulted in the generation of hybrid ssDNA-dsDNA amplicons. These were captured on the dipsticks via hybridization with complementary probes and detected with a scCro/carbon nanoparticle (scCro/CNPs) conjugate. The two different test zones on the dipsticks allowed the discrimination of the two species and the assay exhibited high sensitivity, 6.3 pg/μL of genomic DNA from both G. australes and G. excentricus. The specificity of the approach was also demonstrated using genomic DNA from non-target Gambierdiscus species and other microalgae genera which did not produce any signals. The possibility to use cells directly for amplification instead of purified genomic DNA suggested the compatibility of the approach with field sample testing. Future work is required to further explore the potential use of the strategy for on-site analysis and its applicability to other toxic species.",

    "abstract": "The effects of nutrient effluents from fish cage aquaculture are an important eutrophication concern. It has been proposed that marine fish farm derived nutrients have the potential to increase phytoplankton abundance and lead to intensification of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and that these blooms may negatively impact both the finfish and the shellfish industry. This study addressed this hypothesis using farmed salmon biomass in Scottish marine waters (as a proxy for nutrient load added to the water column as a consequence of fish farming) cell abundance of HAB taxa that most frequently impact shellfish farms and human health in the region (Dinophysis spp., Alexandrium spp. and Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), and cell abundance of one phytoplankton species of particular concern to the salmon farming industry (Karenia mikimotoi). Data from a 15-year weekly HAB monitoring programme and parallel national monitoring data relating to salmon farm stocking biomass were summarised in 5 km per 5 km aggregation boxes. Linear regression models were used to assess (i) inter-annual variation in cell abundance and total annual farmed salmon biomass; (ii) intra-annual (monthly) variation in harmful phytoplankton cell abundance and salmon biomass; (iii) a further analysis included seasonal effects within the intra-annual analysis. Farmed salmon biomass alone had a non-significant effect on cell abundance of any of the studied phytoplankton taxa. In contrast, a significant effect on cell abundance was found when using location, month or season as the predictive variable. Despite the non-significant impact of fish biomass on phytoplankton counts, the relationship varied seasonally, with a different response of Dinophysis spp. indicating a taxa specific interaction. A possible explanation for the lack of a significant relationship between farmed salmon and harmful phytoplankton cell abundance is that aquaculture farms are generally located in hydrodynamically energetic locations where recurrent flushing likely allows efficient dilution of nutrients. Overall, the analyses suggest that current levels of salmon farming activities do not markedly impact the abundance of routinely monitored biotoxin producing or fish killing phytoplankton taxa in Scottish waters.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms and the toxins they produce pose a growing threat worldwide. Mitigation of such events has primarily focused on phosphorus management and has largely neglected the role of nitrogen. Previous bloom research and proposed management strategies have primarily focused on temperate, dimictic lakes, and less on warm-monomictic systems like those at subtropical latitudes. The in-lake conditions, concentration of total microcystins, and microbial functioning of twenty warm-monomictic lakes in the southcentral United States were explored in the spring and summer of 2021. Our data revealed widespread microcystins in lakes across this region, some of which exceeded regulatory limits. Microcystins were higher in the spring compared to the summer, indicating that warm-monomictic lakes, even across a large range of precipitation, do not follow the trends of temperate dimictic lakes. Microcystins were found in surface waters and bottom waters well below the photic zone, reflecting the persistence of these toxins in the environment. Principal components analyses showed a strong association between microcystins, nitrate + nitrite, and Planktothrix relative abundance and transcriptional activity. Many systems exhibited stronger denitrification in the spring, perhaps contributing to the decreased toxin concentrations in the summer. Counter to most sampled lakes, one lake with the highest concentration of total microcystins indicated nitrogen cycle disruption, including inhibited denitrification. These findings are relevant to mitigating cyanobacterial blooms and toxin production in warm-monomictic systems, and suggests a need to consider nitrogen, and not solely phosphorus, in nutrient management discussions.",

    "abstract": "Dinoflagellates are known to possess an exceptionally large genome organized in permanently condensed chromosomes. Focusing on the contribution of satellite DNA (satDNA) to the whole DNA content of genomes and its potential role in the architecture of the chromosomes, we present the characterization of the satellitome of Alexandriun minutum strain VGO577. To achieve this, we analyzed Illumina reads using graph-based clustering and performed complementary bioinformatic analyses. In this way, we discovered 180 satDNAs occupying 17.38 % of the genome. The 12 most abundant satDNAs represent the half of the satellitome but no satDNA is overrepresented, with the most abundant contributing ∼1.56 % of the genome. The largest repeat unit is 517 bp long but more than the half of the satDNAs (101) have repeat units shorter than 20 bp. We used FISH to map a selected set of 26 satDNAs. Although some satDNAs generate discrete hybridization signals at specific chromosomal locations (hybridization sites, HS), our cytological analysis showed that most satDNAs are dispersed throughout the genome, probably forming short arrays. Two satDNAs co-localize with the 45S rDNA. With the exception of telomeric DNA, no other satDNA yields HS on all chromosomes. In addition, we analyzed nine satDNAs yielding HS in VGO577 in four other A. minutum strains. Polymorphism at the intraspecific level was found for the presence/absence and/or abundance of some satDNAs, suggesting the amplification/deletion of these satDNAs following geographic separation or during culture maintenance of the strains. We also discuss how these results contribute to the understanding of chromosome architecture and evolution of dinoflagellate genomes.",

    "abstract": "Ostreopsis spp. blooms have been occurring in the last two decades in the Mediterranean Sea in association with a variety of biotic and abiotic substrata (macroalgae, seagrasses, benthic invertebrates, sand, pebbles and rocks). Cells proliferate attached to the surfaces through mucilaginous trichocysts, which lump together microalgal cells, and can also be found in the plankton and on floating aggregates: such tychoplanktonic behavior makes the quantitative assessment of blooms more difficult than planktonic or benthic ones. Different techniques have been so far applied for quantifying cell abundances of benthic microalgae for research, monitoring and risk assessment purposes. In this context, the Benthic Dinoflagellates Integrator (BEDI), a non-destructive quantification method for benthic dinoflagellate abundances, was developed and tested within the EU ENPI-CBCMED project M3-HABs. This device allows mechanical detachment of cells without collecting the benthic substrate, providing an integrated assessment of both epiphytic and planktonic cells, i.e. of the number of cells potentially made available in the water volume from \"resuspension\" which could have harmful effects on other organisms (including humans). The present study confirms the effectiveness of the BEDI sampling device across different environments across the Mediterranean Sea and constitutes the first large-scale study of Ostreopsis spp. blooms magnitude in function of different macro- and meso-habitat features across the basin.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton populations in the natural environment interact with each other. Despite rising global concern with Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, which can produce the potent neurotoxin domoic acid, we still do not fully understand how other phytoplankton genera respond to the presence of Pseudo-nitzschia. Here, we used a 4-year high-resolution imaging dataset for 9 commonly found phytoplankton genera in Narragansett Bay, alongside environmental data, to identify potential interactions between phytoplankton genera and their response to elevated Pseudo-nitzschia abundance. Our results indicate that Pseudo-nitzschia tends to bloom either concurrently with or right after other phytoplankton genera. Such bloom periods coincide with higher water temperatures and lower salinity. Pseudo-nitzschia image abundance tends to increase the most from March-May and peaks during May-Jun, whereas the image-derived biovolume and width of Pseudo-nitzschia chains increase the most during Jan-Feb. For most phytoplankton genera, their relationship with Pseudo-nitzschia abundance is noticeably different from their relationship with Pseudo-nitzschia image features. Despite the complexity in the phytoplankton community, our analysis suggests several ecological indicators that may be used to determine the risk of harmful algal blooms.",

    "abstract": "During 2020-2021, an unusually prolonged bloom of the toxigenic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis persisted for more than 12 months along the Gulf coast of Florida, resulting in severe environmental effects. Motivated by the possibility that unusual nutrient conditions existed during summer 2021, the short-term interactions of temperature, nitrogen (N) forms (ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), and urea) and availability on photosynthesis-irradiance responses and N uptake rates were examined in summer 2021 and compared to such responses from the earlier winter. Winter samples were exposed to temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30°C while summer samples were incubated at 15, 25, 30, 33°C, representing the maximum range the cells might experience throughout the water column due to daytime surface heating or extreme weather events. Depending on thermal history of the cells, photosynthetic performance differed when cells were exposed to the same temperature, showing a capacity for thermal acclimation in this species. Although blooms generally do not persist throughout the summer, bloom biomass was remarkably higher in summer than during the winter. However, most of the photosynthetic parameters and N uptake rates, as well as total carbon (C) and N cell−1 were significantly lower in the summer populations, showing that the summer populations were photosynthetically and nutritionally stressed. When the summer cells were treated with urea, however, uptake rates and total C and N cell−1 were higher than with the other N substrates, especially in warmer waters, showing differential thermal responses depending on N forms.",

The movement of particles, representing algal cells, was modelled using surface velocities obtained from the 1.5 km resolution Atlantic Margin Model AMM15. Following validation of model performance against drifter tracks, the model results recreate previously hypothesised onshore advection of harmful algal cells from west of the archipelago during 2006 and 2013, when exceptional Dinophysis spp. abundances were measured at Shetland aquaculture sites. Higher eastward advection of Dinophysis spp. cells was also suggested during 2018. Wind roses explain this higher eastward advection during 2006, 2013 and 2018. The study suggests that the European Slope Current is important for the transport of harmful algal blooms, particularly those composed of dinoflagellates.",

    "abstract": "Blooms of the harmful algae species Karenia brevis are frequent off the southwest coast of Florida despite having relatively slow growth rates. The regional frequency of these harmful algal blooms led to the examination of the dominant estuarine outflows for effects on both K. brevis and the phytoplankton community in general. There is comparatively little information on the growth rates of non-Karenia taxonomic groups other than diatoms. A seasonally based series (Fall, Winter, and Spring) of bioassay experiments were conducted to determine the nutrient response of the coastal phytoplankton community. Treatments included estuarine waters (Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor, and the Caloosahatchee River) applied in a 1:25 dilution added to coastal water to mimic the influence of estuarine water in a coastal environment. Other treatments were 5-15 μM additions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silica (Si) species, amino acids, and N (urea) + P added to coastal water. Incubations were conducted under ambient conditions with shading for 48 h. Analyses of dissolved and particulate nutrients were coupled with HPLC analysis of characteristic photopigments and taxonomic assignments of biomass via CHEMTAX. The coastal phytoplankton community, dominated by diatoms, cyanophytes and prasinophytes, was significantly different both by bioassay and by season, indicating little seasonal fidelity in composition. Specific growth rates of chlorophyll a indicated no significant difference between any controls, any estuarine treatment, P, or Si treatments. Conditions were uniformly N-limited with the highest growth rates in diatom biomass. Despite differing initial communities, however, there were seasonally reproducible changes in community due to the persistent growth or decline of the various taxa, including haptophytes, cyanophytes, and cryptophytes. For the one bioassay in which K. brevis was present, the slow growth of K. brevis relative to diatoms in a mixed community was evident, indicating that identifying the seasonally based behavior of other taxa in response to nutrients is critical for the simulation of phytoplankton competition and the successful prediction of the region's harmful algal blooms.",

    "abstract": "The cyanobacterial species Raphidiopsis raciborskii (Wołoszyńska) Aguilera et al. has a high invasiveness potential, which in less than a century leads to its cosmopolitan spread. In the temperate climate of Europe, R. raciborskii has been reported in many countries, but there is still a lack of detailed information about the current status of its distribution in lakes of Bulgaria, as a part of the southeastern range of its spread in Europe. We investigated the distribution of the species using data on the phytoplankton of 122 lakes surveyed during 13-years period (2009-2022). The species was found in 33 lakes (up to 324 m asl), and 14 new localities were registered during the studied period. The results reveal that the number of lakes with the presence of R. raciborskii (27 % of all research lakes) and its contribution to the total phytoplankton biomass, has increased significantly over the last decade. The species has successfully adapted and dominated the phytoplankton in 9 lakes, forming a bloom in 8 of them. The dominant position of R. raciborskii causes loss of species and functional diversity of phytoplankton and displaces the native bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Lakes with and without the species were compared based on the available data on bioclimatic and local environmental variables. Statistically significant differences were established with respect to water transparency, conductivity, maximum depth and maximum air temperature in the warmest month. Species distribution models (SDMs) were used to identify lakes in high risk of future invasion by R. raciborskii. The results of the SDMs implementation confirmed the high maximum air temperature and low water transparency to be important predictors of the occurrence of R. raciborskii in freshwater lakes in Bulgaria. In the areas with high summer temperatures the most suitable for R. raciborskii development were found to be shallow polymictic or medium deep lakes with small surface area and low water transparency. In areas with a suitable climate, the large, deep reservoirs with high transparency as well as macrophyte dominated lakes have a low probability of occurrence of R. raciborskii. Future colonization of lakes above 500 m asl (but most likely below 700 m asl) is also possible, especially in the conditions of global warming. SDMs account for climatic and biogeographic differences of lakes and could help in elucidating the underlying factors that control the occurrence and adaptation of R. raciborskii in a given area.",

    "abstract": "The study of interactions between copepods of the genus Acartia and toxic dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium has been an important topic during the last four decades. Feeding behavior and physiological responses of copepods have been studied in laboratory and field experiments, sometimes with contradictory results. More recently, an evolutionary adaptive mechanism leading to enhanced tolerance of Alexandrium toxins in a population of Acartia experiencing chronic exposure to these dinoflagellates has been reported. In the present work, we collected data from the existing studies on the effects of Alexandrium on feeding, reproduction and mortality of Acartia. With these data, we performed a systematic review consisting of a secondary analysis employing general or generalized linear models, weighting data from different studies by the reciprocal of their standard deviation. Our first aim was to overcome shortcomings of individual studies: limited ranges of the variables and overlooked variables (experiment length, population adaptation). These shortcomings could have led to inconsistent conclusions by missing heterogeneous patterns in copepod responses and in the interactions between variables. Our second aim was to test the enhanced physiological performance of chronically exposed relative to naïve copepod populations over a wide geographic range. We found that the feeding rate is enhanced by increased food biomass, irrespective of the food type. Toxins do not have a clear effect on egg production and have a bi-phasic effect on egg hatching success, which was negative above a specific threshold. Toxins also increased mortality. Experiment length had a positive effect on egg production and negative on egg hatching. Naïve copepod populations showed consistently lower ingestion of Alexandrium and egg hatching rates, thereby supporting the spread of the aforementioned mechanism across populations over a wide geographic range.",

    "abstract": "Despite the global expansion of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs), research is biased to temperate systems within the global north, such as the Laurentian Great Lakes. This lack of diversity represents a significant gap in the field and jeopardizes the health of those who reside along at-risk watersheds in the global south. The African Great Lake, Lake Victoria, is understudied despite serving as the second largest lake by surface area and demonstrating year-round cHABs. Here, we address this knowledge gap by performing a molecular survey of cHAB communities in three anthropogenically and ecologically important freshwater systems of Victoria's Kenyan watershed: Winam Gulf (Lake Victoria), Lake Simbi and Lake Naivasha. We identified a bloom of non-toxic Dolichospermum and toxic Microcystis in the Winam Gulf, with data suggesting sulfur limitation shapes competition dynamics between these two bloom-formers. Though we did not detect a bloom in Naivasha, it contained the largest diversity of cHAB genera amongst the three lakes. In turn, our results indicated methane metabolism may allow non-toxic picoplankton to outcompete cHAB genera, while suggesting Synechococcus spp. serves as a methane source and sink in this system. Lake Simbi exhibited a non-toxic Limnospira bloom at the time of sampling with very low abundances of cHAB genera present. Subsequently, these results were employed to design a cHAB screening and risk assessment framework for local stakeholders. Cumulatively, this work serves to increase cHAB research efforts on the international scale while serving as an impetus for cHAB monitoring on the local scale.",

The pond is kept alkaline with NaOH to minimise fuel rod corrosion, however alkali-tolerant microbial blooms dominated by the cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena catenata are able to thrive in this hostile environment. This study assessed the impact of alternative alkali-dosing regimens (KOH versus NaOH treatment) on biomass accumulation, using a P. catenata dominated mixed culture, which is representative of the pond environment. Optical density was reduced by 40-67 % with KOH treatment over the 3-month chemostat experiment. Microbial community analysis and proteomics demonstrated that the KOH-dependent inhibition of cell growth was mostly specific to P. catenata. The addition of KOH to nuclear storage ponds may therefore help control growth of this pioneer photosynthetic organism due to its sensitivity to potassium, while maintaining the high pH needed to inhibit the corrosion of stored nuclear fuel.",

    "abstract": "A variety of shellfish toxin-producing Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) occur every year in coastal temperate waters worldwide. These toxic HABs may cause lengthy (months) harvesting bans of mussels and other suspension feeding bivalves exposed to their blooms. To safeguard public health and the shellfish industry, European Union regulations request periodic monitoring of potentially toxic microalgae in seawater and phycotoxins in live bivalve molluscs from shellfish production areas. Monitoring of other toxic microalgae, e.g., fish killers, is based solely on cell counts. Morphological identification and quantification of microalgal cells with light microscopy is time-consuming, requires a good expertise, and accurate identification to species level (e.g., Pseudo-nitzschia species) may require electron microscopy. Toxicity varies among morphologically similar species; there are toxic and non-toxic strains of the same species. Molecular techniques using ribosomal DNA sequences offer a possibility to identify and detect precisely the potentially toxic genus/species. In an earlier project (MIDTAL), specific probes against rRNA sequences of all HAB taxa, known at the time of the project, affecting shellfish areas worldwide were designed, and those affecting Europe were tested and calibrated against rRNA extracts of clonal cultures and field samples. Microarray technology was adopted to relate to cell numbers the fluorescence signal from the reaction of all target species probes spotted in the microarray slides with those present in a single sample extract. The EMERTOX project aimed to develop a more automatic \"Lab on a chip\" (LOC) technology, including a non- (cell) disruptive water concentration system and biosensors for HAB cells detection. Here, calibration curves are presented against toxic microalgae (cultures and field samples) causing endemic and emerging toxicity events in Galicia (NW Spain) and Portugal. Results here relating cell numbers to electrochemical signals will be used in an early warning biosensor for toxic algae.",

    "abstract": "The production of allelochemicals by the toxigenic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella is one of the suggested mechanisms to facilitate its bloom formation and persistence by outcompeting other phototrophic protists and reducing grazing pressure. In Southern California, toxic events caused by A. catenella and paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) regularly impact coastal ecosystems; however, the trophic interactions and mechanisms promoting this species in a food web context are still not fully understood. In the present study, we combined a dynamical mathematical model with laboratory experiments to investigate potential toxic and allelochemical effects of an A. catenella strain isolated off the coast of Los Angeles, Southern California, on competitors and a common zooplankton consumer. Experiments were conducted using three toxigenic strains of A. catenella, comparing the new Californian isolate (Alex Cal) to two strains previously described from the North Sea, a lytic (Alex2) and non-lytic (Alex5) strain, testing for donor density-dependent effects on two phytoplankton species (Rhodomonas salina, Tetraselmis sp.) and on the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. Bioassays revealed a steep decline in competitor and consumer populations with increasing Alex Cal concentrations, indicating an intermediate lytic activity compared to the North Sea strains (lytic Alex2 and non-lytic Alex5). The rotifer fed and grew well on the PST- toxic, but non-lytic Alex5 strain, while its survival significantly decreased with increasing concentrations of the two lytic strains Alex Cal and Alex 2, indicating that negative effects on the rotifer were mediated by allelochemicals rather than PST-toxins. Mixed culture experiments including both competitors and consumers demonstrated that the intensity of allelochemical effects not only depended on the A. catenella density but also on the target density. Negative effects on grazers were alleviated by co-occurring competitors with a lower sensitivity to allelochemicals, thus reducing harmful compounds and allowing grazing control on the dinoflagellate to come into effect again. Results from mixed culture experiments were supported by the mathematical approach used in this study which was calibrated with data from simple monoculture growth, pairwise competition and predator-prey experiments, demonstrating the applicability of this model approach to predict the outcome of more complex food web dynamics at the community level.",

    "abstract": "Ocean acidification is caused by rising atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and involves a lowering of pH combined with increased concentrations of CO2 and dissolved in organic carbon in ocean waters. Many studies investigated the consequences of these combined changes on marine phytoplankton, yet only few attempted to separate the effects of decreased pH and increased pCO2. Moreover, studies typically target photoautotrophic phytoplankton, while little is known of plastidic protists that depend on the ingestion of plastids from their prey. Therefore, we studied the separate and interactive effects of pH and DIC levels on the plastidic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum, which is known to form red tides in coastal waters worldwide. Also, we tested the effects on their prey, which typically are cryptophytes belonging to the Teleaulax/Plagioslemis/Geminigera species complex. These cryptophytes not only serve as food for the ciliate, but also as a supplier of chloroplasts and prey nuclei. We exposed M. rubrum and the two cryptophyte species, T. acuta, T. amphioxeia to different pH (6.8 - 8) and DIC levels (∼ 6.5 - 26 mg C L-1) and assessed their growth and photosynthetic rates, and cellular chlorophyll a and elemental contents. Our findings did not show consistent significant effects across the ranges in pH and/or DIC, except for M. rubrum, for which growth was negatively affected only by the lowest pH of 6.8 combined with lower DIC concentrations. It thus seems that M. rubrum is largely resilient to changes in pH and DIC, and its blooms may not be strongly impacted by the changes in ocean carbonate chemistry projected for the end of the 21st century.",
