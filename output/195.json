    "abstract": "A further step towards a novel approach to adaptive nonlinear control developed at Budapest Tech in the past few years is reported. This approach obviates the use of the complicated Lyapunov function technique that normally provides global stability of convergence at the costs of both formal and essential restrictions, by applying Cauchy sequences of local, bounded basin of attraction in an iterative control that is free of such restrictions. Its main point is the creation of a robust iterative sequence that only slightly depends on the features of the controlled system and mainly is determined be the control parameters applied. It is shown that as far as its operation is considered the proposed method can be located between the robust Variable Structure / Sliding Mode and the adaptive Slotine-Li control in the case of robots or other Classical Mechanical Systems. The operation of these method is comparatively analyzed for a wheel + connected mass system in which this latter component is stabilized along one of the spokes of the wheel in the radial direction by an elastic spring. The robustness of these methods is also investigated againts unknown external disturbances of quite significant amplitudes. The numerical simulations substantiate the superiority of the robust fixed point transformations in the terms of accuracy, simplicity, and smoothness of the control signals applied.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning methods play an essential role in many deep learning approaches because the training of complex models with several parameters is an extremely datahungry process.The execution of such a training process in a fully supervised manner requires numerous labeled examples.Since the labeling of the training samples is very time-consuming, learning approaches that require less or no labeled examples are sought.Unsupervised learning can be used to extract meaningful information on the structure and hierarchies in the data, relying only on the data samples without any ground truth provided.The extracted knowledge representation can be used as a basis for a deep model that requires less labeled examples, as it already has a good understanding of the hidden nature of the data and should be only fine-tuned for the specific task.The trend for deep learning applications most likely leads to substituting as much portion of supervised learning methods with unsupervised learning as possible.Regarding this consideration, our survey aims to give a brief description of the unsupervised clustering methods that can be leveraged in case of deep learning applications.",

The deep learning model can self learn and generalize over a huge volume of data, it has recently gained a lot of interest over the research community in classifying medical images. But deep learning model created from the scratch takes more training time as well as a huge amount of data. Using pre-trained networks for a new, similar problem is the fundamental idea of transfer learning. In this work, the survey on disease diagnosis using deep learning-based transfer learning withBrain MRI images alone is carried out over the last 5 years.The inference drawn from this work is that a hybrid architecture based on transfer learning produced more than 90% accuracy in most of the cases with minimal training time.In hybrid architecture, more than one pre-trained models are integrated to extract high-level features.Pre-trained models are good at recognising high-level features like edges, patterns, and so on.The model designed with pre-trained model starts with learned weights rather than assigning a random value.This promotes faster convergence and, as a result, reduces the amount of time required to train the model.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of 5G in SCADA and ICS environments represents a paradigm shift, offering enhanced connectivity, flexibility, and responsiveness.However, this transition mandates a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity to mitigate the potential risks associated with the openness of the network.As industries continue to embrace the advantages of 5G, it is imperative to strike a balance between innovation and security to ensure the reliable and secure operation of critical infrastructure.Penetration testing enhances network security by pinpointing and emphasizing security concerns.Cybersecurity assessments are increasingly becoming standard practice.Penetration testing, a strategy employed to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks, involves testers trying to compromise systems using the same tools and techniques as malicious attackers.This approach aims to identify vulnerabilities before any potential cyberattack occurs.In this study, we proposed a novel automated cybersecurity risk assessment to categorize the ICS (Industrial Control Systems) cybersecurity vulnerabilities connected to the 5G network.",

The design of the FLCs is based on heuristic fuzzy rules. The stability analysis of these fuzzy control systems is performed using LaSalle's invariant set principle with non-quadratic Lyapunov candidate function. This paper proves that if the derivative of Lyapunov function is negative semi-definite in the active region of each fuzzy rule, then the overall system will be asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov (ISL). The stability theorem suggested in the paper ensures sufficient stability conditions for fuzzy control systems controlling a class of nonlinear processes. The end of the paper contains an illustrative example that describes an application of the stability analysis method.",

    "abstract": "Small and medium-sized enterprises form a significant part of the economy of each country with the greatest potential for growth and the impact on stabilizing the economy.Their success or failure depends not only on know-how, capital, or machinery, but also on human resources, one of the competitive advantages and a critical factor of success.In order to achieve success and ensure the sustainability of business processes, the focus is on employee motivation and employee satisfaction, with an emphasis on effective management as multicultural workers' groups are becoming the current trend in logistics companies.Using Tukey's HSD post-hoc test and ANOVA, differences in the perception of motivation and job satisfaction of employees are identified.As part of the post-hoc analysis, the observed dependencies of the mean values of importance and satisfaction with the effect of selected motivation factors are examined in more detail.Based on the results, the fact that employee motivation in logistics companies in Slovakia and the Czech Republic is different, can be concluded.In addition, it varies according to the size of the enterprise.These findings are important for the members of management because of the globalization of economies and multiculturalism of workers' teams in both logistics and also other enterprises.Finding a variety of preferences for motivational needs and job satisfaction does not make it possible to develop unified motivation programs.The needs of employees regarding the size of the enterprise and also the country of origin must be taken into account by the management of an enterprise.",

    "abstract": "The sliding-rolling ratio between the femoral and tibial condyles throughout the active functional arc of the knee (20-120 degrees of flexion angle) is currently unknown. Since wear is the most determining lifetime factor of the current total knee replacements, the presence of sliding-rolling cannot be neglected. The reason lies in the fact that this phenomenon causes different material abrasion compared to pure sliding or rolling alone. Only a limited amount of studies have dealt with this question related to the condyles of the knee prostheses, most of them by means of experimental tests and only in the segment where the motion begins (0 to 20-30 degrees). The primary aim of this paper is to investigate how the sliding-rolling ratio changes between the condyles of five different knee prostheses in the functional arc of the knee (20-120 degrees) as a function of flexion angle. For the analysis, five prosthesis models with identical boundary conditions have been constituted and numerical simulations were carried out using the MSC.ADAMS program system. Beside the sliding-rolling ratio, the normal and friction force between the connecting surfaces has also been calculated as a function of flexion angle.",

However, the adaptivity of the system is largely aggravated by certain problems of content, compensation and selection. As a result, the success of Hungarian public education, as shown by PISA research, lags far behind its possibilities. In our present paper the adaptive model of vocational education is outlined first, where teaching and learning strategies appear as regulating agents with a formative influence on the educational process. The preferred patterns of learning and teaching strategies typical of the individual yield the learning and teaching styles. In the second part of the paper, the results of a longitudinal examination performed among secondary vocational school students in Budapest are presented. The answers to the following questions are sought: how much learning strategy and style can be regarded as an individual characteristic, how it changes with the progress of studies, and whether it shows any correlation with the gender or specialization of the students.",

    "abstract": "In the practice, precise and efficient control is needed for certain state variables of multiple variable physical systems in which the number of the independent control variables is less than that of the independent state variables.In such cases, either the propagation of certain state variables is completely abandoned or the concept of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied in which the model of the controlled system is embedded into the mathematical framework of the Optimal Controllers.This approach uses a cost function that summarizes the contributions of the frequently contradictory requirements.By minimizing this cost a kind of \"compromise\" is achieved.Whenever approximate and/or incomplete system models are available, the use of this controller is justified only for short time-intervals.The only way to reduce the accumulation of the effects of the modeling errors is the frequent re-design of the time horizon from the actual state as initial state that is done by the Receding Horizon Controllers.The more sophisticated Adaptive Controllers are designed by the use of Lyapunov's \"Direct Method\" that has a complicated mathematical framework that cannot easily be combined with that of the optimal controllers.As a potential competitor of the Lyapunov function-based adaptive controllers a Fixed Point Transformation-based approach was invented that in the first step transforms the the problem of computing the control signal into the task of finding an appropriate fixed point of a contractive map.The fixed point can be found by iteration in which the iterative sequence is generated by this contracting map.This method can be used for contradiction resolution without the minimization of any cost function by tracking the observable state components with time-sharing on a rotary basis.In the present paper a novel fixed point transformation is introduced.It is shown that this construction for monotonic response function of bounded derivative can guarantee global stability.Furthermore, the time-sharing-based method is demonstrated by the control of an underactuated 3 DoF Classical Mechanical system via numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "The Tensor Product (TP) model transformation is a recently proposed technique for transforming given Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) state-space models into polytopic model form, namely, to parameter varying convex combination of Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems. The main advantage of the TP model transformation is that it is executable in a few minutes and the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI)-based control design frameworks can immediately be applied to the resulting polytopc models to yield controllers with tractable and guaranteed performance. Various applications of the TP model transformation-based design were studied via academic complex and benchmark problems, but no real experimental environment-based study was published. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to study how the TP model transformation performs in a real world problem and control setup. The laboratory concept for TP model-based controller design, simulation and real time running on an electromechanical system is presented. Development system for TP model-based controller with one hardware/software platform and target system with real-time hardware/ software support are connected in the unique system. Proposed system is based on microprocessor of personal computer (PC) for simulation and software development as well as for real-time control. Control algorithm, designed and simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, use graphically oriented software interface for real-time code generation. Some specific conflicting industrial tasks in real industrial crane application, such as fast load positioning control and load swing angle minimization, are considered and compared with other controller types.",

This research is a two-stage model designed to fully rank the organizational departments where each department has multiple inputs and outputs. First, the department evaluation problem is formulated by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and separately formulates each pair of units. In the second stage, the pair- wise evaluation matrix generated in the first stage is utilized to fully rank-scale the units via the Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). The FANP method adopted here uses triangular fuzzy numbers. ANP equipped with fuzzy logic helps in overcoming the impreciseness in the preferences. DEA-FANP ranking does not replace the DEA classification model; rather, it furthers the analysis by providing full ranking in the DEA context for all departments, efficient and inefficient.",

    "abstract": "It is a well-known fact that in modern societies educational systems are inseparably tied to the labour market.Individuals invest in their own economic potential through education and training; therefore, they increase their labour market value and their future earnings, according to human capital theory.The primary objective of this paper was to examine the decisions made by young people studying in Hungary on continuing their education and selecting the appropriate institution and degree programme, as well as their expectations for their degree.The examination was conducted by means of a questionnaire in seven Hungarian higher education institutions.The findings revealed that students' decisions on going on to higher education are largely influenced by the prospect of a better job in the future, as well as the likelihood of career and financial success.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the safety of the equipment, its environment and most importantly, the operator during robot operations is of paramount importance.Robots and complex robotic systems are appearing in more and more industrial and professional service applications.However, while mechanical components and control systems are advancing rapidly, the legislation background and standards framework for such systems and machinery are lagging behind.As part of a fundamental research work targeting industrial robots and industry 4.0 solutions for completely automated slaughtering, it was revealed that there are no particular standards addressing robotics systems applied to the agri-food domain.More specifically, within the agri-food sector, the only standards existing for the meat industry and the red meat sector are hygienic standards related to machinery.None of the identified standards or regulations consider the safety of autonomous robot operations or human-robot collaborations in the abattoirs.The goal of this paper is to provide a general overview of the regulations and standards (and similar guiding documents) relevant for such applications, that could possibly be used as guidelines during the development of inherently safe robotic systems for abattoirs.Reviewing and summarizing the relevant standard and legislation landscape should also offer some instrumental help regarding the foreseen certification procedure of meat processing robots and robot cells for slaughterhouses in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Economic activities are not conducted in a vacuum; external factors may influence production efficiency, and the activity itself may also result in positive or negative impacts.Although disregarding animal welfare aspects appears to hurt only animals that are harmed as a consequence, banning animal torture is as significant a social interest as combating environmental pollution.Therefore, countries and relevant organisations of certain countries (such as the European Union) regulate via provisions the enforcement of animal welfare aspects with regard to economic activities.Below, economic activities covered by animal welfare regulations and the impacts of animal welfare requirements on economic efficiency will be analysed.In most cases, fulfilling such requirements imposes higher costs for the company at issue and, thus, has an inflationary effect on prices similar to levying a tax.As a consequence, animal welfare regulations generally jolt enterprises from the usual minimum cost-maximum return intersection, so animal protection may appear costly at first.However, in the long term in most cases, they do not bring lower revenues because applying the newoften more expensivemethod or technology boosts productivity and because the loss of competitors due to compliance failure may increase the market share for complying companies.The consumers' behaviour is a paradox: on one hand, they are becoming more and more aware of the environmental impacts of their daily lives, whereas on the other hand, concern for the ethical treatment of animals does not always mean changes in purchasing habits.If we look at the production side, animal healthcare statistics prove that the large majority of losses in livestock breeding (mortality, compulsory slaughtering, diseases, poor reproduction and body mass index (BMI) results, medical expenses, etc.) are not caused by obligate pathogens.Most losses are the direct result of diseases due to unfavourable conditions related to animal breeding, feeding and raising or other external factors (power failure, damages from hail, etc.).Through the appropriate keeping and adequate care of animals, sensible animal welfare attitudes and practices may prevent material losses.",

    "abstract": "The issue of capital structure is among the most commonly discussed fields within Corporate Finance Theory.By optimizing the capital structure, it is possible to achieve an increase in the company value and increase the company flexibility and competitiveness.Economists have, for more than half a century, seen tax benefits (tax shields) as a capital structure determinant.Nonetheless, leverage is also influenced by earnings management, which can significantly reduce information asymmetry, between stakeholders when used correctly.This paper examines the influence of the tax shield and earnings management on a corporate capital structure, in V4 countries.In order to determine the influence of the tax shield and earnings management, panel data model was used.Net sample consisted of 10627 companies from the V4 countries from 2014-2017.The results of the model indicate that corporate behavior in the area of capital structure follows Pecking order; short-term trade credit is the most commonly used liability.The interest tax shield is of little importance for deciding between debt and equity, while the non-debt tax shield is negatively correlated with debt.Furthermore, an inverse correlation between debt and earnings management, as measured by the modified Jones model, indicates that debt monitoring, reduces agent costs and reduces the application of earnings management techniques.",

First, we present the fascination or the obsession of Pauli for the interpretation of number ‘137’. Second, we treat the spontaneous messages originating from unconscious concerning number ‘137’ in the wellknown dreams of Pauli. We restrict our investigations to the dreams containing the especially important formulae of Fine Structure Constant (4π + π + π), and also that containing the so-called background models of mathematical control systems. Third, we shortly mention four of the numerous synchronicities arising during the Pauli–Jung collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Remote monitoring of the status of beehives is essential for efficient beekeeping, leading to less workload on the beekeeper and, because of not opening the hives too frequently, to less stress for the colonies.Sound analysis, utilizing machine learning models of various paradigms, is a common feature of so-called smart hives.Most of these models are aimed at the task of swarming prediction.Swarming of a colony, a fundamental phenomenon in the reproductive process of bees, can cause substantial losses in the production of the apiary and, thus, its prediction is of utmost importance.However, especially in case of nomadic beekeeping where the apiary is moved to the country without access to electricity and good internet connection, the used prediction models should run \"on-site\" with as low energy consumption as possible and using internet connection only to send alerts to the beekeeper.For such, lightweight models are required which can be achieved by using simpler prediction models and/or only the most important audio features.In this paper, the importance of audio features for swarming prediction is investigated by using a genetic algorithm.Various Machine Learning models are trained, using the selected features, and used for predicting swarming on real-world data collected in one Hungarian apiary.This experimental evaluation is the main contribution of this paper.While genetic algorithms are commonly used for feature selection, however, to the best of the authors' knowledge, they have not yet been used in the beekeeping domain.",

    "abstract": "Traditional edge-detection algorithms in image processing typically convolute a filter operator and the input image, and then map overlapping input image regions to output signals. Convolution also serves as a basis in biologically inspired (Sobel, Laplace, Canny) algorithms. Recent results in cognitive retinal research have shown that ganglion cell receptive fields cover the mammalian retina in a mosaic arrangement, with insignificant amounts of overlap in the central fovea. This means that the biological relevance of traditional and widely adapted edge-detection algorithms with convolutionbased overlapping operator architectures has been disproved. However, using traditional filters with non-overlapping operator architectures leads to considerable losses in contour information. This paper introduces a novel, tremor-based retina model and edge-detection algorithm that reconciles these differences between the physiology of the retina and the overlapping architectures used by today's widely adapted algorithms. The algorithm takes into consideration data convergence, as well as the dynamic properties of the retina, by incorporating a model of involuntary eye tremors and the impulse responses of ganglion cells. Based on the evaluation of the model, two hypotheses are formulated on the highly debated role of involuntary eye tremors: 1) The role of involuntary eye tremors has information theoretical implications 2) From an information processing point of view, the functional role of involuntary eye-movements extends to more than just the maintenance of action potentials. Involuntary eye-movements may be responsible for the compensation of information losses caused by a non-overlapping receptive field architecture. In support of these hypotheses, the article provides a detailed analysis of the model's biological relevance, along with numerical simulations and a hardware implementation.",

    "abstract": "Accurate design of heat treatment operations requires the knowledge of the HeatTransfer Coefficients (HTC), which quantity can be determined by performing Inverse Heat Transfer Calculations.The novel approaches for the estimation of HTC are based on heuristic optimisation methods, but the usage of these techniques raises several questions.In the case of genetic algorithms, there are not any rules of thumb for selecting the appropriate population size, mutation rate, stopping condition, and similar.The most efficient way to fine-tune these parameters is to run thousands of experimental tests and evaluate the results.However, in the case of inverse heat conduction, this has not been a viable option because of the high computational demand of fitness calculation which leads to a runtime of dozens of years.This paper presents a solution to this problem using a novel data-parallel direct heat conduction problem solver method implemented on multiple graphics accelerators.The ~100× speed-up achieved by this parallel algorithm made it possible to finish the necessary experimental tests in 15 weeks (instead of 29 years).Data gathered during these experiments are directly useful in practice.Based on these, it is possible to make recommendations for optimal genetic algorithm configuration parameters.",

    "abstract": "Developing autonomous vehicles is a highly important topic in the field of intelligent transportation systems.Automated steering is a crucial function in the autonomous vehicle.Therefore, it is urgent to either develop a new effective control strategy or improve existing ones.A variety of control strategies are used for this purpose, most with limitations related to their computing capabilities with the highly complex systems or to lack of efficacy related to maintaining the balance between driving performance and driving smoothness.In this paper, three different machine learning-based models were developed to perform an autonomous driving task: a supervised learning model (Deep Neural Network, DNN), a reinforcement Deep Q-learning model (DQN), and a hybrid model.The DNN model was trained based on the behavior of the classical MPC controller.The DQN was designed with the same structure as the DNN and trained by directly interacting with the driving environment.The hybrid model is a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms, where the trained DNN model is used as a decision-maker (Actor) in a deep deterministic policy gradient reinforcement learning model.The behavior of the designed models was compared based on several performance indicators, including the ability to drive the vehicle along the desired trajectory, the response time, and the smoothness of the driving system.The results show that the DNN model was able to imitate the behavior of the traditional MP Controller efficiently and all three machine learning models successfully drive the vehicle along the desired path.The hybrid model achieves the best results and improved the smoothness of the driving system with a reasonable response time.",

    "abstract": "Improved surgical skills play a crucial role in ensuring optimal patient outcomes.Traditional methods for skill assessment include self-rating questionnaires and expert evaluations, but these approaches are prone to bias and require substantial qualified human resources.The emergence of Surgical Data Science (SDS) offers a promising avenue for automating skill assessment, leveraging data science techniques to capture, organize, analyze, and model surgical data.In this paper, kinematic data was employed from the JIGSAWS -which is the only skill-annotated Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RAMIS) dataset -to classify surgeons into novice and experienced groups, using various classification methods (Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Dynamic Time Warping, and 1D Convolutional Neural Network).The research encompasses a thorough analysis of parameter tuning and dimensional reduction techniques with the aim of establishing a universal benchmark for data classification.The surgical training tasks of suturing, knot-tying and needle-passing consistently achieved 100 % accuracy.The accuracy attained during surgical gesture analysis often exceeded the overall accuracy of the global assessment of the dataset.",

Hamilton-Jacobi equations, specially important in the control theory, are for important models usually with non-linear Hamiltonian H which is also not smooth, e.g., the absolute value, min or max operations, where it can not apply the classical mathematical analysis. Using the pseudo-analysis with generalized pseudo-convolution it is possible to obtain solutions which can be interpreted in the mentioned classical way. Another important classes of nonlinear equations, where there are applied the pseudo-analysis, are the Burgers type equations and Black and Shole equation in option pricing. Very recent applications of pseudo-analysis are obtained on equations which model fluid mechanics (Navier-Stokes equation) and image processing (Perona and Malik equation).",

    "abstract": "In this paper a hybrid electric vehicle is considered, which contains both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor (EM). Without focusing on the other components of the vehicle, the EM is treated in detail, both regarding modelling aspects and control solutions. After a brief modelling of the plant, two cascade speed control solutions are presented: first a classical PI+PI cascade control solution is presented. The control systems related to traction electric motors (used in vehicle traction) must be able to cope with different requests, such as variation of the reference signal, load disturbances which depend on the transport conditions and parametric disturbances regarding changes in the total mass of the vehicle. For this purpose, in the design of the speed controller (external loop) a specific methodology based on extension of the symmetrical optimum method is presented. The controllers are developed using the Modulus-Optimum method for the inner loop, and the Extended Symmetrical Optimum Method, corrected based on the 2p-SO-method, for the outer loop (for a more efficient disturbance rejection). In order to force the behaviour of the system regarding the reference input, a correction term is introduced as a non-homogenous structured PI controller solution. Simulations were performed using numerical values taken from a real application consisting in a hybrid vehicle prototype, showing satisfactory behaviour.",

On the one hand these experiments can serve as a proof of concept, as a kind of experimental validation of formal ethological models, but on the other hand they can also serve as examples for the ways a human can communicate with things (i.e., with everyday objects) in a virtual environment (e.g. on the Internet). These kinds of experiments can also support Cognitive Infocommunication related research, the field that investigates how a human can co-evolve with artificially cognitive systems through infocommunications devices. The goal of the paper is to introduce an example for such an ethological test system, a possible way for embedding a prototype ethological model described as a fuzzy automaton in MATLAB to the 3D VirCA collaborative augmented reality environment. Some details of the applied ethological experiment paradigm developed for studying the dog-owner relationship in a standard laboratory procedure, as a demonstrative example for ethological model implementation, will also be discussed briefly in this paper.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops an intelligent robust control algorithm for a class of uncertain nonlinear multivariable systems by using a recurrent-cerebellar-modelarticulation-controller (RCMAC) and sliding mode technology.The proposed control algorithm consists of an adaptive RCMAC and a robust controller.The adaptive RCMAC is a main tracking controller utilized to mimic an ideal sliding mode controller, and the parameters of the adaptive RCMAC are on-line tuned by the derived adaptive laws from the Lyapunov function.Based on the  H control approach, the robust controller is employed to efficiently suppress the influence of residual approximation error between the ideal sliding mode controller and the adaptive RCMAC, so that the robust tracking performance of the system can be guaranteed.Finally, computer simulation results on a Chua's chaotic circuit and a three-link robot manipulator are performed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control algorithm.The simulation results confirm that the developed control algorithm not only can guarantee the system stability but also achieve an excellent robust tracking performance.",

Modeling of engineering objects such as elements and structures of products, results of analyses and tests, processes for production, and customer services has reached the level where sophisticated descriptions and modeling procedures serve lifecycle management of product information (PLM). However, effective utilization of highly associative product models is impossible in current modeling because techniques are not available for tracking and evaluation of high number of associative relationships in large product model. The author analyzed the above problem and considered inappropriate organization of product information as its main cause. In order to gain a solution in current modeling systems, a new method is proposed in this paper for change management. In this method, joint modeling of design objectives and human intent is applied for shape-centered products. As background information for the proposed modeling, paper discusses research results in change management for product development in modeling environments. Following this, integrated modeling of closely related engineering objects is proposed as extension to current industrial PLM systems. Next, design objective driven product change management is detailed. Finally, virtual space is outlined as a possible advanced application of the proposed change management with the capability of representation of human intent.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to transform the model of the impedance controlled robot interaction with feedback delay to a Tensor Product (TP) type polytopic LPV model whereupon Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) based control design can be immediately executed. The paper proves that the impedance model can be exactly represented by a finite element TP type poly- topic model under certain constrains. The paper also determines various further TP models with different advantages for control design. First, it derives the exact Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) based canonical form, then it performs complexity trade-off to yield a model with less number of components but rather effective for LMI design. Then the pa- per presents various different types of convex TP model representations based on the non-exact model in order to investigate how convex hull manipulation can be performed on the model. Fi- nally the presented models are analyzed to validate the accuracy of the transformation and the resulting TP type polytopic LPV models. The paper concludes that these prepared models are ready for convex hull manipulation and LMI based control design.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an important issue in the global business world.The topic has been studied from many viewpoints, but due to its continuous development and constant change, it remains a special and interesting area of scientific life to this day.The essence of CSR is that in addition to economic aspects, companies take into account the interests of society in their business and economic behavior.These behaviors can have many segments, so they can take into account their business partners, suppliers, employees, and the surrounding environment.Despite the fact that CSR literature has grown significantly since the turn of the millennium, researchers are mostly focused on the CSR activities of multinational companies, and there is limited research on SMEs.The relevance of the research topic is undoubtedly proven by the fact that many domestic and international researchers refer to the role of the leadership in CSR.Practical implementation basically depends on the behavior of the organization, and ultimately the attitude of the leader to CSR.In developing this study, I aimed to get to know the motivations, views, and attitudes of examined Hungarian small and medium-sized enterprise leaders regarding CSR.In my opinion, the companies that want to be successful, now and in the future, need to integrate CSR into their business strategy.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for long-term natural Electric consumption prediction. Six models are proposed to forecast annual Electric demand. 104 ANFIS have been constructed and tested in order to find the best ANFIS for Electric consumption. Two parameters have been considered in the construction and examination of plausible ANFIS models. The type of membership function and the number of linguistic variables are two mentioned parameters. Six different membership functions are considered in building ANFIS, as follows: the built-in membership function composed of the difference between two sigmoidal membership functions (dsig), the Gaussian combination membership function (gauss2), the Gaussian curve built-in membership function (gauss), the generalized bell-shaped built-in membership function (gbell), the Π-shaped built-in membership function (pi), psig. Also, a number for linguistic variables has been considered between 2 and 20. The proposed models consist of input variables such as: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Population (POP). Six distinct models based on different inputs are defined. All of the trained ANFIS are then compared with respect to the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). To meet the best performance of the intelligent based approaches, data are pre-processed (scaled) and finally our outputs are post-processed (returned to its original scale). The ANFIS model is capable of dealing with both complexity and uncertainty in the data set. To show the applicability and superiority of the ANFIS, the actual Electric consumption in industrialized nations including the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Italy from 1980 to 2007 are considered. With the aid of an autoregressive model, the GDP and population by 2015 is projected and then with yield value and best ANFIS model, Electric consumption by 2015 is predicted.",

This is accomplished by regulating the wheel slip around its optimum value. Due to the high non-linearity of the tyre and road interaction, and uncertainties from vehicle dynamics, a standard PID controller will not suffice. This paper therefore proposes a non-linear control design using input-output feedback linearization approach. To enhance the robustness of the non-linear controller, an integral feedback method was employed. The stability of the controller is analysed in the Lyapunov sense. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed controller, simulations were conducted on two different road conditions. The results from the proposed method exhibited a more superior performance and reduced the chattering effect on the braking torque compared to the performance of the standard feedback linearization method.",

Both representations are applied on the two former methods, whereas one of them is used for the latter optimization technique. Each mentioned algorithm is involved without and with local search steps as one of its evolutionary operators. Since the evolutionary operators of each technique are established according to the applied representation, this paper deals with a total number of ten different chromosome-based evolutionary methods.

    "abstract": "Based on research results and experience, students who finish K-12 education lack the necessary computational thinking skills that they would need to continue their studies effectively in the field of computer sciences.Our goal was to examine the currently used methods and programming languages in K-12 education and to find and present an alternative approach.Using visual programming environments in education to develop students' computational thinking and algorithmic skills is a widespread practice in K-12 education.These environments mostly provide simplified versions of \"real\" programming languages.In this paper, we present event-action-based visual programming, as an alternative to today's most frequently used methods, which do not restrict the students' development ability to simplified and basic applications while retaining the advantages of visual languages.We organized four workshops in which we presented this programming approach to four distinct groups involved in education.The participants were guided to develop a multiplatform mobile application using Construct 2 event-action-based visual programming.At the end of the sessions we collected data in the form of group interviews and questionnaires on the possibilities of including event-action based visual programming in computer science education.Based on the results, the participants found the method suitable for beginner programmers to help them lay the foundations for more complex, textbased programming languages and to develop a positive attitude towards programming.",

All of these characteristics of a time series of tourist demand, result in them being a great challenge for modeling.Therefore, there are different types of models that can be implemented for the modeling of a time series, which include accentuated seasonal components.Throughout this paper, multiple tests are performed using several parameters of the time series, with the ARIMA model, in an attempt to find any influence on the fit and validity of the model.For the accepted models, series are predicted for a year in advance and, in addition, a method of testing the decisions made by authorities in the field of tourism is presented.",

This paper discusses the requirements of manufacturing engineers for distance collaboration tools and the challenges associated with the creation of such systems through a working prototype implemented in the VirCA NET frame- work. This pilot solution is a novel application in the field of VR-enhanced spatially distributed collaboration via shared virtual spaces using immersive visualization. Typical scenarios are provided to highlight the capabilities offered by VirCA NET. The paper identifies and classifies the challenges of distance collaboration from a cognitive infocommunications (CogInfoCom) perspective. The challenges are presented with respect to the theoretical background of CogIn- foCom engines and channels emphasising the link between virtual collaboration and the aim of CogInfoCom.",

    "abstract": "Fault detection problems in dynamic objects and their localization are a very critical and rather challenging tasks for many practical applications.The Kalman-filter technology is used for these purposes most often.The correct operation indicator of the specified filter is the innovation process to be represented as a normal uncorrelated stochastic process with zero mean value and a priori calculated covariation matrix, except the specified conditions, are violated in case of unforeseen perturbations.The aim of the presented work is to develop a method allowing to restore the normal performance of the Kalman filter in the presence of uncertain disturbances.This aim is attained by applying a special one-to-one transformation of the output equation of the testing system, as a result of it, the disturbance component is modified by the extrapolation equation of the state vector dynamic system.This feature will be used in the sequel when modified Kalman filter is applied to the transformed system.The properties of the obtained filter concerning the stability of estimation errors, their convergence, and optimality are discussed.The efficiency of the method has been verified by the method of statistical modeling on a test example of a third-order dynamic system.",

    "abstract": "As the design, development and execution of manufacturing processes continue to spread out across the world, globally distributed enterprises demand new paradigms.Distance collaboration tools are becoming increasingly important in order to maintain synergies between spatially distributed entities enabling effective cooperation over large distances.Virtual Reality (VR) technologies offer unique possibilities for the exchange of planning stages as well as for the identification and collective resolution of problems.This paper discusses the requirements of manufacturing engineers for distance collaboration tools and the challenges associated with the creation of such systems through a working prototype implemented in the VirCA NET framework.This pilot solution is a novel application in the field of VR-enhanced spatially distributed collaboration via shared virtual spaces using immersive visualization.Typical scenarios are provided to highlight the capabilities offered by VirCA NET.The paper identifies and classifies the challenges of distance collaboration from a cognitive infocommunications (CogInfoCom) perspective.The challenges are presented with respect to the theoretical background of CogIn-foCom engines and channels emphasising the link between virtual collaboration and the aim of CogInfoCom.",

    "abstract": "Discussion, evaluation and error recognition, in natural language digital texts, is one of the most neglected areas in the digital world, despite the fact that text management is the most prevalent computer related activity.Millions of erroneous text-based documents of different types are in circulation, without us being aware of how fragile, damaged and harmful they are.It is well accepted in programming and even in other end-user activities, that error recognition plays a crucial role in teaching, learning and in real-world problemsolving processes.In the present paper, we introduce the High-mathability Error Recognition Model, which consists of the processes used in discussion and concept-based problemsolving and we also provide examples of the utilization of the model.We argue that error recognition and correction, and the assessment of problems in text management are as important as in other fields of informatics and computer sciences.In our study experimental groupsstudying with the Error Recognition Modeland control groupsstudying with low-mathability tool-centered approacheswere compared.It was found that the Error Recognition Model is more effective in digital text management, than for the tool-centered methodologies, in two error types: the typographic and layout-breaking error categories and a strong compensation effect was found in the syntax error category.",

    "abstract": "A current source converter (CSC) based static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is a shunt flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) device, which has a vital role in stability support for transient instability and damping support for undesirable interarea oscillations in an interconnected power network.A robust pole-shifting based controller for CSC-STATCOM with damping stabilizer is proposed.In this paper, poleshifting controller based CSC-STATCOM is designed for enhancing the transient stability of two-area power system and PSS based damping stabilizer is designed to improve the oscillation damping ability.First of all, modeling and pole-shifting based controller design, with damping stabilizer for CSC-STATCOM, are described.Then, the impact of the proposed scheme in a test system with different disturbances is demonstrated.The feasibility of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulation in MATLAB and the simulation results show an improvement in power system stability in terms of transient stability and oscillation damping ability with damping stabilizer based CSC-STATCOM.So good coordination between damping stabilizer and pole-shifting controller based CSC-STATCOM is shown in this paper for enhancing the power system stability.Moreover, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are better than without damping stabilizer in CSC-STATCOM.",

    "abstract": "The task of automatically identifying a language used in a given text is called Language Identification (LI).India is a multilingual country and many Indians especially youths are comfortable with Hindi and English, in addition to their local languages.Hence, they often use more than one language to post their comments on social media.Texts containing more than one language are called \"code-mixed texts\" and are a good source of input for LI.Languages in these texts may be mixed at sentence level, word level or even at sub-word level.LI at word level is a sequence labeling problem where each and every word in a sentence is tagged with one of the languages in the predefined set of languages.For many NLP applications, using code-mixed texts, the first but very crucial preprocessing step will be identifying the languages in a given text.In order to address word level LI in code-mixed Kannada-English (Kn-En) texts, this work presents i) the construction of code-mixed Kn-En dataset called CoLI-Kenglish dataset, ii) code-mixed Kn-En embedding and iii) learning models using Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Transfer Learning (TL) approaches.Code-mixed Kn-En texts are extracted from Kannada YouTube video comments to construct CoLI-Kenglish dataset and code-mixed Kn-En embedding.The words in CoLI-Kenglish dataset are grouped into six major categories, namely, \"Kannada\", \"English\", \"Mixed-language\", \"Name\", \"Location\" and \"Other\".Code-mixed embeddings are used as features by the learning models and are created for each word, by merging the word vectors with sub-words vectors of all the sub-words in each word and character vectors of all the characters in each word.The learning models, namely, CoLI-vectors and CoLI-ngrams based on ML, CoLI-BiLSTM based on DL and CoLI-ULMFiT based on TL approaches are built and evaluated using CoLI-Kenglish dataset.The performances of the learning models illustrated, the superiority of CoLIngrams model, compared to other models with a macro average F1-score of 0.64.However, the results of all the learning models were quite competitive with each other.",

    "abstract": "The Flexible Job Shop Problem (FJSP) represents a significant challenge in the field of planning due to its complexity and the constant need for problem-solving in the market.It should be emphasized that FJSP is one of the most difficult NP problems in combinatorial optimization.One of the key factors in maintaining the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises in the market is increasing productivity while minimizing costs and manufacturing time.This paper proposes a multi-criteria approach, whose main role is job prioritization and FJSP optimization using a metaheuristic algorithm in a specific case study of a furniture manufacturing company.To determine the weight coefficients, two methods, the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and the fuzzy Full Consistency Method (FFUCOM), were integrated, while the fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (FWASPAS) method was used for job ranking.As the next step in the study, the NSGA II algorithm was applied to optimize FJSP.Based on the conducted case study and production optimization, experimental results demonstrated the success of the proposed methodology and improved the organization of production resources after job prioritization.",

    "abstract": "Volcanic eruptions cause significant loss of lives and property around the world each year.Their importance is highlighted by the sheer number of volcanoes for which eruptive activity is probable.These volcanoes are classified as in a state of unrest.The Global Volcano Project maintained by the Smithsonian Institution estimates that approximately 600 volcanoes, many proximal to major urban areas, are currently in this state of unrest.A spectrum of phenomena serve as precursors to eruption, including ground deformation, emission of gases, and seismic activity.The precursors are caused by magma upwelling from the Moho to the shallow (2-5 km) subsurface and magma movement in the volcano conduit immediately preceding eruption.Precursors have in common the fundamental petrologic processes of melt generation in the lithosphere and subsequent magma differentiation.Our ultimate objective is to apply stateof-the-art machine learning techniques to volcano eruption forecasting.In this paper, we applied machine learning techniques to the precursor data, such as the 1999 eruption of Redoubt volcano, Alaska, for which a comprehensive record of precursor activity exists as USGS public domain files and global data bases, such as the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanology Project and Aerocom (which is part of the HEMCO data base).As a result, we get geophysically meaningful results.",

    "abstract": "Large spacecrafts undertaking long-life mission greatly suffer from the nonlinear fuel slosh when altering the orbit or maneuvering, which leads to the downgrade on the performance and even stability of the body attitude control by unintentionally generating the huge disturbance thrust.In order to specifically address this solid-liquid coupling problem for a kind of spacecrafts when altering orbit, a nonlinear control method based on Tensor Product (TP) Model transformation is proposed to make a quick response control of the translational velocity vector and the attitude of the spacecraft.Based on the derived polytopic system from TP model transformation, the controller design can guarantee the robust against the uncertainties and disturbances for all system sets within the bounds.The proposed solution also offers an approximation tradeoff so that both the complexity of the TP model and the controller design can be dramatically minimized.The simulation results for spacecrafts with practical specification verify that the design method can make the spacecraft asymptotically stable and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

    "abstract": "The paper deals with the identification of the system parameters in the nonlinear dynamic model of fixed wing UAVs.Fixed wings airplanes are popular in long distance applications and have to be modelled accurately to guarantee efficient control properties.Different methods are suggested to solve the parameter estimation beginning with the standard linear regression (LR) and continued with its extension (ELR), the optimization using interior point methods and finally using the FireFly technique, which is a metaheuristic algorithm.The methods illustrate the convergence and the speed of these approaches.The known default parrameter values of a Sekwa UAV were used to demonstrate that the elaborated identification methods can also reconstruct the numerical values of the dimensionless system parameters embedded into the nonlinear model using the physical weighting functions.After the extension of linear regression, MinMax optimization algorithm was used to get the best and optimal solution and reconstruct the parameters of the Sekwa aircraft.FireFly optimization gives also comparable results with minmax method.Flight data was needed for simulation and testing the different approaches.Matlab and toolboxes were used as simulation software.The results showed the estimated parameters are more accurate than linear regression estimation.Even though it is a small improvment this will reflect in all calculations.",

Utilization this approach and some relevant methods have been investigated by the authors to establish course modeling in virtual university environments. The main objective is definition generic model entities for courses and instance model entities for student course profiles. Course model entities describe virtual university activities. The modeling can be applied generally but it is being developed for the domain of higher education in virtual technologies. The paper introduces some virtual university related concepts and the approach of the authors to virtual university. Following this feature driven associative model of virtual course developed by the authors is explained. Some issues about the conceptualized application oriented virtual course features are discussed as a contribution to implementation of a virtual classroom model proposed by the authors. Finally, possibilities of integration of the university model with engineering modeling systems are discussed taking into account present day virtual universities and possibilities to communicate with prospective students both in professional design and home computer environments.",

    "abstract": "There is already a lot of research in the literature on the binary separation of healthy people and people with some illnesses that affects speech.However, there are only a few examinations where more illnesses are recognized together.The examination of the latter is justified by the fact that a person may suffer from several illnesses at the same time to a certain extent.In the present study, multiclass classification of depression, Parkinson's disease, and general voice disorders (organic and functional dysphonia) was performed using speech samples.Foremost, several acoustic features were examined as input (such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), mel-band energy values, formants and their bandwidths).Using the inputs, auto-and cross-correlation structures were formed as image representations and fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN).Parameter optimization of the correlation structures and the CNN model was applied to achieve the highest accuracy.Moreover, the result of the tuned process was compared to the result of a baseline process.Finally, multiclass (5 and 4 classes) classification was performed with the best parameters.The prominent feature set was the MFCCs (55.9% accuracy, for 5 class classification.64.3% accuracy and 60.0% macro F1-score was obtained for 5 classes after parameter optimization.For classifying 4 classes (merging dysphonic ones together), 74.9% accuracy and 71.7% macro F1-score was achieved.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study on predicting academically at-risk engineering students at the early stage of their education.For this purpose, some soft computing tools namely support vectors machines and artificial neural networks have been employed.The study population included all students enrolled in Pamukkale University, Faculty of Engineering at 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 academic years as freshmen.The data are retrieved from various institutions and questionnaires conducted on the students.Each input data point is of 38-dimension, which includes demographic and academic information about the students, while the output based on the first-year GPA of the students falls into either at-risk or not.The results of the study have shown that either support vector machine or artificial neural network methods can be used to predict first-year performance of a student in a priori manner.Thus, a proper course load and graduation schedule can be transcribed for the student to manage their graduation in a way that potential dropout risks are reduced.Moreover, an input sensitivity analysis has been conducted to determine the importance of each input used in the study.",

    "abstract": "Temporal temperature evolution of ballastless railway track is a random process caused by complex environmental actions.The vertical temperature gradient (VTG), varying continuously with time, has significant effects on the repeated deformation of ballastless track.However, few researchers have considered the statistical analysis of VTGs in alpine and plateau environs characterized by high altitude, strong solar radiation and high diurnal temperature differences.In this study, a temperature field test platform of ballastless track was established in Shannan City, Tibet and the temperature field of ballastless track was measured.Based on four statistical methods, a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) and a third-order polynomial normal transformation technique (TPNT), the VTGs of ballastless track in alpine and plateau areas, are statistically analyzed.The results show that the applied statistical methods, used for predicting the VTG representative value, in ballastless track, are feasible within different application conditions.The recommended positive and negative representative values of the VTG of ballastless track are 91.58o C/m and -40.15 o C/m, and 82.83 o C/m and -35.03 o C/m, with failure probabilities of 1% and 5% respectively, in alpine and plateau areas.The research results can provide a reference for the design and maintenance of ballastless track used in alpine and plateau environs.",

In the study we apply the definition of knowledge-based services to higher education institutions in order to explore various aspects of the role of the university as a site of knowledge management, ranging from active student participation in higher education to the methods and tools that can be used for knowledge scouting, caring and developing at university. We intend to identify clusters of students in line with the phases of the knowledge model as the result of the research. Our hypothesis is that there are some biases among these phases, i.e. these clusters; so the aim of our research is to reveal the reasons for the asymmetrical nature of the process and to find out the prospects how to moderate it - with providing recommendations to the strengthening of each knowledge management phase. Other purpose of the study is the generalization of results in order to determine conclusions by literature which are valid to the whole higher education system.",

    "abstract": "Based particularly on data technologies, information is rapidly evolving in engineering.In mechanical engineering, maintenance is benefiting the most from data innovations, the reduction of maintenance costs, and the improvement of system availability.Modern reliability engineering targets uncertainty with advanced statistics and data science.This paper explores maintenance descriptive analytical techniques to determine whether variations between porosity percentage in batches from two similar machines are due to randomness, suggesting technical issues on machinery.The finding is backed by statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and data mining.Python 3 was used following best practices of data science and data visualization as the main toolset to explore the working data, execute the proposed statistical analysis, and make conclusions.The findings were promising reinforcing the importance of advanced statistics for reliability studies.As a conclusion, we failed to reject the null hypothesis suggesting that there was no apparent difference between sample means.With a confidence of 95%, the difference is explained by natural variations and randomness inherent to the fabrication process.",

    "abstract": "Aircraft applications require high reliability, high availability, and high power density, while aiming to decrease weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impacts.Modern electric driving systems can meet these demands and provide significant technical and economic enhancements over traditional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems.Due to the high reliability of Switched Reluctance Motors (SRMs), it can be used for aircraft electromechanical actuators to replace the conventional actuators.This paper presents Model Predictive Control (MPC) for the actuators system to drive flight control surfaces in modern civil aircraft.In this study, the actuators system with nonlinear SRM is modeled, simulated, and controlled using a predictive control technique.The predictive control algorithm is applied for a three-phase controlled rectifier to provides a fixed DC voltage for actuators supply bus, and for SRM's symmetrical power converter to drive the surface of the actuator.The performance of the proposed system is tested using a simulation model in PSIM software, and the controller is programmed using C language.Obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the suggested system to drive aircraft electromechanical actuators satisfactorily for either tracking demanded motor speed or desired actuator deflection angle.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years, studies of biped robot locomotion and navigation have increased enormously due to its ease in mobility in the terrains that are designed exclusively for the humans.To navigate the biped robot in static and dynamic environments without hitting obstacles is a challenging task.In the present research, the authors have developed a hybridized motion planning algorithm that is, fast marching method hybridized with regression search (FMMHRS) methodology.In this work, initially the fast marching algorithm has been used to observe the environment and identify the path from start to final goal.Later on, the regression search method is combined with the fast marching method (FMM) algorithm to optimize the path without hitting any obstacles.The main objective of the present research work is to generate the path for both the static and dynamic scenarios in simulation and in a real environment.To conduct the testing of the proposed algorithm, the authors have chosen an 18-DOF two legged robot that was developed in our laboratory.",

    "abstract": "Software is not only difficult to create, but it is also difficult to understand.Even the authors themselves in a relatively short time become unable to readily interpret their own code and to explain what intent they have followed by it.Software is being created with the goal to satisfy the needs of a customer or directly of the end users.Out of these needs comes the intent, which is relatively well understandable to all stakeholders.By using other specialized modeling techniques (typically the UML language) or in the code itself, use cases and other high-level specification and analytical artifacts in common software development almost completely dissolve.Along with dedicated initiatives to improve preserving intent comprehensibility in software, such as literate programming, intentional programming, aspect-oriented programming, or the DCI (Data, Context and Interaction) approach, this issue is a subject of contemporary research in the re-revealed area of engaging end users in software development, which has its roots in Alan Kay's vision of a personal computer programmable by end users.From the perspective of the reality of complex software system development, the existing approaches are solving the problem of losing intent comprehensibility only partially by a simplified and limited perception of the intent and do this only at the code level.This paper explores the challenges in preserving the intent comprehensibility in software.The thorough treatment of this problem requires a number of techniques and approaches to be engaged, including preserving use cases in the code, dynamic code structuring, executable intent representation using domain specific languages, advanced UML modularization, 3D rendering of UML, and representation and animation of organizational patterns.",

Waste water is cooled down from 44-49 o C to 13-14 o C. The mass flow rate of the clean and waste water is approximately the same.This heat recovery process reaches a significant coefficient of performance (COP) with 6.03-6.5 meaning that 83-85% of the energy demand for heating clean water is provided by the recovery process and electric energy is consumed only for 17-15%.From the aspect of energy efficiency: the plate heat exchanger participates by about 49%, the low temperature heat pump by 30%, the high temperature heat pump by 21% in the heat recovery.",

An active model is proposed that comprise knowledge from modeling procedures, generic part models and engineers. Present day models of mechanical systems do not contain data about the background of human decisions. This situation motivated the authors at their investigations on exchange design intent information between engineers. Their concept was extending of product models to be capable of description of design intent information. Several human-computer and human-human communication issues were considered. The complex communication problem has been divided into four sub-problems, namely communication of human intent source with the computer system, representation of human intent, exchange of intent data between modeling procedures and communication of the represented intent with humans. Paper discusses the scenario of intelligent modeling based engineering. Then key concepts for the application of computational intelligence in computer model based engineering systems are detailed including knowledge driven models as well as areas of their application. Next, behavior based models with intelligent content involving specifications and knowledge for the design processes are emphasized and an active part modeling is proposed and possibilities for its application are outlined. Finally, design intent supported intelligent modeling is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 is the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies that is focusing on the creation of smart factories with the modular structured Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), in tight cooperation with humans.This trend also implies that the systems become more complex, heterogeneous, and distributed especially their network and software parts.This makes the CPS highly critical subject to failures at different levels, including software, hardware, and human operators.Consequently, ensuring reliable and safe operation under the presence of non-avoidable threats also becomes a more complicated task.The proper analysis of the CPS requires thorough comprehension of both the dependability properties of system components and their interactions as well as structural and behavioral aspects of the complete system.Such an analysis of complex and mutually interlinked system properties puts considerable challenges on appropriate methods for modeling and analysis, as well as, on the related applied software tools.The Dual-graph Error Propagation Model (DEPM), developed in our lab, is a mathematical abstraction of the main future system's properties, which are vital for the determination of the error propagation processes.It is a useful analytical instrument for the evaluation of the influence of particular faults and errors to the overall system behavior.OpenErrorPro is our analytical software tool for stochastic error propagation analysis that supports the DEPM framework.Using OpenErrorPro, a DTMC model could be automatically generated from a DEPM, and the reliability metrics, in addition to, error propagation path, can be computed.This could be implemented for the analysis of the heterogeneous CPS components.The necessary steps for the DEPM framework extension, required for such an implementation, are discussed in this paper.",

Simulation-based results show how the localization accuracy depends on the radar range resolution, deployment of the radar antennas and the accuracy of ranges estimated between transmitting antenna-targetreceiving antenna. As the output, the distributions of the average localization errors inthe monitored area are obtained.Their correctness is demonstrated by processing of the signals acquired by two M-sequence UWB radars with different range resolution and coverage.",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided screen printing is a widely used technology in several fields like the production of textiles, decorative signs and displays and in printed electronics, including circuit board printing and thick film technology.Even though there have been many developments in the technology, it is still being improved.This paper deals with the optimisation of the screen printing process.The layer deposition and the manufacturing process parameters strongly affect the quality of the prints.During this process the paste is printed by a rubber squeegee onto the surface of the substrate through a stainless steel metal screen masked by photolithographic emulsion.The off -contact screen printing method is considered in this paper because it allows better printing quality than the contact one.In our research a Finite Element Model (FEM) was created in ANSYS Multiphysics software to investigate the screen deformation and to reduce the stress in the screen in order to extend its life cycle.An individual deformation measuring setup was designed to validate the FEM model of the screen.By modification of the geometric parameters of the squeegee the maximal and the average stress in the screen can be reduced.Furthermore the tension of the screen is decreasing in its life cycle which results in worse printing quality.The compensation of this reducing tension and the modified shape of squeegee are described in this paper.Using this approach the life cycle of the screen could be extended by decreased mechanical stress and optimised off-contact.",

This problem is the most relevant at the design of the optimal feeding profile of fed-batch chemical reactors due to the nonlinear and unstable dynamical behavior of the processes. This paper shows that how the optimal feeding policy can be determined in fed-batch reactors by sequential quadratic programming, classical evolutionary strategy (ES) and the advanced version of ES that is based on covariance matrix adaptation. A multi-objective function was created and the search space was constrained in case of all of the three applied algorithms. The switching times between states in the feeding trajectory and the feed rates in each state were manipulated to find the global minima of the objective function. To obtain the optimal feeding policy the first-principle model of a pilot fed-batch reactor was implemented in MATLAB and applied as a dynamic simulator of the process. Off-line optimization process was carried out in case of different dosing time distribution. As the results show a significant improvement can be achieved in process performance applying advanced ES based optimization algorithms to generate feeding trajectories.",

    "abstract": "A connected non-regular graph G with n vertices and m edges is called a mean graph, if there exists a p ≥ 2 integer for which p=[G]=2 m/n holds. The topological index p=p(G) is called the centrality parameter of graph G. It is obvious that, if G is a mean graph, then its centrality parameter p(G) is a uniquely defined positive integer. Mean graphs represent a particular subset of connected non-regular graphs. In this note, by presenting relevant examples, some structural irregularity properties of mean graphs are studied and characterized. Comparing the degree deviations S(G) and S(H) of mean graphs G and H having equal centrality parameter p(G)=p(H) it is proved that if the only difference in the corresponding degree sequences of G and H is that the number of vertices of degree p is different, then S(G)=S(H).The smallest mean graph is the 4-vertex unicyclic graph having a degree sequence (3,2,2,1).This graph is isomorphic to the 4-vertex antiregular graph A4, for which S(A4)=2 holds.Using comparative tests on preselected connected graphs it has been shown that the degree deviation S(G) is poorly suited for discriminating among non-regular graphs.",

In contrast to what is seen in the literature on adaptive observer-based TS fuzzy control systems, the proposed method is capable of tracking a reference signal rather than just regulation. Additionally the proposed algorithm benefits from an adaptation algorithm which estimates the parameters of observer optimally. The stability analysis of the adaptation law and the controller is done using an appropriate Lyapunov function. The proposed method is then simulated on the control of Chua's circuit and it is shown that it is capable of controlling this chaotic system with high performance.",

Ltd. has changed the strategy of supporting roll settings in their continuous casting.After the modification had been implemented on casting machines, the quality problems due to centerline segregation of slabs decreased to a great extent.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the relative effectiveness of schematic computer animations and Human Movement Effect (HME) enhanced realistic videos in the context of algorithm visualization.Our investigation was implemented in the AlgoRythmics learning environment, which includes realistic dance choreographies and abstract animations of ten basic computer algorithms.Previous research regarding the AlgoRythmics videos focused on their motivational value.The present study investigates these visualizations as tools for helping students understanding the strategies the illustrated algorithms apply.Our most important conclusion is that HME enhanced realistic algorithm visualizations (such as the AlgoRythmics videos) could be as effective as, or even more effective, than abstract animations, in getting students to understand computer algorithms.The results also confirmed that one of the strengths of the AlgoRythmics videos (as realistic visualizations), is that they are easier to remember.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the features making up corporate budgeting systems have been profoundly deliberated over by academics and professionals.Indeed, so-called traditional methods of budgeting have borne the brunt of severe criticism due to their inflexibility and the sheer amount of time they demand of employees.Nonetheless, several examples exist of budgeting systems that have somehow been transformed, and of organizations which have adopted advanced, flexible budgeting procedures based on evaluation of performance.In the study presented, the authors look into any relationships that may exist between the primary elements of corporate budgeting systems and their performance in the enterprise.The aim is to contribute towards existing knowledge by: 1) summarizing the latest advances that relate to budgeting and corporate performance; 2) reporting on current budgeting practices applied by companies in the Czech Republic, with analysis of how budgeting systems affect managerial behaviour; 3) evaluating any statistical dependence between selected features of corporate budgeting systems; i.e. utilizing a budget as a managerial tool, how enterprises express the added value of budgeting systems, endeavour on the part of management in implementing an effective budgeting system, the workload pertaining to individual components of a budgeting system, and the significance of a budgeting system in comparison with other tools designed for adapting to change in market conditions.In general, the study describes interconnections between the profit-based performance of firms and the majority of the factors and features of the budgeting systems examined.",

Whereas the IFRS still maintains a standard-based literature structure, US GAAP standard setters of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) decided to depart from the standard-based tradition of editing accounting literature by redesigning the existing authoritative US GAAP literature into a single codified text, titled the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This paper focused on the structures of IFRS and US GAAP to understand whether the ASC enhances the application of US GAAP by professionals.The objective of this paper was to determine whether the structure of the ASC offers an appropriate alternative to the standard-based structure of IFRSmaking IFRS a userfriendly accounting literature in Central Europe.We administered a survey as a tool to foster discussion and to identify the features offered by the ASC, which is similar in structure to statutory accounting traditionally adopted in Central Europe.",

The proposed algorithm reduces the number of search points with a slight increase in average Sum-of-Absolute Difference (SAD) per pixel and significant reduction in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) than the Full search (FS).The speed improvement ratio is 11.26%.A novel Motion Estimation (ME) algorithm is proposed in this study that exhibits some properties with potential to facilitate optimized VLSI implementation and to achieve high performance for real video sequences.The main characteristic of this proposed architecture is possessing of only five processing elements (PE) that are used to calculate minimum SAD by using efficient comparators and compressors.Simulation results indicate that our proposed architecture employs low power and processes the video data with high speed than existing architectures without significant change in the video quality.",

    "abstract": "In this study a new algorithm was presented as an objective approach to quantify the relative visibility of diagnostic catheters.This method is suitable for the classification and comparison of diagnostic catheters with different levels of visibility, so as to attain an objective overall picture by measuring a product's properties, instead of relying on subjective values specified by the manufacturer.Our algorithm can be used when examining the distal section of a diagnostic catheter.Two sampling methods were tested on four diagnostic catheters with same diameter and material, but different shape of the distal end.The first sampling method can only be used in case of shapes that have straight sections at the distal end, but the second sampling method can be used for all types of shape.The first sampling method used a longer rectangular (4 mm x 8.6 mm) sample site and the second sampling method used two shorter rectangular (4 mm x 2.2 mm) sample sites.The two testing methods were used so as to check repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) so as to establish how far measurement repeatability with different measuring equipment, when carried out by different people, tracked differences between the different items being measured.This R&R testing helped us isolate where errors in our testing method might originate.It was established that the first (longer rectangle) sample-testing method had a nearly acceptable degree of variation (R&R% = 11.2), but the second method's degree (shorter rectangle) of variation was much worse (R&R% = 41).The value for average X-ray visibility obtained with the first method (18.24% ± 1.08%) when compared to the value for the second method (17.60% ± 1.66%), showed a significance level of 5.47%, and this approaches the borderline for significance.Precision and development of the measurement methods presented here will be treated as an integral part of further research so that they can be used equally with diagnostic catheters of all forms and shapes.",

In the present paper the most important new result is the proposed demand rates determination method for multi-section scheduling problems. Some other important achievements making possible the application of this approach are discussed,too. These are, for example:  feedback control law resulting in stable (implementable with finite buffers) and regular (converging to periodic) processes is described;  optimal demand rates determination for single- section problems is discussed. In this paper the principle of planning is used and a bottleneck scheduling approach is applied. As the result, production times close to the global minimum of net manufacturing time, determined by the loading characteristics of bottleneck machine- groups, may be realized. The proposed control is totally self-organizing. No outside control commands are necessary. Every buffer is only connected (in the signal level) with the previous and the next buffer. The actions are real-time controlled. The most important feature of this control is that it significantly improves the efficiency of utilization of system resources.The generalization for multi-section problems makes it possible to solve the most common application tasks. Ev, the solution of dynamical input problems becomes possible.",

    "abstract": "In Discrete-Event Systems (DES), deadlocks frequently occur.Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) have the character of DES.Namely, FMS consist of many cooperating devices (like robots, machine tools, transport belts, etc.).Frequently, deadlocks occur because of insufficient resources.Petri Nets (PN) are often used to model FMS and to synthesize control for them.To deal with deadlocks, first of all, it is necessary to find and/or avoid them.There are several principal approaches for doing this -either by computing and analyzing the PN reachability tree (RT) or by finding PN model siphons.Then, in the former concept, the supervisor is synthesized by means of P-invariants of the PN model used, while in the latter concept the supervisor, based on siphons, is synthesized.In addition to these approaches, additional techniques can sometimes, be applied -e.g. a suitable utilization of added PN transitions.",

    "abstract": "The paper compares three algorithms for concreteness rating estimation of English words.To train and test the models, we used a number of freely available dictionaries containing concreteness ratings.A feedforward neural network is employed as a regression model.Pre-trained fastText vectors, data on co-occurrence of target words with the most frequent ones, and data on co-occurrence of target words with functional words are used as input data by the considered algorithms.One of the three algorithms was proposed for the first time in this article.We provide detailed explanations of which combinations with functional words are the most informative in terms of concreteness ratings estimation for English words.Although the rest two algorithms have already been used for estimation of concreteness ratings, we consider possible ways to update them and improve the results obtained by a neural network.Thuswise, we use stochastic Spearman's correlation coefficient as a criterion for stopping of training.All three algorithms provided good results.The best value of Spearman's correlation coefficient between the value of the concreteness rating and its estimate was 0.906, which exceeds the values achieved in previous works.",

    "abstract": "Inverse problems in engineering form routinely part of larger engineering simulations.Therefore, the quality of the solution to an inverse problem directly influences the quality of the larger simulation and, ultimately, the ability to solve an engineering problem.Inverse problems can be challenging and time-consuming to solve, as most inverse strategies require iteration due to the non-linear nature of the problem.As a result, they often remain poorly solved before proceeding to the larger analysis.The quality of the solution to an inverse problem is influenced by the inverse strategy, scaling of the problem, scaling of the data, and initial guesses employed for iterative strategies.Research has focussed considerably on inverse strategies and scaling.However, research into strategies that improve initial guesses of an inverse problem has been largely neglected.This study proposes an elegant strategy to improve the initial guesses for conventional optimizationbased inverse strategies, namely direct inverse maps (DIMs) or inverse regression.DIMs form part of modern multivariate statistics.DIM approximates the solution to an inverse problem using regression; popular choices are linear regression, e.g., partial least squares regression (PLSR).These strategies are not iterative but require several independent apriori simulations to have been conducted.As they are not iterative, one way to improve the solution is to increase the number of independent a-priori simulations to be conducted.Our proposed strategy is to use DIM to generate initial guesses for optimization-based inverse strategies.We conduct a parameter investigation on a truss structure's virtual vibrationbased damage identification problem.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a widespread and perilous condition globally, necessitating effective rehabilitation assessment methods.Presently, clinicians rely on manual observation or costly equipment like motion capture systems to evaluate stroke patients' recovery progress.This study introduces a streamlined measurement system designed for assessing lower limb function recovery in stroke patients.The system employs wearable IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor modules strategically placed on the lower limbs to capture joint angles.An algorithm processes sensor data to calculate precise joint angles.To counteract environmental interference affecting IMU sensors, a Kalman filter is implemented to minimize errors, providing real-time adjustments for sensor accuracy.Experimental validation, using exercises and criteria from the FUGL-MEYER Assessment, a widely adopted method for evaluating stroke patients' physical performance, was conducted to compare the proposed system with the VICON motion capture system.Results demonstrated close alignment between the two systems, affirming the proposed system's reliability, applicability, and practicality for real-life medical evaluations.Importantly, the proposed system offers a cost-effective and portable alternative for measuring joint angles, maintaining effectiveness and precision.In summary, this system offers a straightforward design, easy installation, and affordable hardware, making it a viable and practical solution for evaluating lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients.",

    "abstract": "The use of mechanical ventilators is widespread within Intensive Care Units, both in patients with normal respiratory function (e.g., post-operative patients) and in subjects with pathologic conditions influencing ventilation mechanics.In particular heart failure, the decreased capacity of the heart to pump blood through the systemic and pulmonary circulation, is clinically known to adversely affect ventilation.Depending on gravity, different areas of the lungs receive different quotas of the pulmonary blood flow, and their alveoli are ventilated to different degrees: the ventilation/perfusion ratio (V/Q) captures this relationship and is normally higher at the apexes and lower at the bases of the lungs (normal distribution of the ratio).Maldistribution of V/Q occurs when these differences are accentuated, and leads to inefficient gas exchange and diminished arterial oxygen saturation.In this work, we introduce a mathematical model of mechanical ventilation and pulmonary blood perfusion, incorporating a representation of the lungs by vertically stacked functional layers.Numerical simulations readily show how progressive degrees of heart pump decompensation are associated with worsening distribution of the ventilation/perfusion ratio, even in the absence of other complicating factors, such as pulmonary edema.",

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion is a serious issue for cities and urban areas, owing to the increasing usage of vehicles.This phenomenon results in several negative consequences, such as high fuel consumption and loss of time.To address this problem, several countries have implemented optimal traffic signal control systems.However, these systems have some drawbacks, such as the need for expensive hardware and maintenance difficulties.Because the sensors are buried under the road surface, the system often cannot account for the full length of the vehicular queue.This, among several issues, inhibits the full potential of the technology's effectiveness and sustainability.In addition, there is much uncertainty in traffic conditions, which points to the need for a model that includes vagueness in the control system.This study proposes a novel hierarchical structure for a three-stage fuzzy traffic control system.This new system assesses the vehicle queue, identifies heavy traffic, detects emergency cars, and adjusts the duration of traffic lights according to the traffic flow and waiting times of vehicles using fuzzy inference rules.This controller was evaluated and validated using a micro-simulation model of an isolated intersection.The obtained results revealed the increased adaptability and flexibility of the proposed system owing to its potential to differentiate a random number of traffic directions.It is also able to handle emergency vehicles and can decrease waiting times, stalling fewer cars, if there is a high traffic flow in the conflicting direction(s) and is a robust and scalable system with lower computational costs.",

Asperities were replaced by paraboloid and pyramidal surfaces, in order to determine the distribution of the direction angle of asperities, the height distribution of the peak points, the radius distribution of the peak curvatures, and slope angle distribution. These can be properly used for characterizing microtopography changes in the course of the wear process. It was also examined what additional information was provided by SEM recordings of surfaces on surface structure, with particular regard to tribological phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a comparative and multicriteria statistical analysis of knowledge base units as shown on the examples of standardized subfields of electrical engineering. A number of objectives have been realized on knowledge pathways, both globally and locally, and initial hypotheses have been confirmed. Ranking/clustering among standardized fields and subfields has been carried out based on time-frequent innovations presented by knowledge base unit quantities and values. Web applications for analysis and singling out of samples from the entire Web-population of local (SRPS) and global (ISO) standardization have been developed and implemented. These applications represent a significant contribution to authenticity, particularly the authenticity of statistical research methodology. Original regression equations with accompanying indices of quantity, knowledge base unit values and ranking have been developed on the examples within the field of electricalengineering.Results of this study enable the realization of some higher practical objectives, i.e., (1) modification of teaching subjects and improving educational and financial resources for the quality of knowledge, (2) ranking of both narrow and broad standardized technologies and scientific fields.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a novel method for finding quasi-optimal linear sequences of operations in manufacturing processes.The objective is to produce a part by minimizing the sum of machine, setup and tool change costs.The considered approach is based on a fuzzy clustering process, where the clustering algorithm divides the problem into smaller, locally solvable parts, forming disjoint groups of manufacturing tasks.Whenever the groups are already formed, then the order between their elements is established by using a kind of sorting algorithm, inserting their elements into some chains.Joining these chains according to the induced ordering of the groups we obtain a linear ordering of the tasks of the manufacturing processes.The total cost of this manufacturing process represents a good approximation of the (expected) minimal cost.Some threshold values are used in the fuzzy classification algorithm, which results a more flexible, adaptable tool for similar kind of problems.A numerical example is also presented, which follows and illustrates the mentioned theoretical background and the calculation steps.The article provides a brief overview of a possible GNU/Octave implementation of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The high-speed railway in China passes through various seismic zones.As the track geometric irregularity is a critical aspect impacting train operation safety and traininduced vibration, it is meaningful to investigate the influence of earthquakes on the seismic-induced track geometric irregularity of high-speed railways.To determine the impact of earthquakes on track conditions, a complete study was conducted using various earthquake magnitude levels (3.0 to 7.0), varied limiting train speeds, and different track structural types (ballasted and ballastless track).The track quality index, long-wave irregularities, 10 m chord measurement, and vehicle vibration are analysed to suggest the change of track geometric irregularity and its influence after the earthquake.At the same time, the vehicle-track analysis model is used to calculate the difference in vehicle vibration under different seismic-induced track conditions.The vehicle acceleration, the rate of wheel load reduction, derailment coefficient indicators are investigated.These results imply that earthquakes have an impact on high-speed railways, causing track geometric irregularities to shift, which may contribute to increased vibration while trains are running.Compared to the ballasted track, whose normal speed is 250 km/h, the ballastless track, whose nominal speed is 350 km/h, was affected by the earthquake less.According to data, earthquakes have an influence on long waves greater than 1 m.While small and moderate earthquakes have a minor effect on railway safety, they do have an effect on train operating comfort because vehicle vibration is amplified as a result of the seismic-induced track geometric irregularity being worse.",

This new age of engineering is a result of the continuous development for step-by-step moving of product design, analysis and other production engineering activities from conventional environments to modeling environments during the eighties and nineties. However, more developments were needed in knowledge based decision assistance in order to realize modeling of human intent, increasingly complex product structures, and efficient communication of product data. In recent years, a great change of engineering methodology and software produced program products in knowledge technology and advanced local and global communication. Group work of engineers is increasingly organized around special portals for engineering on the Internet. Although intensive research activities produced outstanding methods in knowledge-based solutions for engineering, these methods have not widespread in the industrial modeling practice. This paper attempts to evaluate the possibility that recent communication and knowledge intensive engineering modeling can be developed into communication and knowledge intensive virtual space technology. Paper starts with a discussion on integrated application of different groups of product modeling techniques. Following this, methods are evaluated for the management of product data (PDM). Next section emphasizes aspects, contexts, and intents as primary issues in modeling for relationships in product data and decisions by engineers. Finally, methods for the management of engineering activities for lifecycle of products are summarized, considering communities of engineers around Internet portals.",

    "abstract": "Two opposing tendencies are observable in the field of industrial production in economically developed countries.From the perspective of the management staff, for whom economic effects are paramount, the most important are increased work efficiency and reduced cost of production.Such actions are intended to provide an appropriate competitive position for the company.From the standpoint of the employees, aware of their growing position on the labour market and their value, the most important are suitable working conditions and adequate compensation.These opposing tendencies can be reconciled by the widespread automation and robotisation of the production processes.This requires substantial investment and, considering the growing costs of labour, can provide an increase in efficiency and a reduction in the costs of production.Growth in robotisation and automation are also necessary due to the shrinking labour resources.This paper is intended to analyse the level of robotisation in selected countries, and to investigate the relations between labour costs and the degree of robot utilisation.The final part of the paper characterises the condition of Polish industry from the perspective of robotisation, based on a more in-depth analysis of selected factors.On this basis, the directions are outlined for the necessary changes to achieve further growth and approach the levels observed in European Union countries.",

The robust deadbeat control law is derived for the current loop, with special emphasis on robustness analysis. The stability and robustness analysis under parameter variations are presented for the converter-side current tracking scheme and the grid-side current tracking scheme. It is found that the stability margins obtained from the converter-side current tracking control scheme are generally higher than those obtained from the grid-side current tracking scheme. However, the converter-side current tracking scheme is sensitive to the variation of the damping resistance, and it would impose additional parameter uncertainty on the control system and complicate the problem. Hence the grid-side current tracking scheme is implemented. The simulation results obtained from Matlab/Simulink are presented for verification, where the inductance variation and grid disturbance scenarios are also taken into consideration. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid APF is substantially confirmed by the simulation and experimental results.",

    "abstract": "From the aspect of safety, brakes of rail vehicles are an extremely important system on the vehicle.Braking performance affects the normal functioning of vehicles and interoperability of rail vehicles in classic railway train compositions.All trains, classic and different type of motor trains must conform with the available stopping distances, which are predefined by the railway signalling, i.e. control length of a signal and depends on the maximum allowable speed for which the track section is designed.Apart from that, in classic wagons, which are combined and participate in the formation of different train compositions, mutual compatibility must be ensured from the aspect of used braking equipment and connection subassemblies, but even more important, braking performance of all wagons in the train has to be uniform within certain tolerances.This prevents weaker braked wagons from running into stronger braked ones, which can cause longitudinal jerks and may in extremes lead to a train rupture.Stopping distance during brake application depends on train braking performances, longitudinal running resistance and presence of wind and its direction.This paper deals with the influence of wind conditions on the results of slip brake tests and the estimation of a single vehicle's braking performance.Based on experimental measurements, simulations using CFD and comparison with the obtained results, this paper proposes a possibility to extract air drag resistance and wind force from the total resistance force.Presented methodology and obtained results may serve for further simulations of aerodynamic characteristics apart from braking performance, such as vehicle running resistance, energy consumption, etc. and for optimization of the wagon shape and design.",

Incorporation of argon is demonstrated in the room temperature deposited films and the thickness of the films measured by different methods such as Rutherford backscattering, spectroscopicellipsometry and step-profiler are found to be in reasonable agreement with each other.",

The determination of the energy absorbed by the deformation and the corresponding Energy Equivalent Speed can be of key importance; however their precise determination is a very difficult task. Although, using the results of crash tests, intelligent and soft methods offer an automatic way to model the crash process itself, as well as to determine the absorbed energy, the before-crash speed of the car, etc. In this paper a model is introduced which is able to describe the changing of the energy distribution during the whole deformational process and to analyze the strength of the different parts without any human intervention thus significantly can contribute to the improvement of the modelling, (automatic) design, and safety of car bodies.",

This paper proposes a new model for steganography called Cover Processing-based Steganographic Model (CPSM) that processes the cover objects and transmits them in a way to improve the security of steganographic objects. A comprehensive demonstration based on information theoryproves that CPSM provides improved security in terms of lower relative entropy as compared to previous models from the literature.Moreover, experimental tests show a decrease of the relative error between the cover and steganographic objects of up to 14%.",

Our observations lead to the answer for a question posed by Hong in 1993.The problem concerning graphs with the smallest spectral radius can be formulated as follows: If G is a connected irregular graph with n vertices and m edges, and G has the smallest spectral radius, is it true that Ir(G) =1?It will be shown that the answer is negative; counterexamples are represented by several cyclic graphs.Based on the previous considerations the problem proposed by Hong can be reinterpreted (refined) in the form of the following conjecture: If G is a connected irregular graph with n vertices and m edges, and G has the smallest spectral radius, then Ir(G)=1 if such a graph exists, and if not, then Ir(G)=2.Considering the family of unicyclic graphs for which Ir(G) ≥ 2, we prove that among n-vertex irregular unicyclic graphs the minimal spectral radius belongs to the uniquely defined short lollipop graphs where a pendent vertex is attached to cycle Cn-1.Moreover, it is verified that among n-vertex graphs there exists exactly one irregular graph Jn having a maximal spectral radius and an irregularity index of Ir(Jn)=1.Finally, it is also shown that by using the irregularity index Ir(G) a classification of n-vertex trees into (n-2) disjoint subsets can be performed.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have been widely employed in the dynamic simulation and analysis in the complex systems.While a novel classifier model based on FCMs ( FCMCM) was proposed in our former work, the obvious bottleneck of the genetic leaning algorithm used in FCMCM is its irksome efficiency, in particular, low speed in cross over and mutation delay in global convergence.Moreover the lack of the necessary robustness of a single FCMCM limits its generalization.To this end, a quantum computation based ensemble method FCMCM_QC is proposed to address the scalability problem, which employs a novel evolutionary algorithm inspired by quantum computation.The FCMCM_QC effectively uses the concept and principle of quantum computation to facilitate the computational complexity of genetic optimization for the FCMCM and reasonably selects classifiers with better performance for efficient ensembles.The experimental studies demonstrate the quality of the proposed FCMCM_QC in generally used UCI datasets, and the simulation results prove that the FCMCM_QC does enhance the speed of the convergence with high efficiency and good quality.",

MA-PDDL is an attempt to standardize the description of MAP problems similarly to PDDL in the single-agent setting. In this paper MA-PDDL is extended with partialobservability and probabilistic-effects to model more realistic domains. The conversion is fruitful in both ways: 1) extensive-form games can be solved via game-theoretic solution concepts (e.g. Nash-equilibrium) providing solutions to corresponding MAP problems in general, and 2) MA-PDDL problems can be solved via MAP methods providing solutions to corresponding games. Both cooperative and non-cooperative solutions can be achieved.",

We generalize this classical concept to handle more than two elements of the production process (e.g. machine part product resource operator). The application of this extended concept requires an efficient optimization algorithm for the simultaneous grouping these elements. For this purpose, we propose a novel co-clustering technique based on crossing minimization of layered bipartite graphs. The present method has been implemented as a MATLAB toolbox. The efficiency of the proposed approach and developed tools is demonstrated by realistic case studies. The log-linear scalability of the algorithm is proven theoretically and experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Smart grids are modern electric power infrastructures, which incorporate elements of traditional power systems and information and communication technology (ICT), with the aim to improve the reliability, efficiency and safety requirements of critical infrastructure systems.Due to its reliance on ICT, the Smart Grid exposes electrical power systems to new vulnerabilities and security issues.Therefore, security is becoming an ever increasing concern, in the physical and ICT domain as well.Access controls are one of the most important aspects of information security and a vital element of a layered security strategy.The role-based access control (RBAC) model is widely used in complex enterprise systems which are characterized by many participants accessing the system, but with different levels of access rights depending on their specific duties and responsibilities.The existing security models, which are primarily role-based, are usually not tailored for critical infrastructure systems with specialized features, such as high numbers of equipment and devices dispersed over vast geographical regions.In order to meet the security requirements of smart grids, it is important to manage their assets on a fine level of granularity.This paper proposes an access control management system for smart grids by considering the regional division of critical assets and concept of areas of responsibility (AOR).To this end, the standardized RBAC model was extended with the aim to improve the existing access control policy with greater level of granularity from the aspect of managing electrical utilities.In this paper, we propose the RBACAOR model, which was developed and tested on the Windows operating system platform using .NET Framework role-based security, with the use of different data stores for the RBACAOR configuration, namely Active Directory (AD), AD Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) and Microsoft SQL Server.",

    "abstract": "Videoconferencing represents a technology of the future, in modern education.A combination of audio and video information serves in understanding the content of lectures or presentations, in the form of videoconferencing.The evaluation of the quality of videoconferencing is difficult, as the image and sound affects the final quality.In general, occasional image disturbance has less impact on the perception of quality in comparison to the disturbances in an audio track.In this research, we simulated a real packet network environment and tested video sequences that present different teaching content.We artificially degraded the quality of video sequences by packet loss and jitter.Our test aimed to compare subjective methods of video quality evaluation with objective methods and to evaluate the impact of audio quality on the overall video sequence quality.This paper describes a novel process of evaluating the quality of audio and video signals.Timeconsuming subjective measurements were supported by models and programs that simplified the preparation, testing, and processing of results.The contribution of this article is to present and evaluate the results of video sequence quality testing with an emphasis on semantics, which has a significant impact on viewers' sensitivity to video sequence quality.",

    "abstract": "The world is changing swiftly.These changes require leaders to possess new kinds of knowledge and skills to understand and deal with such complex trends.Therefore, this chapter explains the Leadership Intelligence, that incorporates Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Emotional Quotient (EQ), Cultural Quotient (CQ) and Spiritual Quotient (SQ), for a leading organization, that has significant uncertainty and complexity.With the growing uncertainty and complexity in business environmental contexts, leadership roles have become paramount.And thus, this paper proposes a leadership intelligence framework that incorporates IQ, EQ, CQ, and SQ elements, based on current literature.Consequently, 21 st Century leaders should have these leadership intelligence qualities as a secret of leadership success, in today's organizations, particularly during turbulent times.To achieve higher leadership intelligence, global leaders must recognize their emotional stability along with cognitive balance and work according to local cultural patterns as well as spiritual norms by developing superior IQ, EQ, CQ, and SQ.Basically, this paper discusses why IQ, EQ, CQ, and SQ are essential for today's leaders who face demanding situations in which they must anticipate and adapt to changes and address wicked problems.Moreover, in the present 21 st Century global setting, leaders must own different thinking skills and higher intelligence levels to achieve higher standards of leadership.In these challenging, complex situations, standardized leadership approaches often do not work.New leadership intelligence is needed, to deal with the complex changes.",

    "abstract": "Several automatic and semi-automatic algorithms for adipose tissue (AT) segmentation in CT have been proposed.Our study aimed to determine the effect of the preselected HU range, on the resulting AT volumes and establish whether there is a relationship between body shape and AT values determined, from a single slice.Scans of 98 patients acquired using two CT protocols, were used.Three axial slices were selected from each subject's CT data.Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues (SAT, VAT) were manually segmented and analyzed using three different HU ranges.In addition, a simple BMI calculation model was created by the segmented data.The areas segmented with the three different HU ranges, correlated well with each other in the case of SAT (r 2 =0.99, and r 2 =0.99) and VAT (r 2 =0.99, and r 2 =0.998).The preselected slice position had no significant effect on correlation; however, the absolute values of ATs were statistically different.CT image data acquired with higher tube current yielded a better correlation between SAT, VAT, and BMI.We also found that the correlation of VAT area to mass and BMI was weaker than the corresponding SAT correlations.The simple model-based BMI estimation is in line with real BMI data (males: r 2 =0.78, females: r 2 =0.841).The segmentation threshold does not substantially affect correlation, among the segmented AT values; however, their absolute values are significantly different.In addition, and interestingly, the body shape can be accurately described from the segmented AT data from a single CT slice.",

To answer these questions a good number of experiments and calculations need to be made, moreover the mechanical model of the bow is needed to be prepared which appropriately confirm the results of experiments. Teachers in the Banki Donat Mechanical Engineering College of Budapest Polytechnic set up a small laboratory in 1997 in order to study and measure the physical characteristics of traditional bows. The mechanical analysis of bows is based on the experiments gained in the laboratory and the results of measurements. The knowledge acquired about the mechanical model of bows facilitates not only the analysis of the traditional Hungarian bow, but also provides a good foundation for the comparison from the technical point of view of various composite reflex bows belonging to different historic ethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "SCADA solutions are under a high flux to shift their focus from process control of a limited set of industrial plants to the control of large-scale system of systems.This is in par with the recent proliferation of ubiquitous/pervasive computing paradigm mostly embodied as Internet of Things (IoT).In a traditional setup, a whole system is only partially covered by SCADA data points; therefore, complex simulation is required to fit the missing measurements, hence, buttress decision support scenarios.This usually entails a fully integrated and centralized approach, where SCADA infrastructure needs to hold and distribute data, both collected and calculated.It leads to the increase of load on a supporting real-time database, which hosts millions of data points.It is a challenge that a traditional SCADA design (based on a shared memory database and competing processes), cannot fulfill in real-time.This paper proposes an alternative approach of an architecture and basic functionality of a SCADA system.The proposed architecture targets distributed SCADA systems that can be used to supervise and control large-scale distributed industrial or infrastructural systems.Strategic data organization and segmentation are introduced, so that the acquired data can be efficiently distributed throughout the system.The proposed architecture pushes forward a peer-to-peer node structuring scheme, where an autonomous node supervises and controls only subsets of the system.Nodes collaborate to establish a unified view of the entire system.The proof of the concept implementation has proven to be able to manage significantly more data points in a distributed fashion than a centralized variant.",

Depth perception is a part of vision allowing to accurately determine the distance to an object which makes it an important visual task. Humans have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that enable stereo vision and thus space perception. Some birds however do not have overlapping visual fields, and compensate this lask by moving their heads, which in turn makes space perception possible using the motion parallax as a visual cue. This paper presents a solution using an opto-mechanical filter that was inspired by the way birds observe their environment. The filtering is done using two different approaches:using motion blur during motion parallax, and using the optical flow algorithm. The two methods have different advantages and drawbacks, which will be discussed in the paper. The proposed system can be used in robotics for 3D space perception.",

    "abstract": "Thalassemia syndromes are a diverse group of inherited genetic disorders.There are different types of thalassemia disorders, such as, β-thalassemia, which is also called Mediterranean anemia, that is an inherited disease that played a major role in the American thriller movie, \"Dying of the light\" starring Nicolas Cage (Dec.2014).In this study, we focus on the beta-globin (β-globin) gene family related disorders.We seek potential amelioration strategies for β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia via γ-globin gene induction.In this work, a simulation model is developed, utilizing a reaction systems methodology.These systems are finite and based on a discrete time scale and can be used to describe and analyze complex biological systems and biological phenomenon.In our model, simulations of normal and abnormal cases of fetal, to adult hemoglobin switching developmental stage are illustrated.Various types of known and potential treatment strategies for β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia cases from the literature have been utilized to validate our model, used for identifying new potential treatments to be tested by molecular biologists, in the future studies.Moreover, we propose a novel potential simulation, as a therapeutic means, for β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, by identifying FOG1 as a potential target.Finally, our proposed model, based on a reaction systems methodology, shows that inhibition of FOG1 expression by using methods, such as, RNAi induces γ-globin gene expression and can compensate for the lack of beta-globin in patients suffering from β-globin gene related diseases, such as, β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.",

    "abstract": "Optimization is a widely used field of science in many applications.Optimization problems are becoming more and more complex and difficult to solve as the new models tend to be very large.To keep up with the growing requirements the solvers need to operate faster and more accurately.An important field of optimization is linear optimization which is very widely used.It is also often the hidden computational engine behind algorithms of other fields of optimization.Since linear optimization solvers use a high amount of special linear algebraic vector operations their performance is greatly influenced by their linear algebraic kernels.These kernels shall exploit the general characteristics of large-scale linear optimization problem models as efficiently as possible.To construct more efficient linear algebraic kernels the critical implementational factors influencing operation performance were identified via performance analysis and are presented in this paper.With the results of this analysis a new kernel has been developed for the open-source linear optimization solver called Pannon Optimizer developed at the Operations Research Laboratory at the University of Pannonia.A novel application of indexed dense vectors is also introduced which is designed specifically for linear optimization solvers.Finally a computational study is performed comparing the performance of vector operations of different linear optimization kernels to validate the high efficiency of our kernel.It shows that in case of large scale operations the indexed dense vector outperforms the state-of-the-art open-source linear optimization kernels.",

    "abstract": "Complex digital systems usually demand some kind of a multiprocessing architecture.The requirements to be fulfilled (energy and communication efficiency, speed, pipelining, parallelism, the number of component processors, cost, etc.) and their definable priority order may cause conflicts.Therefore, the best choice of the component processors (beside general-purpose CPUs also DSPs, GPUs, FPGAs and other custom hardware) is very important.Such resulting architectures are called heterogeneous multiprocessing architectures (HMA).The system-level synthesis (SLS) methodology can be applied beneficially in designing the HMAs.In this way, the design procedure can get rid of the most intuitive trial and error steps including also the partly reusing of existing structures.Therefore, the SLS methods help to optimize HMAs by reducing the intuitive steps.A high degree of similarity can be observed between HMAs and modern distributed industrial process control systems (DCS).This paper illustrates the procedure of adapting and applying an SLS tool in redesigning of an existing DCS as a benchmark for analyzing, evaluating and comparing the results.Through this adaptation, all such SLS functions become executable on the traditional and standardized documentation form of a DCS.",

    "abstract": "Making decisions in conditions of uncertainty is one of today's everyday problems.Various statistical models have found their place in practical applications, however working with imprecise, quite often fuzzy valued, data is still a challenge.In this paper, a new fuzzy relation is presented that enables the comparison of triangular fuzzy numbers along the horizontal axis, and a proposal is given for the generalization of the statistical hypothesis for data in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers.The proposed method allows a fuzzy form for both the registered value of the test statistic and the reference critical value and defines the degree of acceptance of the null hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, risk assessment has become the focus of many research efforts, which is the result of environmental, health and/or war related situations.One of the most important trends for the risk assessment models is the use of different patient surveillance systems, which can be used for various purposes, from performance monitoring of athletes to remote monitoring of the elderly.If the aim of the monitoring is to determine the current risk levels, based on the measured values, special care is required.Two fundamental requirements for these kinds of patient monitoring systems are personalization and timely availability of results.However, the proper personalization and the appropriate accuracy, but quickly available result are still difficult issues for researchers.In this article, the authors provide an overview of the methods they propose to address the above questions.In terms of customization, a personal profile-based evaluation is proposed that works with the patient's health characteristics.The applicability of the statistics, generated from previous measurements, in the evaluation is also presented, as well as a method for handling interactions between the input factors.In order to improve the reaction time, the authors propose some methods modifying the traditional Mamdani evaluation, and applying the Higher Order Singular Values Decomposition (HOSVD) method.",

    "abstract": "The learning process of conventional reinforcement learning methods, such as Qlearning and SARSA typically start with an empty knowledge base.In each iteration step, the initial empty knowledge base is gradually constructed by reinforcement signals obtained from the environment.Even only if a fragment of knowledge is available regarding the system behavior which can be injected into the learning process, the learning performance can be improved.In Heuristically Accelerated Fuzzy Rule Interpolation-based Q-learning (HFRIQlearning), the external knowledge can be represented in the form of human experts defined state-action fuzzy rules.If the expert knowledge base contains inaccuracies, i.e., incorrect state-action rules, it can negatively impact the learning performance.The main goal of this paper is to introduce a methodology for correcting (optimizing) the inaccurate a priori expert knowledge and as an additional benefit of optimization, to reduce the size of the Q-function representation fuzzy rule-base during the learning phase.The paper also introduces some examples how the quality of expert knowledge influences the HFRIQ-learning performance on a well-known reinforcement learning benchmark problem.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, classifier combination methodsreceives great attention from machine learning researchers.It is a powerful tool to improve the accuracy of classifiers.This approach has become increasingly interesting, especially for real-world problems, which are often characterized by their imbalanced nature.The unbalanced distribution of data leads to poor performance of most of the conventional machine learning techniques.In this paper, we propose a novel weighted rough set as a Meta classifier framework for 14 classifiers to find the smallest and optimal ensemble, which maximize the overall ensemble accuracy.We propose a new entropy-based method to compute the weight of each classifier.Each classifier assigns a weight based on its contribution to classification accuracy.Thanks to the powerful reduct technique in rough set, this guarantees high diversity of the produced reduct ensembles.The higher diversity between the core classifiers has a positive impact on the performance of minority class as well as on the overall system performance.Experimental results with ozone dataset demonstrate the advantages of weighted rough set Meta classifier framework over the well-known Meta classifiers like Bagging, boosting and random forest as well as any individual classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the DC motors have been replaced by induction motors in most of the industrial applications.Substantially, Induction motors are single speed, but they can produce high power density in a wide range of speed by applying new drive controllers based on constant V/f, DTC and vector control theory.Electric motors control is mainly accomplished by power electronic drives based on control schemes like constant v/f.However, the challenge of torque generation with fast time response and high accuracy was met by using the controllers based on vector control and DTC.In applications like electric train, generation of torque with rapid time response is so vital.As an example, in Anti skid-Anti slid system, the generated torque should vary between zero and the desirable value quickly to prevent the electric train from slip and the wheels from skidding on the rail.However, the accuracy of the torque magnitude due to its high value is not an important issue and most of the time, errors up to 3 percents in the generated torque is acceptable.In this paper, the control systems used in constant v/f drives are modified in order to generate torque with fast time response and acceptable accuracy.Control systems stability is an essential concern in electric drives and is arisen from the complexities in the controller's process and the time delays.In the proposed system, by simplification of the drive controllers, the instability problem of the control units is eliminated which in turn reduces the calculation time delays and results in torque generation with appropriate time response.Furthermore, the overall cost of the drive system is reduced considerably.",

Relative importance of evaluation criteria is stated by fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrices. Determining of elements values of these matrices can be considered as a fuzzy group decision making problem. Aggregation of individual opinions into group consensus is performed by using fuzzy averaging method and Fuzzy Ordered Weighted Aggregation (FOWA,) Operator Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used for determination of rank of recycling technologies with respects to evaluation criteria and its weights.Proposed model is tested by example with real life data.",

    "abstract": "Parallel robots possess a characteristic type of singularities, called type II or drive singularities, inside their workspace.In the neighborhood of these singularities, the inverse dynamics solution grows unboundedly and the robot becomes uncontrollable.There is growing literature on methods that enable parallel robots to pass through drive singularities.Most of this literature relies on dynamic models that presume rigid joints.However, the flexibility of the drive train elements should also be taken into account for high accuracy.In this paper, we propose a systematic trajectory planning method for enabling flexible-joint parallel robots to pass through drive singular configurations.Our method generates admissible polynomial trajectories of degree eleven.Four conditions are derived and incorporated into the method to prevent undesired back-and-forth motion of the endpoint.This ensures not only an efficient operation of the robot but also the avoidance of unintended multiple occurrences of the same singularity.The boundedness of the inverse dynamics solution is also guaranteed.",

    "abstract": "The \"Double Fuzzy Point\" rule representation opens a new dimension for expressing changes of fuzziness in fuzzy rule-based systems.In the case of standard \"Fuzzy Point\" rule representations, it is difficult to describe fuzzy functions in which crisp observations are required to have fuzzy conclusions, or in which an increase in the fuzziness of observations leads to reduced fuzziness in conclusions.These problems are mainly due to a lack of information.A fuzzy point rule determines the connection between a pair of fuzzy sets taken from the domain and the range of the rule.Expressing the fuzzy function through a set of fuzzy points and fuzzy interpolation between pairs of those points, each fuzzy point can be considered as a node point with given location and fuzziness.In common, sparse rule-base definitions, these node points are usually disjunctive on the domain, defining only single antecedent-consequent fuzziness connections at the location of the fuzzy points.However, this kind of information is insufficient when the goal is to express changes in the fuzziness of a given location in the domain.One solution to this problem is the double fuzzy point rule representation concept.Double fuzzy points are pairs of fuzzy points which share the same reference locations, but have different fuzziness properties.The existence of two different fuzziness values in a single location within the domain creates new possibilities for introducing fuzzy interpolation methods capable of interpolating not only between locations, but between changes in local fuzziness values as well.The main goal of this paper is to discuss how two-step Fuzzy Rule Interpolation methods can be adapted to be able to handle the double fuzzy point concept.To this end, an approach referred to as the Generalized Double Fuzzy Point Methodology (GDFPM) is proposed.",

The processing of visual models, within these frameworks, is an essential issue that can be addressed using graph rewriting techniques. The precise definition of graph rewriting-based model transformation requires that beyond the topology of the rules, further textual constraints be added. These constraints often appear repetitively in a transformation; therefore, constraint concerns crosscut the transformation. It is useful to define often applied constraints as physically separated modules and indicate the places where to use them. This effort provides solutions to structuring, modularizing and propagating repetitively occurring and crosscutting constraints. We propose an aspect-oriented approach that allows for consistent constraint management, in which repetitive and crosscutting constraints can be semi-automatically identified.",

    "abstract": "In our age of cyber war and cyber crime, it is critically important to select and use \"good\" passwords to protect user accounts.A well-known general rule says that passwords should contain a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.In this paper I will show mathematically that this rule is a misbelief.Instead of this, the length is the significantly important attribute.Then I will analyse the most common password structures and give an estimation on the time requirements of brute force attacks.(Un)fortunately there are a lot of password lists originating from a lot of intrusions and data thefts to analyse, and we have the incredible results of the latest brute force experiments.On the basis of these calculations we can state that passwords can give us strong protection if we apply some simple rules, unless the password encoding algorithm of the operating system is too weak.It is worth the time and energy for mathematicians to develop stronger hash functions and OS manufacturers to apply them, but this is not discussed here, and nor is how password using habits have changed.",

    "abstract": "The paper examines contagion between the sovereign bond markets of six Eurozone countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) in the period from January 2000 to August 2011.A multinomial logistic model is applied to analyze contagion based on measuring joint occurrences of large yield changes (i.e., coexceedances), while controlling for developments in common and regional factors that affect all sovereign bond markets simultaneously.I found that the Eurozone's stock markets (EUROSTOXX50) returns, United States' Treasury note yields, and the Euro-U.S. dollar (EUR-USD) exchange rate significantly impact the probability of extreme positive yield moves in the Eurozone's sovereign bond markets.Positive EUROSTOXX50 returns and upside moves in U.S. Treasury note yields increased the probability of extreme positive sovereign bond yield moves in the Eurozone, whereas an increase in the EUR-USD exchange rate significantly reduced the probability.Conditional volatility in the Eurozone stock markets and the money market interest rate do not significantly impact the probability of extreme yield increases in the Eurozone's sovereign bond markets.Furthermore, the probability of observing exceedance across Eurozone sovereign bond markets increased dramatically during the Eurozone debt crisis compared to the pre-crisis period.This study's results also indicate less synchronous extreme yield dynamics across the Eurozone sovereign bond markets during the global financial crisis, especially during the Eurozone debt crisis compared to the pre-crisis period.",

    "abstract": "Computational intelligence is branch of artificial intelligence that studies a wide range of tasks and problems especially difficult for traditional algorithms to deal with: those problems that include uncertainty, highly stochastic behavior, or fuzziness.Probably the majority of problems currently dealt with within the artificial intelligence framework, and a large share of problems addressed by modern computer science in general, fall in this category.Computational intelligence seeks to achieve solutions of such complex problems with the techniques that presumably human brain uses, and with the degree of quality equal, or superior, to the quality with which humans solve such problems.Among the problems particularly difficult for computers and particularly easy for human brain we can mention everyday human activities such as intuition, learning, noticing patterns, dealing with language, vision, and spatial orientation.Their computer counterparts are the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, and image processing, among others.Of these areas, machine learning is a set of techniques deeply penetrating all other areas of artificial intelligence, while natural language processing, image processing and computer vision, and other research areas have more applied character and are oriented to model different specific abilities of the human brain.For this special issue, we have selected a representative collection of fourteen papers presenting the latest advances in all these areas of research and practical applications.The first two papers in this issue represent an important application of computational intelligence: recommender systems and evaluation scales.Recommender systems improve the quality of life of the consumers by helping them to make informed decision on buying products and services, basing on the experience of other users.Evaluation scales play a key role in correct functioning of recommender systems, as well as help the businesses to improve their products and services to better match the opinions of the users.C. Ríos et al. from Argentina in their paper \"Selecting and weighting users in collaborative filtering based POI recommendation\" analyze a wide range of techniques that improve location awareness of the recommender systems.In many scenarios it is important for the user to obtain recommendations of products and services available in the geographic vicinity of that user, as well as rated highly by other users from the same geographical region.In addition, geographic awareness of the system helps in disambiguating the names of products and services, such as local restaurants or shops with common names.The authors show how to extract information on geographic location from the data available in various social networks.",

    "abstract": "Receiving an early diagnosis of schizophrenia is a crucial step towards its treatment.However, in current thinking, the diagnosis is based on time-consuming criteria, burdened with subjectivity.Hence, objective and more reliable therapeutic tests are desirable for the clinical practice of Psychiatry.Since schizophrenia is characterized by progressive brain volume changes during the course of the disease, many studies have recently turned attention to machine learning and brain morphometric techniques serving as tools for computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia based on neuroimaging data.In our study, the methodology is applied to distinguish between 52 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 52 healthy volunteers on the basis of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of their brains preprocessed by the means of voxel-based and deformation-based morphometry.The proposed classification schemes vary in the feature extraction and selection steps.Namely, Mann-Whitney testing is implemented as a simple univariate approach playing the role of a comparator to multivariate methods such as inter-subject PCA, the K-SVD algorithm, and pattern-based morphometry.The highest classification accuracy, 70%, is reached with the pattern-based morphometry technique.The study points out the difference between univariate and multivariate approaches towards neuroimaging data.Additionally, the contrast between feature extraction capabilities of voxel-based and deformation-based morphometry is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "In our research we investigated the possibility of offering a viable alternative for internal combustion engines' poppet valves.After examining in-cylinder flow characterization methods, we derived a computer model of the base concept and a special swinging valve arrangement.The flow characterization of both arrangements has been completed using numerical fluid dynamics software.To minimize numerical errors different mesh scenarios were investigated and evaluated.From our research activity a clear picture has been drawn on the qualities of the proposed system.The swinging valve arrangement improves the efficiency of the gas exchange process.Also, the flow during the intake process is more structured and has less local vorticity.The results have also shown a very favourable charge movement pattern that is ideal for GDI engines.All of these findings produce an appropriate platform for a stratified charging, extra lean burning engine concept.The construction concept lends itself to be flawlessly integrated in a throttle-less engine control environment as well.With these qualities the new valve arrangement may be the ideal solution to produce fuel efficient, high specific output engines, for those transportation systems that will still need to rely on fossil fuels in the future.",

    "abstract": "This paper intends to introduce a novel model for query-topic relevance assessment from assessor and cognitive point of view in the sense that relevance is a multidimensional cognitive and dynamic conception.The focus of this presentation is concentrated on modeling the concept \"Query Associative Vocabulary of Relevance\" to emphasize the value of integrating intuitive, descriptive, multi-valued assessment, and agreement in the process of creating a query-topic relevance data.As this model differentiates between different types of query-topics and levels of relevance, it provides a facility to enhance the quality of relevance data by re-evaluating the resulted associative vocabulary at each cycle of refinement.This aspect is of importance, as it is directed toward extracting as much advantage from human assessment as possible.A prototype of this model has generated in an initial run a relevance dataset of 20.710 relevance assessor's feedback and a co-occurrence matrix of 39607 terms distributed in intuitive, descriptive and document associative vocabularies.Most of the assessor feedback is descriptive produced by humans in context of establishing a relevance relationship between a query-topic and related documents.Furthermore, classifying query relevance datasets according to grades of agreements among judgments is useful as it gives a better overview of the performance of the considered system and the comparison of different datasets in context of consistency and performance becoming easier.Despite the importance of relevance in designing and evaluating Information Retrieval Systems as possible intercognitive systems, a consensus on definition is still debatable.However, considering relevance as a multidimensional cognitive and dynamic conception provides researcher with a research track to evaluate the performance of interactive and inter-cognitive processes in terms of the multidimensionality and cognitive aspects of relevance.",

    "abstract": "Most floating point computations, in particular the additive operations, can have an annoying side-effect: The results can be inaccurate (the relative error can be any large) which may lead to qualitatively wrong answers to a computational problem.For the most prevalent applications there are advanced methods that avoid unreliable computational results in most of the cases.However, these methods usually decrease the performance of computations.In this paper, the most frequently occurring vector-vector addition and dot-product operations are investigated.We propose a faster stable add method which has been made possible by the appropriate utilization of the advanced SIMD architecture.In this work we focus only on the widely used Intel systems that are available for most of users.Based on it, stable vector addition and dot-product implementations are also introduced.Finally, we show the performance of these techniques.",

    "abstract": "Although the production of copper and its usage has been known for thousands of years, the search for the optimal process of its production is still in progress.The removal of the negative impacts of a certain technology could cost more, over a period of time, than the initial investment in the selection of the optimal technology process which would consider these effects.Hence, the selection should be supported by the innovative and modern tools, such as the applying of the multi-criteria analysis.This paper presents the implementation of the PROMETHEE/GAIA methodology for the ranking of the appropriate technological pyrometallurgical smelting process for the copper concentrate based on the eleven parameters which recognize the economic, ecological and technical aspects of the technological process.The implementation of the multi-criteria decision-making presented in this paper can be deemed as a contribution to the decision making tools, that is, to the one who makes a decision on the selection of the appropriate technological facility for smelting of the copper concentrates.The decision-makers faced with the practical need of evaluating and selecting the most appropriate technological process for pyrometallurgical copper extraction will get the greatest benefit from this multi-criteria model.The innovative contribution of this paper is also presented in the obtained model which systematically analyzes the ecological, economic and technical parameters of the copper extraction process.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on finding a model to optimize the provision for international emergency help, for emergencies caused by natural or man-made disasters.Nowadays, natural and man-made disasters occur more often than before, possibly, due to climate change, industrial activity, urbanization and migration of people.The national institutions for protection and rescue, in many cases, when the emergency situation is declared, cannot often cope and need help.The international organizations have recognized needs to develop mechanisms, which can be used to help affected countries.Examples are European mechanisms for civil protection and numerous guidelines from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).If the affected country cannot solve the problems and minimize risks for their citizens, material and cultural heritage, Governments send an official request to International Organizations, to obtain different kinds of international help as quickly as possible.However, the problems can appear with costs and other needed resources for providing international help, in terms of country's distance which could provide help or duplication of resources that should be available.Currently, International Organizations do not have the documents, guidelines or software to be used for an emergency, when they have to make optimal decisions, concerning which country will provide help.This can be recognized as a main research gap, which is addressed by this paper.This paper uses operational research, to develop an adjusted transportation model, for optimizing the provision of international help in emergency situations.The main goal of this paper is to find useful solutions for those responsible for emergency management in making decisions for providing help to affected countries.Moreover, we aim to develop a model that will facilitate the appropriate disposition of human and material resources to an affected country in experiencing a disaster.The applied method involves an application of an adjusted transportation model for the case study, based on a real emergency situation during the May floods of 2014, in the Republic of Serbia.Having this in mind, the authors try to provide general results and a model, with a recommendation of how the model can be applied to any emergency situation in the world.The applicability is obvious for the activities of international organizations responsible for emergency management.",

    "abstract": "Many of the hydraulic and pneumatic devices are made from high quality stainless steels, through complex and elaborated manufacturing technologies.Thus, not infrequently the semi-finished product used for obtaining the pneumatic and hydraulic equipment is subjected to different kinds of strains in the manufacturing process.Obviously, the units that are currently producing pneumatic and hydraulic equipment should focus on the manufacturing of products mostly requested in a market economy.This requires the modernization of existing production capacities in line with the EU requirements, followed by the update of technologies to the standards applied in the EU economy.The knowledge about the characteristics of deformability has for the technologist, as well as for the designer and researcher, a great practical significance, because they are important elements in establishing a correct technological process.The change of deformation conditions existing in the industrial process, such as the temperature and rate of deformation, are difficult to consider for correcting the deformability determined by testing.In this paper, through \"deformability\" we understand all the properties characterizing the deformation behavior of the metals and alloys, and the \"deformation resistance\" of the metals is expressed through the unit strain required to produce a certain degree of plastic deformation, under the conditions of a particular diagram of tensions, deformations and deformation rates, in the absence of external friction forces.Thisstudy includes the results of the experimental tests conducted to find the plasticity and deformability characteristics of several stainless steel grades: one martensitic stainless steel (grade X46Cr13), one ferritic stainless steel (grade X6Cr17) and one austensitic stainless steel (grade X5CrNi18-10).",

    "abstract": "The notch impact test, that is used to determine the amount of absorbed energy consumed, for breaking materials, under dynamic forces, is among the various important material mechanical tests.The quality and reliability of the results obtained, as a result of the test, are of great value for laboratories.In this study, the parameters affecting the measurement quality in the notch impact test, are expressed as uncertainty values.Charpy notch impact test was performed for materials with different absorbed energy levels in the laboratory.The uncertainty values were calculated, according to the ISO 148-1 standard, from the data obtained.Then, the uncertainty values were analyzed and their effects on the uncertainty calculation were determined.Herein, it was concluded that the parameters should be determined and analyzed correctly, in order to minimize measurement uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "The current analysis is based on the concept that the proper quality of a particular type of alloy, such as half-hard cast irons and their properties, are determined by chemical composition and a proper melting and alloying processing, as well as, a special nodulizing treatment, assuring the graphite's nodular form.This analysis follows several key aspects of the manufacturing of half-hard cast iron rolls (also called \"ductile iron rolls\"), using the multivariate statistical research used as modelling approach upon the industrial data.In this sense, several results of a complex study on the half-hard cast iron rolls are presented, regarding the cumulative influences of several chemical components of the half-hard cast iron (Phosphorus, Sulphur and Magnesium), upon the Hardness, which is the common method of testing rolls, for the quality and predicted wear properties.The performed research herein has generated a number of multi-component regression equations and correlation coefficients, determined to the 3 rd and 4 th dimension spaces.Also generated are several regression surfaces and correlative level curves, which define proper technological areas.For the multiple regression equations and for the graphical addenda the Matlab software was used.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the research we have performed on networking technology as a review and summary of our doctoral study.Our work's use is to define real-time communications that are transmitted across the Internet, and we have developed a highresolution work concerning the logic that underlies the routing phenomenon.Routing features were analyzed with respect to current trends and demands that imply the usefulness of resources.Much research exists and is constantly being developed for routing technology at fine grain or grosser scale.As the world needs more and more a means to make way and find paths through the millions of interconnected devices, we have proposed a fault-tolerance methodology that implies reasoning, as well as a concise requirement engineered approach for ensuring QoS.In quality of service, there is the discrepancy of knowing that resources are available and are constantly kept as reserved while different autonomous systems suffer from inadequate resource pooling as a whole.Measurement units such as bits/second, erlangs, and other quantifiable data units have been enabled for the measurement of given networking ability.These abilities are properties of infrastructures or network segments in being capable to send data and all of them fail in front of the dynamic nature of the Internet.As it will be presented, our approach shows that all these units can be more understandably put to use if Queueing Theory, Markov Chains, statistical evaluation, and inter-momentary discrete events are analyzed for the exact context or case that requires an optimal routing decision.",
