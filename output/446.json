    "abstract": "This review focuses on recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, management, and strategies for the prevention and control of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by both Old and New World Leishmania species. CL is caused by the vector-borne protozoan parasite Leishmania and is transmitted via infected female sandflies. The disease is endemic in more than 98 countries and an estimated 350 million people are at risk. The overall prevalence is 12 million cases and the annual incidence is 2-2.5 million. The World Health Organization considers CL a severely neglected disease and a category 1 emerging and uncontrolled disease. The management of CL differs from region to region and is primarily based on local experience-based evidence. Most CL patients can be treated with topical treatments, but some Leishmania species can cause mucocutaneous involvement requiring a systemic therapeutic approach. Moreover, Leishmania species can vary in their sensitivity to available therapeutic options. This makes species determination critical for the choice of treatment and the clinical outcome of CL. Identification of the infecting parasite used to be laborious, but now the Leishmania species can be identified relatively easy with new DNA techniques that enable a more rational therapy choice. Current treatment guidelines for CL are based on poorly designed and reported trials. There is a lack of evidence for potentially beneficial treatments, a desperate need for large well-conducted studies, and standardization of future trials. Moreover, intensified research programs to improve vector control, diagnostics, and the therapeutic arsenal to contain further incidence and morbidity are needed.",

    "abstract": "Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory, mucocutaneous disorder of genital and extragenital skin. LS is a debilitating disease, causing itch, pain, dysuria and restriction of micturition, dyspareunia, and significant sexual dysfunction in women and men. Many findings obtained in recent years point more and more towards an autoimmune-induced disease in genetically predisposed patients and further away from an important impact of hormonal factors. Preceding infections may play a provocative part. The role for Borrelia is still controversial. Trauma and an occlusive moist environment may act as precipitating factors. Potent and ultrapotent topical corticosteroids still head the therapeutic armamentarium. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are discussed as alternatives in the treatment of LS in patients who have failed therapy with ultrapotent corticosteroids, or who have a contraindication for the use of corticosteroids. Topical and systemic retinoids may be useful in selected cases. Phototherapy for extragenital LS and photodynamic therapy for genital LS may be therapeutic options in rare cases refractory to the already mentioned treatment. Surgery is restricted to scarring processes leading to functional impairment. In men, circumcision is effective in the majority of cases, but recurrences are well described. Anogenital LS is associated with an increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or penis. This review updates the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, pathogenesis, and management of LS of the female and male genitals and extragenital LS in adults and children.",

    "abstract": "Targeted therapies and immunotherapies are associated with a wide range of dermatologic adverse events (dAEs) resulting from common signaling pathways involved in malignant behavior and normal homeostatic functions of the epidermis and dermis. Dermatologic toxicities include damage to the skin, oral mucosa, hair, and nails. Acneiform rash is the most common dAE, observed in 25–85% of patients treated by epidermal growth factor receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors. BRAF inhibitors mostly induce secondary skin tumors, squamous cell carcinoma and keratoacanthomas, changes in pre-existing pigmented lesions, as well as hand-foot skin reactions and maculopapular hypersensitivity-like rash. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) most frequently induce nonspecific maculopapular rash, but also eczema-like or psoriatic lesions, lichenoid dermatitis, xerosis, and pruritus. Of the oral mucosal toxicities observed with targeted therapies, oral mucositis is the most frequent with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, followed by stomatitis associated to multikinase angiogenesis and HER inhibitors, geographic tongue, oral hyperkeratotic lesions, lichenoid reactions, and hyperpigmentation. ICIs typically induce oral lichenoid reactions and xerostomia. Targeted therapies and endocrine therapy also commonly induce alopecia, although this is still underreported with the latter. Finally, targeted therapies may damage nail folds, with paronychia and periungual pyogenic granuloma distinct from chemotherapy-induced lesions. Mild onycholysis, brittle nails, and a slower nail growth rate may also be observed. Targeted therapies and immunotherapies often profoundly diminish patients’ quality of life, which impacts treatment outcomes. Close collaboration between dermatologists and oncologists is therefore essential.",

    "abstract": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis mainly affecting the cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead. Rosacea is characterized by recurrent episodes of flushing or transient erythema, persistent erythema, phymatous changes, papules, pustules, and telangiectasia. The eyes may also be involved. Due to rosacea affecting the face, it has a profound negative impact on quality of life, self-esteem, and well-being. In addition to general skin care, there are several approved treatment options available for addressing these features, both topical and systemic. For some features, intense pulse light, laser, and surgery are of value. Recent advances in fundamental scientific research have underscored the roles of the innate and adaptive immune systems as well as neurovascular dysregulation underlying the spectrum of clinical features of rosacea. Endogenous and exogenous stimuli may initiate and aggravate several pathways in patients with rosacea. This review covers the new phenotype-based diagnosis and classification system reflecting pathophysiology, and new and emerging treatment options and approaches. We address new topical and systemic formulations, as well as recent evidence on treatment combinations. In addition, ongoing studies investigating novel therapeutic interventions will be summarized.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the role of Cutibacterium acnes in the pathophysiology of acne has recently undergone a paradigm shift: rather than C. acnes hyperproliferation, it is the loss of balance between the different C. acnes phylotypes, together with a dysbiosis of the skin microbiome, which results in acne development. The loss of diversity of C. acnes phylotypes acts as a trigger for innate immune system activation, leading to cutaneous inflammation. A predominance of C. acnes phylotype IA1 has been observed, with a more virulent profile in acne than in normal skin. Other bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus epidermis, are also implicated in acne. S. epidermidis and C. acnes interact and are critical for the regulation of skin homeostasis. Recent studies also showed that the gut microbiome is involved in acne, through interactions with the skin microbiome. As commonly used topical and systemic antibiotics induce cutaneous dysbiosis, our new understanding of acne pathophysiology has prompted a change in direction for acne treatment. In the future, the development of individualized acne therapies will allow targeting of the pathogenic strains, leaving the commensal strains intact. Such alternative treatments, involving modifications of the microbiome, will form the next generation of 'ecobiological' anti-inflammatory treatments.",

CL is a vector-borne infection caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania. The vector is the female sandfly. Globally, CL affects 12 million cases and annually 2 million new cases occur. CL is endemic in almost 100 countries and the total risk population is approximately 350 million people. WHO lists CL an emerging and uncontrolled disease and a neglected tropical disease. Local experience-based evidence remains the mainstay for the management of CL. Whereas intralesional therapeutic options are the first treatment option for most CL patients, those with mucocutaneous and disseminated involvement require a systemic therapeutic approach. Moreover, different Leishmania species can vary in their treatment outcomes. Therefore, species determination is critical for optimal CL clinical management. New DNA techniques allow for relatively easy Leishmania species determination, yet they are not easily implemented in resource-limited settings. There is a desperate need for novel, less toxic, and less painful treatment options, especially for children with CL. Yet, the large and well conducted studies required to provide the necessary evidence are lacking. To further control and potentially eliminate CL, we urgently need to improve vector control, and diagnostics, and we require efficient and safe vaccines. Alas, since CL primarily affects poor people, biotechnical companies dedicate little investment into the research programs that could lead to diagnostic, pharmaceutical, and vaccine innovations.",

    "abstract": "Male and female pattern hair loss are common, chronic dermatologic disorders with limited therapeutic options. In recent years, a number of commercial devices using low-level laser therapy have been promoted, but there have been little peer-reviewed data on their efficacy.To determine whether treatment with a low-level laser device, the US FDA-cleared HairMax Lasercomb®, increases terminal hair density in both men and women with pattern hair loss.Randomized, sham device-controlled, double-blind clinical trials were conducted at multiple institutional and private practices. A total of 146 male and 188 female subjects with pattern hair loss were screened. A total of 128 male and 141 female subjects were randomized to receive either a lasercomb (one of three models) or a sham device in concealed sealed packets, and were treated on the whole scalp three times a week for 26 weeks. Terminal hair density of the target area was evaluated at baseline and at 16- and 26-week follow-ups, and analyzed to determine whether the hypothesis formulated prior to data collection, that lasercomb treatment would increase terminal hair density, was correct. The site investigators and the subjects remained blinded to the type of device they dispensed/received throughout the study. The evaluator of masked digital photographs was blinded to which trial arm the subject belonged.Seventy-eight, 63, 49, and 79 subjects were randomized in four trials of 9-beam lasercomb treatment in female subjects, 12-beam lasercomb treatment in female subjects, 7-beam lasercomb treatment in male subjects, and 9- and 12-beam lasercomb treatment in male subjects, compared with the sham device, respectively. Nineteen female and 25 male subjects were lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 122 female and 103 male subjects in the efficacy analysis, the mean terminal hair count at 26 weeks increased from baseline by 20.2, 20.6, 18.4, 20.9, and 25.7 per cm2 in 9-beam lasercomb-treated female subjects, 12-beam lasercomb-treated female subjects, 7-beam lasercomb-treated male subjects, and 9- and 12-beam lasercomb-treated male subjects, respectively, compared with 2.8 (p<0.0001), 3.0 (p<0.0001), 1.6 (p=0.0017), 9.4 (p=0.0249), and 9.4 (p=0.0028) in sham-treated subjects (95% confidence interval). The increase in terminal hair density was independent of the age and sex of the subject and the lasercomb model. Additionally, a higher percentage of lasercomb-treated subjects reported overall improvement of hair loss condition and thickness and fullness of hair in self-assessment, compared with sham-treated subjects. No serious adverse events were reported in any subject receiving the lasercomb in any of the four trials.We observed a statistically significant difference in the increase in terminal hair density between lasercomb- and sham-treated subjects. No serious adverse events were reported. Our results suggest that low-level laser treatment may be an effective option to treat pattern hair loss in both men and women. Additional studies should be considered to determine the long-term effects of low-level laser treatment on hair growth and maintenance, and to optimize laser modality.",

Physicians were identified through national databases and contacted through random sampling methods.In the USA, 1005 patients, 101 dermatologists, and 100 rheumatologists were surveyed. PsA had been diagnosed in 270 patients (26.9%). Of those with psoriasis alone, fewer than 60% (versus 85.6% of PsA patients) had seen a healthcare provider within 12 months. Joint pain was reported by 51.8% of psoriasis patients without a diagnosis of PsA, and 37.6% of dermatologists cited their greatest challenge in managing PsA patients as being differentiating PsA from other arthritic diseases. Itching was reported by 36% of psoriasis patients versus 12% of dermatologists as the most important factor contributing to disease severity. Patients reported lower rates of current treatment than did dermatologists and rheumatologists. Conventional oral and biologic therapies were used by 24.9 and 17.7% of patients, respectively. Among patients who had received injectable biologics, treatment dissatisfaction was related to long-term safety/tolerability, injection-related anxiety/fear, and cost.This large, population-based survey identified unmet needs in the management of psoriasis and PsA patients in the USA, including assessment of disease severity, PsA diagnosis, undertreatment, and satisfaction with therapy.",

Two independent reviewers performed an assessment of articles and extracted data for qualitative synthesis.Included studies (N = 168) were published between 1979 and 1 March, 2021; 72.6% were published since 2010. Disorders including or related to depression (41 studies, 0.1-62.3%) and anxiety (20 studies, 1.9-67.9%) were the most commonly reported. The most prevalent psychosocial comorbidities were feelings of stigmatization (eight studies, 17.3-100%), adjustment disorders (12 studies, 4-93.9%), sleep disturbance (seven studies, 4.6-89.0%), relationship difficulties including sexual dysfunction (ten studies, 2.0-81.8%), and avoidance or restriction behavior (12.5-76%). The prevalence of most psychosocial comorbidities was significantly higher vs healthy individuals. Factors associated with a significantly higher burden included female sex, visible or genital lesions, age < 30 years (particularly adolescents), and greater body surface area involvement, among others. The most commonly reported patient coping strategy was lesion concealment.Available studies were heterogeneous and often had limited details; additionally, publication bias is possible.The results of this systematic review show that vitiligo greatly affects psychosocial well-being. The extent of psychosocial comorbidities supports the use of multidisciplinary treatment strategies and education to address the vitiligo-associated burden of disease.PROSPERO (CRD42020162223).",

Interactions between commensal microbiota and the multiple cell types involved in cutaneous wound healing regulate the immune response and promote barrier restoration. This dialog between host cells and the microbiome is dysregulated in chronic wounds. In this review, we first describe how advances in sequencing approaches and analysis have been used to study the chronic wound microbiota, and how these findings underscored the complexity of microbial communities and their association with clinical outcomes in patients with chronic wound disorders. We also discuss the mechanistic insights gathered from multiple animal models of polymicrobial wound infections. In addition to the well-described role of bacteria residing in polymicrobial biofilms, we also discuss the role of the intracellular bacterial niche in wound healing. We describe how, in contrast to pathogenic species capable of subverting skin immunity, commensals are essential for the regulation of the cutaneous immune system and provide protection from intracellular pathogens through modulation of the antimicrobial molecule, Perforin-2. Despite recent advances, more research is needed to shed light on host-microbiome crosstalk in both healing and nonhealing chronic wounds to appropriately guide therapeutic developments.",

Although this virus primarily causes respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of cutaneous manifestations associated with this disease have been reported.The aim of this review was to collate and categorize the dermatologic findings reported in patients with COVID-19 and identify specific lesions that may facilitate diagnosis and prognostication.An evidence-based review of the PubMed database was conducted on 14 May, 2020 using the search terms \"Covid-19 skin,\" \"Covid-19 rash,\" \"Covid-19 exanthem,\" and \"Covid-19 chilblains.\" Peer-reviewed publications containing original COVID-19 patient cases and a discussion of the associated cutaneous findings were included in the analysis.The literature search identified 115 records, of which 34 publications describing 996 patients with dermatologic conditions were included. Case reports (n = 15), case series (n = 13), and observational prospective studies (n = 4) were the most common publication types. Acral lesions resembling pseudo-chilblains were the most frequent lesion identified (40.4% of cases), appearing in young adults (mean age, 23.2 years) after the onset of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (55/100 patients). Erythematous maculopapular rashes affected 21.3% of patients, most frequently impacting middle-aged adults (mean age, 53.2 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (110/187 patients). Vesicular rashes affected 13.0% of patients, appearing in middle-aged adults (mean age, 48.3 years) after the onset of other symptoms (52/84 patients). Urticarial rashes affected 10.9% of patients, appearing in adults (mean age, 38.3 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (46/78 patients). Vascular rashes resembling livedo or purpura were uncommon (4% of cases), appearing in elderly patients (mean age, 77.5 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (18/29 patients). Erythema multiforme-like eruptions, although infrequent (3.7% of cases), affected mostly children (mean age, 12.2 years).Vesicular rashes may suggest an initial diagnosis of COVID-19, acral lesions may be most appropriate for epidemiological uses, and vascular rashes may be a useful prognostic marker for severe disease. As a potential correlate to disease severity, prognosis, or infectibility, it is critical that all healthcare professionals be well versed in these increasingly common cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) have increased infection risk, including skin infections and systemic infections. Immunomodulators (e.g., anti-tumor necrosis factors, anti-interleukin [anti-IL]-23, anti-IL-17, Janus kinase inhibitors) increase risk of infections. Dupilumab (a monoclonal antibody blocking the shared receptor component for IL-4 and IL-13) is approved for inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD and for moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the impact of dupilumab on infection rates in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. METHODS: This analysis pooled data from seven randomized, placebo-controlled dupilumab trials in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Exposure-adjusted analyses assessed infection rates. RESULTS: Of 2932 patients, 1091 received placebo, 1095 dupilumab 300 mg weekly, and 746 dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks. Treatment groups had similar infection rates overall per 100 patient-years (placebo, 155; dupilumab weekly, 150; dupilumab every 2 weeks, 156; dupilumab combined, 152), and similar non-skin infection rates. Serious/severe infections were reduced with dupilumab (risk ratio 0.43; p < 0.05), as were bacterial and other non-herpetic skin infections (risk ratio 0.44; p < 0.001). Although herpesviral infection rates overall were slightly higher with dupilumab than placebo, clinically important herpesviral infections (eczema herpeticum, herpes zoster) were less common with dupilumab (risk ratio 0.31; p < 0.01). Systemic anti-infective medication use was lower with dupilumab. CONCLUSIONS: Dupilumab is associated with reduced risk of serious/severe infections and non-herpetic skin infections and does not increase overall infection rates versus placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.

Multiple GPP subtypes have been described, from acute GPP of von Zumbusch to milder, annular pustular psoriasis. Generalized pustular psoriasis mainly affects adults, with a female preponderance, but juvenile GPP also occurs. Flares are a hallmark of GPP and may occur de novo or be provoked by triggers, including withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids, infections, stress, pregnancy, and menstruation. Severity of flares varies widely between patients, and between flares in an individual patient. Significant flares are often accompanied by systemic symptoms, notably fever, general malaise, and extracutaneous manifestations such as arthritis, uveitis, and neutrophilic cholangitis. Common laboratory abnormalities include neutrophilia, elevated C-reactive protein levels, hypocalcemia, and abnormal liver function tests. The clinical course of GPP is highly variable; it can be a relapsing disease with recurrent flares and no pustulation between flares or a persistent disease with perpetual mild pustulation punctuated with flares of greater severity. Patients may have multiple flares per year or a flare every few years. Most flares last 2–5 weeks and approximately 50% require hospitalization. Life-threatening complications include sepsis and renal, hepatic, respiratory, and heart failure. Reported mortality rates are 2–16%.",

Of patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg, respectively, 40.9% and 21.2% in BRAVE-AA1 and 36.8% and 24.4% in BRAVE-AA2 achieved a SALT score ≤ 20 at Week 52. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events included upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, acne, urinary tract infection, creatine phosphokinase elevation, and COVID-19 infection.There were no comparisons with placebo.Efficacy of baricitinib for adults with severe AA continuously improved over 52 weeks, indicating that long-term treatment may be necessary to observe maximum clinical benefit. There were no new safety signals.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03570749 and NCT03899259. Efficacy and Safety of Baricitinib in Patients with Severe Alopecia Areata: Week-52 Results from BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2.Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and body. Baricitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor that is approved to treat AA in several countries, based on results from two studies, BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2. In these studies, adults with at least 50% scalp hair loss were treated with baricitinib for 36 weeks. Long-term therapy is important in AA, and hair regrowth can take longer in some patients with severe disease. Therefore, we assessed outcomes from a longer course of therapy. In this study, we report the results after 52 weeks of continuous treatment with baricitinib 4 mg or 2 mg in 465 patients in BRAVE-AA1 and 390 patients BRAVE-AA2. The goal was to reduce scalp hair loss to 20% or less by Week 52. In BRAVE-AA1, 40.9% of patients who took baricitinib 4 mg and 21.2% of patients who took baricitinib 2 mg had 20% or less missing scalp hair by Week 52. Similarly, in BRAVE-AA2, 36.8% of patients who took baricitinib 4 mg and 24.4% of patients who took baricitinib 2 mg had 20% or less missing scalp hair by Week 52. The most common adverse effects that were reported during the study period were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, acne, urinary tract infection, creatine phosphokinase elevation, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The results of longer-term treatment indicate that hair regrowth continues to improve without any new safety concerns for adults with severe AA taking baricitinib.",

    "abstract": "Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a rare, severe neutrophilic skin disorder characterized by sudden widespread eruption of superficial sterile pustules with or without systemic inflammation. GPP flares can be life-threatening if untreated due to potential severe complications such as cardiovascular failure and serious infections. Currently, there are no GPP-specific therapies approved in the USA or Europe. Retinoids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate are the most commonly used non-biologic therapies for GPP. The evidence that supports the currently available treatment options is mainly based on case reports and small, open-label, single-arm studies. However, recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of GPP and the identification of gene mutations linked to the disease have paved the way for the development of specific targeted therapies that selectively suppress the autoinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms induced during GPP flares. Several biologic agents that target key cytokines involved in the activation of inflammatory pathways, such as tumor necrosis factor-α blockers and interleukin (IL)-17, IL-23, and IL-12 inhibitors, have emerged as potential treatments for GPP, with several being approved in Japan. The evidence supporting the efficacy of these agents is mainly derived from small, uncontrolled trials. A notable recent advance is the discovery of IL36RN mutations and the central role of IL-36 receptor ligands in the pathogenesis of GPP, which has defined key therapeutic targets for the disease. Biologic agents that target the IL-36 pathway have demonstrated promising efficacy in patients with GPP, marking the beginning of a new era of targeted therapy for GPP.",

    "abstract": "Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a rare, severe form of pustular psoriasis characterized by widespread, recurrent episodes of neutrophil-rich pustule formation in the epidermis, which can be accompanied by fever and systemic inflammation. Recent clinical, histologic, and genetic evidence indicates that GPP is a distinct entity from plaque psoriasis, with different cytokine pathways predominant in the manifestation of each disease. The interleukin-36 (IL-36) signaling cascade plays a key role in regulating the innate immune system, and its dysregulation appears central to the pathogenesis of GPP. The altered expression of various IL-36 pathway constituents has been shown to cause a positive feedback loop of uncontrolled signaling and excess production of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn leads to chemokine induction and neutrophil recruitment in the epidermis. Given the potentially life-threatening nature of GPP episodes, drug interventions that rapidly achieve disease resolution are required. Early phase data indicate that treatments targeting various components of the IL-36 inflammatory cascade represent promising areas of research. However, there are currently no therapeutic agents specifically approved for GPP in the USA or Europe. Understanding the inflammatory pathways, associated risk factors, and role of neutrophils in the manifestation and perpetuation of GPP flares remains a key goal in developing effective therapeutics. In this article, we summarize the current understanding of GPP, describe novel therapeutic opportunities, and detail how the unique pathophysiology of the disease may inform future treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "For adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years) with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab resulted in substantial clinical benefit compared with placebo, with an acceptable safety profile. However, long-term data on the approved dose regimens of dupilumab in adolescents with AD are lacking. This open-label extension study (LIBERTY AD PED-OLE, NCT02612454) reports the long-term safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD who had participated in dupilumab parent trials. Patients enrolled under the original study protocol received subcutaneous dupilumab according to a weight-based regimen (2 or 4 mg/kg every week). Following protocol amendment, patients were switched to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) irrespective of weight, and newly enrolled patients were started on dupilumab 300 mg q4w. Patients with an inadequate clinical response (Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] score of 0/1 was not reached) to the q4w regimen could be uptitrated to the approved dupilumab dose regimens of 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks (body weight < 60 or ≥ 60 kg, respectively). Patients whose IGA score of 0/1 was maintained continuously for a 12-week period after week 40 were discontinued from dupilumab, monitored for relapse, and re-initiated on dupilumab if required. Data for 294 patients (mean age 14.7 years) were analyzed, 102 (34.7%) of whom had completed the 52-week visit at the database lock. The dupilumab long-term safety profile was comparable to that seen in adults and consistent with the known safety profile. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild/moderate. By week 52, 42.7% of patients had an IGA score of 0/1 (clear/almost clear), and 93.1%, 81.2%, and 56.4%, respectively, had at least a 50%, 75%, or 90% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Most (70.9%) patients required uptitration to the approved dupilumab dose regimen. The proportions of uptitrated patients with an IGA score of 0/1 or 75% improvement in EASI increased over time, reaching 35.7% and 51.9%, respectively, 48 weeks after the first uptitration visit. By week 52, 29.4% of patients had clear/almost clear skin sustained for 12 weeks and had stopped medication; 56.7% relapsed and were subsequently re-initiated on treatment, with a mean time to re-initiation of 17.5 (± standard deviation 17.3) weeks. Consistent with results seen with short-term treatment, long-term treatment with dupilumab showed an acceptable safety profile while providing incremental clinical benefit with continued treatment over time. The high proportion of patients who needed uptitration because of inadequate response to q4w dosing supports the q2w dose regimen as optimal for this age group. Finally, the majority of patients who stopped medication after having clear/almost clear skin sustained over 12 weeks experienced disease recurrence, suggesting the need for continued dupilumab dosing to maintain efficacy. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02612454, NCT02407756, NCT03054428, and NCT03050151. Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a common chronic skin disease that can cause intense and persistent itching and rashes. Atopic dermatitis remains a problem for many adolescent patients, even if they use a number of different treatments. Dupilumab is a newer treatment for atopic dermatitis. In short-term clinical studies, dupilumab improved the disease with acceptable safety. In this study, adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who had completed one of the short-term studies continued dupilumab treatment for 1 year. The patients started treatment with dupilumab once every 4 weeks. But if their atopic dermatitis did not improve sufficiently, they were given dupilumab every 2 weeks. Through a year of treatment, there were no unexpected side effects. The side effects that did occur were mild or moderate in severity and in most cases did not lead to interruption of treatment. Almost half of the patients achieved skin that was clear or almost clear of atopic dermatitis during the study. But their atopic dermatitis often returned if they stopped being treated, and about half of them needed to start treatment again. Most patients needed to be treated every 2 weeks. The positive effects of dupilumab generally increased the longer patients were treated.",

SS is accompanied by fever; an elevation of inflammatory markers (e.g., erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein) in serum may also be observed. Although most cases of SS are idiopathic, SS also occurs in the setting of malignancy or following administration of an associated drug. SS has also been reported in association with pregnancy and a burgeoning list of infectious (most commonly upper respiratory tract infections) and inflammatory diseases; likewise, the litany of possible iatrogenic triggers has also grown. Over the past several years, a wider spectrum of SS presentation has been realized, with several reports highlighting novel clinical and histological variants. Corticosteroids continue to be efficacious first-line therapy for the majority of patients with SS, although novel steroid-sparing agents have been recently added to the therapeutic armamentarium against refractory SS. New mechanisms of SS induction have also been recognized, although the precise etiology of SS still remains elusive. Here, we catalogue the various clinical and histological presentations of SS, summarize recently reported disease associations and iatrogenic triggers, and review treatment options. We also attempt to frame the findings of this review in the context of established and emerging paradigms of SS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) often requires long-term management with systemic therapies. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to report the safety and efficacy of dupilumab treatment up to 4 years in adults with moderate-to-severe AD and efficacy in a subgroup of patients who transitioned from dupilumab once-weekly (qw) to administration every other week (q2w). METHODS: This interim analysis of the open-label extension study (NCT01949311) evaluated dupilumab 300 mg qw or q2w in adults previously enrolled in dupilumab trials for moderate-to-severe AD. Patients switched from qw to q2w following protocol amendment. The primary outcome was safety; efficacy was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 2677 patients enrolled and treated, 352 (13.1%) completed week 204 (end of efficacy assessments) and 202 (7.5%) completed safety follow-up through week 244. Self-reported compliance was 98.1%. Dupilumab's safety profile was consistent with previous reports. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis, AD, upper respiratory tract infection, oral herpes, conjunctivitis, injection-site reaction, and headache. At week 204, mean ± standard deviation (SD) Eczema Area and Severity Index was 2.46 ± 3.98, and mean percent change from parent study baseline (PSBL) was -91.07%; mean ± SD Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score was 2.10 ± 1.83, and mean percent change from PSBL was -68.74%. Efficacy was maintained in patients (n = 226) who transitioned from qw to q2w dosing. Limitations of this study included its open-label design, the lack of control arm, and smaller subsets of patients at later timepoints and receiving the approved q2w regimen. CONCLUSION: These results support dupilumab as continuous long-term treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe AD; efficacy was sustained following transition from qw to q2w dosing.

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, heterogeneous, inflammatory disease characterized by skin lesions, pruritus, and pain. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD experience chronic symptoms, intensified by unpredictable flares, and often have comorbidities and secondary complications, which can result in significant clinical burden that impacts the patient's overall quality of life. The complex interplay of immune dysregulation and skin barrier disruption drives AD pathogenesis, of which T-cell-dependent inflammation plays a critical role in patients with AD. Despite new targeted therapies, many patients with moderate-to-severe AD fail to achieve or sustain their individual treatment goals and/or may not be suitable for or tolerate these therapies. There remains a need for a novel, efficacious, well-tolerated therapeutic option that can deliver durable benefits across a heterogeneous AD patient population. Expression of OX40 [tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 4 (TNFRSF4)], a prominent T-cell co-stimulatory molecule, and its ligand [OX40L; tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 4 (TNFSF4)] is increased in AD. As the OX40 pathway is critical for expansion, differentiation, and survival of effector and memory T cells, its targeting might be a promising therapeutic approach to provide sustained inhibition of pathogenic T cells and associated inflammation and broad disease control. Antibodies against OX40 [rocatinlimab (AMG 451/KHK4083) and telazorlimab (GBR 830)] or OX40L [amlitelimab (KY1005)] have shown promising results in early-phase clinical studies of moderate-to-severe AD, highlighting the importance of OX40 signaling as a new therapeutic target in AD.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis has a major global impact. Immunocompetent hosts usually control this disease, resulting in an asymptomatic latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Because TNF inhibitors increase the risk of tuberculosis reactivation, current guidelines recommend tuberculosis screening before starting any biologic drug, and chemoprophylaxis if LTBI is diagnosed. Available evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies suggests that IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors do not increase the risk of tuberculosis reactivation. To evaluate psoriasis patients with treated or untreated newly diagnosed LTBI who received IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors and the tolerability/safety of tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis. This is a retrospective, observational, multinational study from a series of 14 dermatology centres based in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and Brazil, which included adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis and newly diagnosed LTBI who were treated with IL-23 or IL-17 inhibitors between January 2015 and March 2022. LTBI was diagnosed in the case of tuberculin skin test and/or interferon gamma release assay positivity, according to local guideline, prior to initiating IL-23 or IL-17 inhibitor. Patients with prior diagnosis of LTBI (treated or untreated) or treated active infection were excluded. A total of 405 patients were included; complete/incomplete/no chemoprophylaxis was administered in 62.2, 10.1 and 27.7% of patients, respectively. The main reason for not receiving or interrupting chemoprophylaxis was perceived heightened risk of liver toxicity and hepatotoxicity, respectively. The mean duration of biological treatment was 32.87 ± 20.95 months, and only one case of active tuberculosis infection (ATBI) was observed, after 14 months of treatment with ixekizumab. The proportion of ATBI associated with ixekizumab was 1.64% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0–5.43%] and 0% for all other agents and 0.46% (95% CI 0–1.06%) and 0% for IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors, respectively (not statistically significant). The risk of tuberculosis reactivation in patients with psoriasis and LTBI does not seem to increase with IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors. IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors should be preferred over TNF antagonists when concerns regarding tuberculosis reactivation exists. In patients with LTBI considered at high risk for developing complications related to chemoprophylaxis, this preventive strategy may be waived before initiating treatment with IL-17 inhibitors and especially IL-23 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The ALLEGRO phase 2a and 2b/3 studies demonstrated that ritlecitinib, an oral JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor, is efficacious at doses of ≥ 30 mg in patients aged ≥ 12 years with alopecia areata (AA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of ritlecitinib in an integrated analysis of four studies in AA. Two cohorts were analyzed: a placebo-controlled and an all-exposure cohort. Proportions and study size–adjusted incidence rates (IRs) of adverse events (AEs) of interest and laboratory abnormalities are reported. In the placebo-controlled cohort (n = 881; median exposure: 169 days), the proportion of ritlecitinib-treated patients with AEs was 70.2–75.4% across doses versus 69.5% in the placebo group; serious AEs occurred in 0-3.2% versus 1.9% for the placebo. A total of 19 patients permanently discontinued due to AEs (5 while receiving the placebo). In the all-exposure cohort (n = 1294), median ritlecitinib exposure was 624 days [2091.7 total patient-years (PY)]. AEs were reported in 1094 patients (84.5%) and serious AEs in 57 (4.4%); 78 (6.0%) permanently discontinued due to AEs. The most common AEs were headache (17.7%; 11.9/100 PY), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test (15.5%; 9.8/100 PY), and nasopharyngitis (12.4%; 8.2/100 PY). There were two deaths (breast cancer and acute respiratory failure/cardiorespiratory arrest).

    "abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immunological reaction and a frequent complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is associated with high mortality rates and may have a significant negative impact on the patient’s quality of life, particularly in the chronic-stage setting. Many different organs can be involved, which leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations. In this context, dermatologists play a key role by diagnosing and treating GVHD from the outset since cutaneous features are not just the most common but are also usually the presenting sign. Several skin-direct therapies are available and may be indicated as monotherapy or adjuvant treatment in order to allow faster tapering and withdrawal of systemic immunosuppression. Treatment of steroid-refractory patients remains a challenge and, to date, no consensus has been reached for one single agent in second-line therapy. This article aims to review skin involvement as well as provide and update discussion on therapeutic options for both acute and chronic cutaneous GVHD.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary ichthyoses are due to mutations on one or both alleles of more than 30 different genes, mainly expressed in the upper epidermis. Syndromic as well as nonsyndromic forms of ichthyosis exist. Irrespective of etiology, virtually all types of ichthyosis exhibit a defective epidermal barrier that constitutes the driving force for hyperkeratosis, skin scaling, and inflammation. In nonsyndromic forms, these features are most evident in severe autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) and epidermolytic ichthyosis, but to some extent also occur in the common type of non-congenital ichthyosis. A correct diagnosis of ichthyosis—essential not only for genetic counseling but also for adequate patient information about prognosis and therapeutic options—is becoming increasingly feasible thanks to recent progress in genetic knowledge and DNA sequencing methods. This paper reviews the most important aspects of nonsyndromic ichthyoses, focusing on new knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disorders, which will hopefully lead to novel ideas about therapy.",

    "abstract": "Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), commercially available since 2000-2001, are the first and only topical medications approved for chronic treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in pediatric patients and remain a welcomed alternative to topical corticosteroids. In January 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a boxed warning requirement based on a theoretical risk of malignancy (including lymphoma) with TCI use. However, in the years since, analyses of epidemiologic and clinical data have failed to demonstrate a causal relationship between TCI use and malignancy or lymphoma risk, especially for pimecrolimus cream. In fact, the observed number of malignancies and lymphomas observed both in post-marketing surveillance and reported to the FDA using its adverse events reporting system is much lower among TCI-exposed patients than the expected number for the general population. Furthermore, among children enrolled in post-marketing pediatric registry studies for both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus followed for up to 5.5 years [10,724 patient-years (PY)] or 6.5 years (16,219 PY), respectively, the observed number of malignancies and lymphomas is very low and similar to the number expected for a sample of similar size in the general population. In addition to reporting these comparative malignancy and lymphoma data, this article provides a historical overview of the boxed warning requirement and critically evaluates the preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological evidence that has thus far failed to substantiate a relationship between TCI use and malignancy. The authors also provide practical clinical advice for optimizing AD management and patient care in the context of the boxed warning.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris is still evolving. It is known that multiple factors impact acne pathophysiology, including genetic, hormonal, inflammatory, and environmental influences. Because of its implications in many of these factors, diet has been a part of the acne discussion for decades. Several studies have evaluated the significance of the glycemic index of various foods and glycemic load in patients with acne, demonstrating individuals with acne who consume diets with a low glycemic load have reduced acne lesions compared with individuals on high glycemic load diets. Dairy has also been a focus of study regarding dietary influences on acne; whey proteins responsible for the insulinotropic effects of milk may contribute more to acne development than the actual fat or dairy content. Other studies have examined the effects of omega-3 fatty acid and γ-linoleic acid consumption in individuals with acne, showing individuals with acne benefit from diets consisting of fish and healthy oils, thereby increasing omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid intake. Recent research into the effects of probiotic administration in individuals with acne present promising results; further study of the effects of probiotics on acne is needed to support the findings of these early studies. In this review, we discuss the current evidence regarding the diets of US patients with acne and how they may impact acne and acne treatment.",

    "abstract": "Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic, recurrent skin disease belonging to the spectrum of psoriasis. It is characterized by an eruption of sterile pustules on the palms and soles. Recent studies in PPP have focused on genetic differences between pustular phenotypes and the role of the innate immunological system and the microbiome in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Mutations in IL36RN (a major predisposing factor for generalized pustular psoriasis) were found in selected patients with PPP and were associated with earlier disease onset. Studies have shown that the interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-36 pathways might be involved in the pathogenesis of PPP. A microbiome has been demonstrated in the vesicopustules of PPP, and an abundance of Staphylococcus appears to be increased by smoking. Improved understanding of the underlying etiopathogenesis of PPP has led to advances in treatment options, and targeted therapies for PPP have been evaluated or are under evaluation against more than 12 molecules in ongoing clinical trials. These targets include CXCR2 (IL-8 receptor type B), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, IL-1 receptor, IL-8, IL-12, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-17 receptor, IL-36 receptor, phosphodiesterase-4, and tumor necrosis factor-α.",

    "abstract": "Background: Management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) commonly requires long-term treatment. Objective: The aim of this study was to report the safety and efficacy of dupilumab treatment for up to 3 years in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Methods: This ongoing, multicenter, open-label extension study (LIBERTY AD OLE; NCT01949311) assessed dupilumab treatment in adults previously enrolled in dupilumab trials. Patients received dupilumab 300 mg weekly up to 148 weeks. The primary outcome was safety. Results: Of 2677 patients enrolled and treated, 347 reached week 148. Mean self-reported drug compliance was 98.2%. Safety data were consistent with previously reported trials (270.1 adverse events [AEs]/100 patient-years; 6.9 serious AEs/100 patient-years) and the known dupilumab safety profile. Common AEs (≥ 5% of patients) included nasopharyngitis, AD, upper respiratory tract infection, conjunctivitis, headache, oral herpes, and injection-site reactions. AD signs and symptoms showed sustained improvements during treatment with mean (standard deviation, mean percentage change from parent study baseline) Eczema Area and Severity Index 1.4 (3.2, − 95.4%) and weekly Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale 2.2 (1.8, − 65.4%) at week 148. Limitations: No control arm; fewer patients at later time points; regimen different from the approved 300 mg every 2 weeks dose. Conclusion: These safety and efficacy results support dupilumab as a continuous long-term treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01949311.

    "abstract": "Pivotal phase III studies demonstrated that abrocitinib, an oral, once-daily, JAK1-selective inhibitor, is effective treatment for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) as monotherapy and in combination with topical therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg in an integrated analysis of a phase IIb study, four phase III studies, and one long-term extension study. Two cohorts were analyzed: a placebo-controlled cohort from 12- to 16-week studies and an all-abrocitinib cohort including patients who received one or more abrocitinib doses. Adverse events (AEs) of interest and laboratory data are reported. Total exposure in the all-abrocitinib cohort (n = 2856) was 1614 patient-years (PY); exposure was ≥ 24 weeks in 1248 patients and ≥ 48 weeks in 606 (maximum 108 weeks). In the placebo-controlled cohort (n = 1540), dose-related AEs (200 mg, 100 mg, placebo) were nausea (14.6%, 6.1%, 2.0%), headache (7.8%, 5.9%, 3.5%), and acne (4.7%, 1.6%, 0%). Platelet count was reduced transiently in a dose-dependent manner; 2/2718 patients (200-mg group) had confirmed platelet counts of < 50 × 103/mm3 at week 4. Incidence rates (IRs) were 2.33/100PY and 2.65/100 PY for serious infection, 4.34/100PY and 2.04/100PY for herpes zoster, and 11.83/100PY and 8.73/100PY for herpes simplex in the 200-mg and 100-mg groups, respectively. IRs for nonmelanoma skin cancer, other malignancies, and major adverse cardiovascular events were < 0.5/100PY for both doses. Five venous thromboembolism events occurred (IR 0.30/100PY), all in the 200-mg group. There were three deaths due to gastric carcinoma (diagnosed at day 43), sudden death, and COVID-19. Abrocitinib, with proper patient and dose selection, has a manageable tolerability and longer-term safety profile appropriate for long-term use in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.

    "abstract": "Advances in sequencing, bioinformatics and analytics now allow the structure, function and interrelations of whole microbial communities to be studied in greater detail. Collaborative efforts and multidisciplinary studies, crossing the boundary between environmental and medical microbiology, have allowed specific environmental, animal and human microbiomes to be characterized. One of the main challenges for microbial ecology is to link the phylogenetic diversity of host-associated microbes to their functional roles within the community. Much remains to be learned on the way microbes colonize the skin of different living organisms and the way the skin microbiome reacts to the surrounding environment (air, water, etc.). In this review, we discuss examples of recent studies that have used modern technology to provide insights into microbial communities in water and on skin, such as those in natural resources (thermal spring water), large mammals (humpback whales) and humans (the skin microbiome). The results of these studies demonstrate how a greater understanding of the structure and functioning of microbiota, together with their interactions with the environment, may facilitate the discovery of new probiotics or postbiotics, provide indicators for the quality of the environment, and show how changes in lifestyle and living environment, such as urbanization, can impact on the skin microbiome and skin health and disease in humans.",

In this review, we summarize recent updates on GA epidemiology and etiopathogenesis and offer an updated review of the therapeutic options for GA currently reported in the literature.

    "abstract": "Vulvar melanoma (VuM) and vaginal melanoma (VaM) represent a unique subgroup of malignant melanomas with important differences in biology and treatment. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology and prognosis of VuM and VaM in a large representative cohort. Women with invasive VuM or VaM were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-18 population representing 27.8% of the US population. Data on age, ethnicity, stage, location, histopathology, primary surgery, and lymphadenectomy were collected. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to analyze disease-specific and overall survival. Univariate and multivariate regression models were used to identify factors with a significant association with disease-specific survival. A total of 1400 VuM and 463 VaM were included for further analysis; 78.6% and 49.7% of women with VuM and VaM underwent surgery, but only 52.9% of women with non-metastatic VuM and 42.9% of women with non-metastatic VaM undergoing surgery had lymph node assessment; one third of these had positive nodes. Superficial spreading was the most common subtype in VuM, and nodular melanoma in VaM (p < 0.001). The median disease-specific survival was 99 months (95% confidence interval 60–138) and 19 months (95% confidence interval 16–22), respectively. Survival was significantly associated with age at diagnosis, ethnicity, stage, surgery, lymph node metastases, histologic subtype, ulceration, mitotic count, and tumor thickness in VuM, and stage, surgery, and lymph node involvement in VaM. In the Cox model, lymph node status and number of mitoses remained independent predictors of outcome in VuM; in VaM, only lymph node status remained significant. The overall prognosis of VuM and VaM remains poor. The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system is applicable and should be used for VuM; however, lymph node status and mitotic rate are the most important predictors of survival. Lymph node status should be assessed and patients with positive nodes may be candidates for adjuvant treatment.",

    "abstract": "This review presents the main challenges encountered when diagnosing unusual variants of malignant melanoma with the aim of raising awareness to allow application of the most appropriate treatment strategies. Although these melanomas are often rare, their misdiagnosis potentially jeopardizes patients' health and survival, and has medicolegal implications. The clinical and histologic presentations of melanoma vary greatly, and assessment of uncommon melanomas can be difficult for practitioners because of their scarcity and resemblance to other dermatologic entities. The most problematic melanoma types are desmoplastic melanoma, polypoid melanoma, primary dermal melanoma, verrucous malignant melanoma, pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma, mucosal melanoma, follicular melanoma and melanoma with non-melanocytic differentiation. The two most difficult-to-diagnose subtypes of melanoma are the nevoid and the amelanotic melanomas. Some specific attributes of these variants can be more easily recognized with digital dermatoscopy, facilitating early detection and possibly avoiding invasive procedures. Key cases with the most notable clinical, dermatoscopic, and histopathologic features are presented, highlighting the practical issues of making an accurate diagnosis and choosing the best therapy.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of data from clinical trials of biologics, the approval of new biologics, and our improved understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis have increased the therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Biologics currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis include tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors, ustekinumab (an IL-12/23 inhibitor), and IL-23 inhibitors. Data from clinical trials and studies of the safety and efficacy of biologics provide essential information for the personalization of patient care. We discuss the benefits and disadvantages of biologics as a first-line treatment choice, update treatment recommendations according to current evidence, and propose psoriasis treatment algorithms. Our discussion includes the following comorbid conditions: psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis B, nonmelanoma skin cancer, lymphoma, and latent tuberculosis. We make evidence-based treatment recommendations for special populations, including pediatric patients, patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and pregnant and breastfeeding patients with psoriasis. Ultimately, individualized recommendations that consider patient preferences, disease severity, comorbid conditions, and additional risk factors should be offered to patients and updated as new trial data emerges.",

Next to the known trigger factors, the role of microbiota in the development and aggravation of rosacea continues to raise interest. Demodex folliculorum mites, Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and the Demodex-associated bacterium, Bacillus oleronius are microbes that have been linked with rosacea. However, the results of studies which assessed their involvement in the disease have been inconsistent and inconclusive. Microbiological research in many different disciplines exploded in recent years as methods to analyze complex microbial communities at the taxonomic and phylogenetic levels became available. Here, we provide an update on the microorganisms implicated in rosacea and review the potential pathogenic role of microbes in the development of rosacea.",

Though overt gastrointestinal symptoms are rare, three-fourths of patients with DH have villous atrophy in the small bowel, and the rest have celiac-type inflammatory changes. DH affects mostly adults and slightly more males than females. The mean age at onset is about 50 years. DH diagnosis is confirmed by showing granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the papillary dermis. The DH autoantigen, transglutaminase 3, is deposited at the same site in tightly bound immune complexes. At present, the DH-to-celiac disease prevalence is 1:8. The incidence of DH is decreasing, whereas that of celiac disease is increasing, probably because of improved diagnostics. In DH, the treatment of choice for all patients is a gluten-free diet (GFD) in which uncontaminated oats are allowed. At onset, most patients need additional dapsone to rapidly control the rash and itching. Dapsone can be stopped after a mean of 2 years, and a strict lifelong GFD alone is required. Dietary adherence offers an excellent long-term prognosis for patients with DH, with a normal quality of life and all-cause mortality.",

    "abstract": "Crisaborole ointment, 2%, is a nonsteroidal phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of crisaborole in infants aged 3 to < 24 months with mild-to-moderate AD in an open-label study.Infants (3 to < 24 months) with Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) of mild (2) or moderate (3) and percentage of treatable body surface area (%BSA) ≥ 5 received crisaborole twice daily for 28 days; a cohort with moderate AD per ISGA and %BSA ≥ 35 were included in a PK analysis. Endpoints included safety (primary), efficacy, and PK (exploratory).Included were 137 infants total (mean age [SD], 13.6 months [6.42]), with 21 in the PK cohort (12.7 months [6.58]). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 88 (64.2%) patients (98.9% rated as mild/moderate). TEAEs were considered treatment-related for 22 patients (16.1%); most frequently reported were application site pain (3.6%), application site discomfort (2.9%), and erythema (2.9%). ISGA clear/almost clear with ≥ 2-grade improvement at day 29 was achieved by 30.2% of patients. From baseline to day 29, mean percentage change in Eczema Area and Severity Index score was - 57.5%, and mean change in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure total score was - 8.5. Crisaborole systemic exposures in infants were characterized and, based on nonlinear regression analysis, were comparable with that in patients aged ≥ 2 years.In this open-label study, crisaborole was well tolerated and effective in infants (3 to < 24 months) with mild-to-moderate AD with systemic exposures similar to patients aged ≥ 2 years.NCT03356977.Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disease that causes inflamed and itchy skin. Crisaborole is an ointment that is approved to treat patients aged 2 years and older with mild-to-moderate AD. This clinical trial studied crisaborole in infants with mild-to-moderate AD who were 3 to under 24 months old. These infants were treated with crisaborole twice a day for 28 days. The trial studied crisaborole’s safety, effectiveness, and absorption into the bloodstream. In total, 137 infants were treated. Although side effects of some sort occurred in about two-thirds of patients, only 1 in 6 patients experienced side effects that were attributed to crisaborole. When these side effects did occur, these were mainly pain, discomfort, or redness where crisaborole was applied. Fewer than 1 in 25 patients experienced each side effect where crisaborole was applied. The doctors saw improvement in the AD symptoms of some patients at day 29 of the study compared to the beginning of the study. Crisaborole blood-level measurements in this age group were consistent with those seen in patients aged 2 years and older. Overall, crisaborole was considered well tolerated and effective in infants (3 to under 24 months old) with mild-to-moderate AD.

    "abstract": "Acne is a common cause for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), particularly in patients with skin of color (SOC), and PIH is often more distressing to patients than the acne itself. Topical retinoids are approved for the treatment of acne and for pigmentation disorders such as melasma or mottled hyperpigmentation associated with photodamage; moreover, they have been shown to reduce hyperpigmentation in patients with SOC. Therefore, treatment with topical retinoids should be started as early as possible unless contraindicated. Use of novel formulations or application of commonly recommended moisturizers may help reduce irritation. Combining retinoids with other topical agents and procedures such as superficial chemical peels can help to improve hyperpigmentation. Primary acne lesions are likely to improve weeks before PIH resolves and helping patients manage their expectations may reduce frustration. Providing clinicians and researchers with more education about the presentation and management of dermatologic conditions in patients with SOC is also recommended.",

    "abstract": "Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a rare disease that has only recently benefited from a consistent definition and clinical coding standard. A lack of disease awareness combined with clinical similarities to other types of psoriasis have historically complicated the diagnosis of GPP. It is now clear that GPP requires a differential diagnosis from psoriasis vulgaris (plaque psoriasis), and better understanding of the genetic characteristics underlying GPP may improve the accuracy of diagnoses in the future. GPP can present at any age but is most common in the fifth decade of life. There appears to be a female preponderance in GPP, although there is notable variability in prevalence by geographical region and between ethnicities. GPP is potentially life-threatening, associated with several serious complications, and may require emergency treatment, particularly for complications arising from systemic inflammation. As with many rare diseases, there are inherent challenges to understanding the epidemiology of GPP. In addition to small patient numbers, estimating the prevalence of rare diseases is further complicated by studies that use non-standardized methodologies and that are conducted in different populations. These complications in data gathering have led to marked variability in GPP case estimates by geographical region and between ethnicities. There is ongoing research into disease characteristics, and insights into regional measures of prevalence are essential to increasing our understanding of GPP.",

    "abstract": "Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe rare skin disease characterized by widespread eruption of sterile superficial macroscopic pustules with or without systemic inflammation. Generalized pustular psoriasis flares may lead to life-threatening multiorgan complications, which highlights the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis. However, the rarity of the disease and its heterogeneous cutaneous and extracutaneous symptoms, and the resemblance of symptoms to other skin conditions, pose considerable challenges to the timely diagnosis and treatment of patients with GPP. Current laboratory tests used for GPP diagnosis are generally not GPP specific, and are mainly focused on the assessment of inflammatory markers and clinical and histopathologic features of GPP, and emerging genetic screening approaches. A differential diagnosis to distinguish GPP from other similar conditions requires careful assessment of the patient's skin symptoms, potential disease triggers, medical history, histopathologic features, laboratory tests, and clinical disease course. The comprehensive interpretation of these assessments can be challenging owing to the lack of standardized global guidelines. While there is currently a lack of standardized international guidelines for the diagnosis of GPP, recent advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of the disease have provided new opportunities to enhance diagnosis. In the future, defining specific GPP subtypes using genetic and histopathologic strategies will guide therapeutic decisions, allowing patients to achieve their treatment goals without delay. In this article, we provide an overview of the current diagnostic methods, differential diagnostic strategies, and future advances in the diagnosis of GPP, as well as features of GPP variants.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can have tremendous impact on quality of life for affected children and adults. First-line therapy for acute management of AD includes topical therapies such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and, more recently, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor crisaborole. Topical agents have remained the mainstay therapy for decades; however, there has been a longstanding need for topical therapies with high efficacy and low risk of adverse effects with long-term use. Given the ongoing advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AD, there are novel targets for pharmacological intervention. We are now in an unprecedented time with more than 40 topical treatments in the pipeline for AD in addition to many developments and treatments on the horizon. This review summarizes selected therapeutic topical agents in later phases of development that target various aspects in the pathogenesis of AD such as Janus kinase inhibition (ruxolitinib and delgocitinib), phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition (roflumilast and difamilast), aryl hydrocarbon modulation (tapinarof), and modulation of the microbiome. We also review novel targeted therapies that are in early phase clinical trials, including AMTX-100, BEN-2293, and PRN473. Preliminary findings on efficacy and tolerability of most of these agents are promising, but further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of these novel agents against the current standard of care.",

Knowledge of the burden of GPP and the experience of affected individuals is limited.To conduct a survey of people living with GPP to understand how they experience GPP flares, which therapies they have received and are receiving, and how GPP impacts their activities of daily living.The online survey consisted of 43 questions answered by individuals recruited from an opt-in market research database. The research team performed a targeted outreach to identify individuals with GPP. The survey included screening questions to determine if potential participants qualified for inclusion. Eligible individuals were US residents aged ≥ 18 years who self-reported that they had been diagnosed with GPP. Respondents provided consent to participate and received compensation (fair market value) for their time.Between August 4 and 14, 2020, 66 people living with GPP in the USA were surveyed. Most participants were female, aged 40-59 years, had been diagnosed ≥ 1 year previously, and had experienced ≥ 2 flares in the past year. A substantial proportion of respondents had symptoms for years, had consulted multiple healthcare professionals, and experienced misdiagnoses before receiving a diagnosis of GPP. Emotional stress was the most common cause of flares and many respondents reported a fear of flares. Respondents defined flares by the presence of itching, an increase in the size of the affected area, more crusts or pustules, and fatigue. A change in mood was the most burdensome symptom. Most respondents were receiving topical corticosteroids and only approximately one-third felt their condition was well controlled. GPP had an impact on activities of daily living even in the absence of flares and many respondents felt that their physician did not understand the level of emotional, psychological, or physical pain caused by GPP.GPP imposes a substantial emotional burden on patients, with wide-ranging impacts on activities of daily living beyond the physical discomfort of skin lesions.",

    "abstract": "Lupus erythematosus comprises a spectrum of autoimmune diseases that may affect various organs (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) or the skin only (cutaneous lupus erythematosus [CLE]). Typical combinations of clinical, histological and serological findings define clinical subtypes of CLE, yet there is high interindividual variation. Skin lesions arise in the course of triggers such as ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, smoking or drugs; keratinocytes, cytotoxic T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) establish a self-perpetuating interplay between the innate and adaptive immune system that is pivotal for the pathogenesis of CLE. Therefore, treatment relies on avoidance of triggers and UV protection, topical therapies (glucocorticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors) and rather unspecific immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs. Yet, the advent of licensed targeted therapies for SLE might also open new perspectives in the management of CLE. The heterogeneity of CLE might be attributable to individual variables and we speculate that the prevailing inflammatory signature defined by either T cells, B cells, pDCs, a strong lesional type I interferon (IFN) response, or combinations of the above might be suitable to predict therapeutic response to targeted treatment. Therefore, pretherapeutic histological assessment of the inflammatory infiltrate could stratify patients with refractory CLE for T-cell-directed therapies (e.g. dapirolizumab pegol), B-cell-directed therapies (e.g. belimumab), pDC-directed therapies (e.g. litifilimab) or IFN-directed therapies (e.g. anifrolumab). Moreover, Janus kinase (JAK) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitors might broaden the therapeutic armamentarium in the near future. A close interdisciplinary exchange with rheumatologists and nephrologists is mandatory for optimal treatment of lupus patients to define the best therapeutic strategy.",

Objectives: To report integrated safety of lebrikizumab in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from phase 2 and 3 studies. Methods: Five double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled studies; one randomized open-label study; one adolescent open-label, single-arm study; and one long-term safety study were summarized in two datasets: (1) placebo-controlled week 0–16 (All-PC Week 0–16) in patients who received lebrikizumab 250 mg every 2 weeks (LEBQ2W) versus placebo and (2) patients who received any dose of lebrikizumab at any time during the studies (All-LEB). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (IR)/100 patient-years (PY) are provided. Results: A total of 1720 patients received lebrikizumab (1637.0 PY exposure). In All-PC Week 0–16, the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar between treatment groups; most events were nonserious and mild or moderate in severity. The most frequently reported TEAEs were atopic dermatitis (placebo) and conjunctivitis (LEBQ2W). Frequencies of conjunctivitis cluster were 2.5% (placebo) and 8.5% (LEBQ2W), and all events were mild or moderate (All-LEB 10.6%, IR, 12.2). Frequencies of injection site reactions were 1.5% (placebo) and 2.6% (LEBQ2W; All-LEB 3.1%, IR, 3.3). Frequencies of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were 1.4% (placebo) and 2.3% (LEBQ2W; All-LEB 4.2%, IR, 4.5). Conclusion: The safety profile for lebrikizumab consisted of TEAEs that were mostly nonserious, mild or moderate in severity, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. The safety profile was similar in both adults and adolescents.

    "abstract": "The incidence of syphilis has been increasing in the USA since 2000. Notably, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic negatively impacted the public health efforts to contain the spread of sexually transmitted diseases including syphilis and congenital syphilis. Clinical manifestations of syphilis are predominantly mucocutaneous lesions, thus dermatologists are primed to recognize the myriad presentations of this disease. Primary syphilis is classically characterized by a painless transient chancre most often located in the genital area. Secondary syphilis typically manifests clinically as systemic symptoms in addition to a mucocutaneous eruption of which a variety of forms exist. Although less common in the era of effective penicillin treatment, late clinical manifestations of syphilis are described as well. In addition to recognition of syphilis on physical examination, several diagnostic tools may be used to confirm infection. Treponema pallidum spirochetes may be detected directly using histopathologic staining, darkfield microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody, and polymerase chain reaction assays. A table detailing the histopathologic features of syphilis is included in this article. Serologic testing, non-treponemal and treponemal tests, is the preferred method for screening and diagnosing syphilis infections. Two serologic testing algorithms exist to aid clinicians in diagnosing positive syphilis infection. Determining the correct stage of syphilis infection combines results of serologic tests, patient history, and physical examination findings. Using the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definitions and treatment guidelines, a management algorithm is proposed here. Penicillin remains the pharmacological treatment of choice although specific clinical situations allow for alternative therapies. Syphilis is a reportable disease in every state and should be reported by stage according to individual state requirements. Screening recommendations are largely based upon risks encountered through sexual exposures. Likewise, sexual partner management includes evaluating and treating persons exposed to someone diagnosed with an infective stage of syphilis. Close clinical follow-up and repeat testing are recommended to ensure appropriate response to treatment. This guide will discuss the current epidemiology of syphilis and focus on practice aspects of diagnosis and management, including public health reporting.",

    "abstract": "Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the lower extremities. It typically occurs in older individuals and is the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux. Such retrograde venous blood flow is the result of incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or venous obstruction. Stasis dermatitis is eczematous. The associated impairment of venous valves may cause swelling of the legs, leading to serious conditions including venous ulcerations. Diagnosis can be challenging because of its clinical resemblance to other skin conditions and poor clinical recognition by physicians. The cornerstones of stasis dermatitis treatment are compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes, and interventional treatment options to correct the underlying causes of venous reflux. Given the central role of inflammation of the lower extremities in driving the cutaneous changes characteristic of stasis dermatitis, new therapeutic approaches that target the inflammation are under clinical evaluation in patients with stasis dermatitis. Stasis dermatitis is a skin disease that can affect a person for a long time. It affects the legs of older people who have a disease called chronic venous insufficiency. This is when a person's veins have difficulty sending blood from their limbs back to their heart. Stasis dermatitis is caused by increased pressure inside a person's veins. Its signs and symptoms are skin discoloration, itch, dryness, and scaling and can be similar to the signs and symptoms of cellulitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Cellulitis is a common skin infection caused by bacteria. Cellulitis causes redness, swelling, and pain. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy skin rash caused by contact with something that irritates the skin. Stasis dermatitis is usually diagnosed after a healthcare provider has looked at person's skin and their medical history. Treatment for stasis dermatitis should treat the chronic venous insufficiency that causes the disease. It should also treat the skin lesions caused by stasis dermatitis. One way to treat stasis dermatitis is to reduce pain and swelling. This is done by applying pressure with compression stockings or bandages. Minor surgery can treat the venous insufficiency that causes stasis dermatitis. No treatments have been approved for the skin symptoms associated with stasis dermatitis. New ways to treat such symptoms need to be developed.",

    "abstract": "Chronic prurigo (CPG) is a neuroinflammatory, fibrotic dermatosis that is defined by the presence of chronic pruritus (itch lasting longer than 6 weeks), scratch-associated pruriginous skin lesions and history of repeated scratching. Patients with CPG experience a significant psychological burden and a notable impairment in their quality of life. Chronic prurigo of nodular type (CNPG; synonym: prurigo nodularis) represents the most common subtype of CPG. As CNPG is representative for all CPG subtypes, we refer in this review to both CNPG and CPG. We provide an overview of the clinical characteristics and assessment of CPG, the burden of disease and the underlying pathophysiology including associated therapeutic targets. The information provided results from a PubMed search for the latest publications and a database search for current clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register [European Medicines Agency]; using the following terms or combinations of terms: 'chronic prurigo', 'prurigo', 'prurigo nodularis', 'pathophysiology', 'therapy', 'biologics', 'treatment'). Dupilumab is the first authorized systemic therapy by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CNPG to date. Topical and systemic agents that are currently under investigation in clinical randomized, placebo-controlled phase II and III trials such as biologics (e.g., nemolizumab, vixarelimab/KPL-716, barzolvolimab/CDX-0159), small molecules (ruxolitinib cream, povorcitinib/INCB054707, abrocitinib) and the opioid modulator nalbuphine are highlighted. In the last past 15 years, several milestones have been reached regarding the disease understanding of CPG such as first transcriptomic analysis, first terminology, first guideline, and first therapy approval in 2022, which contributed to improved medical care of affected patients. The broad range of identified targets, current case observations and initiated trials offers the possibility of more drug approvals in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Acne is a common, chronic inflammatory condition affecting millions of people worldwide, with significant negative impact on quality of life and mental health. Acne is characterized by comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodulocystic lesions, with long-lasting sequelae including scarring and dyspigmentation, the latter of which is more common in skin of color. The four main pillars of acne pathophysiology include alteration of sebum production and concentration, hyperkeratinization of the follicular unit, Cutibacterium acnes strains, and an inflammatory immune response. Newer research has provided greater insight into these pathophysiologic categories. This greater understanding of acne pathogenesis has led to numerous new and emerging treatment modalities. These modalities include combinations of existing treatments, repurposing of existing agents historically used for other conditions, new topical treatments, novel antibiotics, topical and oral probiotics, and various procedural devices. This article will provide an overview of emerging treatments of acne and their link to our current and improved understanding of acne pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, including upadacitinib, have been recently approved for the treatment of moderate-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) and real-world data on upadacitinib effectiveness and safety are limited. This interim analysis aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of upadacitinib throughout 48 weeks of observation in a real-world adult AD population. This prospective study collected data on adult patients affected by moderate-to-severe AD and treated with upadacitinib at the dosage of either 15 mg or 30 mg daily based on the physician decision. Upadacitinib was prescribed in the context of a national compassionate use programme. In this interim analysis, within patient comparisons of continuous scores of different scales (namely Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI], body surface area [BSA], Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI], Patient Oriented Eczema Measure [POEM], Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] subtests) were performed. The percentage of patients achieving EASI 75, EASI 90 and EASI 100 at Week 16, 32 and 48 was also evaluated. One hundred and forty-six patients were included in the analysis. Upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg daily was prescribed as monotherapy in most cases (127/146, 87.0%). Upadacitinib was initially prescribed at the dosage of 30 mg daily in 118 of 146 (80.8%) patients and 15 mg daily in 28/146 (19.2%) patients. A significant improvement in the clinical signs and symptoms of AD was detected by Week 16 and throughout the study period. EASI 75, EASI 90 and EASI 100 responses were achieved by 87.6%, 69.1% and 44.3% at Week 48, associated with a sustained reduction in the mean values of all physician-reported (EASI and BSA) and patient-reported (Itch- Sleep- and Pain-NRS, DLQI, and POEM) disease severity outcomes, up to 48 weeks of treatment. Treatment response observed in 15 mg upadacitinib-treated patients was comparable with that detected in 30 mg upadacitinib-treated patients, revealing no statistical difference between the two patient sub-cohorts. Through the observation period, dose reduction or escalation was observed in 38/146 (26%) of treated cases. Overall, 26 of 146 (17.8%) patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) during the treatment period. In total, 29 AEs were recorded and most of them were evaluated as mild to moderate, while in 4 cases the occurrence of AE led to drug discontinuation, for a total of 7/146 (4.8%) dropouts. This study provides strong evidence of a sustained response obtained by upadacitinib in AD patients, who had failed to respond to conventional or biological systemic agents, through 48 weeks of observation. Upadacitinib was also demonstrated to be advantageous in terms of flexibility in dose reduction or escalation as upadacitinib dose was shaped on clinical needs that, in a real-world setting, might frequently change.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data demonstrate strong associations between psoriasis and metabolic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The presence of metabolic comorbidities significantly influences the selection and effectiveness of pharmacological treatments. Some drugs should be prescribed with caution in patients with metabolic comorbidities because of an increased risk of adverse events, while others could have a reduced effectiveness. The aim of this narrative review is to highlight the challenges that healthcare professionals may face regarding the management of psoriasis in patients with metabolic comorbidities. In the first part of the article, the epidemiological association between psoriasis and metabolic comorbidities and their pathogenetic mechanisms is summarized. The second part describes the efficacy and safety profile of conventional and biologic drugs in patients with selected metabolic comorbidities including obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/hepatic steatosis, and diabetes. Finally, the role of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as diet, alcohol abstinence, physical activity, and smoking avoidance is discussed. In conclusion, the choice of the best approach to manage patients with psoriasis with metabolic comorbidities should encompass both tailored pharmacological and individualized non-pharmacological interventions.",

    "abstract": "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer characterized by neuroendocrine differentiation. Its carcinogenesis is based either on the integration of the Merkel cell polyomavirus or on ultraviolet (UV) mutagenesis, both of which lead to high immunogenicity either through the expression of viral proteins or neoantigens. Despite this immunogenicity resulting from viral or UV-associated carcinogenesis, it exhibits highly aggressive behavior. However, owing to the rarity of MCC and the lack of epidemiologic registries with detailed clinical data, there is some uncertainty regarding the spontaneous course of the disease. Historically, advanced MCC patients were treated with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy yielding a median response duration of only 3 months. Starting in 2017, four programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors—avelumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab (utilized in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings), and retifanlimab—have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with disseminated MCC on the basis of prospective clinical trials. However, generating clinical evidence for rare cancers, such as MCC, is challenging owing to difficulties in conducting large-scale trials, resulting in small sample sizes and therefore lacking statistical power. Thus, to comprehensively understand the available clinical evidence on various immunotherapy approaches for MCC, we also delve into the epidemiology and immune biology of this cancer. Nevertheless, while randomized studies directly comparing immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy in MCC are lacking, immunotherapy shows response rates comparable to those previously reported with chemotherapy but with more enduring responses. Notably, adjuvant nivolumab has proven superiority to the standard-of-care therapy (observation) in the adjuvant setting.",

    "abstract": "Abrocitinib, an oral, once-daily, Janus kinase 1-selective inhibitor, is efficacious in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with a manageable long-term safety profile. We aimed to provide updated integrated long-term safety results for abrocitinib from available data accrued up to a maximum of almost 4 years in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from the JADE clinical development program. Analysis included 3802 patients (exposure: 5213.9 patient-years) from the phase II monotherapy study (NCT02780167) and the phase III studies JADE MONO-1 (NCT03349060), JADE MONO-2 (NCT03575871), JADE TEEN (NCT03796676), JADE COMPARE (NCT03720470), JADE DARE (NCT04345367; 200 mg only), JADE REGIMEN (NCT03627767), and JADE EXTEND (NCT03422822; data cutoff 25 September, 2021). Data from patients receiving one or more doses of abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg were pooled in a consistent-dose cohort (patients were allocated to receive the same abrocitinib dose throughout exposure in the qualifying parent study and/or long-term study) or a variable-dose cohort (patients received open-label abrocitinib 200 mg; responders were randomized to abrocitinib 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, and could then receive abrocitinib 200 mg plus topical corticosteroids as rescue therapy). Incidence rates of adverse events of special interest were assessed. Cox regression analysis of risk factors for herpes zoster and serious infections was performed. Overall, this safety analysis of long-term data up to a maximum of ~ 4 years of abrocitinib exposure does not indicate any changes from the previously reported risk profile. The most frequent serious infections (per Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred term) with consistent-dose abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg were herpes zoster (0.5% and 0.2%), pneumonia (0.2% with either dose), and herpes simplex (0.1% with either dose). Risk factors for herpes zoster were a history of herpes zoster, abrocitinib 200-mg dose, age ≥ 65 years, absolute lymphocyte count < 1 × 103/mm3 before the event, and residing in Asia. For serious infections, > 100 kg body weight was a risk factor. Incidence rate/100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) with the consistent abrocitinib 200-mg and 100-mg dose combined was higher in older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients versus younger (aged 18 to < 65 years) patients for serious adverse events (17.6 [11.7‒25.4] vs 6.7 [5.8‒7.8]), malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (2.4 [0.6‒6.0] vs 0.1 [0.0‒0.4]), non-melanoma skin cancer (2.4 [0.6‒6.1] vs 0.2 [0.1‒0.4]), lymphopenia (3.5 [1.3‒7.6] vs 0.1 [0.0‒0.3]), and venous thromboembolism (1.7 [0.4‒5.1] vs 0.1 [0.0‒0.3]). Incident rate/100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancer with the consistent abrocitinib 200-mg and 100-mg dose combined was higher in current/former smokers (0.9 [0.4‒1.6]) vs never-smokers (0.0 [0.0‒0.1]). This safety update showed a consistent profile for abrocitinib with no new safety signals and continues to support that abrocitinib has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Risk of specific adverse events was higher in certain patient populations, especially those aged ≥ 65 years.

NCT03422822; study start date: 8 March, 2018; study completion date: ongoing (estimated completion date: 31 January, 2026). Abrocitinib is an approved treatment for people with moderate or severe atopic dermatitis, also known as AD or atopic eczema. Abrocitinib is a tablet that is taken by mouth once a day. This safety analysis looked at the side effects of treatment in a large group of adults and adolescents with moderate or severe AD who took abrocitinib up to a maximum of almost 4 years. This analysis also looked at which people were more likely to have certain side effects after taking abrocitinib. The results from this analysis were similar to those of previous safety analyses with abrocitinib, with no new side effects. Infections such as shingles, pneumonia, or herpes simplex can occur during treatment with abrocitinib. Shingles was more likely to occur in people who previously had shingles before taking abrocitinib, or who took the higher dose of abrocitinib (200 mg), or were 65 years of age or older, or had certain blood test results, or lived in Asia. People who are 65 years of age or older and took abrocitinib were more likely to develop some types of cancer, have certain abnormal blood test results, or develop blood clots in the veins than people with AD who were younger and took abrocitinib. Current or former smokers with AD who took abrocitinib were more likely to develop skin cancer (but not melanoma) than people with AD who took abrocitinib but have never smoked. This analysis further shows that abrocitinib had manageable safety in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by increased itch, skin pain, poor sleep quality, and other symptoms that negatively affect patient quality of life. Upadacitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 than JAK2, JAK3, or tyrosine kinase 2, is approved to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effect of upadacitinib on patient-reported outcomes over 52 weeks in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. METHODS: Data from two phase III monotherapy trials of upadacitinib (Measure Up 1, NCT03569293; Measure Up 2, NCT03607422) were integrated. Changes in pruritus, pain, other skin symptoms, sleep, quality of life, mental health, and patient impression were evaluated. Patient-reported outcome assessments included the Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Dermatology Life Quality Index, Atopic Dermatitis Symptom Scale, Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index, Patient Global Impression of Severity, Patient Global Impression of Change, and Patient Global Impression of Treatment. Minimal clinically important differences, achievement of scores representing minimal disease burden, and the change from baseline were evaluated in patients who received upadacitinib through week 52 and in patients who received placebo through week 16. RESULTS: This analysis included 1609 patients (upadacitinib 15 mg, N = 557; upadacitinib 30 mg, N = 567; placebo, N = 485). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally similar across all arms. The proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib reporting improvements in itch increased rapidly by week 1, increased steadily through week 8, and was sustained through week 52. Patients receiving upadacitinib also experienced improvements in pain and other skin symptoms by week 1, which continued through week 16; improvements were maintained through week 52. Patient reports of improved sleep increased rapidly from baseline to week 1, increased steadily through week 32, and were sustained through week 52. Patients experienced quality-of-life improvements through week 8, which were maintained through week 52. By week 1, patients in both upadacitinib groups experienced rapid improvements in emotional state, and by week 12, patients also achieved meaningful improvements in anxiety and depression. Improvements in mental health continued steadily through week 32 and were maintained through week 52. Patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg generally experienced improvements in patient-reported outcomes earlier than those treated with upadacitinib 15 mg. Through week 16, patients receiving upadacitinib experienced greater improvements versus those receiving placebo in all assessed patient-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis treated with once-daily upadacitinib 15 or 30 mg experienced early improvements in itch, pain, other skin symptoms, sleep, quality of life, and mental health that were sustained through week 52.

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a T helper 2-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Patients with AD are prone to recurrent infections of the skin and other organs, which can severely worsen the disease course. This review summarises the current evidence on the aetiology, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of infections in patients with AD. PubMed was searched for English-language research articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and guidelines published until February 2023 using the key term \"atopic dermatitis\" and terms relevant to infections. Patients with AD have an increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal infections of the skin, mainly due to impaired barrier function, altered immune response and frequent scratching. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus, which can cause impetigo, folliculitis, abscesses, eczema herpeticum and other complications. They also appear to increase susceptibility to systemic infections, including respiratory and urinary tract infections and sepsis. Certain systemic treatments for AD, such as mycophenolate mofetil and Janus kinase inhibitors, increase the risk of viral infections. Prevention and treatment of recurrent infections in patients with AD require a multifaceted approach that includes topical and systemic antimicrobials, skin care and effective control of AD symptoms (to break the itch–scratch cycle). Preventing and limiting the development of infections are important considerations in choosing an AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "There is a need for long-term atopic dermatitis (AD) treatments that can effectively improve AD involvement of the head and neck (H&N) region (referred to as H&N AD). Tralokinumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin-13, is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Recent real-world studies have observed the effectiveness of tralokinumab for H&N AD. Here, data from phase III parent trials, ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, and the long-term extension trial, ECZTEND, were used to assess impacts of long-term tralokinumab treatment on H&N AD and the association between improvements in H&N AD and patient quality of life, and to evaluate whether a proportion of patients developed paradoxical H&N erythema. These post hoc analyses included data from all patients initiated on tralokinumab in ECZTRA 1 or ECZTRA 2. Patients were treated up to 4 years (i.e., up to 52 weeks in ECZTRA 1 or ECZTRA 2 plus up to 152 weeks in ECZTEND). Outcomes included body region subscores of the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI; H&N, upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Correlations between H&N EASI and DLQI were assessed with Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ). The incidence of paradoxical H&N erythema (defined as H&N EASI erythema increasing from baseline to a score of 3, while all other regional EASI subscores are 0 or 1, during two or more consecutive visits) was also assessed. Overall, 1192 patients who were initiated on tralokinumab in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, of whom 523 patients opted to continue in ECZTEND, were analyzed. Percentages of patients who had H&N EASI ≤ 1 increased from 12.2% at parent trial baseline to 87.2% by week 152 of ECZTEND. Improvements in EASI subscore outcomes from parent trial baseline were comparable across body regions throughout all timepoints of the study. At parent trial week 16, H&N EASI was moderately correlated with total DLQI (ρ = 0.47), with the strongest numerical correlations observed for DLQI questions regarding skin discomfort (ρ = 0.43) and embarrassment due to skin (ρ = 0.40). During up to 4 years of treatment, seven tralokinumab-treated patients exhibited paradoxical H&N erythema, five of whom improved to absent or mild H&N EASI erythema with continued tralokinumab treatment. Tralokinumab provided progressive and sustained improvements in H&N AD, with H&N EASI 0/1 observed in nearly 90% of patients treated up to 4 years. Improvements in H&N EASI were similar to improvements observed for other body regions and were associated with improvements in patient quality of life, particularly for skin discomfort and self-consciousness/embarrassment due to skin.

NCT03160885 (ECZTRA 2); study start date: 12 June, 2017; primary completion date: 4 September, 2019; study completion date: 14 August, 2019. NCT03587805 (ECZTEND); study start date: 18 March, 2018; data cut-off date: 30 April, 2022; primary completion date: 3 July, 2024; study completion date: 3 July, 2024. Tralokinumab is an injectable treatment for atopic dermatitis capable of providing long-term disease control in the head and neck region. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease that can affect multiple body areas. Atopic dermatitis occurring in the head and neck region (referred to as H&N AD) can be especially burdensome owing in part to its high visibility. Additionally, H&N AD is challenging to treat and may show a lower clinical response to AD treatments than other body areas. Therefore, there is an increased demand for treatments that provide complete/almost complete skin clearance, especially around the face. Tralokinumab is an injectable medication approved for treating moderate-to-severe AD. It has been shown to improve H&N AD in real-world clinical settings. Here, data from phase III parent trials (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) and the long-term extension trial (ECZTEND), funded by LEO Pharma A/S, were used to examine the impact of long-term tralokinumab treatment on H&N AD in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were treated up to 4 years. We found that the severity of H&N AD, including facial redness (i.e., erythema), improved in patients treated with tralokinumab up to 4 years. These improvements in H&N AD were similar to improvements in other body regions and were associated with improvements in patient quality of life, particularly for skin discomfort and self-consciousness/embarrassment due to skin. Worsening or new facial redness has been sometimes observed with certain AD treatments. Very few tralokinumab-treated patients showed increased redness specific to the H&N region compared with other body sites. Most of these cases resolved with continued treatment. Overall, these findings show that tralokinumab effectively treats H&N AD.",

Presence, severity, and therapeutic response of AD are traditionally reported through clinical assessments including the Eczema Area and Severity Index or Investigator's Global Assessment. These clinical rating scales are visual assessments used in clinical trials to denotate AD severity. Alternatively, biomarkers open the potential to further enhance diagnosis of AD, assess disease status and severity, and potentially enable tailored treatment options for patients. Biomarkers can be classified according to their clinical use, clinical presentation, and underlying/endogenous molecular mechanisms. Specifically, interleukin (IL)-13, which has been shown to be a key biomarker in AD pathogenesis, can be used for prediction of AD development and to monitor clinical severity/response to treatment. Treatment with tralokinumab, a human monoclonal antibody that binds directly to—and subsequently blocks signaling of—IL-13, has been shown to reduce inflammation, re-balance the skin microbiome, and improve the skin barrier in patients with AD. In this review, key AD-related biomarkers, the role of IL-13 in driving AD pathogenesis, and the impact of IL-13 inhibition by tralokinumab on other AD-related biomarkers are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune bullous diseases are a group of chronic inflammatory disorders caused by autoantibodies targeted against structural proteins of the desmosomal and hemidesmosomal plaques in the skin and mucosa, leading to intra-epithelial or subepithelial blistering. The oral mucosa is frequently affected in these diseases, in particular, in mucous membrane pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and paraneoplastic pemphigus. The clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and may present with erythema, blisters, erosions, and ulcers localized anywhere on the oral mucosa, and lead to severe complaints for the patients including pain, dysphagia, and foetor. Therefore, a quick and proper diagnosis with adequate treatment is needed. Clinical presentations of autoimmune bullous diseases often overlap and diagnosis cannot be made based on clinical features alone. Immunodiagnostic tests are of great importance in differentiating between the different diseases. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy shows depositions of autoantibodies along the epithelial basement membrane zone in mucous membrane pemphigoid subtypes, or depositions on the epithelial cell surface in pemphigus variants. Additional immunoserological tests are useful to discriminate between the different subtypes of pemphigoid, and are essential to differentiate between pemphigus and paraneoplastic pemphigus. This review gives an overview of the clinical characteristics of oral lesions and the diagnostic procedures in autoimmune blistering diseases, and provides a diagnostic algorithm for daily practice.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory condition with substantial burden and limited treatment options for adolescents with moderate-to-severe disease. Significantly more patients treated with dupilumab vs. placebo achieved Investigator's Global Assessment 0/1 at week 16.The objective of this study was to assess the impact of dupilumab treatment vs. placebo on the achievement of clinically meaningful improvements in atopic dermatitis signs, symptoms and quality of life.R668-AD-1526 LIBERTY AD ADOL was a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, phase III clinical trial. Two hundred and fifty-one adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis received dupilumab 300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w; n = 84), dupilumab 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w; n = 82), or placebo (n = 85). A post-hoc subgroup analysis was performed on 214 patients with Investigator's Global Assessment > 1 at week 16. Measures of atopic dermatitis signs, symptoms, and quality of life were assessed. Clinically meaningful improvement in one or more of three domains of signs, symptoms, and quality of life was defined as an improvement of ≥ 50% in Eczema Area and Severity Index, ≥ 3 points in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale, or ≥ 6 points in the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index from baseline.Of patients receiving dupilumab q2w, 80.5% [66/82] experienced clinically meaningful improvements in atopic dermatitis signs, symptoms, or quality of life at week 16 (vs. placebo, 20/85 [23.5%], difference 57.0% [95% confidence interval 44.5-69.4]; q4w vs. placebo, 53/84 [63.1%], difference 39.6% [95% confidence interval 25.9-53.3]; both p < 0.0001). Results were similar in adolescents with Investigator's Global Assessment > 1 at week 16 (q2w, 46/62 [74.2%] vs. placebo, 18/83 [21.7%], difference 52.5% [95% confidence interval 38.5-66.6]; q4w, 38/69 [55.1%] vs. placebo, difference 33.4% [95% confidence interval 18.7-48.1]; both p < 0.0001).Dupilumab provided clinically meaningful improvements in signs, symptoms, and quality of life in adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis among patients with Investigator's Global Assessment > 1 at week 16. Treatment responses should be interpreted in the context of such clinically relevant patient-reported outcome measures.ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT03054428.

This review provides an overview of the major alterations occurring in the skin microbiome (microbial and genomic components) during the various stages of life, beginning with its establishment in the first weeks of life through to what is known about the microbiome in older populations. Studies that have helped identify the factors that most influence skin microbiome function, structure, and composition during the various life stages are highlighted, and how alterations affecting the delicate balance of the microbiota communities may contribute to variations in normal physiology and lead to skin disease is discussed. This review underlines the importance of improving our understanding of the skin microbiome in populations of all ages to gain insights into the pathophysiology of skin diseases and to allow better monitoring and targeted treatment of more vulnerable populations.",

Women accounted for the majority of sufferers (68.3 %) and had a greater burden of illness than men. Patients had relatively few comorbidities (mean 3.3, standard deviation 2.2). Primary care physicians and allergists were the most common providers of CIU/CSU-related care. Oral corticosteroids were the most commonly prescribed medication, used in 54.7 % of patients. Patients accumulated a mean of 15.1 office visits per year (standard deviation 12.6). The mean all-cause healthcare cost totaled over US$9000 per year.Although the disease affects a relatively young population, CIU/CSU carries a substantial cost. Frequent oral corticosteroid use in CIU/CSU patients is a concern because of adverse events associated with the drug.",

    "abstract": "The Urticaria Activity Score summed over 7 days (UAS7) assesses the itch severity and hive count in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) using once- or twice-daily diary-based documentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparability of twice-daily versus once-daily versions of the UAS and the resulting UAS7 values. Data came from the ASSURE-CSU study. The twice-daily and once-daily UAS7 was calculated from morning and evening ratings, as well as from exact 24-h evening ratings of hive count and itch severity, respectively. Three UAS7 scores were computed: UAS7 twice daily (UAS7TD), UAS7 once daily for maximum itch (UAS7OD1MAX), and UAS7 once daily for average itch (UAS7OD2AVG). UAS7 values were assigned to five score bands (0, 1–6, 7–15, 16–27, 28–42), reflecting urticaria-free to severe disease activity. The score values and score band ratios of the UAS7TD and UAS7OD versions were compared and assessed for correlation by weighted Cohen's kappa statistics. Data from 614 patients were analyzed. All three versions of the UAS7 yielded very similar results, with a mean (standard deviation) UAS7TD, UAS7OD1MAX, and UAS7OD2AVG of 17.3 (10.49), 17.7 (8.90), and 16.2 (8.68), respectively. Correlation coefficients between UAS7TD and UAS7OD1MAX, UAS7TD and UAS7OD2AVG, and UAS7OD1MAX and UAS7OD2AVG were 0.94, 0.95, and 0.99, respectively, showing very high positive pairwise correlation. The weighted kappa coefficient, κ (95% confidence interval) was 0.78 (0.75–0.82) for UAS7TD versus UAS7OD1MAX, and 0.82 (0.78–0.85) for UAS7TD versus UAS7OD2AVG, demonstrating substantial agreement. The once- and twice-daily UAS7 scores were highly consistent, supporting the use of either version when evaluating CSU activity.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a clinical syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity. COVID-19 has become a public health emergency of relevant international concern, and it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe cases involves the host response as an important contributor to the disease process and tissue damage, mainly due to dysregulated and excessive innate immune responses. The primary immune response leads to viral clearance in the majority of cases. However, in a subgroup of patients, the secondary immune response may be exaggerated, leading to inflammatory-induced lung injury and other complications including pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and potentially death. Several cutaneous immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa, are therapeutically managed with biologic and non-biologic immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs. The outbreak of COVID-19 affects the management of these chronic conditions, not only for those who are already receiving treatment but also for those who are about to start a new treatment to control their disease. In this article, the management of cutaneous immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed.",

Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of adapalene 0.3%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel (A0.3/BPO2.5) in atrophic acne scar formation in patients with acne. In this multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded, vehicle-controlled study, subjects with moderate or severe facial acne (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score 3 or 4; ≥ 25 inflammatory lesions; ten or more atrophic acne scars) applied A0.3/BPO2.5 or vehicle daily per half face for 24 weeks. Subjects with acne requiring systemic treatment were excluded. Assessments included investigator atrophic acne scar count, Scar Global Assessment (SGA), acne lesion count, IGA, skin roughness and skin texture, subject self-assessment of clinical acne-related scars and satisfaction questionnaire, tolerability, and safety. Included subjects (n = 67) had mainly moderate acne (92.5% IGA 3); mean scores at baseline were approximately 40 acne lesions and 12 scars per half face. By week 24, the change from baseline in total scar count was − 15.5% for A0.3/BPO2.5 versus + 14.4% for vehicle (approximately 30% difference), with a mean of 9.5 scars versus 13.3 per half face, respectively (p < 0.0001). For SGA at week 24, a total of 32.9% with A0.3/BPO2.5 versus 16.4% with vehicle (p < 0.01) were clear/almost clear. Inflammatory acne lesions decreased by 86.7% for A0.3/BPO2.5 versus 57.9% for vehicle (p < 0.0001), and 64.2 versus 19.4% of subjects, respectively, were IGA clear/almost clear (p < 0.0001) at week 24. Treatment-related AEs were reported by 20.9% for A0.3/BPO2.5 versus 9% for vehicle side, most commonly skin irritation (14.9 vs. 6%, respectively). Topical A0.3/BPO2.5 prevented and reduced atrophic scar formation. Scar count increased with vehicle (+ 14.4%) but decreased with A0.3/BPO2.5 (− 15.5%) over 24 weeks.

    "abstract": "Pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) involves the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. A cream formulation of ruxolitinib, a potent selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, was developed for topical delivery. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from three double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in patients with AD: a phase II study with ruxolitinib cream 0.15%, 0.5%, or 1.5% once daily or 1.5% twice daily (BID), and two phase III studies with 0.75% or 1.5% BID. Effects of baseline characteristics on pharmacokinetics were examined. Correlations were attempted between plasma concentrations and change in hematological parameters over time. Ruxolitinib plasma concentrations at steady-state (Css) increased with cream strength in a less-than-dose-proportional manner. In the phase III studies, overall mean (standard deviation [SD]) Css after ruxolitinib cream 0.75% and 1.5% BID (23.8 [35.0] and 35.7 [55.0] nM) were a fraction of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration for thrombopoietin-stimulated phosphorylated STAT3 inhibition (281 nM), a JAK/STAT signaling marker. Three covariates were identified for Css: dose, percent body surface area (%BSA) treated, and baseline Investigator's Global Assessment score. Mean (SD) bioavailability of ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID was 6.22% (7.66%). There were no correlations between Css and any hematological changes except for a transient increase in platelets at week 2. Plasma ruxolitinib concentrations after treatment with topical ruxolitinib cream in patients with up to 20% BSA affected by AD are not expected to lead to systemic plasma concentrations that may be associated with adverse effects commonly associated with oral JAK inhibitors.

    "abstract": "Ten percent of all women have pigmented vulvar lesions. Fortunately, most of these are benign but 1% of all melanomas in women affect the vulva. While the mortality rate of cutaneous melanoma has dropped by 7% annually during the last 5 years, the prognosis of vulvar melanoma remains dismal: the 5-year overall survival rate is 47% compared with 92% for cutaneous melanoma. The current evidence suggests that this likely results from a combination of delayed diagnosis and different tumor biology, treatment strategies, and treatment response. Although many landmark trials on checkpoint inhibitors included mucosal and vulvar melanomas, the results were often not reported separately. Post-hoc analyses indicate overall response rates between 19 and 37% for checkpoint inhibitors. A recently published retrospective study on vulvar melanomas suggests an objective response in 33.3% with a similar safety profile to cutaneous melanoma. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be considered in recurrent disease if a c-KIT mutation is present.",

We especially consider the reception of TD in underserved communities and the developing world as well as the ethico-legal challenges wrought by the burgeoning utilization of this new paradigm of care. The potential of TD to occupy a more prominent role in dermatologic care in a post-COVID-19 world is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Acne affects more than 80% of adolescents and young adults, who most often develop acne scars. Supporting data on the effect of acne scars on patient's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are limited. The aim was to determine how the severity of acne scars impacts the HRQOL of afflicted individuals. In this population-based cross-sectional study, 723 adults with facial acne scars but without active acne lesions self-completed the Self-assessment of Clinical Acne-Related Scars (SCARS) questionnaire formulated to investigate degree of acne scarring. The Facial Acne Scar Quality of Life (FASQoL), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) were completed to assess the attitude of these patients toward their scars and the impact of scarring on their HRQOL. The mean (standard error) DLQI score for facial acne scars was 6.26 (0.22). Acne scars were considered a 'very large' or 'extremely large' concern by 19.3% of participants with mild scars as compared to 20.1% and 34.0% of participants with moderate and severe/very severe scars, respectively (P = 0.003). Higher FASQoL scores were associated with increased severity of scarring (P = 0.001). In total, 16.9% of participants had clinical features of dysmorphia (i.e., DCQ > 13). DCQ scores were significantly higher among participants with more severe scarring (mean DCQ score of 8.04 [0.28], 8.40 [0.18], and 10.13 [0.08] among participants with mild, moderate, and severe/very severe acne scars, respectively; P = 0.001). Most commonly reported signs of emotional distress were self-consciousness (68.0%) and worry about scars not going away (74.8%). This study highlights the significant psychosocial impact of atrophic acne scars in the form of embarrassment and self-consciousness. Individuals with mild scars also expressed significant impact on quality of life that increased with aggravation of scar severity. Patient-reported outcomes provide an insight into the physical, functional, and psychological impact of acne scarring from the patient's perspective.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of tralokinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes interleukin-13, plus topical corticosteroids (TCS) as needed were evaluated over 32 weeks in the phase III ECZTRA 3 trial. Significantly more tralokinumab- versus placebo-treated patients achieved the primary endpoints of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) and all confirmatory endpoints at Week 16. This post hoc analysis investigated the impact of tralokinumab plus TCS on atopic dermatitis (AD) severity, symptoms, and health-related quality of life (QoL) over the entire 32-week treatment period of ECZTRA 3, including all patients initiated on tralokinumab irrespective of the response achieved at Week 16. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks (q2w) with TCS as needed for an initial 16 weeks. At Week 16, patients who achieved the clinical response criteria (IGA 0/1 and/or EASI-75) with tralokinumab were re-randomized 1:1 to tralokinumab q2w or every 4 weeks (q4w), with TCS as needed, for another 16 weeks. Patients not achieving the clinical response criteria with tralokinumab received tralokinumab q2w plus TCS from Week 16. All patients randomized to tralokinumab in the initial treatment period were pooled for this analysis, irrespective of response at Week 16 or dosing regimen beyond Week 16. Continued tralokinumab (q2w, N = 164; q4w, N = 69) plus TCS treatment provided progressive improvements from Week 16 onwards in AD signs, with 70.2% (177/252) of patients achieving EASI-75 and 50.4% (127/252) achieving EASI-90 at Week 32. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes were observed within the first few weeks of tralokinumab q2w plus TCS treatment and were sustained throughout the 32-week period. At Week 32, patients initiated on tralokinumab q2w plus TCS achieved a relative improvement versus baseline of 70.8% (standard error (SE), 2.4) in eczema-related sleep interference numeric rating scale (NRS) and 66.8% (SE, 3.1) in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Mean TCS use during Weeks 16–32 ranged from 9.2 to 13.6 g (SE, 1.2–2.0) q2w. Most patients (89.9% (222/247)) initiated on tralokinumab q2w plus TCS achieved a meaningful improvement in at least one of the three disease domains, including AD signs (EASI-50), symptoms (pruritus NRS improvement ≥ 3), and QoL (DLQI improvement ≥ 4) at Week 16. Of patients initiated on tralokinumab q2w plus TCS, 53.4% (132/247) achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in all three domains at Week 16 (vs. placebo, 28.5% (35/123); p < 0.001). Continued tralokinumab treatment plus TCS as needed provides progressive and sustained improvements in AD signs, symptoms, and health-related QoL over 32 weeks. NCT03363854; study start date: 22 February 2018; primary completion date: 8 March 2019; study completion date: 26 September 2019. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes excessively dry and itchy skin that can negatively impact sleep and overall quality of life for patients. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the most common medication used for AD, but they are not able to control the most severe cases. Tralokinumab is a treatment injected under the skin that targets an immune messenger protein called interleukin 13, which plays a key role in driving the signs and symptoms of AD. The ECZTRA 3 clinical trial, funded by LEO Pharma, compared the use of TCS as needed with either tralokinumab or placebo in over 350 adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD over a 32-week period. After 16 weeks, more patients taking tralokinumab plus TCS had clear or almost clear skin compared with patients taking placebo plus TCS. Patients taking tralokinumab also used less TCS than patients taking placebo. In new analyses presented here, we found that the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin continued to increase with on-going treatment from Week 16 to Week 32. Tralokinumab plus TCS treatment also led to clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes important to patients, including itch, sleep, and quality of life. Improvements occurred early, within the first few weeks of therapy, and lasted through Week 32. Our assessment of multiple outcomes over time clearly demonstrates the positive impact of tralokinumab on different aspects of AD.",

    "abstract": "Actinic keratosis (AK) is a chronic skin disease in which clinical and subclinical cutaneous lesions coexist on sun-exposed areas such as the head and neck region and the extremities. The high prevalence of AK means the disease burden is substantial, especially in middle-aged and elderly populations. Evidence indicates that AK may progress into invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, so the European guidelines recommend treatment of any AK regardless of clinical severity. Given the aging population and therefore the increasing incidence of AK and cutaneous field carcinogenesis, further updates on the long-term efficacy of current therapies and new investigational agents are critical to guide treatment choice. Patients often have difficulty adequately applying topical treatments and coping with adverse local skin reactions, leading to less than optimum treatment adherence. The development of associated local skin symptoms and cosmetic outcomes for the area of interest are also relevant to the choice of an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Treatment is always individually tailored according to the characteristics of both patients and lesions. This review focuses on the therapeutic approaches to AK and illustrates the currently available home-based and physician-managed treatments.",

Therefore, a reliable assessment of the patient with leukonychia is essential. In the past, two classifications for leukonychia have been presented. The morphological classifies the nail according to the distribution of the white lines: total, partial, transversal, and longitudinal leukonychia. Mees' and Muehrcke's lines are examples of transversal leukonychia, while Terry's and Lindsay's nails are examples of total and partial leukonychia. The anatomical classifies according to the structure responsible for the white color: the nail plate in true leukonychia, the nail bed in apparent leukonychia, and the surface only in pseudoleukonychia. In this review, both morphological and anatomical features have been combined in an algorithm that enables clinicians to approach leukonychia efficiently and effectively.",

We aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, and bioavailability of 1.5% ruxolitinib cream under maximum-use conditions in patients with atopic dermatitis. Efficacy was evaluated as an exploratory objective. Eligible patients aged ≥ 12–65 years with atopic dermatitis, an Investigator's Global Assessment score ≥ 2, and ≥ 25% affected body surface area were enrolled in an open-label, maximum-use phase I study conducted in the USA and Canada. Patients applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily to lesions identified at baseline for the first 28 days and continued use only on active lesions for an additional 28 days (extension period). Safety was assessed by frequency, duration, and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. Plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib and pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed as secondary endpoints. Overall, 41 patients (median age, 17 years; 51% male) were enrolled and 37 (90.2%) entered the extension period, all of whom completed the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 13 patients (31.7%). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in four patients (9.8%). The mean (standard deviation) steady-state plasma concentration was 104 (309) nM during the first 28 days, well below the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Janus kinase-mediated myelosuppression in the bone marrow (281 nM), and decreased further during the extension period. Higher plasma concentrations were detected in a few patients who were treated for a very high affected body surface area. At day 56, 94.6% of patients achieved ≥ 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index. Under maximum-use conditions, ruxolitinib cream was generally well tolerated, with approximately one-third of patients experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events and few treatment-related adverse events. The mean steady-state plasma concentration of ruxolitinib was well below the level expected to affect bone marrow production of blood cells, with a small number of patients exhibiting higher plasma concentrations. In addition, ruxolitinib cream showed a high level of efficacy in patients with atopic dermatitis involving ≥ 25% affected body surface area. NCT03920852.",

    "abstract": "Topical treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) used reactively often fail to achieve lasting disease control; many of these therapies are associated with safety concerns that limit long-term use. Crisaborole ointment, 2%, is a nonsteroidal phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD that has potential as a long-term maintenance therapy.The aim was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of crisaborole once daily (QD) compared to vehicle QD as a maintenance therapy to reduce the incidence of flares in patients with AD who previously responded to crisaborole twice daily (BID).CrisADe CONTROL was a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 52-week, phase III study of patients aged ≥ 3 months with mild-to-moderate AD involving ≥ 5% treatable body surface area. Eligible patients received crisaborole BID during an open-label run-in period of up to 8 weeks. Responders were randomly assigned in the double-blind maintenance period to receive either crisaborole QD or vehicle QD. Responders were defined as patients who achieved Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) success (ISGA score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] with a ≥ 2-grade improvement) and ≥ 50% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index total score (EASI-50) from baseline. Patients who experienced a flare (ISGA score ≥ 2) during the double-blind maintenance period switched to crisaborole BID for up to 12 weeks. During this period, patients were assessed every 4 weeks; if the flare resolved (ISGA score ≤ 1), patients resumed their assigned treatment. The primary endpoint was flare-free maintenance until onset of the first flare. Key secondary endpoints were number of flare-free days, number of flares, and maintenance of pruritus response until onset of the first flare. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was also analyzed.Overall, 497 patients entered the open-label run-in period with crisaborole BID, of which 270 patients were randomized into the 52-week double-blind maintenance period of the study. Of the 270 patients, 135 were randomly assigned to the crisaborole QD group and 135 were randomly assigned to the vehicle QD group. Median time of flare-free maintenance was longer for patients who received crisaborole versus vehicle (111 vs 30 days, respectively; p = 0.0034). The mean number of flare-free days was higher for patients who received crisaborole versus vehicle (234.0 vs 199.4 days, respectively; p = 0.0346). The mean number of flares was lower for patients who received crisaborole versus vehicle (0.95 vs 1.36, respectively; p = 0.0042). No clear trend was observed in maintenance of pruritus response between crisaborole- and vehicle-treated patients. Crisaborole was well tolerated, with no new or unexpected safety findings when used as maintenance treatment.Crisaborole QD was effective and well tolerated for long-term maintenance treatment and flare reduction in adult and pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate AD.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04040192, 31 July 2019.Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an immuno-inflammatory skin disease that can last a long time. It causes skin lesions and intense itching. Topical AD treatments used reactively often fail to control the disease over a long period of time. Many are associated with safety concerns that limit long-term use. Crisaborole ointment is a nonsteroidal treatment for the skin and is used to treat mild-to-moderate AD. Previous studies showed that using crisaborole twice daily was effective and had few side effects in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. This study evaluated how effective and safe long-term treatment with once-daily crisaborole was compared with an ointment with no drug (vehicle). The study included patients aged ≥ 3 months with mild-to-moderate AD whose AD improved after previous treatment with twice-daily crisaborole. This study was designed to investigate how much crisaborole reduced the incidence of AD flares over 52 weeks in these patients.The study included 270 patients whose AD had improved after treatment with twice-daily crisaborole. Of these patients, 135 were randomly assigned to receive crisaborole once a day and 135 to receive vehicle once a day. Patients who received crisaborole had a significantly longer time before experiencing AD flares than those who received vehicle. Crisaborole was well tolerated, and no new or unexpected side effects were found when used as a once-daily maintenance treatment for 52 weeks. These results indicate that once-daily treatment with crisaborole could be a potential long-term maintenance treatment option in children and adults with mild-to-moderate AD.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, heterogeneous, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by chronic or relapsing eczematous lesions with intense pruritus and discomfort. Affected patients often experience significant impairment in their quality of life, and the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD forms remains challenging. In the past few decades, increasing knowledge on the AD pathogenesis has driven the development of novel targeted therapies. Interleukin (IL)-13 plays a central and pleiotropic role in AD pathogenesis, contributing directly or indirectly to epidermal barrier disfunction, type-2 inflammation, dysbiosis, fibrosis, and itch response. For this reason, agents selectively targeting IL-13, such as lebrikizumab, emerged as a potential therapy for AD. This article reviews the current evidence about lebrikizumab in the management of AD. The phase II and phase III trials seem to corroborate efficacy of lebrikizumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, as shown by significant improvement of Eczema Area and Severity Index, body surface area, and pruritus scores. Also, lebrikizumab demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability profiles, with the majority of patients experiencing no significant adverse events. Lebrikizumab seems to be a promising emerging targeted biological agent for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. More data on the long-term efficacy and safety, head-to-head comparisons with other agents, and real-world evidence will help to clarify its place in therapy in AD.",

    "abstract": "Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a common autoimmune bullous disease affecting mainly the elderly, with rising incidence due to increased life expectancy. This disease is characterized by tense bullous lesions on normal or erythematous skin, accompanied by pruritus. BP pathogenesis involves autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230, leading to detachment at the dermo-epidermal junction as well as blister formation. BP is associated with coexisting comorbidities and drug exposure, and its management often requires high doses or chronic use of systemic glucocorticoids, posing risks of adverse effects. This review focuses on novel treatment options for BP, exploring therapies targeting different immune pathways. Rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, depletes B-lymphocytes and has shown efficacy in severe cases. Dupilumab, targeting interleukin (IL)-4 receptor α and thus blocking IL-4 and IL-13, downregulates type 2 helper (Th2) responses and has demonstrated promising results. Targeting eosinophil-related molecules using bertilimumab and AKST4290 has yielded positive results in clinical trials. Omalizumab, an immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibody, can reduce disease severity and allows corticosteroid tapering in a number of cases. Complement inhibitors such as nomacopan and avdoralimab are being investigated. IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors such as secukinumab and tildrakizumab have shown potential in a limited number of case reports. Neonatal Fc receptor antagonists such as efgartigimod are under investigation. Additionally, topical therapies and Janus kinase inhibitors are being explored as potential treatments for BP. These novel therapies offer promising alternatives for managing BP, with potential to improve outcomes and reduce high cumulative doses of systemic corticosteroids and related toxicities. Further research, including controlled clinical trials, is needed to establish their efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing regimens for BP management.",

    "abstract": "Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), a refractory skin disease characterized by repeated eruptions of sterile pustules and vesicles on palms and/or soles, involves interleukin-17 pathway activation. Brodalumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody, is being investigated for use in PPP treatment. The aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of brodalumab in Japanese PPP patients with moderate or severe pustules/vesicles. A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between July 2019 and August 2022, at 41 centers in Japan. Patients aged 18–70 years with a diagnosis of PPP for ≥ 24 weeks, a PPP Area Severity Index (PPPASI) score of ≥ 12, a PPPASI subscore of pustules/vesicles of ≥ 2, and inadequate response to therapy were included. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive brodalumab 210 mg or placebo, subcutaneously (SC) at baseline, weeks 1 and 2, and every 2 weeks (Q2W) thereafter until week 16. Changes from baseline to week 16 in the PPPASI total score (primary endpoint) and other secondary skin-related endpoints and safety endpoints were assessed. Of the 126 randomized patients, 50 of 63 in the brodalumab group and 62 of 63 in the placebo group completed the 16-week period. Reasons for discontinuation were adverse event (n = 6), withdrawal by patient/parent/guardian (n = 3), progressive disease (n = 3), and lost to follow-up (n = 1) in the brodalumab group and Good Clinical Practice deviation (n = 1) in the placebo group. Change from baseline in the PPPASI total score at week 16 was significantly higher (p = 0.0049) with brodalumab (least-squares mean [95% confidence interval {CI}] 13.73 [10.91–16.56]) versus placebo (8.45 [5.76–11.13]; difference [95% CI] 5.29 [1.64–8.94]). At week 16, brodalumab showed a trend of rapid improvement versus placebo for PPPASI-50/75/90 response (≥ 50%/75%/90% improvement from baseline) and Physician's Global Assessment 0/1 score: 54% versus 24.2%, 36.0% versus 8.1%, 16.0% versus 0.0%, and 32.0% versus 9.7%, respectively. Infection was the dominant treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE); the commonly reported TEAEs were otitis externa (25.4%/1.6%), folliculitis (15.9%/3.2%), nasopharyngitis (14.3%/4.8%), and eczema (14.3%/12.9%) in the brodalumab/placebo groups, respectively. The severity of most TEAEs reported was Grade 1 or 2 and less frequently Grade ≥ 3. Brodalumab SC 210 mg Q2W demonstrated efficacy in Japanese PPP patients. The most common TEAEs were mild infectious events. NCT04061252 (Date of Trial Registration: August 19, 2019)",

    "abstract": "Ruxolitinib cream has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antipruritic activity and was well tolerated in a phase 3 study in patients aged 2–11 years with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). This study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and quality of life (QoL) with ruxolitinib cream under maximum-use conditions and with longer-term use. Eligible patients were aged 2–11 years with moderate to severe AD [Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score 3–4], and ≥ 35% affected body surface area (BSA). Patients applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily to all baseline-identified lesions during the 4-week maximum-use period, then to active lesions only up to week 52 (patients with ≤ 20% affected BSA from week 8). Safety was assessed by frequency and severity of adverse events. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed as secondary endpoints, and efficacy and QoL were exploratory endpoints. Overall, 29 patients (median age 5 years) were enrolled. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 9/29 patients (31.0%); there were no adverse events of special interest (i.e., no serious infections, malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events, or thromboses) during the study period. Mean steady-state plasma concentration during the maximum-use period was below the known half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Janus kinase–mediated myelosuppression in adults. Reductions in affected BSA and IGA observed at week 4 were sustained with as-needed use through 52 weeks. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes and QoL measures were consistent with efficacy results. These results support the safety of ruxolitinib cream in children (2–11 years) with AD, including those with extensive disease, and are consistent with previous efficacy findings. NCT05034822, first registered 30 August 2021. Ruxolitinib cream 1.5% is approved in the USA for patients aged ≥ 12 years for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) involving ≤ 20% of the body, with recent studies supporting the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream in younger children with mild to moderate AD. Maximum-use trials look at the safety of treatments applied to more extensive areas of skin, assessing potential for side effects. This maximum-use trial assessed safety, absorption, and effectiveness of 1.5% ruxolitinib cream when applied twice daily for 4 weeks in children aged 2–11 years with AD involving ≥ 35% of the body. Patients then applied ruxolitinib cream as needed for ≤ 52 weeks, and safety and disease control were assessed. During the first 4 weeks, 31% of patients reported side effects. Only one patient experienced treatment-related side effects at the application site. As-needed ruxolitinib cream did not cause any other side effects of concern. The average ruxolitinib blood level during the first 4 weeks was low. As expected with low ruxolitinib blood levels, no side effects associated with oral drugs of the same class (e.g., low levels of white blood cells, serious infections, cancers, major cardiovascular events, or blood clots) were seen. AD lesions decreased in size and there was relief of itching during the first 4 weeks of treatment, and the amount of ruxolitinib cream applied decreased thereafter. Disease control was maintained for ≤ 52 weeks with as-needed ruxolitinib cream. These findings help to confirm the safety and effectiveness of ruxolitinib cream in children.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that significantly impairs the quality of life. Recent advancements in systemic therapies, such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, offer very effective new treatment options. However, concerns regarding potential adverse events, including cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk, have emerged from clinical studies and call for further real-life investigations. This has highlighted the need to establish specific risk categories, such as tobacco smokers. This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of upadacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, in patients who smoke with moderate-to-severe AD over a 2-year treatment period, comparing outcomes with patients who do not smoke. A retrospective multicenter study was conducted across 12 dermatology departments in Italy, including 375 patients treated with upadacitinib. The presence and intensity of smoking habits as well as effectiveness scores and safety data were collected. Patients who smoke accounted for 36.8% of the sample. Two thromboembolic events in patients who do not smoke were recorded in the 2-year (median follow up of 52.6 weeks) observation period. The most common adverse event was acneiform eruption (12.4% of patients after 104 weeks). No significant differences related to safety emerged regarding the presence or absence of a smoking habit. Drug survival was very high with no differences between the two cohorts (83.5% after 104 weeks for patients who smoke). This study suggests that upadacitinib is a safe and effective treatment for moderate-to-severe AD in presence of tobacco smoke, with no significant differences in safety or effectiveness compared with patients who do not smoke.",

    "abstract": "Vulvovaginal itching is a common yet often under-recognized condition affecting women across all age groups. Despite its prevalence, many dermatologists receive minimal training in vulvar diseases, leading to delayed diagnoses and prolonged discomfort for patients. This review explores the broad spectrum of causes, including infections, inflammatory conditions, neuropathic disorders, and systemic illnesses. The complexity of vulvovaginal pruritus often requires a multidisciplinary approach to accurately diagnose and treat. Contributing factors such as hormonal changes, personal hygiene practices, and environmental exposures must also be considered. Treatment strategies typically begin with lifestyle modifications and topical therapies, such as corticosteroids and antifungals, but can extend to systemic medications and biologics for resistant cases. Additionally, nonpharmaceutical options such as sitz baths and psychological interventions can be crucial for managing chronic symptoms. However, there remains a significant gap in research, particularly regarding the characterization of female-specific pruritus and its long-term impact on quality of life. Despite some advances, the available studies largely focus on isolated causes rather than the holistic nature of the condition. Further research is urgently needed to develop comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing and treating vulvovaginal itching, a condition that has a profound effect on both physical and emotional well-being.",

An academic hospital-based cross-sectional study in The Netherlands. A numerical rating scale (NRS, 0–10) was used to determine the prevalence of HS-related itch (NRS score ≥3). Candidate predictors for pruritus were subsequently determined using logistic regression models, and the impact of pruritus was assessed using a modified five-dimensional (5-D) itch scale. Associated serological and histological markers of pruritus were (semi-)quantitatively investigated in a subpopulation. The prevalence rate of pruritus in 211 HS patients was 57.3%, with a mean NRS score of 6.1 ± 2.0. Patients with a pruritus NRS score ≥3 had more HS-affected body sites than patients with a score <3 (p < 0.001). The occurrence of a pruritus NRS score ≥3 was associated with Hurley III disease (odds ratio [OR] 7.73; p = 0.003) and pain (OR 1.34; p < 0.001). Pruritus affected sleep and activities of daily living (ADL) in the majority of cases, with an associated modified 5-D itch score of 13.7 ± 3.6 (on a scale from 5 to 25) in 52 HS patients. Histological examination showed eosinophilic granulocytes were present in 25% (2/8) of the perilesional skin and 63% (10/16) of the lesional skin, while a perineural infiltrate was found in 25% (2/8) and 69% (11/16) of the perilesional and lesional skin, respectively. Pruritus is a frequent but underreported symptom in patients with HS. Its moderate to severe intensity and significant impact on daily activities have great potential to impair patients' quality of life.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adapalene 0.3 %/benzoyl peroxide 2.5 % (0.3 % A/BPO) topical gel in subjects with moderate and severe inflammatory acne. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Randomization was stratified by acne severity (50 % moderate and 50 % severe). Subjects received 0.3 % A/BPO, 0.1 % A/BPO (benchmark), or vehicle (comparator) once daily for 12 weeks. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were success rate at week 12 (the percentage of subjects rated 'clear' or 'almost clear' with at least a 2-grade improvement on Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]) and change in inflammatory (IN) and noninflammatory (NIN) lesion counts from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints were percent changes in IN and NIN lesion counts. Safety endpoints were incidence of adverse events (AEs) and local tolerability signs/symptoms. A total of 503 subjects were randomized: 217, 217, and 69 subjects in the 0.3 % A/BPO, 0.1 % A/BPO, and vehicle groups, respectively. For success rate (subjects rated 'clear' or 'almost clear' with ≥2-grade improvement in IGA), 0.3 % A/BPO was superior to vehicle, with a treatment difference of 22.7 % (33.7 vs. 11.0 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 12.8–32.6, p < 0.001). At week 12, 0.3 % A/BPO was superior to vehicle for mean reduction from baseline in IN (27.0 vs. 14.4) and NIN lesion counts (40.2 vs. 18.5), as well as for percentage reduction from baseline in IN (68.7 vs. 39.2 %) and NIN lesion counts (68.3 vs. 37.4 %) (all p < 0.001). Among subjects with severe inflammatory acne (IGA = 4), 0.1 % A/BPO did not reach statistical significance for success rate compared with vehicle (p = 0.443), whereas 0.3 % A/BPO demonstrated significantly greater efficacy (p = 0.029, requiring ≥3-point IGA improvement). Additionally, 0.3 % A/BPO was safe and well-tolerated. Results of this clinical trial demonstrate the significantly greater efficacy of adapalene 0.3 % A/BPO topical gel compared with vehicle as well as a good safety profile in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory non-nodulocystic acne, which increases patients' treatment options.

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, which is associated with a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life. Traditional therapies for psoriasis are often not able to meet desired treatment goals, and high-dose and/or long-term use is associated with toxicities that can result in end-organ damage. An improved understanding of the involvement of cytokines in the etiology of psoriasis has led to the development of biologic agents targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukins (ILs)-12/23. While biologic agents have improved treatment outcomes, they are not effective in all individuals with psoriasis. The combination of biologic agents with traditional therapies may provide improved therapeutic options for patients who inadequately respond to a single drug or when efficacy may be increased with supplementation of another treatment. In addition, combination therapy may reduce safety concerns and cumulative toxicity, as lower doses of individual agents may be efficacious when used together. This article reviews the current evidence available on the efficacy and safety of combining biologic agents with systemic therapies (methotrexate, cyclosporine, or retinoids) or with phototherapy, and the combination of biologic agents themselves. Guidance is provided to help physicians identify situations and the characteristics of patients who would benefit from combination therapy with a biologic agent. Finally, the potential clinical impact of biologic therapies in development (e.g., those targeting IL-17A, IL-17RA, or IL-23 alone) is analyzed.",

Enthesitis and dactylitis, two hallmarks of PsA, are associated with radiographic peripheral/axial joint damage and severe disease. Clinical symptoms of enthesitis include tenderness, soreness, and pain at entheses on palpation, whereas dactylitis is recognized by swelling of an entire digit that is different from adjacent digits. Both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to diagnose enthesitis and dactylitis, especially in patients in whom symptoms may be difficult to discern. Delayed treatment of PsA can result in irreversible joint damage and reduced quality of life. Thus, it is recommended that dermatologists monitor patients with psoriasis for these two early and important manifestations of PsA.",

As a result of the development of these noninvasive techniques, diagnosis is now established earlier and with better accuracy. These advances are of great benefit to high-risk patients, who previously would have had to undergo several excisions. In this review, we focus on the classic technique of dermoscopy and the more recent digital version, as well as on advanced noninvasive imaging techniques, such as reflectance confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography. On the basis of their specific features, these noninvasive medical devices can be used not only to diagnose and monitor melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers but also to choose the best therapy and follow the patient's response to treatment in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Many of the molecular pathways associated with psoriasis pathogenesis are also involved in host defense mechanisms that protect against common pathogens. Candida can stimulate the production of cytokines that trigger or exacerbate psoriasis, and many systemic psoriasis treatments may put patients at increased risk for developing oral, cutaneous, and genitourinary candidiasis. Therefore, dermatologists should regularly screen patients with psoriasis for signs of Candida infection, and take steps to effectively treat these infections to prevent worsening of psoriasis symptoms. This review provides an overview of candidiasis epidemiology in patients with psoriasis, followed by a primer on the diagnosis and treatment of superficial Candida infections, with specific guidance for patients with psoriasis. Candidiasis in patients with psoriasis typically responds to topical or oral antifungal therapy. While biologic agents used to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis, such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and interleukin-17 inhibitors, are known to increase patients' risk of developing localized candidiasis, the overall risk of infection is low, and candidiasis can be effectively managed in most patients while receiving systemic psoriasis therapies. Thus, the development of candidiasis does not usually necessitate changes to psoriasis treatment regimens.",

Patients with eyebrow, eyelash and nail involvement were purposefully sampled. Interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed.Dermatologists (n = 10) described eyebrow and eyelash loss as concerning for affected patients and, along with nail appearance, as deserving assessment. Dermatologist data informed the development of single item, 4-point Likert-type ClinRO and PRO measures of current eyebrow loss, eyelash loss and nail appearance and a PRO measure of eye irritation. Patients (n = 45, age 15-72 years) confirmed the importance and relevance of these signs/symptoms. Interim revision resulted in measures that were understood by and relevant to patients. Dermatologists (n = 5) and patients (n = 10, age 21-54 years) participated in the development of the eyebrow, eyelash and nail photoguides and confirmed that they included photos that appropriately represented different severity levels and were helpful to derive and standardize ratings across raters.The ClinRO and PRO measures for eyebrow, eyelash and nail appearance, with their accompanying photoguides and the PRO Measure for Eye Irritation provide clear and meaningful assessments of outcomes important to patients with AA.",

    "abstract": "Conjunctivitis is a known comorbidity of atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab clinical trials for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults showed a higher conjunctivitis incidence for dupilumab-treated patients than placebo-treated patients, whereas trials for uncontrolled asthma reported lower rates for both dupilumab and placebo. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and severity of conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials in adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis or uncontrolled asthma. We evaluated the incidence of conjunctivitis in adolescents (aged 12 to < 18 years) in three phase III trials. Ocular events were diagnosed and treated based on patient-reported symptoms and an external eye examination by study investigators, in most cases without an ophthalmologic referral. In LIBERTY AD ADOL (16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial), adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were randomized to subcutaneous placebo, dupilumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, or dupilumab every 2 weeks (200 mg, patients < 60 kg at baseline; 300 mg, ≥ 60 kg at baseline). In LIBERTY AD PED-OLE (open-label extension), pediatric patients from previous dupilumab atopic dermatitis trials received dupilumab 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg weekly (up to 300 mg) or 300 mg every 4 weeks. In LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST (randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial), patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma were randomized to 52 weeks of add-on therapy with dupilumab 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched-volume placebo. In ADOL, more dupilumab-treated (17/165; 10.3%) than placebo-treated patients (4/85; 4.7%) reported one or more conjunctivitis event. All events were mild to moderate in severity; 12 (7.3%) dupilumab-treated and 4 (4.7%) placebo-treated patients received treatment. Most patients with conjunctivitis (dupilumab, 12/17; placebo, 4/4) recovered/resolved during the treatment period. The risk of conjunctivitis showed no relationship with dupilumab serum concentration. In PED-OLE, 12/275 adolescents (4.4%) reported one or more conjunctivitis event. Most conjunctivitis events were mild to moderate. Ten patients received treatment for conjunctivitis. Ten patients recovered/resolved during the study. In QUEST, similar low proportions of dupilumab-treated (2/68, 2.9%) and placebo-treated (1/39, 2.6%) adolescents reported one or more conjunctivitis event. All events were mild to moderate. One dupilumab-treated patient received treatment for conjunctivitis. All cases recovered/resolved during the study. No patients in these trials discontinued study treatment temporarily or permanently because of conjunctivitis. In ADOL, one case of unspecified viral keratitis (specific viral etiology not known) in the dupilumab 300-mg every 4 weeks group and one case of allergic blepharitis in the placebo group were reported; both events resolved during the treatment period, and neither led to treatment discontinuation. Dupilumab-treated adolescents in atopic dermatitis trials had a higher incidence of conjunctivitis than placebo-treated patients, whereas overall rates of conjunctivitis among adolescents in the asthma trial were lower than in atopic dermatitis trials and were similar for dupilumab- and placebo-treated patients. Most events were mild to moderate, most recovered/resolved, and none prompted study withdrawal. These results are similar to those reported in adult trials and support a drug–disease interaction.

    "abstract": "Baricitinib, a selective Janus kinase 1/Janus kinase 2 inhibitor, is indicated in the European Union and Japan for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of baricitinib 2 mg in the AD clinical program. Six double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, and two long-term extension studies were summarized in two datasets. Placebo comparison was based on six 16-week studies with baricitinib 2 mg. All-bari-2-mg-AD included patients who received baricitinib 2 mg at any time during the eight studies. In total, 1598 patients received once-daily baricitinib 2 mg for 1434.2 patient-years of exposure (median 330 days/maximum 2.4 years). Treatment-emergent adverse events were higher for baricitinib 2 mg (57.9%) vs placebo (51.6%). Serious adverse events, serious infections, and opportunistic infections were low in frequency and similar between baricitinib 2 mg and placebo. There were no malignancies, gastrointestinal perforations, or major adverse cardiovascular events with baricitinib 2 mg in the placebo-controlled period. Herpes simplex (cluster) was higher for baricitinib 2 mg (3.8%) vs placebo (2.8%); rates decreased with extended 2 mg exposure. In All-bari-2-mg-AD, there were five malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer, two major adverse cardiovascular events, one peripheral venous thrombosis, one arterial thrombosis, and no pulmonary embolisms, deep vein thromboses, or deaths. This integrated analysis in patients with moderate-to-severe AD confirms the established safety profile of baricitinib 2 mg. Longer exposure to treatment is required to evaluate risks of malignancies and major adverse cardiovascular events. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02576938 (first posted 15 October, 2015); NCT03334396 (7 November, 2017); NCT03334422 (7 November, 2017); NCT03428100 (9 February, 2018); NCT03435081 (15 February, 2018); NCT03733301 (7 November, 2018); NCT03334435 (7 November, 2017); NCT03559270 (18 June, 2018). Baricitinib is a medication that helps an overactive immune system adjust itself, leading to improvements in the inflammatory condition atopic dermatitis. Baricitinib is approved for patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in 40 countries. Because it works with the immune system, it is important to understand the safety of baricitinib. Safety information was collected from eight studies and analyzed in two datasets. The first dataset compared the safety of baricitinib 2 mg with placebo in six 16-week studies in which neither patient nor physician knew whether they were taking baricitinib or placebo. The second dataset included an additional two extension studies and examined the safety of baricitinib in all patients receiving at least one dose of baricitinib 2 mg. Patients took baricitinib 2 mg for a maximum of 2.4 years, with a median time of 330 days. In the first dataset, adverse events were higher for baricitinib 2 mg (57.9%) than placebo (51.6%). Serious adverse events, serious infections, and opportunistic infections were low in number and similar for patients taking baricitinib 2 mg or placebo. Herpes simplex infections were more frequent in patients taking baricitinib 2 mg (3.8%) than in those taking placebo (2.8%), but rates in those taking baricitinib 2 mg decreased with a longer treatment duration. There were no occurrences of cancer, gastrointestinal perforations, or major adverse cardiovascular events. In the second dataset, there were five reports of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer, two major adverse cardiovascular events, one peripheral venous thrombosis, one arterial thrombosis, and no pulmonary embolisms, deep vein thromboses, or deaths. Longer treatment with baricitinib is required to better understand the risks of developing cancer or major adverse cardiovascular events. This analysis of safety in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is consistent with the safety reported previously for baricitinib 2 mg.",

    "abstract": "A three-pronged approach to acne treatment—combining an antibiotic, antibacterial, and retinoid—could provide greater efficacy and tolerability than single or dyad treatments, while potentially improving patient compliance and reducing antibiotic resistance. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple-combination, fixed-dose topical clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% (IDP-126) gel for the treatment of acne. In a phase II, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, 12-week study, eligible participants aged ≥ 9 years with moderate-to-severe acne were equally randomized to once-daily IDP-126, vehicle, or one of three component dyad gels: BPO/adapalene; clindamycin phosphate/BPO; or clindamycin phosphate/adapalene. Coprimary endpoints were treatment success at week 12 (participants achieving a ≥ 2-grade reduction from baseline in Evaluator's Global Severity Score and clear/almost clear skin) and least-squares mean absolute changes from baseline in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts to week 12. Treatment-emergent adverse events and cutaneous safety/tolerability were also assessed. A total of 741 participants were enrolled. At week 12, 52.5% of participants achieved treatment success with IDP-126 vs vehicle (8.1%) and dyads (range 27.8–30.5%; P ≤ 0.001, all). IDP-126 also provided significantly greater absolute reductions in inflammatory (29.9) and noninflammatory (35.5) lesions compared with vehicle or dyads (range inflammatory, 19.6–26.8; noninflammatory, 21.8–30.0; P < 0.05, all), corresponding to > 70% reductions with IDP-126. IDP-126 was well tolerated, with most treatment-emergent adverse events of mild-to-moderate severity. Once-daily treatment with the novel fixed-dose triple-combination clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel demonstrated superior efficacy to vehicle and all three dyad component gels, and was well tolerated over 12 weeks in pediatric, adolescent, and adult participants with moderate-to-severe acne.

    "abstract": "Baricitinib (Olumiant®) is an oral small molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). In phase III studies in adults with moderate to severe AD who were inadequately controlled with topical corticosteroids (TCS) or systemic treatments (e.g. ciclosporin), or for whom these therapies were not advisable, baricitinib, alone or in combination with TCS, achieved significant and/or clinically relevant improvements in multiple measures of disease severity, pruritus, skin pain, sleep disturbance and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) over 16 weeks. Benefit onset was rapid, with efficacy generally sustained over the longer term (treatment duration ≤ 68 weeks). In this patient population, the safety profile of baricitinib was consistent with that established in the moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population. Although further longer-term data would be beneficial, current evidence indicates that baricitinib, alone or in combination with TCS, provides an oral alternative to subcutaneous biologics for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. A better understanding of the multiple factors that cause atopic dermatitis (AD; a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease often known as eczema) has led to the development of novel therapies that target various inflammatory pathways involved in the disease process. Baricitinib (Olumiant®), a Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2 inhibitor that targets inflammatory pathways in AD, is a once-daily oral treatment approved in the EU for moderate to severe AD in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. In such patients, baricitinib, alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids, improved disease severity, pruritus, skin pain, sleep disturbance and health-related quality of life compared with placebo over 16 weeks. Benefit onset was rapid and generally sustained over the longer term (treatment duration ≤ 68 weeks). The safety profile of baricitinib in patients with moderate to severe AD is consistent with that seen in adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis treated with the drug. Thus, baricitinib provides a convenient oral alternative to subcutaneous biologics for the treatment of moderate to severe AD.",

Roflumilast cream 0.3% is a highly potent phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved by the US FDA for treatment of psoriasis. The aim of this study was to define the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of roflumilast delivered topically from a phase I maximal usage study and data from phase II and phase III studies. PK data for roflumilast and the active metabolite, roflumilast N-oxide, were determined from a phase I PK and safety maximal usage study of roflumilast cream 0.3% applied once daily for 14 days in patients with plaque psoriasis affecting body surface area (BSA) ≥20% (N = 26). Serial plasma samples were obtained on Days 1 and 15 to determine maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Plasma concentrations were also assessed at Weeks 3, 4, and 5 for terminal half-life (t½). Concentrations of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide in skin were assessed at Day 28 for 14 patients with psoriasis in a phase I/IIa study of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.5% and 0.15% for 28 days. Systemic exposure (Ctrough and AUC) of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide in two phase III trials (DERMIS-1, n = 245; DERMIS-2, n = 250) of roflumilast cream 0.3% for 8 weeks was assessed at Weeks 4 and 8. Bioavailability of roflumilast cream 0.3% after topical administration was 1.5%. Unlike after oral dosing, the plasma concentration-time curve was flat, with a peak-to-trough ratio of 1.2. Roflumilast N-oxide concentrations were eightfold higher than roflumilast concentrations. The t½ in adult patients was 4.0 days for roflumilast and 4.6 days for roflumilast N-oxide following the last dose administered. Steady state was reached by Day 15. Concentrations of roflumilast in skin were, on average, 126- and 61.8-fold higher than corresponding mean plasma Ctrough following administration of roflumilast cream 0.15% and 0.5% daily for 28 days. Roflumilast N-oxide was quantifiable in only one skin sample (N = 27). Following 8 weeks of treatment in DERMIS-1, mean plasma Ctrough of roflumilast was 1.78 ng/mL, and 9.86 ng/mL for roflumilast N-oxide. In DERMIS-2, mean plasma Ctrough was 1.72 ng/mL and 10.2 ng/mL, respectively. In the maximal usage study (mean BSA: 27.5%), eight patients (30.8%) experienced adverse events (AEs) and all were mild or moderate, with no reports of diarrhea, headache, insomnia, or application-site pain; no patients discontinued treatment due to an AE. Topical administration of roflumilast cream 0.3% results in concentrations in skin 126- and 61.8-fold higher relative to plasma, which are much higher than expected to be achievable with oral dosing. PDE4 inhibition in the skin is likely due to roflumilast as compared with its active metabolite, as there is no significant conversion to roflumilast N-oxide in the skin. Consistent with reservoir formation and retention of drug in the stratum corneum, roflumilast is slowly released from the skin (t½ 4 days) and peak-to-trough ratio is 1.2.

    "abstract": "In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), wheals, angioedema, or both appear spontaneously for > 6 weeks. Current recommended treatment options for urticaria target mast cell mediators such as histamine, or activators, such as autoantibodies. The goal of CSU treatment is to treat the disease until it is gone as effectively and safely as possible. As no cure is available for CSU as of now, the treatment is aimed at continuously suppressing disease activity, with complete control of the disease and a normalization of quality of life. To achieve this, pharmacological treatment should be continued until no longer needed. Treatment of CSU should follow the basic principles of treating as much as needed and as little as possible taking into consideration that the activity of the disease may vary. Since CSU is a disease with spontaneous remission, it is hard to tell, in patients with complete control and no signs or symptoms, when medication is no longer needed. The current international guideline for urticaria suggests that the treatment can be stepped down once a patient is free of signs and symptoms. Other reasons for stepping down the treatment of CSU patients include safety concerns or issues, pregnancy or wanting to become pregnant, and economic factors. As of now, it is unclear over which period, with what intervals and with which dosages CSU treatment should be stepped down. Guidance on this is needed for all recommended therapies: (i) standard-dosed second-generation H1-antihistamine (sgAH), (ii) higher than standard-dosed sgAH, (iii) standard-dosed omalizumab, (iv) higher than standard-dosed omalizumab, and (v) cyclosporine. However, there is a lack of controlled trials on the step down and discontinuation of these treatments. Here, we aim to provide a summary of what is known and what needs to be investigated in further studies, based on our own experience and real-world evidence.",

To further explore the long-term efficacy of tralokinumab for AD, a pooled analysis of these trials was conducted.ECZTRA 1 and 2 patients (n = 1596 total) were randomized to tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks (q2w) over 16 weeks. Patients achieving Investigator's Global Assessment of clear/almost clear skin (IGA 0/1) and/or 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at Week 16, were re-randomized to tralokinumab q2w, every 4 weeks (q4w), or placebo (tralokinumab withdrawal) for another 36 weeks. Patients not achieving the response criteria at Week 16 received open-label tralokinumab q2w plus optional topical corticosteroids (TCS). A pooled, prespecified analysis assessed the proportions of Week 16 responders that maintained IGA 0/1 and/or EASI-75 at Week 52. Pooled data from all patients initiated with tralokinumab, regardless of the response at Week 16 or dosing regimen received thereafter, were analyzed post hoc.In patients who achieved the primary endpoints at Week 16, IGA 0/1 responses were maintained at Week 52 without rescue treatment (including TCS) by 55.9%, 42.4%, and 34.0% of patients re-randomized to tralokinumab q2w, q4w, or placebo (tralokinumab withdrawal), respectively, while EASI-75 responses were maintained by 57.3%, 50.4%, and 26.4%, respectively (prespecified analysis). In a post hoc analysis of all patients initiated with tralokinumab, response rates improved over time with continued tralokinumab treatment beyond Week 16 to Week 52 for EASI-50 (63.1-82.7%), EASI-75 (37.6-61.8%), EASI-90 (20.4-37.3%), and IGA 0/1 (23.0-36.2%).Tralokinumab treatment provides progressive and sustained improvement over 1 year in the extent and severity of AD in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.NCT03131648 (ECZTRA 1); study start date: 30 May 2017; primary completion date: 7 August 2018; study completion date: 10 October 2019. NCT03160885 (ECZTRA 2); study start date: 12 June 2017; primary completion date: 4 September 2019; study completion date: 14 August 2019. INFOGRAPHIC.Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by excessively dry and itchy skin, resulting in a considerable burden of disease. Patients with AD often require long-term treatment. Tralokinumab is an injectable antibody treatment that targets a protein called interleukin-13, which substantially contributes to the signs and symptoms of AD. In the ECZTRA 1 and 2 phase III clinical trials, funded by LEO Pharma A/S, adults with moderate-to-severe AD treated with tralokinumab every other week for 16 weeks showed significant improvement in disease extent and severity compared with patients receiving placebo. To further explore the long-term efficacy of tralokinumab for AD, we performed a new analysis combining the almost 1600 patients of ECZTRA 1 and 2. A large proportion of patients treated with tralokinumab who achieved clear or almost clear skin at Week 16 were able to maintain clear or almost clear skin at Week 52 with less frequent dosing (every 4 weeks). Additionally, combining all patients treated with tralokinumab, regardless of Week 16 response or dose frequency thereafter, showed that most patients achieved a significant reduction in disease extent and severity at Week 52. These results demonstrate that many tralokinumab-treated patients continue to improve beyond Week 16, and highlight that efficacy results at Week 16 may not be representative of the outcome of longer-term tralokinumab treatment. These findings may help health care providers better advise patients regarding when to modify treatment with tralokinumab.",

    "abstract": "Ruxolitinib cream is the first topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved in the United States (US) for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and nonsegmental vitiligo. A postmarketing study with oral tofacitinib, approved for rheumatoid arthritis, triggered class warnings for JAK inhibitors, including risk of serious infections, mortality, malignancy, major adverse cardiovascular events, and thrombosis. Because ruxolitinib cream is indicated for inflammatory conditions, it is subject to the same warnings as oral JAK inhibitors in the US. Here, nearly 14,000 patient-years of postmarketing safety data from the first year following market approval of ruxolitinib cream were reviewed. The Incyte global safety database (21 September 2021–20 September 2022) and US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (as of 30 September 2022) were queried for adverse event (AE) reports received for ruxolitinib cream. The search identified 294 postmarketing individual case safety reports containing 589 events, including four serious AEs and no fatal AEs. AEs (i.e., any unfavorable sign, symptom, or disease) representing >2% of all events included application site pain (n = 16), atopic dermatitis (n = 15), skin irritation (n = 15), scratch (n = 14), and condition aggravated (n = 13). The four serious AEs were skin cancer (n = 2), pericarditis, and thrombocytopenia (both n = 1), none of which had sufficient information to assess possible relatedness to ruxolitinib cream. Serious AEs associated with the class warnings for JAK inhibitors were not reported. Postmarketing safety data from the year following approval suggest ruxolitinib cream is generally well tolerated, without significant systemic AEs, and with a low incidence of application site reactions.",

    "abstract": "Psoriatic disease is a lifelong chronic illness for which there is no cure. It is well established that psoriasis leads to a major impairment of health-related quality-of-life and wellbeing. Most people with psoriasis live together with partners, bringing along a major burden for them. The FamilyPso was created to measure this burden in psoriasis. The aim of the FamilyPso international study was to validate this tool and to show feasibility for the use of the FamilyPso across multiple countries. A prospective cohort study was conducted in 11 centers in Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Turkey. The factor structure of the FamiliyPso was examined by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) including tests of measurement invariance for gender and language. Subgroups (e.g., countries and gender) were tested for significant differences, and the relationship between the severity of illness and FamilyPso scores was tested for differences between countries using a mixed regression model. Descriptive statistics for items and scores are presented herein. The cohort consisted of 556 people with psoriasis and their partners. Patients agreed that their partners would answer the questionnaire in their absence and return the forms to the centers. The mean age of patients and partners was 51 years. Psoriasis severity was mild in 57.6%, moderate in 31.5%, and severe in 10.9% of cases, and 91.3% received treatment. The results of the CFA confirmed the original factor structure with minor modifications. Self-assessed high severity of psoriasis was a predictor for a higher burden in 4/5 FamilyPso domains. There was an increased burden to partners related to the severity of psoriasis particularly in the domain \"general emotional strain,\" including items such as a \"feeling of helplessness.\" The results of the study showed that the FamilyPso could assess the burden of partners of people with psoriasis and can be used across different countries. The data can improve management of psoriatic disease and should be considered in shared decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) may be markedly impaired in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.Our objectives were to compare improvements in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) scores between patients receiving guselkumab compared with placebo or adalimumab and to correlate these improvements with skin clearance.Pooled phase III VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 data were evaluated through week 24. At baseline, patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg, placebo, or adalimumab 40 mg. At week 16, patients receiving placebo switched to guselkumab. Assessment measures included DLQI percent change from baseline, DLQI 0/1, DLQI minimal clinically important difference (MCID), individual domain scores, PSSD symptoms and signs score = 0, DLQI association with PSSD, Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI).Significantly greater improvements from baseline DLQI were observed with guselkumab versus placebo (weeks 8 and 16) and versus adalimumab (week 24; p < 0.001). The proportion of patients achieving DLQI 0/1 (\"no impact\") at week 24 was higher with guselkumab than with adalimumab (58.9 vs. 40.2%; p < 0.001), and more patients attained a ≥ 4-point reduction in DLQI (MCID) at this timepoint (p < 0.001). Changes in individual DLQI domains were significantly greater for patients receiving guselkumab than for those receiving adalimumab, and among patients with individual baseline domain scores = 3 or 6 (severest impact), more guselkumab recipients than those receiving adalimumab achieved a score = 0 across all domains at week 24. DLQI 0/1 scores were associated with a PSSD symptom or sign score = 0 (no impact) and greater improvement of PASI and IGA (week 24).Pooled VOYAGE 1/VOYAGE 2 data demonstrated that guselkumab was superior to adalimumab in improving HRQoL, which was associated with greater skin clearance.NCT02207231 and NCT02207244.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis often present in sensitive and thin-skinned areas that are at higher risk for topical treatment-related skin irritation (e.g., burning, stinging). Our objective was to address the need for topical treatments that can be safely applied to these areas. We assessed the local tolerability of crisaborole topical ointment when applied to sensitive and thin-skinned areas of healthy volunteers. In this phase I, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, single-center study, 32 subjects were randomized 3:1 to twice-daily application of crisaborole topical ointment, 2 %, (n = 24) or vehicle ointment (n = 8) for 21 days to 13 anatomic skin areas, including the face/hairline, genitals, extensor, and intertriginous areas. The primary endpoint was assessment of the frequency and severity of local tolerability symptoms (burning/stinging, erythema, and pruritus) using the Local Tolerability Scale. Overall, 98.8 % of all tolerability assessments had a grade of 0 (no signs/symptoms of irritation) and 0.1 % had a grade >1 (mild); no differences were observed in the frequency of local tolerability scores between treatment groups. The total frequency of local tolerability assessments graded >0 (none) was lower across all application sites with crisaborole ointment (0.0–2.2 %) than with vehicle ointment (2.4–7.1 %). Local tolerability did not change over time, and was comparable between sensitive and nonsensitive skin areas. Crisaborole ointment application to sensitive skin areas was well tolerated in healthy volunteers, supporting its potential role as a topical treatment alternative for patients with AD or psoriasis.",

Our aim was to assess whether intradermal injection with BTX-B is an effective treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Twenty patients with HS stage I–III disease, according to Hurley’s classification, were consecutively included for treatment with either a placebo or BTX-B. At the next intervention after 3 months, all participants received the active substance and another follow-up at 6 months. The primary outcome was quality of life, measured using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), while secondary outcomes were the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain in the worst boil and HS-related impairment of general health (VAS), as well as changes in physician-reported disease activity assessed as the number of total lesions, and reported adverse effects of treatment. The DLQI improved from a median of 17 at baseline to 8 at 3 months in the BTX-B group, compared with a reduction from 13.5 to 11 in the placebo group (p <0.05). Improvement of the patients’ own ratings of symptoms and a reduction in total lesions supplemented the primary outcome. Fifty-five percent of the study population reported some degree of hyperhidrosis. BTX-B improves the quality of life in patients with HS. Furthermore, comorbidity between HS and hyperhidrosis is suggested. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03103074.",

In this review, we describe how changes in the structure and function of the microbiome are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. We highlight recent data showing that differential changes in microbial diversity, both within and across communities from different body habitats (including the skin, gut, and oral mucosa), are associated with the development and severity of AD. We also describe recent evidence demonstrating that the metabolic activity of the skin microbiome can act as a regulator of inflammation, with alterations in the level of a skin microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolite, indole-3-aldehyde (IAId), being shown to play a role in AD. The various mechanisms by which interactions between the microbiome and components of the non-histaminergic pathway result in itch in AD are also discussed.",

Efficacy was assessed by static physician's global assessment (sPGA) and psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). Quality of life, assessed by dermatology life quality index (DLQI), and safety were also evaluated.Overall, 181 patients received brodalumab for a median of 264 weeks. Brodalumab treatment resulted in rapid improvements in sPGA, PASI, and DLQI that were maintained through week 264. Achieving PASI 90 to < 100 or PASI 100 at weeks 12, 240, and 264 was associated with greater likelihood for DLQI 0 or 1 compared with achieving PASI 75 to < 90. Over 5 years, one adverse event of suicidal ideation was reported, no suicides occurred, and no new safety signals emerged.Brodalumab demonstrated skin clearance and improved quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile, throughout 5 years of treatment.

    "abstract": "Haematological malignancies induce important alterations of the immune system, which account for the high frequency of autoimmune complications observed in patients. Cutaneous immune-mediated diseases associated with haematological malignancies encompass a heterogeneous group of dermatoses, including, among others, neutrophilic and eosinophilic dermatoses, autoantibody-mediated skin diseases, vasculitis and granulomatous dermatoses. Some of these diseases, such as paraneoplastic pemphigus, are associated with an increased risk of death; others, such as eosinophilic dermatoses of haematological malignancies, run a benign clinical course but portend a significant negative impairment on a patient's quality of life. In rare cases, the skin eruption reflects immunological alterations associated with an unfavourable prognosis of the associated haematological disorder. Therapeutic management of immune-mediated skin diseases in patients with haematological malignancies is often challenging. Systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are considered frontline therapies but may considerably augment the risk of serious infections. Indeed, developing a specific targeted therapeutic approach is of crucial importance for this particularly fragile patient population. This review provides an up-to-date overview on the immune-mediated skin diseases most frequently encountered by patients with onco-haematological disorders, discussing new pathogenic advances and therapeutic options on the horizon.",

In patients suffering from an advanced melanoma with such a somatic alteration, combined targeted therapy with a BRAF and MEK inhibitor can be applied to significantly increase the survival probability. Nevertheless, resistance mechanisms, as well as negative predictive biomarkers (elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, high number of metastatic organ disease sites, brain metastasis), remain a major problem in treating melanoma patients. Recently, a landmark overall survival (OS) rate of 34% after 5 years of combined targeted therapy in treatment-naïve patients was reported. On the other hand, patients harboring a BRAF mutation and receiving first-line immune checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab plus nivolumab showed a 5-year OS rate of 60%. As indicated by these data, long-term survival can be reached in melanoma patients but it remains unclear if this is equivalent to reaching a true cure for metastatic melanoma. In this review, we summarize the recent results for combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in advanced melanoma harboring an activating BRAF mutation and discuss the impact of baseline characteristics on long-term outcome.",

Moisturizers should be selected based on proven clinical effectiveness in improving the skin barrier and improving the symptoms of AD. We searched the PubMed database for clinical trials assessing daily moisturization for the treatment of AD published between 2006 and 2019. Studies had to assess the efficacy of commercially available moisturizers using objective measures of corneometry, transepidermal water loss, or incidence of flare as endpoints, and treatments had to be currently available to patients. Clinical studies showed that moisturization (typically twice daily) significantly improved the skin barrier in adults and children with AD. Longer-term flare studies showed that daily moisturization reduced the incidence of flares and extended the time between flares. Proactive moisturization of infants at high risk of developing AD may reduce its manifestation. Therapeutic moisturizers for AD are specifically formulated with ingredients that target symptoms of AD, such as itch, inflammation, or compromised skin barrier. The US FDA requires that any moisturizer available in the USA and claiming to treat AD must contain colloidal oatmeal. Healthcare providers can maximize compliance and outcomes by educating patients on the benefits of liberally applying a therapeutic moisturizer twice daily to support the skin barrier and help reduce the incidence of flares. Specific recommendations should be for clinically tested moisturizers evaluated using objective, validated skin assessments.",

This prospective, observational study enrolled adult patients actively using chlormethine gel. Patients were monitored for up to 2 years during standard-of-care clinic visits. No specific visit schedules or clinical assessments, with the exception of patient-completed questionnaires, were mandated because of the expected variability in practice patterns. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with stage IA–IB disease receiving chlormethine + topical corticosteroids + other with ≥ 50% decrease in body surface area from baseline to 12 months. Response was assessed at each visit using by-time analysis, which investigates the trend to treatment response and allows assessment of response over time. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the Skindex-29 questionnaire. In total, 298 patients were monitored. At 12 months post-treatment initiation, 44.4% (chlormethine + topical corticosteroids + other) and 45.1% (patients receiving chlormethine + other treatment) of efficacy-evaluable patients were responders. By-time analysis demonstrated that peak response occurred (chlormethine + other; 66.7%) at 18 months. There was a significant correlation between responder status and lower post-baseline Skindex-29 scores. This real-world study confirmed that chlormethine gel is an important therapeutic option for patients with mycosis fungoides and contributes to reducing the severity of skin lesions and improving health-related quality of life.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum 25(OH)D level and AD, and the effect of VD supplementation on AD severity, while providing stratified analyses based on latitude and region. A systematic review was performed on all published studies in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases that analyzed effects of serum 25(OH)D and VD supplementation on AD. This systematic review and meta-analysis includes 20 studies with 1882 cases of AD. We found significantly lower 25(OH)D levels in AD patients compared with healthy controls (HC) (p < 0.001), significantly lower 25(OH)D levels in severe AD compared with both mild and moderate AD (p < 0.001), and VD supplementation improved AD symptoms (p < 0.001). Factors like seasonal and environmental changes, sunlight exposure, and cultural practices may confound the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and AD severity. There are limited randomized controlled trials that assess this association. Overall, lower serum 25(OH)D is associated with more severe AD, and VD supplementation may help lower AD severity. Further research is needed to confirm the presence and direction of causality of the relationship between VD and AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BI 695501 is an FDA-approved biosimilar to adalimumab reference product (RP). VOLTAIRE-X was a randomized clinical trial to assess outcomes with a biosimilar monoclonal antibody in line with the FDA requirements for designation as an 'interchangeable' biosimilar. The aim of this study was to assess whether multiple switches between adalimumab RP and BI 695501 lead to equivalent pharmacokinetics and a similar safety and immunogenicity profile compared with continuous adalimumab RP. We conducted a phase III, double-blind, randomized controlled trial between July 19, 2017, and April 16, 2019. There were 49 investigational sites across Europe and North America. Of 323 screened patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, 259 were treated with adalimumab RP during the run-in period. Of these, 118 and 120 were randomized to the continuous or switching arms, respectively. Interventions consisted of a run-in period with adalimumab RP 80 mg subcutaneously (SC) on Day 1, then 40 mg SC every other week (EOW) Weeks 2–12. Patients were then randomized to receive adalimumab RP 40 mg EOW Weeks 14–48 (continuous arm) or BI 695501 40 mg Weeks 14 and 16, adalimumab RP 40 mg Weeks 18 and 20, and BI 695501 40 mg EOW Weeks 22 to 48 (switching arm); all interventions were given SC. Primary endpoints were pharmacokinetics parameters, area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUCτ,30–32) and maximum observed drug plasma concentration (Cmax,30–32), measured after the third switch during the Week 30–32 dosing interval. 238 patients (mean [standard deviation] age 44.9 [13.8]; 66.0% male) were treated in the switching (n = 118) or continuous arms (n = 120). Adjusted mean Cmax,30–32 was 7.08 and 7.00 μg/mL in the switching and continuous treatment arms, respectively; adjusted mean AUCτ,30–32 was 2025.8 and 1925.9 μg h/mL. Point estimate for mean ratio for AUCτ,30–32 was 105.2% (90.2% confidence interval [CI] 96.6–114.6), and 101.1% (90.2% CI 93.3–109.7) for Cmax,30–32. Both CIs were within a predefined bioequivalence range of 80.0–125.0%. Treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation in 0.8% and 1.7% of patients in the switching and continuous treatment arms, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores were highly similar in the two arms across the entire trial period. Pharmacokinetic equivalence was demonstrated, with highly similar efficacy and immunogenicity, and comparable safety observed in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis who received either adalimumab RP continuously or who switched between adalimumab RP and BI 695501.

    "abstract": "There has been no extensive synthesis of studies evaluating the cost of chronic hand eczema (CHE). This review evaluated the societal costs, healthcare resource utilisation, missed work time and job loss due to CHE. MEDLINE and 16 other databases and websites were searched in October 2020 for studies meeting prespecified inclusion criteria. Studies conducted in Europe, Australia, New Zealand or the Americas were included. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts, and full-text papers published in English between 2000 and 2020, for relevance. Data extraction was carried out by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. All data were based on costs between 2001 and 2013 but have been inflated to 2020 prices and converted to US dollars and Euros. A total of 30 studies (reported in 33 publications) were included in the synthesis. Mean total societal costs per year per patient ranged from $2549 (€1813) to $10,883 (€7738). Pharmacological therapy was, on average, $28.34 (€20.15) per month in Italy and $36.49 (€25.94) per month for emollients in Switzerland. Yearly treatment costs were $599.05 (€425.92) for drugs, including topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, other topical treatments and oral treatments, and $178.40 for emollients, in Germany. CHE was associated with hospitalisation costs ranging from $81.86 (€58.20) per patient per month (US) to $105.04 (€74.68) per patient per month (Italy) and $639.59 (€454.75) per year (Germany). Up to 57% of patients took sick leave and up to 25% reported job loss/job change due to CHE. This review confirms the significant cost burden of CHE. Given the paucity of studies estimating the monetary costs of absenteeism, presenteeism and job loss associated with CHE, current mean societal costs are likely underestimated. Uncontrolled disease may also lead to increased costs to patients and society.",

The subtlety of the initial clinical appearance of MF can result in diagnostic delays and hesitancy to refer suspected cases to specialist clinics. An unmet need remains for greater awareness and education. Therefore, an international expert panel of dermatologists, oncologists, hematologists, and dermatopathologists convened to discuss and identify barriers to early and accurate MF diagnosis that could guide clinicians toward making a correct diagnosis. Confirmation of MF requires accurate assessment of symptoms and clinical signs, and subsequent correlation with dermatopathological findings. This review summarizes the expert panel's guidance, based on the literature and real-life experience, for dermatologists to help include MF in their list of differential diagnoses, along with simple clinical and histopathologic checklists that may help clinicians to suspect and identify potential MF lesions and reduce diagnostic delays.",

    "abstract": "Background: Traditional systemic immunosuppressants and advanced therapies improve signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). However, data are limited in severe and/or difficult-to-treat AD. In the phase 3 JADE COMPARE trial of patients with moderate-to-severe AD receiving background topical therapy, once-daily abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg showed significantly greater reductions in the symptoms of AD than placebo and significantly greater improvement in itch response (with abrocitinib 200 mg) than dupilumab at week 2. Objective: This study assessed the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib and dupilumab in a subset of patients with severe and/or difficult-to-treat AD in a post hoc analysis of the JADE COMPARE trial. Methods: Adults with moderate-to-severe AD received once-daily oral abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg, dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks, or placebo with concomitant medicated topical therapy. Severe and/or difficult-to-treat AD subgroups were classified by baseline characteristics [Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) 4, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) > 21, failure or intolerance to prior systemic agents (excluding patients who took only corticosteroids), percentage of body surface area (%BSA) > 50, upper quartiles of EASI (EASI > 38) and %BSA (%BSA > 65), and combined subgroup of IGA 4, EASI > 21, and %BSA > 50, and failure or intolerance to prior systemic agents (excluding patients who took only corticosteroids)]. Assessments included IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a ≥ 2-point improvement from baseline, ≥ 75% and ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in EASI (EASI-75 and EASI-90), ≥ 4-point improvement from baseline in Peak Pruritus-Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4), time to PP-NRS4, least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in 14-day PP-NRS (days 2–15), Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) up to week 16. Results: The proportion of patients achieving IGA 0/1, EASI-75, and EASI-90 responses was significantly greater with abrocitinib 200 mg than placebo (nominal p < 0.05) across all subgroups with severe and/or difficult-to-treat AD. Across most subgroups, PP-NRS4 response was significantly greater with abrocitinib 200 mg than placebo (nominal p < 0.01); the time to achieve this response was shorter with abrocitinib 200 mg (range 4.5–6.0 days) than abrocitinib 100 mg (range 5.0–17.0 days), dupilumab (range 8.0–11.0 days), and placebo (range 3.0–11.5 days). LSM change from baseline in POEM and DLQI was significantly greater with abrocitinib 200 mg than placebo (nominal p < 0.001) across all subgroups. Clinically meaningful differences were observed between abrocitinib and dupilumab for most evaluated endpoints across several subgroups, including in patients who failed or were intolerant to prior systemic therapy. Conclusions: Abrocitinib provided rapid and substantially greater improvements in skin clearance and quality of life compared with placebo and dupilumab in subgroups of patients with severe and/or difficult-to-treat AD. These findings support the use of abrocitinib for severe and/or difficult-to-treat AD. Trial registration:: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03720470.",

This post hoc analysis focuses on 304 patients receiving either dupilumab or placebo with TCS and assessed the percentage of patients considered responsive to dupilumab treatment at week 16.At week 16, almost all patients receiving dupilumab + TCS (95%) demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in AD signs, symptoms, or QoL compared with placebo + TCS (61%, p < 0.0001).

    "abstract": "Dapsone, initially synthesized for textile dyeing, gained recognition in the 1930s for its antibacterial properties, leading to its utilization in dermatology for leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis. Despite US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for these conditions, dapsone's off-label uses have expanded, making it a valuable option in various dermatologic conditions. This review seeks to highlight the common uses of dapsone in its FDA indications and off-label indications. Diseases in which dapsone is considered first-line therapy or adjunctive therapy are reviewed, with highlights from the resources included. An overview of dapsone's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, indications, dosages, and safety profile are also reviewed. Dapsone's versatility and safety profile make it a cost-effective treatment option in dermatology, particularly for patients with limited access to specialized medications. Ongoing clinical trials are also described exploring dapsone's efficacy in novel dermatologic uses. Dapsone has been a valuable adjunctive therapy across various dermatologic conditions for years and evidence for its use continues to expand.",

The management of regional nodes remains a matter of debate. By replacing elective lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy has revolutionized the treatment of malignant melanoma. In this paper, the history of the procedure is traced, and the indication for completion lymphadenectomy after positive sentinel node biopsy is discussed in light of the recent studies that addressed this issue. The role of adjuvant therapies in the management of patients with stage III melanoma is also discussed.",

GT was evaluated for primary axillary hyperhidrosis in replicate, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, phase III trials. GT reduced sweating severity and production versus vehicle and was generally well tolerated.Our objective was to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from these trials.Patients aged ≥ 9 years with primary axillary hyperhidrosis ≥ 6 months, gravimetrically measured sweat production ≥ 50 mg/5 min in each axilla, Axillary Sweating Daily Diary (ASDD) Item 2 severity score ≥ 4, and Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) score ≥ 3 were randomized 2:1 to GT 3.75% or vehicle applied once daily to each axilla for 4 weeks. The 4-item ASDD, 6 Weekly Impact (WI) items, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), HDSS, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were utilized.In the pooled population, 463 patients were randomized to GT and 234 to vehicle; 426 (92.0%) and 225 (96.2%) completed the trials. At baseline, most patients considered their axillary sweating to be at least moderate in severity, impact, and bothersomeness (ASDD items 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Improvement was substantially greater for GT than for vehicle at every study week, and, at week 4, ASDD scores improved from baseline by 62.6 versus 34.0% (severity), 65.5 versus 40.3% (impact), and 65.4 versus 39.0% (bothersomeness). Improvements favoring GT versus vehicle also occurred for WI items, PGIC, HDSS, and DLQI.PRO results demonstrated that GT reduced the disease burden of primary axillary hyperhidrosis.Clinicaltrials.gov; ATMOS-1 (NCT02530281), ATMOS-2 (NCT02530294).",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis is highly prevalent in black/African American, Asian, and Hispanic patients, making assessment of these populations in clinical trials important. Crisaborole ointment, 2%, is a nonsteroidal phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. In two pivotal phase III clinical trials in patients aged ≥ 2 years, crisaborole was superior to vehicle in reducing global disease severity. The most common treatment-related adverse event was application site pain. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of crisaborole according to patient race and ethnicity. A pooled post hoc analysis by race and ethnicity of the two pivotal trials and a safety extension trial was performed. Race included white or nonwhite (encompassing Asian/native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, black/African American, and other/American Indian/Alaskan native); ethnicity included Hispanic/Latino or not Hispanic/Latino. In white, nonwhite, Hispanic/Latino, and not Hispanic/Latino groups at day 29, more crisaborole- than vehicle-treated patients achieved improvements in global disease severity [Investigator’s Static Global Assessment of clear/almost clear with a ≥ 2-grade improvement (white: 33.5% vs. 22.3%, nominal p < 0.001; nonwhite: 30.0% vs. 21.3%, nominal p < 0.05; Hispanic/Latino: 35.4% vs. 18.2%, nominal p < 0.01; not Hispanic/Latino: 31.3% vs. 22.8%, nominal p < 0.01)]. Crisaborole treatment also improved atopic dermatitis signs/symptoms and quality of life. Frequency of crisaborole-related adverse events was 7.1–8.5% in the pivotal trials. Across races and ethnicities, crisaborole demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, with a low frequency of treatment-related adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Glycopyrronium tosylate is a topical anticholinergic approved in the USA for primary axillary hyperhidrosis in patients aged ≥ 9 years (Qbrexza™ [glycopyrronium] cloth, 2.4%). This 44-week open-label extension study assessed glycopyrronium tosylate safety and descriptive efficacy in patients completing one of two, phase III, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 4-week trials (NCT02530281; NCT02530294). Patients aged ≥ 9 years with primary axillary hyperhidrosis were randomized 2:1 (glycopyrronium tosylate: vehicle, once daily) in the double-blind trials. Completers could receive open-label glycopyrronium tosylate for up to an additional 44 weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events and local skin reactions were assessed. Descriptive efficacy assessments were gravimetrically measured sweat production, Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale responder rate (≥ 2 grade improvement), and Dermatology Life Quality Index/children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index. Of 651 patients completing the double-blind trials, 564 (86.6%) entered the open-label extension; 550 were analyzed. Most patients experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events had mild or moderate events (> 90%). Discontinuation because of treatment-emergent adverse events remained low and relatively stable, with a cumulative rate of 8.0% (44/550) over 44 weeks. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (> 5%) were dry mouth (16.9%), vision blurred (6.7%), application-site pain (6.4%), nasopharyngitis (5.8%), and mydriasis (5.3%). Most patients (67.5%) had no local skin reactions; those occurring were predominantly mild/moderate. Glycopyrronium tosylate efficacy was maintained throughout the trial; at week 44, the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale responder rate was 63.2%, and improvements from baseline (double blind) in sweat production were − 71.3% and 8.7 ± 6.2/6.2 ± 4.9 for Dermatology Life Quality Index/children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index. Daily long-term application of glycopyrronium tosylate for up to 48 weeks (double blind plus open label) was generally well tolerated and efficacy was maintained. No new safety signals emerged.

    "abstract": "Chronic pruritus, defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in a need to scratch that lasts more than 6 weeks, is a prevalent and bothersome symptom associated with both cutaneous and systemic conditions. Due to complex pathogenesis and profuse contributing factors, chronic pruritus therapy remains challenging. Regardless of the well-established antipruritic properties of classic pharmacotherapy (topical therapy, phototherapy and systemic therapy), these methods often provide insufficient relief for affected individuals. Owing to the growing interest in the field of pruritic research, further experimental and clinical data have emerged, continuously supporting the possibility of instigating novel therapeutic measures. This review covers the most relevant current modalities remaining under investigation that possess promising perspectives of approval in the near future, especially opioidergic drugs (mu-opioid antagonists and kappa-opioid agonists), neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, biologic drugs, Janus kinase inhibitors, ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists and histamine H4 receptor antagonists.",

    "abstract": "Ruxolitinib cream 1.5% (OPZELURA™) is a topical formulation of ruxolitinib, a potent, selective inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2. The targeting of these kinases is associated with therapeutic benefits in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). In two identically designed, multinational, phase III studies in patients aged ≥ 12 years with mild to moderate AD, ruxolitinib cream 1.5% improved measures of disease severity, pruritus and sleep disturbance relative to vehicle cream when applied twice daily for 8 weeks. Disease severity was controlled for the next 44 weeks when applied as needed to active lesions. Ruxolitinib cream 1.5% was well tolerated in this patient population; its safety profile was similar to that of vehicle cream over the short term, with the types of treatment-emergent adverse events typical of those seen in the vehicle-controlled period over the longer term. Moreover, application site treatment-emergent adverse events indicative of skin tolerability issues (e.g. stinging/burning sensation) were infrequent and no safety findings suggestive of systemic JAK inhibition were identified. Although further longer-term data would be of use, ruxolitinib cream 1.5% provides an alternative to established topical agents (e.g. corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors) for the treatment of mild to moderate AD in adults and adolescents. Atopic dermatitis (AD; also known as atopic eczema) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that most commonly occurs in children but may also affect adults. Ruxolitinib cream 1.5% (OPZELURA™) is a topical therapy that inhibits Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2, which are enzymes that can modify the inflammatory pathways involved in AD. It is approved in the USA for short-term and non-continuous longer-term treatment of mild to moderate AD in non-immunocompromised patients aged ≥ 12 years whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Patients experienced clearer skin and a reduction in itch and disturbed sleep when treated with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% twice daily compared with a non-medicated cream for 8 weeks. Moreover, clearer skin was maintained for a further 44 weeks when using the treatment as needed. The safety profile of ruxolitinib cream 1.5% was similar to that of the non-medicated cream, and stinging/burning sensations following application were infrequent. Thus, ruxolitinib cream 1.5% offers an alternative to established topical agents (e.g. corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors) for the treatment of adults and adolescents with mild to moderate AD.",

Patients received dupilumab 300 mg every week (qw) or every 2 weeks (q2w), or placebo with/without topical corticosteroids. Post hoc efficacy at week 16 was examined using broad categorical and continuous assessments of skin lesions, symptoms, biomarkers, and quality of life. Safety was also assessed.In the ≥ 60-year-old group at week 16, a greater proportion of dupilumab-treated patients achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0/1 (q2w: 44.4%; qw: 39.7%) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (63.0%; 61.6%) versus placebo (7.1% and 14.3%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Type 2 inflammation biomarkers (immunoglobulin E and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine) were also significantly reduced in dupilumab- versus placebo-treated patients (P < 0.01). Results were similar in the < 60-year-old group. The exposure-adjusted incidences of adverse events in dupilumab-treated patients were generally similar to those receiving placebo, with numerically fewer treatment-emergent adverse events in the dupilumab-treated ≥ 60-year-old group versus placebo.There were fewer patients in the ≥ 60-year-old group; post hoc analyses.Dupilumab improved AD signs and symptoms in patients aged ≥ 60 years; results were comparable to those in patients aged < 60 years.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to apremilast 30 mg twice daily or placebo for 16 weeks, followed by a 16-week extension phase during which all patients received apremilast. The primary endpoint was achievement of PPPASI-50 response (≥ 50% improvement from baseline in PPPASI). Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in PPPASI total score, Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index (PPSI), and patient's visual analog scale (VAS) for PPP symptoms (pruritus and discomfort/pain). A total of 90 patients were randomized (apremilast: 46; placebo: 44). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved PPPASI-50 at week 16 with apremilast versus placebo (P = 0.0003).

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease requiring efficacious and safe long-term therapy. Several new systemic treatments have recently been approved for use in patients with moderate to severe AD. However, head-to-head comparisons have not been conducted for all the currently available treatments for AD. Multiple network meta-analyses have compared efficacy of these different therapies during the initial 16-week treatment period, but not beyond week 16. Therefore, understanding the differences in key trial design and statistical methods is essential for evaluating long-term efficacy, making cross-trial comparisons, and informing treatment decisions. This focused narrative review provides an overview of data and trial methodology to guide clinicians in evaluating longer-term efficacy and safety of currently approved systemic treatments for patients with AD. We discuss important elements of longer-term trial designs and statistical analysis strategies that should be considered based on our experience as clinical trialists. In addition, a summary of key efficacy results of published, longer-term, phase III clinical trials of US Food and Drug Administration-approved, novel systemic treatments (i.e., dupilumab, tralokinumab, abrocitinib, and upadacitinib) is provided, including the design and data handling methods used. Long-term safety considerations and differences in the time-effect and safety profiles of various medications are also noted to help inform clinical decisions for individual patients. Overall, the findings of these trials support efficacy in long-term treatment with novel systemic agents for patients with AD.",

This study assessed the sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and associated costs of patients with HS following biologic approval.This non-interventional, retrospective cohort study involved adult (≥ 18 years) and adolescent (12-17 years) patients diagnosed with HS in the United States (US) using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database during the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.Of 42,843 identified patients, 10,909 met the incident HS patient criteria (10,230 adults, 628 adolescents, 51 patients aged <12 years). Patients were mostly diagnosed by a general practitioner/pediatrician (adults: 41.6%; adolescents: 39.6%) or dermatologist (adults: 22.1%; adolescents: 30.6%). Commonly reported Charlson comorbidities at pre-index in adult patients were diabetes without complications (20.4%), chronic pulmonary disease (16.4%) and diabetes with complications (9.0%), and the most frequent Elixhauser comorbidities were uncomplicated hypertension (38.3%), obesity (22.5%), uncomplicated diabetes (19.0%) and depression (17.4%). The burden of comorbidities generally increased over time after diagnosis in both adults and adolescents. HS-related surgical procedures were uncommon in the 2-years post-index period: an incision and drainage procedure was reported in 7.6% of adults and 6.4% of adolescents. Patients were predominantly treated with both topical and systemic antibiotic treatments (adults: 25.0% and 65.1%, respectively; adolescents: 41.7% and 74.5%, respectively). Biologic prescription was higher in adults than adolescents (3.5% vs. 1.8%). Total healthcare costs for adult and adolescent patients in the 2-years post-index period were US$42,143 and US$16,057, respectively, with outpatient costs accounting for the majority of these costs (US$20,980 and US$8408, respectively).In adult and adolescent patients with HS, comorbidity burden continues to increase after diagnosis. All-cause and HS-specific HCRU and costs are high in adults and adolescents with HS. These findings support the need for a multidisciplinary comprehensive care strategy for patients with HS.",

    "abstract": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is genetically a distinct tumor compared to cutaneous melanoma (CM), and due to its low mutational burden, it is far less perceptible to the immune system. Thus, treatments that have revolutionized the treatment of CM remain widely inefficient in metastatic UM or only demonstrate effectiveness in a small subpopulation of patients. To this end, the therapeutic benefit of immune checkpoint blockade is very limited and may come at the expense of severe immune-related adverse events that could potentially affect all organ systems. Notably, tebentafusp, an entirely novel class of anti-cancer drugs, has received official authorization for the treatment of metastatic UM. It is the first agent that demonstrated a survival advantage in a randomized controlled trial of metastatic UM patients. Despite the survival benefit and approval, the restriction of tebentafusp to HLA-A*02:01-positive patients and the low objective response rate indicate the persistent need for additional therapies. Thus, liver-directed therapies are commonly used for tumor control of hepatic metastases and represent a central pillar of the daily management of liver-dominant disease. Further, promising data from targeted therapies independent of MEK-inhibitors, such as the combination of darovasertib and crizotinib, raise hope for additional options in metastatic UM in the future. This narrative review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the current treatment landscape for metastatic UM.",

    "abstract": "Morbilliform eruptions, which are a clinical reaction pattern characterized by erythematous macules and papules coalescing into patches that cover most of the skin surface, are one of the most common cutaneous findings in the inpatient setting. In the hospital setting, most causes are benign and due to low-risk drug exanthems; however, morbilliform eruptions may also be a sign of high-risk diseases, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and graft-versus-host disease. Proper identification of the etiology and risk stratification of a morbilliform eruption is critical to ensure proper management and optimize patient outcomes. In this review, we discuss the key features that differentiate high-risk from low-risk morbilliform eruptions, as well as specific characteristics that differentiate the different high-risk eruptions. Additionally, we offer a clinical algorithm that may be applied in the management of a patient who presents with a morbilliform rash.",

    "abstract": "A subset of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis show long-term remission after drug withdrawal lasting well beyond several half-life times of the drug, particularly following effective treatment with modern biologics such as interleukin-23 inhibitors. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the development of comorbidities, including psoriatic arthritis, a key comorbidity causing irreversible damage, can be prevented or delayed in a subgroup of patients with psoriasis receiving these therapies. This implies that psoriasis treatments may alter the underlying disease mechanisms in some individuals, extending beyond their direct pharmacological effects. However, this concept of disease modification remains controversial, as predicting the natural clinical course of an individual patient with psoriasis is challenging, and typically, no permanent clinically detectable changes occur in psoriatic skin inflammation. This article aims to provide an overview of the current evidence on disease modification in psoriasis and discusses clinical and molecular markers that could be used to predict or monitor disease modification in psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis severity and treatment responsiveness vary by body region, which differentially impacts quality of life (QoL). The objective of the study was to examine adalimumab efficacy by body region and regional response and QoL relationship. Patients (n = 1212) with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were randomized 2:1 to 80 mg at week 0, followed by adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week for 16 weeks in the double-blind REVEAL study. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses and Dermatology Life Quality Index outcomes were analyzed. Week 16 regional mean PASI improvements were significantly greater with adalimumab (83.1 ± 1.57, 81.3 ± 1.58, 75.7 ± 1.34, and 73.9 ± 1.26% in the trunk, head, upper extremities, and lower extremities, respectively; all p < 0.001 vs. placebo). Likewise, percentages of patients with regional PASI ≥75/≥90/100% reduction from baseline were significantly higher with adalimumab (all p < 0.001); adalimumab responses were greater for the trunk (77.9/65.0/59.1%) and head (74.6/66.1/62.8%; all p ≤ 0.0001 vs. lower) than upper (67.7/45.1/39.6%; p = 0.4, p = 0.04, p = 0.0005, respectively, vs. lower) and lower extremities (65.7/40.0/31.3%). Adalimumab significantly improved Dermatology Life Quality Index scores vs. placebo (8.2- vs 1.7-point decrease from baseline; p < 0.001). The study was a post hoc analysis. Adalimumab treatment resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in disease severity and QoL. QoL improvements were associated with PASI responses in all body regions. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00237887.",

In patients with HS or psoriasis, the overall safety of adalimumab 40-mg EOW and EW was generally comparable. In studies of adalimumab for non-dermatologic indications, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, the overall AE rates were similar for EW and EOW dosing.In patients with HS or psoriasis, the safety of adalimumab EW and EOW was comparable and consistent with the expected adalimumab AE profile. The safety of adalimumab EW dosing in patients with dermatologic conditions is supported by data comparing adalimumab EW and EOW dosing for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00918255, NCT01468207, NCT01468233, NCT00645814, NCT00077779, NCT00055497, NCT01070303, NCT00195715, NCT00348283, NCT00385736, NCT00408629, and NCT00573794.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory testing is typically required for patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) treated with systemic immunosuppressants. A previous analysis of laboratory outcomes in randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD found no clinically important changes in hematologic, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters, supporting the use of dupilumab without routine laboratory monitoring. The aim was to assess laboratory results in adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab in a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Adolescents aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1:1:1 to subcutaneous dupilumab 200/300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) (200 mg for patients < 60 kg at baseline; 300 mg for patients ≥ 60 kg at baseline); dupilumab 300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w); or placebo for 16 weeks. Laboratory evaluations included hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters. Of 251 patients enrolled in the study, 250 received treatment and were included in the analysis. 4.7%, 2.4%, and 4.8% of patients receiving placebo, dupilumab 200/300 mg q2w, and dupilumab 300 mg q4w, respectively, had laboratory abnormalities reported as treatment-emergent adverse events, none of which prompted discontinuation of study treatment or study withdrawal. Mean eosinophil counts were elevated at baseline in all treatment groups. Patients in both dupilumab regimens, but not the placebo group, showed mild transient increases in mean eosinophil counts above baseline that returned to near-baseline values by week 16. Mean levels of lactate dehydrogenase trended towards the upper limit of normal at baseline and decreased with treatment; greater decreases were seen in dupilumab-treated patients than placebo-treated patients. There were no meaningful changes in other laboratory parameters, and none of the laboratory abnormalities were clinically significant. No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters were seen in adolescents, similar to that observed in adults. The findings of this study indicate no routine laboratory monitoring is required in this population prior to or during dupilumab treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03054428.",

    "abstract": "Abrocitinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, provided significant itch relief by week 2 in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in the phase III JADE COMPARE trial. This post-hoc analysis of JADE COMPARE aimed to further characterize itch response and determined whether early itch relief could predict subsequent improvements in AD severity. JADE COMPARE was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial. Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned to receive oral abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg once daily, subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every other week (after a 600-mg loading dose), or placebo, plus medicated topical therapy for 16 weeks. Assessments were ≥ 4-point improvement in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4) from days 2 to 15, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores at week 12. Association between week 2 PP-NRS4 and efficacy at week 12 was evaluated by chi-squared tests. The predictive value of early response for later efficacy was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. As early as day 4 after treatment, a significantly greater proportion of patients achieved PP-NRS4 response with abrocitinib 200 mg (18.6%) versus dupilumab (5.6%; p < 0.001) and placebo (6.0%; p < 0.003). A similar trend was observed with abrocitinib at the 100-mg dose, with significantly greater PP-NRS4 response rates versus placebo as early as day 9. With both doses of abrocitinib, week 12 IGA 0/1, EASI-75, EASI-90, and DLQI 0/1 response rates were greater in week 2 PP-NRS4 responders than nonresponders; no differences were observed between week 2 PP-NRS4 responders and nonresponders in the dupilumab and placebo groups. Early improvement in PP-NRS at week 2 was associated with skin clearance at week 12 in abrocitinib-treated patients. Abrocitinib resulted in rapid relief from itch in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, with significant improvement in itch as early as day 4 after treatment with abrocitinib 200 mg compared with dupilumab and placebo. Abrocitinib-induced itch relief by week 2 was associated with subsequent improvements at week 12. [Video abstract available.] ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03720470. Atopic dermatitis (AD), also called atopic eczema, is a skin disease that affects people throughout their lives. About 10% of adults worldwide have AD. Itch is the most bothersome symptom reported by people with AD and scratching this itch can damage the skin, resulting in painful sores. It is unknown if relief from itch can influence other symptoms of AD. We analyzed data from the JADE COMPARE study, which included 837 people who received treatment with abrocitinib, dupilumab or placebo. We studied how fast itch relief occurred after people received these treatments. We also wanted to study if rapid itch relief was associated with improvement in other signs of AD later on with continued treatment. We found that as early as 4 days after treatment, abrocitinib 200 mg provided significant relief from itch compared with dupilumab or placebo. People who had rapid itch relief within 2 weeks of treatment with abrocitinib were more likely to have clear or almost clear skin and improved quality of life after 12 weeks of continued treatment with abrocitinib. Rapid itch relief did not appear to increase the likelihood of clear skin at week 12 in people who received dupilumab. Larger studies are needed to confirm this result. This study provides important evidence for physicians as they analyze itch relief and determine treatment options for people with AD.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has changed the melanoma treatment spectrum. Few studies have examined the characteristics and long-term outcomes of patients achieving complete response (CR) under ICI.We evaluated patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma treated with first-line ICI. The characteristics of those achieving CR were compared with those not achieving CR. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Late-onset toxicities, response to second-line treatment, the prognostic value of clinicopathologic features, and blood markers were examined.A total of 265 patients were included; 41 (15.5%) achieved CR, while 224 (84.5%) had progressive disease, stable disease, or partial response. At the therapy start, those who had CR were more likely to be older than 65 years of age (p = 0.013), have a platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio below 213 (p = 0.036), and have lower lactate dehydrogenase levels (p = 0.008) than those not achieving a CR. For those who discontinued therapy after CR, the median follow-up time after CR was 56 months (interquartile range [IQR] 52-58) and the median time from CR to therapy end was 10 months (IQR 1-17). Five-year PFS after CR was 79% and 5-year OS was 83%. Most complete responders had a normalization of S100 at the time of CR (p < 0.001). In simple Cox regression analysis, age below 77 years at CR (p = 0.04) was associated with better prognosis after CR. Eight patients received second-line ICI; disease control was seen in 63%. Late immune-related toxicities occurred in 25% of patients, most being cutaneous immune-related toxicities.Response, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, is, until now, the most important prognostic factor, and CR is a valid surrogate marker for long-term survival in patients treated with ICI. Our results highlight the importance of investigating the optimal therapy duration in complete responders.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to compare therapeutic response among patients with early-onset psoriasis (EOP) and late-onset psoriasis (LOP) receiving adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ustekinumab, or methotrexate in the Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR). Patients were grouped by age of onset: EOP (age ≤ 40 years) or LOP (age > 40 years). Repeated-measures analysis with logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (AOR; adjusted for baseline characteristics) for achieving a Physician's Global Assessment score of cleared/minimal (PGA 0/1) or a percentage of body surface area involved with psoriasis < 3% (%BSA < 3) or %BSA < 1 for all patients; similar sensitivity analyses were performed for each treatment group. Of 7511 patients, 5479 (72.9%) had EOP. The LOP group had a higher likelihood of achieving PGA 0/1 after treatment than did the EOP group in all patients (AOR 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.25]; p = 0.0019); the same was true in subgroups of etanercept-treated (AOR 1.38 [95% CI 1.14–1.66]; p = 0.0010) and methotrexate-treated (AOR 1.62 [95% CI 1.16–2.26]; p = 0.0049) patients. No significant difference was found between the EOP and LOP groups with regard to the likelihood of achieving %BSA < 3 or %BSA < 1 among all patients. However, LOP patients were more likely than EOP patients to achieve %BSA < 3 or %BSA < 1 in subgroups treated with infliximab (AOR 1.45 [95% CI 1.09–1.93; p = 0.0103] and AOR 1.36 [95% CI 1.03–1.78; p = 0.0290], respectively) and etanercept (AOR 1.30 [95% CI 1.06–1.61; p = 0.0123] and AOR 1.34 [95% CI 1.09–1.64; p = 0.0053], respectively). Our real-world data from PSOLAR indicate that there are differences in some patient characteristics between EOP and LOP and that patients with EOP are less likely than those with LOP to respond to certain systemic treatments.

    "abstract": "The recent advent of numerous clinical trials for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis has led to new and emerging therapeutic options for this chronic inflammatory skin disease. With this rapid development has come a lack of consistency in study designs, trial conduct, and statistical analyses. Healthcare providers are challenged to interpret how variations in study parameters may influence clinical trial results. Based on literature review and our experience as clinical trialists, we compiled a list of 22 key study parameters of contemporary clinical trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and ranked the top study parameters that may have a significant effect on efficacy results. The top parameters included study comparators, rules for rescue treatment, washout periods for topical and systemic treatments, inclusion criteria such as disease severity by Eczema Area and Severity Index and/or Investigator Global Assessment scores, and the duration of the screening period. We describe considerations for these key parameters, with a focus on between-parameter interactions and effect on efficacy results. This may serve to inform the interpretation of atopic dermatitis clinical trials and raise the profile of the need to harmonize the clinical trial design.Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disease characterized by red, itchy skin that is highly burdensome for patients. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease have large, inflamed skin areas with frequent itching. Recently, the number of clinical trials for drugs that treat moderate-to-severe AD has rapidly increased, with differences in how these trials are designed. There is a need for healthcare providers examining results from different clinical trials to understand how trial design factors might influence study outcomes. In this article, we identify key trial design factors that impact study outcomes, detail how these factors can impact clinical trial results, and explore how these factors interact with one another to affect study outcomes. The five most important design factors, as determined via author surveys, were study comparators (a placebo and/or another drug to which the drug being studied is compared); the rules for the use of rescue treatment (a form of treatment given if an enrolled participant has uncontrolled AD symptoms); washout periods (the time before the trial when previous treatments are stopped to allow them to be cleared from a patient’s system); inclusion criteria (that determine which participants are included); and the length of the screening period (the time when patients are assessed to determine if they qualify for participation). By understanding how these key trial design factors impact on study outcomes, healthcare providers may be equipped to better interpret different AD clinical trials. This work also emphasizes the value of harmonizing the AD clinical trial design.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathic itch is a type of chronic pruritus resulting from neural dysfunction along the afferent pathway. It is often accompanied by abnormal sensations such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, or hypoesthesia. This condition, which may involve motor or autonomic neural damage, significantly impacts patients' quality of life, causing severe itch and associated comorbidities such as depression, disrupted sleep, and social strain. Neuropathic itch accounts for 8% of chronic pruritus cases, though this may be underestimated. This comprehensive review focuses on nerve impingement as the primary pathophysiological mechanism for various forms of neuropathic itch including brachioradial pruritus (BRP), notalgia paresthetica (NP), and anogenital itch. BRP, often seen in middle-aged white women, manifests as pruritus in the dorsolateral forearms typically exacerbated by ultraviolet (UV) exposure and related to cervical spine pathology. NP, prevalent in middle-aged women, presents as pruritus in the upper back due to thoracic spine nerve compression. Anogenital pruritus, affecting 1-5% of adults, is often linked to lumbosacral spine issues after ruling out dermatologic conditions such as lichen sclerosus or lichen simplex chronicus. The pathophysiology of neuropathic itch involves both peripheral and central mechanisms, with nerve damage being a key factor. Diagnosis requires a thorough history, physical examination, and potentially imaging studies. Topical agents such as menthol, capsaicin, and lidocaine are used for mild cases, while systemic medications such as gabapentin, pregabalin, and antidepressants are prescribed for moderate to severe cases; however, no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies currently exist specifically for neuropathic itch. Understanding the underlying neural dysfunction and appropriate therapeutic strategies is crucial for managing neuropathic itch effectively.",

    "abstract": "Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a rare and difficult-to-treat, small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis presenting with recurrent long-lasting wheals. So far, no guidelines and treatment algorithms exist that could help clinicians with the management of UV. In this review, we describe evidence on systemic treatments used for UV and propose a clinical decision-making algorithm for UV management based on the Urticarial Vasculitis Activity Score assessed for 7 days (UVAS7). Patients with occasional UV-like urticarial lesions and patients with UV with skin-limited manifestations and/or mild arthralgia/malaise (total UVAS7 ≤7 of 70) can be initially treated using the step-wise algorithm for chronic urticaria including second-generation H1-antihistamines, omalizumab, and cyclosporine A. Patients with UV with more severe symptoms (UVAS7 >7), especially those with hypocomplementemic UV, may require a multidisciplinary approach, particularly if underlying diseases, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer, or infection, are present. Immunomodulatory therapy is based on clinical signs and symptoms, and the drug availability and safety profile, and includes systemic corticosteroids, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, anti-interleukin-1 agents, and other therapies. The level of evidence for all UV treatments is low. Prospective studies with current and novel drugs are needed and could provide further insights into UV pathogenesis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is rare neutrophil skin disease causing painful, progressively enlarging ulcers. Among the treatment options, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a therapy of first choice for paraneoplastic PG. Otherwise, it is used in therapy-refractory courses. To assess the efficacy and safety of IVIG therapy in patients with PG. A retrospective chart review for patients in five dermatologic wound centres in Germany was performed. Overall, 81 patients were included. IVIG was used as adjunct therapy with (methyl-) prednisolone and/or a steroid sparing therapy in 77 (95.1%) cases. Response to treatment (combined complete and partial, defined as tendency to heal and cessation of lesion progression, respectively) was 49.3% 1 month after initiation of IVIG. In total 18.8% had a complete response after 6 months. Statistically significantly higher response rates were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease [odds ratio (OR) 3.49, confidence interval (CI) 1.13–10.80 and OR 6.64, CI 1.01–43.57, respectively]. Patients with solid malignancy tended to have better response (OR 4.36, CI 0.79–23.91). A higher IVIG dose was also associated with a tendency towards better response rates (OR 2.70, CI 0.84–8.63). In total, 1 (1.2%) severe adverse event (myocardial infarction with consequent death) was observed as well as three moderate adverse events, with two thromboembolic events (2.5%) and one acute kidney injury (1.2%). Other adverse events were mild or unlikely to be associated with IVIG therapy, with 14 events in 10 patients overall (12.3%). This multicentre retrospective study shows the important role of adjunctive IVIG therapy in patients with PG with recalcitrant courses. Identifying subgroups with a higher probability of response could improve future response rates and save patients from ineffective treatment and potential adverse events.",

    "abstract": "There are limited data from randomized controlled clinical trials on the outcomes of biologics after discontinuation of a different systemic therapy. To determine the efficacy of adalimumab in patients who previously received systemic therapy (including failed therapy), we performed a pooled post hoc analysis of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Patients from the M02-528, REVEAL, and CHAMPION studies who were previously exposed to systemic treatment were categorized based on their response. The efficacy of adalimumab compared with placebo was analyzed at the end of the double-blind treatment period for the overall pooled intent-to-treat population (N = 1469) and subgroups that received (n = 780) or did not respond to (n = 229) previous systemic pretreatments. Rates for an improvement of ≥75 % from baseline in the PASI score (PASI75 response) were significantly greater (p < 0.001) at week 16 in patients treated with adalimumab compared with patients who received placebo in the overall (72.1 vs. 8.0 %, respectively), previously treated (72.7 vs. 8.5 %), and previously failed treatment (70.4 vs. 8.1 %) groups. PASI75 response rates were similar in the overall group and in patients who did not respond to methotrexate, cyclosporine, or psoralen plus ultraviolet A therapy. Improvements of ≥90 or ≥100 % from baseline PASI score were also higher with adalimumab vs. placebo in previously treated patients. Adverse events were similar among subgroups. Adalimumab was efficacious for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis regardless of prior exposure to systemic therapies or failure of those prior therapies.

    "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as acne inversa, is a recurring, painful, chronic, and sometimes disfiguring inflammatory skin disease. Our objective was to report the baseline clinical characteristics, natural history, and associated outcomes of patients with HS from the ongoing, prospective, non-interventional UNITE registry that is collecting data regarding the natural history and associated outcomes of HS. Patients with inflammatory HS lesions were enrolled, including adolescents (aged 12 to < 18 years) and adults (aged ≥ 18 years). None had participated in previous or current originator-adalimumab studies/registries. Patients received treatment consistent with site-specific, routine clinical practice. HS disease status was assessed by HS lesions and disease flare; treatment and outcomes data were collected at enrolment and every 6 months for ≤ 4 years. Enrolment (N = 594; 89.1% adults; 10.9% adolescents) occurred from 29 October 2013 to 29 December 2015 at 73 sites in 12 countries. At baseline, the majority were female (69.7%) and White (81.2%), had moderate-to-severe disease (Hurley stage II or III; 93.3%), and had undergone prior procedures/surgery for HS (68.7%). In total, 61.6% of adults and 49.2% of adolescents were obese; 40.2% of patients reported current tobacco use. Scarring due to lesions occurred in 91.2% of patients. The prevalence of comorbidities of interest was as follows: depression (13.3%), other psychiatric disorders (9.6%), inflammatory bowel disease (2.7%), diabetes (9.1%), and polycystic ovary syndrome (5.2%). In this population from the UNITE HS registry, obesity and smoking were common, and disease burden was high, manifesting as multiple lesions, scarring, surgical history, and considerable comorbidities.",

Increasing alcohol use is associated with worsening psoriasis severity, is a risk factor for poor response to systemic treatments and may impact on comorbidities such as psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, cancer and liver disease. Harmful alcohol use and alcohol dependency can be defined by the updated ICD-11 coding system and screening can be completed using many tools including the Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-Opener (CAGE), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) questionnaires. Dermatologists may be able to complete brief interventions encouraging alcohol reduction in psoriasis patients. Psoriasis patients may respond to messages of gain with reduced psoriasis severity and loss with reduced cardiovascular risk. It is important for dermatologists to discuss alcohol with all psoriasis patients, to be aware of the impact of alcohol in psoriasis and to familiarise themselves with screening tools, brief intervention and local services available to patients who require specialist input for harmful alcohol use or alcohol dependency.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abrocitinib, an oral, once-daily Janus kinase 1-selective inhibitor, improved itch severity, sleep, and work productivity versus placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate relationships among itch, sleep, and work productivity in the phase III JADE MONO-2 clinical trial. METHODS: A repeated-measures longitudinal model was used to examine relationships between itch (using the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [PP-NRS] or Nighttime Itch Scale [NTIS]) and sleep disturbance/loss (using the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure sleep item and SCORing AD Sleep Loss Visual Analog Scale) and, separately, between itch and work productivity (using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 questionnaire). Mediation modelling was used to investigate the effect of treatment (abrocitinib vs placebo) on work impairment via improvements in itch and sleep. RESULTS: The relationships between itch/sleep and itch/work productivity were approximately linear. PP-NRS scores of 0, 4-6, and 10 were associated with 0 days, 3-4 days, and 7 days per week of disturbed sleep, respectively. PP-NRS or NTIS scores of 0-1, 4-5, and 10 were associated with 0-10%, 20-30%, and >50% overall work impairment, respectively. Seventy-five percent of the effect of abrocitinib on reducing work impairment was indirectly mediated by improvement in itch, followed by sleep. CONCLUSION: These results quantitatively demonstrate that reducing itch severity is associated with improvements in sleep and work productivity. Empirical evidence for the mechanism of action of abrocitinib showed that itch severity is improved, which reduces sleep loss/sleep disruption and, in turn, improves work productivity.

    "abstract": "The different cutaneous leishmaniases are distinct in their etiology, epidemiology, transmission, and geographical distribution. In most instances cutaneous leishmaniasis is limited to one or a few skin ulcers that develop at the site where the parasites were deposited during the bite of the sandfly vector. Lesions typically heal spontaneously after several months but some lesions can be large and follow a chronic, more severe course. Protective immunity is usually acquired following cutaneous infection with Leishmania spp., so prevention of disease through prophylactic immunization appears to be feasible. Since vaccination with live, virulent parasites is associated with an unacceptable rate of adverse events, attention has turned to the use of killed or attenuated parasite vaccines and defined subunit vaccines. Whole parasite vaccines have the advantage of delivering multiple antigenic epitopes that may be necessary for initiation of a broad-based immune response. Persistent or repeated immune-stimulation by parasite antigens and/or sustained expression of interleukin-12 appear to be critical elements in the development of durable immunity. A number of purified or recombinant antigens, when co-administered with a vaccine adjuvant, appear promising as vaccine candidates against cutaneous leishmaniasis. The sustained expression of recombinant Leishmania antigens by vaccination with DNA is an attractive approach because it mimics the persistent antigenic stimulation of subclinical infection. Effective vaccine-induced immunity must generate an antigen-specific memory T cell population that, upon exposure to the infecting parasite, rapidly produces a type 1 effector T cell response that leads to interferon-gamma-mediated activation of infected macrophages to kill the intracellular parasites. This parasite-directed recall response must be prompt and of sufficient magnitude to overcome the subversive effect that the intracellular infection has on macrophage effector function.

    "abstract": "Brodalumab is a fully human anti–interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody efficacious for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. This study summarizes malignancy rates in psoriasis clinical studies of brodalumab. Data were pooled from one phase II study and three large, multicenter, phase III randomized studies of brodalumab for the treatment of psoriasis, including two studies with randomization to brodalumab, ustekinumab, or placebo. Data from the 52-week (brodalumab and ustekinumab) and long-term (brodalumab) pools were summarized as exposure-adjusted or follow-up time-adjusted event rates per 100 patient-years (PY). Exposure-adjusted event rates per 100 PY at 52 weeks were lower with brodalumab (n = 4019; 3446 total PY of exposure) than with ustekinumab (n = 613; 495 total PY of exposure), including adjudicated malignancies (0.9 vs 2.6) and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-adjudicated malignancies (0.3 vs 0.4). The exposure-adjusted event rate of adjudicated malignancies in the brodalumab group remained stable in the long-term analysis (0.9 [82 events]). Rates of malignancy among brodalumab-treated patients with psoriasis were generally low.

    "abstract": "The impact of immune-related conditions on the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is poorly understood. Determinants of COVID-19 outcomes among patients with psoriasis are yet to be established.Th objective of this study was to characterize a large cohort of patients with psoriasis with COVID-19 and to identify predictors of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality.A population-based nested case-control study was performed using the computerized database of Clalit Health Services, Israel. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence (CIs) of predictors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality.The study population included 3151 patients with psoriasis who tested positive for COVID-19. Subclinical COVID-19 infection occurred in 2818 (89.4%) of the patients while 122 (3.9%), 71 (2.3%), 123 (3.9%), and 16 (0.5%) of the patients experienced a mild, moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Overall, 332 (10.5%) patients were hospitalized and 50 (1.6%) patients died because of COVID-19 complications. Intake of methotrexate independently predicted COVID-19-associated hospitalization (adjusted OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.11-4.78; p = 0.025). Use of biologic agents was not associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalization (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.32-1.73; p = 0.491) or mortality (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.12-6.21; p = 0.870). Older age, the presence of comorbid cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal failure independently predicted both COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality.The use of oral methotrexate was associated with an increased odds of COVID-associated hospitalization, whereas the use of biologic drugs was not associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined the effects of probiotics used perinatally on prevention or treatment of atopic disease in infants and children. However, to date, no review has examined randomized controlled trials of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, specifically, administered both prenatally and postnatally and its effect over a long period of time. The objective was to determine if L. rhamnosus either used solely or in conjunction with other probiotics demonstrates a long-term preventive effect on atopic disease in pediatric patients when used perinatally. A systematic review was undertaken to identify those studies where L. rhamnosus was used (either solely or in conjunction with other probiotics). The following databases were searched from the year 2000 through December 8, 2021: PubMed, Cochrane Reviews and Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials; systematic reviews were hand searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Meta-analytic statistical techniques were then employed. Evaluation of the incidence of atopic eczema was also examined longitudinally based on timeframe. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) assessments were employed to determine the quality of the evidence. Eleven randomized controlled trials were identified which examined L. rhamnosus in its effect on atopy. Risk of bias was low on the majority of the domains assessed. Meta-analysis of the timeframes ≤ 2 years (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47–0.75; p < 0.00001) and 6–7 years (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50–0.75; p < 0.00001) demonstrated statistically significant reductions in atopic eczema with use of L. rhamnosus. For the 4 to 5-year (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55–1.00; p = 0.05) and 10–11-year (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37–1.27; p = 0.23) timeframes there was no statistically significant reduction. GRADE assessment for each timeframe was considered moderate in two, owing to high attrition rates in all of the studies, and low in two due to imprecision. Based on the meta-analysis and GRADE assessments, the use of L. rhamnosus with or without other probiotics appears to have a positive effect in reducing the incidence of atopic eczema in pediatric patients at least out to 7 years. Attrition rates temper these findings.",

    "abstract": "Plaque psoriasis affects ~ 1% of the pediatric population, negatively impacting quality of life. The efficacy and safety of secukinumab in pediatric patients with moderate to severe or severe chronic plaque psoriasis have been established in two pivotal phase 3 trials (open-label, NCT03668613; double-blind, NCT02471144). The aims were to report the pooled safety of secukinumab up to 52 weeks from two studies in subgroups of pediatric patients stratified by age and bodyweight, and to present, alongside the pediatric data, the pooled safety data from four pivotal adult secukinumab trials. The safety of secukinumab was evaluated in subgroups of pediatric patients defined by age (6 to < 12 and 12 to < 18 years) and bodyweight (< 25 kg, 25 to < 50 kg, and ≥ 50 kg) in the pooled population. Patients received secukinumab low dose (LD; 75/75/150 mg), secukinumab high dose (HD; 75/150/300 mg), placebo, or etanercept (0.8 mg/kg). For safety analyses, data were pooled from the pediatric studies NCT03668613 and NCT02471144, and presented alongside the pooled data from four adult pivotal studies (NCT01365455, NCT01636687, NCT01358578, NCT01555125). A total of 198 pediatric patients (overall exposure: 184.6 patient-years [PY]) and 1989 adult patients (1749.5 PY) receiving secukinumab up to week 52 were included in this analysis. At week 52, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was lower in the lower age and bodyweight subgroups. The AEs reported within these subgroups were consistent with the overall AEs reported in this analysis. Overall, exposure-adjusted incidence rates for treatment-emergent AEs were lower in the secukinumab-treated pediatric pool (198.8/100 PY) compared with the etanercept (266.3/100 PY) and adult pools (256.1/100 PY). Up to 52 weeks, the incidence rates of the AEs in the secukinumab-treated patients in the 6 to < 12 years subgroup and 12 to < 18 years subgroup were 167.7/100 PY and 214.7/100 PY, respectively. Similarly, incidence rates of the AEs in the secukinumab-treated patients in the < 25 kg, 25 kg to < 50 kg, and ≥ 50 kg subgroups were 177.3/100 PY, 192.5/100 PY, and 206.8/100 PY, respectively. Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported AE in secukinumab-treated pediatric patients across age (< 12 years: 11.8/100 PY; ≥ 12 years: 42.4/100 PY) and bodyweight (< 25 kg: 22.8/100 PY; 25 kg to < 50 kg: 19.0/100 PY; ≥ 50 kg: 43.0/100 PY). Of the 198 secukinumab-treated pediatric patients, one reported nail Candida, one reported skin Candida, and two reported vulvovaginal Candida. Transient and mostly mild events of neutropenia were observed with secukinumab, none leading to study treatment discontinuation. No incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies was reported in pediatric patients treated with secukinumab. Secukinumab was well tolerated in pediatric patients with moderate to severe and severe plaque psoriasis across age and bodyweight subgroups. The overall safety profile of secukinumab in pediatric patients was consistent with that of adult patients.

    "abstract": "Cohort studies on the use of retinoids for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) have yielded contradicting results. As the clinical presentation of HS is heterogeneous, with different predilection sites and hallmark features, it can be hypothesized that HS phenotypes are associated with the effectiveness of specific retinoid treatments.The aim of this study was to evaluate the drug survival of oral retinoids in the treatment of HS and to establish predictors for longer treatment duration.A retrospective, dual-center study was conducted in the Netherlands in adult HS patients treated with oral retinoids between 2011 and 2021. Drug survival analyses were performed through Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Additionally, Cox regression models were used to determine predictors for a longer drug survival.In total, 102 patients were included. Overall drug survival of (low-dose) isotretinoin (n = 66) at 12 and 24 months was 44.2% and 15.5%, respectively. Termination of treatment was mostly due to ineffectiveness (26%). Presence of widespread comedones (p = 0.03) and the use of concomitant systemic medication (p = 0.04) were associated with a prolonged treatment duration. For acitretin (n = 36), the overall drug survival was 42.0% at 12 months and 37.4% at 24 months, and was also predominantly determined by ineffectiveness (28%). Interestingly, the scarring folliculitis phenotype (p < 0.05) was associated with prolonged drug survival time for acitretin treatment relative to the regular phenotype.Comparable drug survival rates at 12 months for isotretinoin and acitretin were found. HS patients with widespread comedones and the scarring folliculitis phenotype could benefit from treatment with isotretinoin or acitretin, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Itch is the most bothersome symptom reported by patients with psoriasis. Safe and effective treatments for psoriasis that also address itch are needed. To report effects of roflumilast cream on itch-related outcomes from a Phase 2b trial. Adults with chronic plaque psoriasis were randomized to roflumilast 0.3%, roflumilast 0.15%, or vehicle once-daily for 12 weeks. Psoriasis severity was assessed via the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA; a 5-point scale assessing plaque thickening, scaling, and erythema ranging from 0 [clear] to 4 [severe]) and ≥ 2 on a modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-HD, which combines severity of lesions and area affected, ranging from 0 [no disease] to 72 [maximal disease], with the actual percentage of the anatomical area involved in those patients with < 10% of anatomical area involved [e.g., 0.1 for 1% to 0.9 for 9%]). Itch was evaluated via Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS), Psoriasis Symptom Diary (PSD) Items 1 (severity of itch) and 2 (bother of itch), and itch-related sleep loss NRS scores. Post hoc correlation analyses between WI-NRS and PASI, WI-NRS and itch-related sleep loss, and WI-NRS and DLQI were also performed. Roflumilast-treated patients had significantly greater improvements than vehicle-treated patients in WI-NRS and PSD Items 1 and 2 beginning at Week 2 and in itch-related sleep loss Weeks 6 through 12. Among patients with baseline WI-NRS ≥ 6, significantly more patients achieved ≥ 4-point improvement with roflumilast than with vehicle as early as Week 2. Itch severity had low correlation with PASI while WI-NRS and IGA were not always aligned. The first assessment was at 2 weeks, limiting the ability to assess early onset of itch response. Roflumilast cream improved itch and itch-related sleep loss associated with chronic plaque psoriasis. NCT03638258.",

    "abstract": "Acne vulgaris, hirsutism, seborrhea and female pattern hair loss (FPHL) are common disorders of the pilosebaceous unit (PSU). In some women with hyperandrogenemia, an excess of androgens at the PSU can lead to the development of these dermatological manifestations. These manifestations can cause many psychiatric and psychological implications, such as social fears and anxiety, and can adversely affect quality of life. High androgen levels at the PSU as a possible underlying cause of acne vulgaris, hirsutism, seborrhea and FPHL supports the rationale for using combined oral contraceptives for the management of these conditions in women. The purpose of this review is to describe these dermatological manifestations of the PSU and the management of these conditions through the use of the oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol/chlormadinone acetate (EE/CMA). EE/CMA 0.03/2mg is a combined monophasic contraceptive pill with anti-androgenic properties. It is approved in Europe for contraception and has been investigated in phase III trials for the treatment of acne. EE/CMA was better than placebo and similar to another low-dose oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel) in improving symptoms of acne in two phase III randomized controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate papulopustular acne. In addition, in trials investigating the contraceptive efficacy of EE/CMA, limited data suggest that there were also improvements in hirsutism, FPHL and seborrhea in small subgroups of patients. EE/CMA has a good safety profile. The most commonly reported adverse events are breast tenderness/pain, headache/migraine and nausea. Evidence in the literature indicates that the use of EE/CMA for the treatment of dermatological disorders under the control of androgens may be a valid treatment option. Further investigation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Available treatment options for anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are limited by low response rates and frequent recurrences. Cryotherapy is an established therapeutic option for several pre-malignant skin disorders.This retrospective, non-randomized study included HIV-positive MSM who received intra- and/or perianal HSIL cryotherapy treatment between 30 December 2008 and 23 April 2015. Cryotherapy was applied in sessions 4-6 weeks apart for a maximum of five sessions. Patients received a follow-up high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) to assess treatment response. Complete and partial treatment responders were followed-up after 6 months and then every 6-12 months to investigate recurrent HSILs.Of 64 patients [median age 48 years; interquartile range (IQR) 42-56] included in the study, six were lost to follow-up. In total, 35 (60%) of 58 patients responded to treatment. Of 64 patients, 31 (48%) reported one or more side effects, of which anal pain or tenderness and mild blood loss were reported most frequently. A total of 19 patients who responded to cryotherapy were adequately followed-up for over 18 months, of whom 13 (68%) had recurrent HSILs.Cryotherapy is capable of clearing HSIL in HIV-positive MSM, and treatment success rates are comparable with those reported for current treatment modalities. The treatment is well tolerated, and side effects are relatively mild. Future studies should therefore compare the efficacy and tolerability of cryotherapy with those of current treatment modalities in randomized controlled trials.",

    "abstract": "Compounded cantharidin has been used for decades to treat molluscum contagiosum but lacks rigorous clinical evidence to support its safety and efficacy. VP-102 is a shelf-stable drug–device combination product that contains topical cantharidin (0.7% weight/volume [w/v]) and is being evaluated for the treatment of molluscum. Our objective was to present pooled safety and efficacy analyses of VP-102 in the treatment of molluscum compared with vehicle. Participants aged ≥ 2 years were randomized 3:2 to topical administration of VP-102 or vehicle in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase III trials. Study drug was applied to all baseline and new lesions once every 21 days until clear or for a maximum of four applications. Assessors blinded to treatment counted all lesions at each study visit. All adverse events (AEs) were documented. Data were pooled for analyses. In total, 310 participants received VP-102 and 218 received vehicle. Mean age was 7.5 years (range 2–60) for VP-102 and 6.8 (2–54) for vehicle. Complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at day 84 occurred in 50% of VP-102 participants and 15.6% of vehicle recipients (p < 0.0001). Mean molluscum lesion counts decreased 76% for VP-102 and 0.3% for vehicle at day 84 (p < 0.0001). The most common AEs in the VP-102 group were application site blistering, pruritus, pain, and erythema, which were generally mild or moderate in severity. Pooled analyses showed a significantly higher percentage of participants with complete molluscum lesion clearance and larger reductions in lesion counts with VP-102 than with vehicle. AEs were anticipated because of the pharmacodynamic properties of cantharidin.

    "abstract": "Capillary malformations of the head and neck region often cause psychological and physical burden. As the effectiveness of modern laser and light therapies is still suboptimal, patients often seek different therapeutic strategies. Other recognized, but not routinely proposed therapies include cosmetic camouflage, surgery, and medical tattooing. Information on therapeutic outcomes is currently lacking for patients to adequately participate in the treatment decision-making process. The objective of this systematic review was to review the effectiveness and safety of recognized therapies for untreated capillary malformations of the head and neck: laser and light treatment modalities, photodynamic therapy, cosmetic camouflage, medical tattooing, and surgery. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to 16 December, 2020 for observational and experimental studies examining recognized therapies for untreated capillary malformations of the head and neck. Two reviewers independently evaluated the risk of bias of included studies. Predefined treatment and safety outcomes of pooled data were scored using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We included 48 observational and three randomized studies (totaling 3068 patients), evaluating nine different therapies. No studies on surgery or cosmetic camouflage matched our inclusion criteria. The pooled proportion of patients reaching a ≥75% clearance was 43% (95% confidence interval 24–64%; I2 = 55%) for the pulsed dye laser after three to eight treatment sessions (GRADE score: very low). Other therapies were less effective. Hyperpigmentation was most frequently described after the pulsed dye laser (incidences up to 40%). Pain was most common after photodynamic therapy, yet the intensity was unreported. Substantial heterogeneity among studies as to patient characteristics and outcomes limited pooling and data comparisons. The pulsed dye laser seems preferable for treatment-naive capillary malformations of the head and neck region, yet demonstrates greater hyperpigmentation rates compared with other therapies. Our results are, however, based on low-quality evidence. Future studies using uniform outcome measures and validated metrics are warranted for study comparability. Based on this systematic review, clinicians and patients should be aware of the limited evidence about the available options when making (shared) treatment decisions for capillary malformations.

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can negatively impact work productivity and daily activities. Ruxolitinib cream, a Janus kinase inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with atopic dermatitis in two phase III studies (TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2).This post hoc analysis sought to describe the effects of ruxolitinib cream on work productivity and activity impairment from pooled data from the phase III studies, to estimate indirect costs due to atopic dermatitis, and to estimate the incremental cost savings with ruxolitinib cream versus vehicle cream.Patients in both studies were ≥ 12 years old with atopic dermatitis for ≥ 2 years, an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 2 or 3, and a 3-20% affected body surface area at baseline. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive ruxolitinib cream (0.75% or 1.5%) or vehicle cream for 8 weeks. Patient self-reported productivity in the efficacy-evaluable population was assessed at weeks 2, 4, and 8 using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Specific Health Problem version 2.0. Statistical significance for the two doses versus vehicle was calculated using an analysis of covariance. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment overall work impairment scores were converted to a model of costs per employed patient due to lost productivity and incremental cost savings from ruxolitinib cream treatment using a human capital approach.Of 1249 patients enrolled (median age, 32 years; female sex, 61.7%), 1208 were included in the efficacy-evaluable population. Patients applying 0.75% or 1.5% ruxolitinib cream had significant changes in overall work impairment (- 17.9% [0.75% strength] and - 15.0% [1.5% strength] vs - 5.7% for vehicle; p < 0.0001 for both) and daily activity impairment (- 20.6% [0.75% strength] and - 21.5% [1.5% strength] vs - 10.6% for vehicle; p < 0.0001 for both). These corresponded to estimated lost productivity costs in 2021 US dollars of $1313 (0.75% strength) and $1242 (1.5% strength) versus $2008 (vehicle) over the 8-week trial period. Compared with a patient receiving vehicle, incremental annual indirect cost savings were estimated to be $5302 with 0.75% ruxolitinib cream and $4228 with 1.5% ruxolitinib cream.Ruxolitinib cream therapy is associated with improved work productivity and daily activity compared with vehicle and is estimated to reduce the indirect cost burden on the patient.ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03745638 (registered 19 November, 2018) and NCT03745651 (registered 19 November, 2018).",

    "abstract": "Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a prevalent dermatological condition characterized by a distinctive herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions, often forming a \"Christmas tree\" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains uncertain, with hypotheses pointing to both infectious and noninfectious origins. Human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated, with evidence suggesting viral reactivation as a potential trigger. Epidemiologically, PR affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence in females. The condition is observed globally, with varying incidence rates and seasonal variations, suggesting an infectious component. While PR is generally benign and self-limiting, it can cause significant discomfort owing to pruritus, and atypical presentations and recurrences complicate diagnosis and management. This review evaluates the current understanding of PR's pathogenesis, highlighting both infectious and noninfectious hypotheses, including viral reactivation and immune response mechanisms. It also examines treatment options, such as antivirals and phototherapy, which have shown varying degrees of effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify etiological factors and to explore the efficacy and safety of various treatment modalities. Understanding these aspects is crucial for improving patient outcomes and developing targeted therapies, especially for atypical or recurrent cases.",

    "abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by nonscarring hair loss of the scalp, face, and/or body. Three therapies have been approved for the treatment of severe AA; however, there are several different approaches for defining disease severity. Therefore, severity assessment tools are helpful in determining the appropriate treatment approach and evaluating treatment response in patients with AA. This vodcast discusses tools for assessing AA severity, including the Severity of Alopecia Tool, AA Scale, and AA Severity and Morbidity Index. It is suggested that severity assessments should include factors beyond just scalp hair loss, with the AA Scale including secondary clinical features, such as involvement of eyebrows and eyelashes. Moreover, AA can significantly impact patient's quality of life; therefore, measuring the psychosocial impacts of AA is as important as measuring the physical effects. Some of the measures to assess the negative impact on the quality of life of patients with AA include the Dermatology Life Quality Index, Alopecia Areata Symptom Impact Scale, and Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index. Behavioral changes due to AA could also be considered when assessing psychosocial impacts, particularly for adolescents, who may experience bullying, which can lead to school avoidance, anxiety, and depression. In summary, when assessing severity of AA to inform treatment decisions, clinicians should be guided by evidence-based tools, with additional consideration of factors beyond scalp hair loss, such as impairment in activity, mental health, and wellbeing.

    "abstract": "The growing availability of targeted immunomodulatory therapies has transformed the treatment landscape for chronic inflammatory skin diseases. However, treatment selection remains largely empirical, often guided more by trial-and-error and insurance mandates than by an individual patient's underlying disease biology. This disconnect between therapeutic strategy and the need to address and calibrate for patient molecular heterogeneity undermines clinical outcomes and contributes to inefficiency in care delivery. Precision medicine offers a solution by tailoring diagnosis and treatment to the molecular and cellular features of each patient's skin disease. In this Current Opinion, we outline key clinical contexts where precision approaches can be transformative: diagnostic ambiguity, selecting treatments for an established diagnosis, and selecting treatments without a defined diagnosis or disease mechanism. We highlight advances in precision techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics that enable more refined skin disease classification and accurate prediction of drug response. Although several challenges remain before these techniques can be widely adopted, such as limited biomarker validation, high costs, and a lack of breadth in research cohorts, we argue that their potential benefits, for patients, clinicians, and the broader field of dermatologic care, substantially outweigh the associated costs. We advocate for expanded funding, population-based research, and scalable diagnostics to successfully integrate precision medicine into dermatology. By combining molecular phenotyping with traditional clinicopathologic diagnosis, precision medicine can reduce therapeutic inefficiency, improve patient outcomes, and redefine care paradigms in chronic inflammatory skin disease.",

Outcomes were assessed as change from therapy start to last observation (either data cutoff date or treatment discontinuation). Mean (±SE) EASI scores at the time of the last 3-year interim observation were consistent with mild disease in the dupilumab cohort and moderate disease in the methotrexate and cyclosporine cohorts. Improvements in pruritus were numerically greater in the dupilumab cohort relative to the methotrexate and cyclosporine cohorts, while improvements in QoL were similar in the dupilumab and methotrexate cohorts, with no significant change in the cyclosporine cohort. Rates of AD exacerbation were numerically lower with dupilumab treatment relative to methotrexate treatment which were numerically lower than cyclosporine treatment. Dupilumab discontinuation rates were numerically lower relative to methotrexate which were numerically lower than cyclosporine. This PEDISTAD 3-year interim analysis of dupilumab, methotrexate, and cyclosporine treatment in children with AD demonstrates numerically greater improvements in AD signs, symptoms and QoL with dupilumab treatment relative to methotrexate and cyclosporine [Video abstract and graphical abstract available]. NCT03687359. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, often diagnosed before 5 years of age. AD causes intense itching and negatively impacts the sleep, mood, and quality of life of affected children and their families. Children may be treated with skin creams and ointments, which are often not enough to treat all AD signs (extent and severity of disease assessed by a clinician) and symptoms (burden of disease reported by a patient and/or caregiver). The drug dupilumab is approved for use in children as young as 6 months with moderate-to-severe AD and has shown improvements in signs and symptoms in clinical trials (sponsored by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Sanofi). We compared the use of dupilumab, methotrexate, and cyclosporine in routine clinical practice in children under the age of 12 years with moderate-to-severe AD using 3-year data from the PEDISTAD study. Compared with children treated with methotrexate and cyclosporine, children treated with dupilumab had greater improvements in the extent and severity of their AD, as assessed by their doctor. Children treated with dupilumab also showed greater improvements in how they described the severity of their symptoms, such as daytime/nighttime itching, and their quality of life. Fewer children using dupilumab stopped treatment and fewer reported side effects compared with those using methotrexate and cyclosporine. In summary, dupilumab-treated children had greater improvements in AD signs, AD symptoms, and quality of life, were more likely to continue treatment, and had fewer reported side effects than those given cyclosporine and methotrexate.",

    "abstract": "Recent phase II trials have shown that BRAF/MEK inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors are active in patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM), reporting intracranial disease control rates of 50–75%. Furthermore, retrospective analyses suggest that combining stereotactic radiosurgery with immune checkpoint inhibitors or BRAF/MEK inhibitors prolongs overall survival. These data stress the need for inter- and multidisciplinary cooperation that takes into account the individual prognostic factors in order to establish the best treatment for each patient. Although the management of MBM has dramatically improved, a substantial number of patients still progress and die from brain metastases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for prospective studies in patients with MBM that focus on treatment combinations and sequences, new treatment strategies, and biomarkers of treatment response. Moreover, further research is needed to decipher brain-specific mechanisms of therapy resistance.",

Patients diagnosed with psoriasis were identified using fee-for-service Medicare International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes assigned by dermatologists or rheumatologists. Self-administered questionnaires were used to obtain information on demographics, medical history, and smoking and alcohol habits. Hazard ratios from Cox regression models were adjusted for ethnicity, income, body mass index, and history of non-melanoma skin cancer and were stratified on age and on randomization status in the Women's Health Initiative study components.In the initial statistical model, past and current alcohol drinkers had higher risks of psoriasis compared with never-drinkers (P-trend < 0.001). This association was not observed after adjusting for cigarette smoking (P-trend: 0.478). The effect of alcohol (by status, frequency, and alcohol subtype) isolated by stratifying the analysis by smoking status (i.e., among never smokers) showed no association with psoriasis. Smoking showed an increasing risk for psoriasis with greater pack-years compared with those who have never smoked (P-trend: < 0.001). Compared to smokers at baseline, past smokers had a lower risk of psoriasis across women who smoked 5-14 cigarettes per day (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.88) and across women who smoked for 5-24 years (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.46-0.90).These findings indicate that alcohol consumption does not modulate smoking-related psoriasis risk. Cigarette smoking, but not alcohol consumption, is an independent risk factor for psoriasis in postmenopausal women. As greater pack-years was associated with a higher risk of psoriasis and smoking cessation was conversely associated with a lower risk of psoriasis for moderate smokers, a greater emphasis on smoking abstinence and cessation counseling may benefit patients who already have other risk factors for psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "There are limited data on clinical outcomes and prognosis factors for bullous pemphigoid (BP) at long-term follow-up. We aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors in BP patients. This retrospective study was performed between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2023 in Shandong Province, China. The primary outcomes were the rates and predictive factors of mortality, complete remission off-therapy (CROT), and relapse by Cox proportional hazards models or logistic regression analyses. Nomograms for BP mortality and CROT were also described. Of the 1063 BP patients enrolled, 45 were excluded due to loss to follow-up. The cohort comprised 1018 BP patients to analyze. A total of 344 (33.8%) patients died, with cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality rates of 22.8%, 31.2%, and 34.5%, respectively. Increased age at onset (HR = 1.08), body surface area (BSA) involvement 10–30%, BSA involvement > 30% (HR = 7.19; HR = 9.84, respectively), double-positive IgG and C3 on DIF (HR = 1.37), and systemic corticosteroid in combination with immunosuppressants treatments (HR = 0.50) were associated with mortality. A total of 321 (31.5%) patients achieved CROT. Cumulative CROT rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 10.9%, 32.9%, and 47.5%, respectively. Shorter diagnosis delay time (HR = 1.01), baseline anti-BP180 antibody < 50 IU/mL (HR = 1.48) and systemic drugs other than corticosteroid treatment (HR = 1.68) were associated with CROT. Predictive models demonstrated outstanding performance in classifying mortality at 1, 3, and 5 years (AUCs 0.83, 0.86, 0.88), but moderate classification for CROT (AUCs 0.67, 0.62, 0.63). A total of 749 (73.6%) patients experienced relapses. This study, the first large cohort to examine long-term outcomes in BP patients, identifies risk factors for mortality and CROT, offering key insights for clinicians to improve prognosis and reduce relapse rates.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory disease requiring long-term therapy. Risankizumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, is approved to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults. The aim was to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of continuous risankizumab treatment through 6 years in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. LIMMitless, a phase 3, open-label extension study, evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis following multiple phase 2/3 base studies. Patients randomized to risankizumab 150 mg at baseline of the base studies (≤ 52 weeks) were eligible to enroll in the LIMMitless study, in which they received risankizumab 150 mg subcutaneously every 12 weeks for an additional 252 weeks. This final analysis assessed safety (treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAEs]) through 324 weeks and efficacy (including proportions of patients who achieved ≥ 90%/100% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI 90/PASI 100], static Physician's Global Assessment of clear or almost clear [sPGA 0/1], or Dermatology Life Quality Index of no effect on patient's quality of life [DLQI 0/1]) through 304 weeks. Of 897 patients enrolled in the LIMMitless study, 661 completed the study for a total of 4921.2 patient years of exposure to risankizumab. Rates of TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, and TEAEs of safety interest were low and consistent with rates observed in previous studies. During the base studies, risankizumab treatment demonstrated high rates of rapid and durable efficacy through 52 weeks; risankizumab treatment also maintained or further improved efficacy and quality-of-life outcomes in the LIMMitless study. At week 304, 86.0% of patients achieved PASI 90, 54.2% achieved PASI 100, 84.7% achieved sPGA 0/1, and 76.3% achieved DLQI 0/1 (using modified nonresponder imputation). Long-term risankizumab was well tolerated and demonstrated high and durable efficacy through 6 years of continuous treatment. NCT03047395.",

    "abstract": "Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), also known as neurodermatitis, is a common chronic pruritic dermatosis defined by lichenified plaques resulting from persistent scratching. Though often secondary to underlying dermatologic, systemic, or psychological triggers, LSC represents a distinct clinical entity with significant morbidity. The hallmark itch-scratch cycle contributes not only to visible skin changes but also to substantial sleep disruption, emotional distress, and functional impairment. Psychological stress, anxiety, and depression are frequent comorbidities and can further perpetuate disease chronicity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evolving understanding of LSC, from its neuroimmune-driven pathogenesis to the wide spectrum of therapeutic strategies currently available. In addition to topical corticosteroids, novel approaches including immunomodulators, neuromodulators, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and biologics are being increasingly explored. Procedural therapies such as cryotherapy, fractional laser resurfacing, and botulinum toxin injections, have also emerged as valuable tools, particularly in treatment-refractory cases. Recent insights into type 2 inflammation and dysregulated sensory pathways have informed the rationale for these targeted strategies. In anatomically sensitive areas such as the genital region, where topical agents may be poorly tolerated, systemic treatments may be required. Given this complexity, individualized, multimodal treatment plans are critical to optimizing management and improving quality of life (QoL) in patients with LSC. By synthesizing current data on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and both established and emerging therapies, this review aims to guide clinicians in optimizing care for patients with LSC and addressing its far-reaching psychosocial burden.",

    "abstract": "Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare subtype of psoriasis with widespread skin lesions, with some patients experiencing severe systemic symptoms. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence-driven model for accurate classification of erythrodermic psoriasis severity by integrating clinical and laboratory indicators. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (2005-22). Patients were divided into mild and moderate-to-severe groups using k-means clustering. After imputing missing values, we trained seven candidate algorithms-K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Bayesian classifier, and logistic regression-using repeated, stratified ten-fold cross-validation with three repeats (10 × 3 CV); performance was summarized by the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across folds. Feature importance was assessed using SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations), a game-theoretic approach that quantifies each features contribution to individual model predictions, ten indicators were incorporated into a diagnostic scoring system. The optimal cut-off for mild/moderate-to-severe cases classification was selected with the Youden index on the cross-validated receiver operating characteristic curve. Of 260 screened records, 242 erythrodermic patients met the study criteria. Histology confirmed psoriasis in 108 cases, while the remaining patients were diagnosed based on clinical presentation and medical history. K-means clustering assigned 94 patients to the moderate-to-severe group and 148 to the mild group. Moderate-to-severe erythrodermic psoriasis was characterized by a higher inflammatory burden (median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 4.11 vs 2.70, p < 0.001), more frequent fever (88% vs 41%, p < 0.001), greater edema severity (16% vs 1.4%, p < 0.001), lower albumin and higher calcium levels (both p < 0.001), and longer hospitalization (median 26 vs 20 days, p = 0.005). After adjustment for age and sex, moderate-to-severe cases required systemic therapy roughly twice as often as mild cases (odds ratio 2.21, p < 0.05). Of seven machine-learning algorithms, the Artificial Neural Network yielded the highest mean validation area under the curve. The SHAP analysis highlighted the ten most influential predictors adopted from the Artificial Neural Network-edema, edematous erythema (defined as the combination of both redness and swelling of the skin), fever, albumin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, serum calcium, white blood cell count, acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate), pruritus, and superficial lymphadenopathy-and these were converted to integer points to form the bedside score. The receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 33.5 points as the optimal threshold for distinguishing between mild and moderate-to-severe cases. The model, named 'EPICS' (Erythrodermic Psoriasis Integrated Classification System), effectively stratified patients, as evidenced by internal validation. This model is currently available online ( https://pumch-dermatology.shinyapps.io/classification/ ). The EPICS model is a robust tool for assessing erythrodermic psoriasis severity, offering precise classification based on easily accessible clinical and laboratory indicators. However, its effectiveness in clinical practice requires further validation through additional research.",

    "abstract": "Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) is a severe and rare variant of psoriasis. Clinical features include scaling and erythema affecting more than 75% of body surface area, associated with systemic symptoms such as lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, fever, fatigue, dehydration, serum electrolyte disturbances, and tachycardia, making this condition a potentially life-threatening disease. Differential diagnosis can be challenging, encompasses atopic dermatitis, cutaneous adverse drug reaction, and advanced cutaneous lymphoma. Following a correct diagnostic framing, appropriate systemic treatment must be initiated. Unfortunately, there are no recent up-to-date guidelines and standardized treatment options for EP are still lacking. To review the current reported systemic treatment options for EP. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and based on a search in MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library for articles in English from first available publication to 9 November 2024. In all, 145 studies were included in the review. Case reports and case series are the main available work, reporting heterogeneous outcomes and effectiveness with nonbiologic and biologic systemic agents. Among non-biologic systemic treatments, methotrexate and cyclosporin are the most widely reported as treatment for EP, showing clinical response in over 60% of cases, with cyclosporine offering a faster onset of action and being suitable for acute management. Available randomized controlled trials include patients with EP treated with etretinate, infliximab, certolizumab-pegol (CZP), Ixekizumab, guselkumab, risankizumab, and deucravacitinib. However, these trials were not specifically designed for erythrodermic psoriasis, and the sample size of EP patients included is limited, resulting in reduced statistical power and limiting the reliability of the findings. Among TNF-α inhibitors, infliximab is the most reported agent, with data on 103 patients. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) also showed promising results, with PASI 75 achieved in over 80% of patients at 52 weeks. A retrospective analysis comparing infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, and efalizumab found TNF-α inhibitors to be superior to other biologic classes. Regarding IL-17 inhibitors, secukinumab is the second most frequently studied biologic, with 93 patients reported. It demonstrated rapid efficacy, achieving PASI 75 in more than 80% of patients by week 8. A head-to-head comparison with ixekizumab showed comparable outcomes. Among IL-23 inhibitors, risankizumab led to PASI 90 in over 75% of patients at week 16, suggesting high efficacy despite more limited data. Non-biologic systemic drugs appear to be a rational first-line therapy, with cyclosporine showing good results in managing the acute phase and methotrexate being effective in maintaining remission. In the case of contraindications or treatment failure of traditional systemic therapies, among biologic drugs, the rapidity of action, safety, and limited evidence of efficacy are in favor of IL-17 inhibitors and risankizumab. However, the findings we report are limited by the evidence available in current literature, which is characterized by low statistical power.",

    "abstract": "Nail psoriasis can have a substantial negative impact on both the physical and emotional well-being of patients, and is a risk factor for psoriatic arthritis. Achieving complete clearance of nails in addition to skin is therefore an important treatment goal. We aimed to evaluate concurrent complete skin and nail clearance in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with bimekizumab or active comparators. Data were analyzed from the BE SURE and BE VIVID phase III trials, their open-label extension BE BRIGHT, and the BE RADIANT phase IIIb trial and its open-label extension. Included patients had baseline modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) >0 and entered their respective open-label extension. Proportions of patients achieving complete skin (PASI 100; 100% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and nail (mNAPSI 0) clearance at the same time are reported for bimekizumab- and active comparator-treated patients during controlled trial periods, and in the long term for continuous bimekizumab-treated patients and those switching from comparators. Data are reported using modified non-responder imputation. At the end of comparator-controlled periods, 45.8% of bimekizumab (N = 151) versus 18.3% of adalimumab (N = 91) patients (BE SURE week 24), 51.1% of bimekizumab (N = 169) versus 26.5% of ustekinumab (N = 92) patients (BE VIVID week 52), and 63.3% of bimekizumab (N = 182) versus 36.1% of secukinumab (N = 155) patients (BE RADIANT week 48) achieved PASI 100 and mNAPSI 0. Following long-term treatment, 57.7% of adalimumab switchers/49.1% of continuous bimekizumab patients (BE SURE/BE BRIGHT year 4), 52.2% of ustekinumab switchers/48.3% of continuous bimekizumab patients (BE VIVID/BE BRIGHT year 4), and 51.9% of secukinumab switchers/57.4% of continuous bimekizumab patients (BE RADIANT year 3) achieved PASI 100 and mNAPSI 0. Numerically higher proportions of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved concurrent complete skin and nail clearance versus adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab. Clearance rates increased following switch to bimekizumab, and were sustained long-term in both switchers to bimekizumab and continuous bimekizumab-treated patients.

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by fluctuating disease activity. Exacerbations of AD signs and/or symptoms, or flares, have a significant impact on patient quality of life and may require modification or escalation of treatment. However, research into preventing and managing flares may be hampered by the lack of consensus on a clear, clinically relevant, measurable definition of flare. This narrative review provides an overview of disease flare frameworks established through previous systematic literature reviews, flare definitions proposed by American and European guidelines, as well as those used in randomized controlled trials and observational studies published between January 2014 and September 2024. It identifies a range of flare definitions in use in the literature, the majority of which are based on clinician-reported outcomes, with very few referring to the patient perspective. Given the highly individualized experience of disease flare in patients with AD, incorporating the perspective of patients, alongside established measures of disease activity, is vital for creating and validating a definition that is clinically relevant.",

The aim was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of upadacitinib treatment through 140 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Measure Up 1 (MeUp1; NCT03569293), Measure Up 2 (MeUp2; NCT03607422), and AD Up (NCT03568318) are ongoing, phase 3, randomized clinical trials evaluating upadacitinib 15 mg (UPA15) and 30 mg (UPA30) in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD. This interim analysis evaluated efficacy and safety through week 140. At baseline, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive once-daily UPA15, UPA30, or placebo alone (MeUp1/2) or with concomitant topical corticosteroids (AD Up). At week 16, patients initially randomized to placebo were rerandomized 1:1 to UPA15 or UPA30. Skin and itch efficacy assessments included achievement of ≥ 75%/≥ 90%/100% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75/90/100), validated Investigator Global Assessment for AD score of clear/almost clear (vIGA-AD 0/1), and ≥ 4-point improvement from baseline in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (∆WP-NRS≥4). Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. A total of 2782 patients were randomized in MeUp1/2 or AD Up. Efficacy response rates, including optimal outcomes such as EASI 90 and WP-NRS score of 0/1, were sustained through week 140 in all three studies. At week 140, EASI 75 was achieved by 85.5%/90.5% (UPA15/UPA30; integrated MeUp1/2) and 81.5%/90.0% (UPA15/UPA30; AD Up) of patients, and vIGA-AD 0/1 was achieved by 56.6%/64.4% (UPA15/UPA30; integrated MeUp1/2) and 52.0%/56.8% (UPA15/UPA30; AD Up) of patients. Over 60% of patients across all three studies achieved ∆WP-NRS≥4 at week 140. Pooled safety data across all three studies demonstrated safety profiles consistent with 16-week and 52-week analyses. UPA15 and UPA30 with and without topical corticosteroids demonstrated robust, durable efficacy and a favorable safety profile through 140 weeks in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD.

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) significantly affects quality of life in patients of all ages and requires long-term treatment. Dupilumab is approved for uncontrolled moderate-to-severe AD in patients aged ≥ 6 months and in other type 2 inflammatory diseases. Data from placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and long-term open-label extensions (OLEs) enable comprehensive assessment of dupilumab's safety profile for up to 5 years. To integrate short- and long-term dupilumab safety data in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. We describe safety from eight phase 3 trials with > 7000 patient-years of dupilumab use: five 16-week RCTs in children (6 months–11 years, with concomitant topical corticosteroids [TCS]) and adolescents and adults (≥ 12 years, without TCS); one 52-week RCT in adults (with TCS); and two OLEs in children and adolescents (6–11- and 12–18-year cohorts, ± TCS, duration ≤ 1 year) and adults (± TCS, duration ≤ 5 years). The proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in RCTs was lower with dupilumab versus placebo in children/infants and was similar with dupilumab versus placebo in adults/adolescents. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates with longer-term treatment in OLEs were similar to the RCTs. Most TEAEs reported in RCT and OLE studies were mild to moderate and not related to study drug (per investigators). Fewer patients in the dupilumab versus placebo treatment arms experienced serious TEAEs (16-week RCTs: infants/children 0.8% vs 3.0%; adults/adolescents 2.0–2.2% vs 4.6%; 52-week RCT: 3.2–3.6% vs 5.1%). Common TEAEs that had higher incidence rates with dupilumab compared with placebo in RCTs included injection-site reactions (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities High Level Term) and conjunctivitis (clustered term). Serious infections and non-herpetic skin infections were more frequent with placebo. In the most comprehensive dupilumab safety assessment to date, safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disease that affects people of all ages. Since patients with atopic dermatitis require continuous, life-long treatment, doctors and patients must understand the risks and benefits of treatment options before choosing one medication over another. This study reviews the safety of the drug dupilumab, which is used to treat infants, children, adolescents, and adults who have moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is not well controlled with topical corticosteroids. We looked at side effects and safety data from more than 4000 patients who received either dupilumab or placebo treatment for up to 5 years in eight clinical trials. This study is the largest safety analysis of dupilumab to date. We found that children 6 months to 11 years receiving dupilumab had fewer side effects than patients in the placebo group. Adolescents and adults (12 years and older) taking dupilumab and placebo had similar rates of side effects. Serious side effects were more frequent in the placebo than in the dupilumab group in all age groups. Most side effects in patients who received dupilumab were mild or moderate, were not caused by dupilumab, and did not stop patients from taking dupilumab. The most common side effects that occurred more frequently in dupilumab-treated patients were pain or swelling around the injection location, common colds, and conjunctivitis. In conclusion, the safety of dupilumab in over 3000 patients in this study is consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile for infants, children, adolescents, and adults.",

    "abstract": "Differences in atopic dermatitis (AD) prevalence, clinical presentation, and pathophysiology have been reported in different ethnic/racial groups; however, clinical trial data for patients with skin of color are limited. Tralokinumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets interleukin-13, a key driver of AD. To investigate the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab, and examine AD biomarker expression at baseline and week 16, by self-reported racial subgroup (Asian, Black, and White) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Post hoc analyses were conducted by racial subgroup using data from four phase 3 trials: placebo-controlled parent trials ECZTRA 1, 2, and 3 and the open-label extension trial ECZTEND. Endpoints included Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1, 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75), and adverse events. In ECZTRA 1, serum and skin samples were analyzed for biomarker expression by immunoassay and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) abundance by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A total of 1876 patients pooled from ECZTRA 1/2/3 (Asian/Black/White N = 407/134/1335) and 1392 patients from ECZTEND (Asian/Black/White N = 203/108/1081) were included. Baseline characteristics were largely balanced between treatment groups and racial subgroups, although AD severity was more moderate in Black patients and regional differences were observed. At week 16 of ECZTRA 1/2/3, tralokinumab improved efficacy outcomes, including IGA 0/1 and EASI-75, relative to placebo across all subgroups. Further improvements beyond week 16 were observed with continued tralokinumab treatment, including 78%, 88%, and 83% of Asian, Black, and White patients, respectively, achieving EASI-75 at week 56 of ECZTEND (corresponding to up to 2 years total tralokinumab treatment). At baseline, serum biomarker levels were elevated in Asian patients from Japan compared with other subgroups, while Asian patients from USA/Europe had lower S. aureus abundance, when adjusting for IGA. The safety profile of tralokinumab was comparable to placebo, and serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were rare, across racial subgroups. Tralokinumab was well-tolerated and improved signs, symptoms, and biomarkers in patients with moderate-to-severe AD at 16 weeks across the racial subgroups studied, with further improvement in response rates up to 2 years of treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03131648 (registered 24 April 2017), NCT03160885 (registered 18 May 2017), NCT03363854 (registered 01 December 2017), and NCT03587805 (registered 03 July 2018). Atopic dermatitis (AD), often called eczema, is a chronic condition causing itchy, inflamed skin. The frequency and appearance of AD can vary by race. Tralokinumab is an injectable medication approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Data from four clinical trials with >1800 patients across Europe, North America, and Asia were used to test the ability of tralokinumab to improve AD symptoms in patients who self-identified as Asian, Black, or White. The amount of selected molecules known to reflect AD severity (called biomarkers) was measured in skin and blood before and after treatment to test for differences across racial groups. Before treatment, there were small differences in AD severity and geographic location between racial groups. Asian patients from Japan had higher biomarker levels in their blood before treatment, even when adjusting for differences in severity. For patients of all races, 16 weeks of tralokinumab treatment increased clear skin and quality of life, and reduced itch and biomarkers, more than placebo (inactive medicine). Asian, Black, and White patients who continued tralokinumab showed further improvements in AD symptoms up to two years of total treatment. Side effects were mostly mild and occurred at similar rates between patients of different races. Increased understanding of potential differences in the underlying causes, and treatment responses, between patients with skin of color and White patients is critical for improving AD treatment for all patients. Tralokinumab improved AD severity, itch, and quality of life with minimal side effects across diverse populations of patients with moderate-to-severe AD.",

    "abstract": "Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common dermatological condition that can profoundly affect psychosocial well-being. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure to assess the burden of acne in research and clinical practice. This systematic review aimed to identify, critically appraise, and synthesize current evidence on the effects of acne on HRQoL and other psychosocial outcomes. Structured searches of PubMed and Web of Science were conducted to identify studies measuring any HRQoL or psychosocial outcome in patients with acne vulgaris (all ages). Eligible studies were those that included ≥ 50 patients with acne, measured HRQoL or psychosocial outcomes as primary endpoints, were conducted in Europe and North America, and were published in English from 1 January 2014 to 30 April 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. In total, 101 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. They varied widely in terms of study design, population, outcomes, and quality, but overall demonstrated the adverse impacts of acne on HRQoL, mental health outcomes, and the lived experiences of people with acne. Despite their heterogeneity, studies frequently found that acne predominantly affected the emotional and psychological domains of HRQoL, and was particularly burdensome to adults, females, and those with more severe acne. This review collated the spectrum of impacts that acne vulgaris can impose on psychosocial well-being, and highlighted the need for consensus outcome measures to streamline future research and improve clinical practice.

    "abstract": "The solar radiation range has harmful and beneficial effects. Sunscreens, which selectively block specific spectral regions, may potentially interfere with skin homeostasis. For instance, the ultraviolet (UV) B waveband produces erythema and DNA damage; simultaneously, it induces pre-vitamin D3 synthesis. UVA1 and visible light can both induce pigmentation in skin phototypes IV–VI, and act in synergy to induce erythema and persistent pigment darkening. In contrast, UVA may contribute to blood pressure control and cardioprotection by inducing release of nitric oxide from intracutaneous photolabile nitric oxide derivatives. Finally, infrared A radiation alters the collagen equilibrium of the dermal extracellular matrix but is involved in the regulation of body temperature and in nitric oxide release, with a potential beneficial impact on blood pressure regulation. Ideally, photoprotection should thus be performed with a neutral density filter, mitigating all radiation ranges homogeneously, to maintain solar spectrum homeostasis. Natural compounds such as mycosporine-like amino acids are promising natural UV radiation-filtering compounds for an improved homeostasis with our environment. Lastly, we should not forget individual characteristics and behavior, as homeostasis differs according to individual phototypes and skin exposure behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Information on the factors that influence treatment management decisions for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is limited. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of clinical specialty setting and geographic region on the management of patients with PsA in the USA. LOOP was a multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study conducted across 44 sites in the USA. Patients were aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or established diagnosis of PsA and were routinely visiting a rheumatologist or dermatologist. All patients enrolled in the study were assessed by both a rheumatologist and a dermatologist. Primary outcomes were the times from symptom onset to PsA diagnosis; PsA diagnosis to first conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD); PsA diagnosis to first biologic DMARD (bDMARD); and first csDMARD to first bDMARD. Of 681 patients enrolled in the study, 513 had a confirmed diagnosis of PsA and were included in this analysis. More patients were recruited by rheumatologists (71.3%) than by dermatologists (28.7%). The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis of PsA was significantly shorter for patients enrolled by rheumatologists than for those enrolled by dermatologists (1.0 vs. 2.6 years; p < 0.001). Disease activity and burden were generally similar across enrolling specialties. However, patients in western areas of the USA had less severe disease than those in central or eastern areas, including measures of joint involvement, enthesitis, and dactylitis. There was a substantial delay in the time from symptom onset to diagnosis in this study population, and this was significantly longer for patients enrolled in the dermatology versus the rheumatology setting. This supports the need for collaboration across specialties to ensure faster recognition and treatment of PsA.",

    "abstract": "The prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma has substantially improved over the last years with the advent of novel treatment strategies, mainly immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Given the survival benefit provided in the metastatic setting and the evidence from prospective clinical trials in the early stages, these drugs have been introduced as adjuvant therapies for high-risk resected stage III disease. Several studies have also investigated immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as BRAF and MEK inhibitors, for neoadjuvant treatment of high-risk stage III melanoma, with preliminary evidence suggesting this could be a very promising approach in this setting. However, even with new strategies, the risk of disease recurrence varies widely among stage III patients, and no available biomarkers for predicting disease recurrence have been established to date. Improved risk stratification is particularly relevant in this setting to avoid unnecessary treatment for patients who have minimum risk of disease recurrence and to reduce toxicities and costs. Research for predictive and prognostic biomarkers in this setting is ongoing to potentially shed light on the complex interplay between the tumor and the host immune system, and to further personalize treatment. This review provides an insight into available data on circulating and tissue biomarkers, including the tumor microenvironment and associated gene signatures, and their predictive and prognostic role during neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment for cutaneous high-risk melanoma patients.",

    "abstract": "Hedgehog pathway inhibitors (HHIs) have broadened the treatment options available for patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) for whom traditional therapeutic approaches are not feasible or effective. Sonidegib and vismodegib are oral HHIs that were approved for treatment of patients with advanced BCC after demonstrating promising efficacy in the pivotal Phase II BOLT (NCT01327053) and ERIVANCE (NCT00833417) trials, respectively. However, the incidence and types of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) observed with these agents may limit continuous use of HHIs and ultimately impact clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the safety and tolerability profiles of sonidegib and vismodegib and discuss potential management strategies for HHI class-effect AEs, including muscle spasms, creatine phosphokinase increase, alopecia, and dysgeusia. These AEs primarily occur early in treatment and can lead to treatment discontinuation. Differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of sonidegib and vismodegib may contribute to the variability noted in times to onset and resolution of these and other AEs. Evidence suggests that protocol modifications, such as treatment interruptions and dose reductions, are effective ways to manage AEs while maintaining disease control. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions may also be considered as part of an AE management strategy. Overall, healthcare providers and patients with advanced BCC should be aware of the HHI class-effect AEs and plan effective management strategies to avoid treatment discontinuation and optimize therapeutic response.",

    "abstract": "The Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) is a patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess psoriasis signs and symptoms. The aim was to assess the usefulness of the PSI in enhancing patient care in the clinical setting. Eight dermatology clinics in six countries enrolled adults representing the full spectrum of psoriasis severity who regularly received care at the clinic. Patients were administered the eight-item PSI (score range 0–32; higher scores indicate greater severity) while waiting for the physician; the physician conducted a static physician global assessment (sPGA) and estimated psoriasis-affected body surface area (BSA) at the same visit. Physicians completed a brief questionnaire after each patient visit, and were interviewed about the PSI after all patients were seen. The clinics enrolled 278 patients; mean [standard deviation (SD)] psoriasis-affected BSA was 7.6% (11.4). Based on BSA, 47.8% had mild psoriasis, 29.1% had moderate psoriasis, and 23.0% had severe psoriasis. Based on sPGA, 18.7% were clear/almost clear, 67.3% were mild/moderate, and 14.0% were severe/very severe. The mean (SD) PSI total score was 12.2 (8.3). Physicians spent a mean (SD) 4.9 (4.8) min discussing PSI findings with their patients (range 0–20 min). Key benefits of PSI discussions included the following: new information regarding symptom location and severity for physicians; prompting of quality-of-life discussions; better understanding of patient treatment priorities; change in treatment regimens to target specific symptoms or areas; and improvement of patient–physician relationship. The PSI was useful for treated and untreated patients to enhance patient–physician communication, and influenced treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Chlormethine gel was approved for treatment of mycosis fungoides, the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, on the basis of results from study 201 and study 202. A post-hoc analysis of study 201 found interesting trends regarding improved efficacy of chlormethine gel vs ointment and noted a potential association between dermatitis and clinical response.To expand these results by performing a post-hoc analysis of study 202.Patients received chlormethine gel or ointment during study 201 (12 months) and higher-concentration chlormethine gel during study 202 (7-month extension). Response was assessed using Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS). Associations between treatment frequency, response, and skin-related adverse events (AEs) were assessed using multivariate time-to-event analyses. Time-to-response and repeated measures analyses were compared between patients who only used chlormethine gel and those who switched from ointment to gel.No associations were seen between treatment frequency and improved skin response (CAILS) or AE occurrence within the 201/202 study populations. However, an association was observed specifically between contact dermatitis and improved CAILS response at the next visit (p < 0.0001). Patients who used chlormethine gel during both studies had a significantly (p < 0.05) shorter time to response and higher overall response rates than patients who initiated treatment with ointment.This post-hoc analysis shows that patients who initiated treatment using chlormethine gel had faster and higher responses compared with patients who initially used chlormethine ointment for 12 months. The development of contact dermatitis may be a potential prognostic factor for response.Study 201: NCT00168064, September 14, 2002; Study 202: NCT00535470, September 26, 2007.",

    "abstract": "Molluscum contagiosum is often characterized by persistent lesions and bothersome symptomology. What patients with molluscum contagiosum and/or caregivers consider to be meaningful measures of therapeutic success is unknown. We aimed to collect patient experience data and assess Global Impression of Change from patients and/or caregivers participating in a large phase III molluscum contagiosum interventional trial. The Berdazimer Sodium In Molluscum Patients with LEsions (B-SIMPLE4) phase III study enrolled 891 patients with molluscum contagiosum. Patients were randomly assigned to berdazimer gel, 10.3% or vehicle gel applied once daily for 12 weeks. Assessments of participant and investigator perceptions of complete lesion clearance were collected at weeks 12 and 24 along with Global Impression of Change scores from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). A subset of 30 B-SIMPLE4 patients participated in the patient/caregiver experience exit interview to evaluate bothersome signs and symptoms. At week 12, among participants with a ≥ 75% molluscum contagiosum lesion count reduction from baseline (as assessed by investigators), 99% (373/376) reported improvement. Perceptions of complete clearance at week 12 were nearly 40% for both participant-reported and investigator-reported Global Impression of Change in berdazimer group vs 20% in the vehicle group: 82% (322/392) of participants in the berdazimer group and 60% (237/394) in the vehicle group reported their molluscum contagiosum lesions were either very much improved or much improved at week 12. Similarly, investigators scored 80% (314/393) of berdazimer and 54% (215/396) of vehicle participants as very much improved or much improved. From the exit interview, the mean duration of participant-reported molluscum contagiosum was nearly 2 years. The most frequently reported molluscum contagiosum-related signs and symptoms were itch (n = 20), scarring (n = 18), and pain (n = 13). Visibility and contagiousness of molluscum contagiosum were the most bothersome aspects to participants. The most frequently reported psychosocial impacts were self-consciousness (n = 15) and embarrassment (n = 14). Lesion clearance was an expectation of 28/30 study participants. Overall, 26/30 reported being very satisfied (n = 18) or satisfied (n = 8) with the changes in their disease over the duration of the trial; 23/30 stated that the change in lesion count was meaningful. A mean reduction of 18 lesions (76% decrease) from the baseline lesion count was reported by participants (n = 28). Although 22 of 28 had less than complete lesion clearance, 17 of 22 reported that the reduction in the number of lesions was meaningful. Molluscum contagiosum lesion reductions, with or without complete clearance, may be considered a therapeutic \"success\" by the patient/caregiver. NCT04535531 (registered 2 September, 2020).",

    "abstract": "The advent of molecular medicine may allow for individualized cancer prognostication, which should enable better clinical management and, hopefully, improve patient outcomes. A 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test is currently available for patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma; this test helps inform patients' individual treatment plans, especially when combined with traditional biomarkers. The objective of this study was to review the current literature and establish the level of evidence for a cutaneous melanoma 31-GEP test. A review of seven development and validation studies for the 31-GEP test was conducted. The respective strengths and weaknesses of each study were applied to the level of evidence criteria from major organizations that publish guidelines for melanoma management: American Joint Committee on Cancer, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Academy of Dermatology. Evaluating each study led to classifying the 31-GEP test as level I/II, I–IIIB, and IIA according to American Joint Committee on Cancer, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Academy of Dermatology criteria, respectively. This stands in contrast to the official unrated status conferred by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the II/IIIC rating designated by the American Academy of Dermatology. Differences between the authors' findings and official published ratings may be attributed to chronological issues, as many of the studies were not yet published when the aforementioned organizations conducted their reviews. There was also difficulty in applying the National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria to this prognostic test, as their guidelines were intended for evaluation of predictive markers. Nevertheless, based upon the most current data available, integration of the 31-GEP test into clinical practice may be warranted in certain clinical situations.",

Forty-five items on the classification, diagnosis, and treatment of angioedema without wheals were proposed for the survey.Most items (93.8%) were agreed after two rounds. All panelists agreed with the proposed classification, as well as with most of the clinical and treatment characteristics. The angioedema without wheals classification established three groups: histamine-mediated, bradykinin-mediated, and unknown mechanism angioedema. The clinical characteristics of the proposed types of angioedema were also agreed, except for the allergic histamine-mediated and unknown mechanism angioedema, which generated debate. Regarding treatments, although there was broad agreement with the proposed items, a lack of knowledge about some treatments in this pathology was observed.The proposed classification of angioedema without wheals was accepted with a high degree of agreement; however, knowledge of available treatments needs to be increased and the definition of angioedema of unknown mechanism needs to be improved.",

    "abstract": "Nail involvement is frequent in people with psoriasis. It can considerably impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL) beyond the impairments due to other psoriasis symptoms, for example, because patients feel ashamed of visible nail defects or because of the functional impairment in manual activities and walking. In clinical trials on nail psoriasis, it is therefore crucial to assess whether the treatment reduces HRQoL impairments that are specific to nail psoriasis. For this purpose, two validated patient questionnaires are available, the Nail Psoriasis Quality of Life Scale (NPQ10) and the Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis–Quality of Life (NAPPA-QOL). The ten-item NPQ10 has the advantage of being short and thus quick to administer. The 20-item NAPPA-QOL, in contrast, assesses the different dimensions of HRQoL which is considered a multi-dimensional construct. Yet most randomized controlled trials on nail psoriasis do not evaluate HRQoL improvement. If they do, a number of different instruments are used, most of which are not nail specific. This makes comparison of trial outcomes difficult. Harmonizing the measurement of HRQoL in future clinical trials on nail psoriasis would improve comparability across studies and would also enhance the reliability of meta-analyses.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and management of four cases of dermatological disorders, most of which are related to the endocrine disorder of androgen excess, are presented. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) may be useful when well-tolerated hormonal therapy and/or when contraception is required. A female patient with androgenetic alopecia or female pattern balding, without underlying hyperandrogenism, was treated with ethinylestradiol/chlormadinone acetate (EE/CMA) 0.03mg/2mg for 6 months and experienced stabilization of hair loss (case report 1). A patient who had previously received a COC for an irregular menstrual pattern but again experienced irregular menses and also acne after stopping treatment was diagnosed with acne associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [case report 2]. After 6 month’s treatment with EE/CMA 0.03mg/2 mg, this patient had fewer acne lesions and became eumenorrheic. A third patient who had excess hair since childhood was diagnosed with idiopathic hirsutism (no underlying gynecological or endocrinological disorder was found) and was treated with EE/CMA 0.03mg/2mg (case report 3). Less hair growth was reported after 6 month’s treatment. Case report 4 describes a patient who presented with oligomenorrhea and acne. She was diagnosed with PCOS with acne, seborrhea and mild hirsutism. Treatment with EE/CMA 0.03mg/2mg for 6 months resulted in improvements in her facial acne, seborrhea and hirsutism; she also became eumenorrheic. These four cases illustrate that EE/CMA may be a useful and well tolerated treatment option in the management of patients with dermatological disorders with or without hyperandrogenization.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of messenger RNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is yet to be delineated. It remains largely unknown how AD-related immunosuppressive medications affect the development of vaccine-induced immunity. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine among patients with AD and to assess its effectiveness in protecting against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality. A specific analysis additionally examined whether AD-related immunosuppressive drugs influenced the effectiveness of the vaccine. A population-based cohort study was performed using the database of Clalit Heath Services, Israel, to follow adult patients with AD. Multivariate Cox and logistic regression analyses were utilized to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) of the incident outcomes. As of 26 June, 2021, 58,582 (75.4%) out of 77,682 adult patients with AD completed two BNT162b2 vaccine doses in Israel. Adulthood-onset AD (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.28–1.40; p < 0.001) and moderate-to-severe AD (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.05–1.21; p = 0.001) predicted an increased vaccination rate. Vaccinated patients with AD demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted HR, 0.20; 95% CI 0.16–0.26; p < 0.001), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.08; 95% CI 0.04–0.18; p < 0.001), and COVID-19-associated mortality (adjusted HR, 0.04; 95% CI 0.01–0.20; p < 0.001). Exposure to immunosuppressive drugs (n = 597; 0.8% of patients) did not impair the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination (adjusted HR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.13–6.81; p = 0.958). In patients with AD, COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective for a wide range of COVID-19-related outcomes. Immunosuppressive drugs did not impair the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in this retrospective analysis.",

    "abstract": "Keratoacanthoma (KA) is a relatively common, fast-growing epithelial tumour, with characteristic behaviour and clinical variability. Although it appears as a solitary lesion in a majority of cases, multiple KAs do occur, secondary to skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation, chemical carcinogens or certain medications, but may also be associated with various genetic syndromes. Thus, multiple KAs may serve as an early clinical alarm sign. Prompt diagnosis of the underlying cause and identification of the mechanism of development are critical for the secondary prevention of associated organ disorders or neoplasias, the improvement of patient quality of life and familial counselling. Although research in this field has seen important progress in the last few years, there are still many pathogenic processes that have not been elucidated. Additionally, the literature on this topic is limited to individual case reports and small case series, making it difficult for clinicians to parse available data and select the essential information. Therefore, this work aims to review current knowledge, summarizing existing studies, with focus on multiple KAs associated with genetic syndromes, and proposes a diagnostic algorithm for these rare cases to help guide clinicians in their practice. Lastly, we aim to highlight the main gaps in understanding the underlying mechanisms and suggest further research avenues.",

    "abstract": "External genital warts are caused by various subtypes of the human papilloma virus and spread through direct skin-to-skin contact. Approximately 1% of the US population have external genital warts. Although cantharidin has been used to treat external genital warts for decades, there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved cantharidin products and no reliable or controlled sources of cantharidin available. VP-102 is a drug-device combination product containing cantharidin (0.7% w/v) in a single-use shelf-stable applicator. The objective of this randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, phase II clinical trial was to determine the optimal regimen for the treatment, safety, and efficacy of VP-102 in external genital warts. The study was conducted in two parts. Part A was dose finding and Part B was performed following the completion of Part A for a safety and efficacy evaluation. Following completion of Part A, 6-h and 24-h VP-102 regimens under occlusion were selected to be evaluated in Part B. Pooled results from Part B and Part A of the 6-h and 24-h VP-102 treatment regimens showed that 36.7% and 33.3% of participants achieved complete clearance of all treatable external genital warts at the end of treatment vs 4.2% (p < 0.0048) and 0% (p < 0.0075) with the vehicle. Adverse events experienced by the VP-102-treated participants were consistent with the pharmacodynamic action of cantharidin as a vesicant and were primarily mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events included application-site vesicles, pain, and erythema. No participants discontinued the study because of adverse events and no serious adverse events were deemed treatment related. The adverse event profile and efficacy of VP-102 under occlusion demonstrated in this study support the conclusion that a 6-h or up to 24-h exposure regimen represents an acceptable risk:benefit profile and justifies the conduct of a larger vehicle-controlled phase III study in external genital warts.
