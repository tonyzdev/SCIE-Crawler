    "abstract": "Abstract Dermatophytoses are skin diseases related to the infection of surface layers of skin and other keratinised structures such as hair and nails, caused by fungi referred to as dermatophytes. The scientific literature provides descriptions of over 50 dermatophytic species classified in the Trichophyton , Epidermophyton , Nannizzia , Arthroderma , Lophophyton , and Paraphyton genera. Dermatophytes are regarded as pathogens; they are not a component of skin microbiota and their occurrence in animals and humans cannot be considered natural. The review of the scientific literature regarding the occurrence and prevalence of dermatomycoses in companion animals revealed significant differences in the prevalence of the infections. Two main factors are most frequently assumed to have the greatest epidemiological importance, i.e. the animal origin and the type of infection. In this aspect, interesting data are provided by investigations of the fungal microbiota present in cat and dog fur. Interestingly, an anthropophilic species Trichophyton rubrum was found to be one of the species of dermatophytes colonising the skin of animals that did not present symptoms of infection. Is the carrier state of this species important in the epidemiology of human infections? Additionally, animal breeders and veterinarians claim that only certain breeds of dogs and cats manifest high sensitivity to dermatophyte infections. The pathomechanism of dermatophyte infections has not yet been fully elucidated; however, three main stages can be distinguished: adhesion of arthrospores to corneocytes, their germination and development of mycelium, and fungal penetration into keratinised tissues. Importantly, the dermatophyte life cycle ends before the appearance of the first symptoms of the infection, which may pose an epidemiological threat. Dermatophyte virulence factors include various exoenzymes, mainly keratinase, protease, lipase, phospholipase, gelatinase, and DNase as well as toxins causing haemolysis responsible for nutrient supply to pathogens and persistence in the stratum corneum of the host. Clinical symptoms of the infection are external manifestations of the dermatophyte virulence factors. 1. Introduction. 2. Dermatophytoses in dogs and cats. 2.1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails are the most prevalent among all fungal infections, currently affecting over 20–25% of the world’s human and animal populations. Dermatophytes are the etiological factors of the most superficial fungal infections. Among other pathogenic filamentous fungi, what distinguishes them is their unique attribute to degrade keratin. The remarkable ability of this group of fungi to survive in different ecosystems results from their morphological and ecological diversity as well as high adaptability to changing environmental conditions. Dermatophytes, although they are one of the oldest groups of microorganisms recognised as pathogens, have not been classified in a stable taxonomic system for a long time. In terms of diagnostics, dermatophytes still pose a serious problem in the identification procedure, which is often related to therapeutic errors. The increasing number of infections (including zoonoses), the lack of taxonomic stability, and the ambiguous clinical picture of dermatomycosis cases necessitate the search for new methods for the rapid, cheap, and reproducible species identification of these fungi. In turn, the species identification is determined by the clarity of classification criteria combined with the taxonomic division generally accepted by microbiologists and referring to the views expressed by clinicians, epidemiologists, and scientists. In this paper, the authors present the evolution of taxonomic systems for dermatophytes over the history of microbiology development. The discovery of new facts about the biology and ecology of dermatophytes and the development of techniques applied in a mycological diagnosis laboratory facilitated the development of new identification strategies at various points in the history. The modern molecular classification system of these pathogens seems to be stable and widely accepted. However, will it end the long-standing classification confusion and the period of hundreds of nomenclatural changes, which are a diagnostician’s nightmare? It can be argued that the taxonomy of dermatophytes, in particular that of anthropophilic species, is sufficiently established and stable for the benefit of both clinicians and scientists. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects a significant portion of the global population. In susceptible individuals, the disease is driven by dysbiotic microbiota on the tooth surface below the gum line, progressively eroding the tooth--supporting structures of the periodontium, including the alveolar bone. Clinically, PD manifests as attachment loss and periodontal pocket formation. Influenced by environmental factors, it can ultimately lead to tooth loss and is associated with an increased risk of systemic conditions. Host cells, including oral keratinocytes, gingival fibroblasts, and monocytes/macrophages, regulate the immune response that drives chronic inflammation and tissue damage in PD. Programmed cell death pathways – apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis – are key regulators of the immune response. These pathways orchestrate the elimination of infected, activated, and/or damaged cells, which is essential for either fuelling or resolving local inflammation. However, periodontal pathogens, particularly Porphyromonas gingivalis , can manipulate these pathways, supporting the maintenance of highly inflammatory environment. Prolonged exposition to proinflammatory agents may induce cellular senescence. This process contributes to chronic inflammation and tissue breakdown, further exacerbating the progression of PD. In this review, we discuss the key factors contributing to the onset and progression of PD, the virulence factors of P. gingivalis , and their effects on immune responses and cell death in keratinocytes, gingival fibroblasts, and macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This narrative review aims to discuss the potential of phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotic therapy, with a particular emphasis on its potential applications in dentistry. Despite historical fluctuations, phage therapy is gaining increasing acceptance and becoming more widespread in the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections. Contemporarily, phage therapy has become a prevalent treatment modality for bacterial infections of the digestive system in countries such as Georgia. In clinical trials, it has been used to treat wounds, bone and blood infections. In theory, it can be used in any instance of bacterial infection, including within the oral cavity. There are numerous methods of administration, and the therapy itself is regarded as both safe and effective, particularly in cases where antibiotics are ineffective, such as in the development of biofilms or infections by MDR bacteria. Despite the lack of ample clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of this therapy in dentistry, a growing body of evidence suggests its potential use in restorative dentistry, endodontics, periodontology, as well as oral and maxillofacial surgery. To determine whether phage therapy can be considered a viable alternative or to assess its effectiveness when used in combination with antibiotic therapy, further regulations and research are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are one of the classes of extracellular biopolymers synthesized by bacteria. Some strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used in the dairy industry are able to synthesize EPS (EPS(+) strains). EPS may be secreted by a cell in the form of capsule or slime. Our review describes the factors influencing the activity of EPS production by LAB, the impact of the use of EPS(+) strains on the quality of fermented milk products (yoghurt, cheeses, etc.) and pro-health properties of EPS produced by LAB. The capability to synthesize EPS by LAB depends on many factors, e.g., affiliation to species and characteristics of strain, growth stage, composition of culture medium (type of carbon and nitrogen sources, and presence of other nutrients), temperature, pH, and presence of adjuvant microflora. The presence of EPS synthesized by LAB strains has a significant effect on changes in various properties of dairy products, including: yoghurt, kefir and many other fermented milk drinks, sour cream and cheeses. The EPS act as thickening, emulsifying and gelling agents, hence the use of EPS(+) strains may become a certain alternative to the use of thickeners in, e.g., fermented milks. During formation of a casein milk curd, EPS are able to bind water and thus reduce syneresis. The high water holding capacity of EPS has a positive effect on increasing viscosity and improving texture of low-fat cheeses. EPS are claimed to have health-promoting properties, like: anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, immunomodulatory and reducing blood cholesterol. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract A new class of feed additives and nutritional supplements, known as probiotics, include bacterial, fungal, and yeast cultures from various sources. Overall, probiotics are believed to promote the health and well-being of animals, birds, and humans in a variety of settings. Incorporating probiotics into the diets of cattle and poultry has been demonstrated to improve growth, feed conversion efficiency, immunological responses, and the animal's ability to manage enteric infections. The use of probiotic-enriched chicken feed has been shown to enhance egg production by as much as 30% among laying chickens. Probiotics may be used to fight off harmful microorganisms, create antibacterial compounds (such as bacteriocins or colicins), and alter the immunological response of the host, according to the National Institutes of Health. Pathogenic microbial strains such as Lactobacillus , Streptococcus , Bacillus , Enterococcus , Pediococcus , Aspergillus , and Saccharomyces are employed in the making of chicken products. The use of subtherapeutic doses of antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, to combat or remove harmful bacteria and promote animal growth and feed efficiency has resulted in the accumulation of antibiotic residues in animal feed as well as the emergence of drug-resistant microbes in the feed supply chain. As a result of public health concerns, there has been a renewed emphasis on the use of probiotics in chicken production rather than antibiotics in recent years. This research examines the effects of probiotics and direct-fed microorganisms (DFM) on chicken health and performance, with a particular emphasis on the favourable effects they have on poultry health and performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Minerals have been important throughout history, but nowadays, their use has increased, as well as their extraction needs. Therefore, due to the growing demand for metals, and both the depletion of high-grade ores and their related environmental concerns, the mining industry has been forced to leave behind the past traditional techniques of metal recovery (use of inorganic acids), and adopt eco-friendlier alternatives, such as the utilization of weaker leaching agents, such as organic acids. Thus, the present review is focused on the use of microbially-produced organic acids as a promising alternative to conventional techniques in the mining industry, with emphasis on the following topics: a) the advantages and disadvantages of the use of organic acids for leaching purposes, b) the main microorganisms studied for the production of these organic acids, c) a summary of the latest reports on bioleaching as well as a comparison of the existent techniques; d) the explanation of leaching mechanisms where organic acids may be involved, to fulfill metal recovery; and, e) interactions between metallic ions and organic acids. The review of the current knowledge regarding the use of organic acids for leaching purposes seeks the visualization of relevant strategies that may be improved for metal-recovery processes, intending to develop circular economy practices that may have the potential to be implemented at an industrial scale.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The root system of a plant works like a factory that produces a huge amount of chemicals to communicate effectively with the microorganisms around it. At the same time, micro-organisms can use these compounds as an energy source. The variety of microorganisms associated with plant roots is enormous, amounting to tens of thousands of species. This complex microbial community, also called the second plant genome, is essential for plant health and productivity. Over the last few years, there has been significant progress in research into the structure and dynamics of the microbial sphere of the rhizosphere. It has been proven that plants shape the composition of microorganisms by synthesizing root secretions. On the other hand, microorganisms play a key role in the functioning of plants through their positive impact on their growth and development. In general, rhizosphere microorganisms promote plant growth directly by providing plants with minerals such as nitrogen and phosphorus and by synthesizing growth regulators, as well as indirectly, by inhibiting the development of various plant pathogens. 1.

The main sources of microorganisms in the air include soil, water and the decomposition of organic matter, while anthropogenic sources are represented by landfills, wastewater treatment plants, composting facilities and traffic. Microorganism populations in the air can be seasonal or relatively constant, but the most frequent increase in their occurrence is recorded in the summer and autumn. Studies show that humidity, the presence of carbon monoxide and ozone concentrations are the main factors affecting the diversity of bacteria and the percentage of pathogenic bacteria present in outdoor air. Microorganisms in the air inside residential buildings are primarily concentrated on dust particles. Approximately 60% of dust microbiota are spores of mould fungi. The key emitters of microorganisms into the atmosphere are municipal wastewater treatment plants. The bacteria and pathogens released are potentially resistant to antibiotics, rendering the bioaerosols of wastewater treatment plants a possible hazard to human health.

This article explores advanced applications of polyurethane biomaterials in medicine, the challenges posed by infections associated with their use, and innovative surface modification techniques to improve their functionality. PUs are employed in a diverse array of medical devices, including non-implantable applications such as wound dressings, catheters, and infusion sets; short-term implants like bone stabilizers and tracheostomy tubes; and long-term implants such as tissue regeneration scaffolds, artificial blood vessels, and heart valves. Despite their many advantages, their use carries a significant risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, infective endocarditis, and urinary tract infections. An important challenge lies in bacterial biofilms, which complicate treatment and enhance bacterial resistance to antibiotics. To address these issues, innovative PU surface modification methods are being developed, including laser texturing, nanoparticle deposition with antibacterial properties, ion implantation, cold metal spraying, the integration of biodegradable and biocompatible components, and plasma modifications. These advanced techniques aim to enhance polyurethane biomaterials’ antibacterial properties and biocompatibility, thereby reducing infection risks and improving clinical outcomes. This article underscores the importance of ongoing research to effectively combat biomaterial-associated infections and broaden the medical applications of polyurethanes. The development of advanced surface modification methods holds great promise for improving patient quality of life and the efficacy of medical treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Malignant mesothelioma is a rare but highly aggressive cancer, with an incidence of approximately 1–2 cases per million per year in industrialized countries and a global annual mortality exceeding 30,000 cases. The disease is caused mainly by exposure to asbestos and is resistant to conventional treatment modalities, resulting in poor outcomes. Standard approaches include surgery, chemotherapy, and, more recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, owing to the aggressive nature of cancer, the prognosis is poor, with limited treatment options. Globally, the disease accounts for more than 30,000 deaths annually. Current treatment efficacy remains suboptimal, particularly in advanced stages. Oncolytic virotherapy, especially adenovirus-based vectors, has emerged as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy with the potential to induce tumour lysis and stimulate antitumour immunity. This review summarizes the current treatment landscape for mesothelioma and highlights preclinical and early clinical findings on engineered oncolytic adenoviruses, particularly those expressing ICOSL, CD40L, and OX40L, and their promising synergistic effects with checkpoint blockade and chemotherapy. Furthermore, in this review, we present insights from clinical studies of the effects of adenovirus Ad5/3-D24-GM-CSF on mesothelioma and discuss promising avenues for future immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacteria use a variety of mechanisms in order to successfully survive in hosts. To support proliferation sophisticated means of maintenance in host especially metabolism of carbon and nitrogen is needed. One metabolic mechanism is the metabolism of amino sugars which are being used simultaneously as a carbon and nitrogen source. D-galactosamine (GalN) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Gal-NAc) and their derivatives are widely used by bacteria. For instance, they build parts of cell wall and LPS. The metabolism of both amino sugars is performed and controlled by proteins encoded by aga genes, present in a wide variety of Proteobacteria . The genetic mechanism underlying this metabolic pathway is, however not yet fully known. Despite this, there is a possibility of using this pathway as a target for therapy, especially in the times of ever-growing danger of bacterial drug resistance. The goal of this article was to present the current knowledge of aga genes and their importance in GalN and GalNAc metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The two-component NarLX signaling system is a key mechanism for bacterial adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Composed of a histidine kinase (NarX) and a response regulator (NarL), it enables bacteria to accurately detect and respond to environmental changes, particularly in nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Studies on various bacterial species, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , have shown that the NarLX system plays a fundamental role in anaerobic metabolism, biofilm formation, colonization ability and virulence. In E. coli , the system activates 51 operons and inhibits 41 of them, while in other species it affects key survival processes. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance, the NarLX system represents a promising therapeutic target. Potential strategies include the development of small-molecule inhibitors that could precisely modulate bacterial behavior without destroying the bacterial flora. The research points to the possibility of developing innovative methods to combat bacterial infections, offering an alternative to traditional antibiotics and minimizing the risk of increasing bacterial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder with an increasing global prevalence. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system typically categorizes IBS into four subtypes based on symptomatology. The objective of this review is to provide a concise synthesis of the most current information regarding IBS, encompassing widely accepted diagnostic criteria, etiology, epidemiological data and the significance of gut microbiota (GM) in pathogenesis of this disorder. Additionally, it will explore future perspectives. Recent studies have demonstrated that the GM in healthy individuals primarily consists of four main bacterial phyla: Firmicutes spp., Bacteroidetes spp., Actinobacteria spp., and Proteobacteria spp. Dysbiosis or an imbalance in these bacteria may be a contributing factor to the IBS development. It is imperative to acknowledge the multifaceted role of the GM in several essential biological processes, including: immunomodulation, intestinal barrier integrity, gut microbiota-gut-brain axis (GBA) or nutrient absorption. The composition of GM is subject to variation depending on the IBS subtype. Many therapeutic strategies have been devised for the treatment of patients with IBS, comprising antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Although FMT has shown promise, clinical trials outcomes remain still inconsistent. Dietary interventions and psychological support are also vital components of IBS management. Despite the advances in understanding the GM-IBS relationship, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding specific microbial markers for each IBS subtype. Consequently, a definitive microbiota pattern has yet to be delineated. However, emerging evidence underscores the microbiome’s role in IBS pathophysiology.",

Concurrently, the widespread and increasing use of these biocides, particularly within healthcare settings, has prompted concerns regarding their potential contribution to the emergence of reduced microbial susceptibility to them and the phenomenon of cross-resistance to antibiotics. This review focuses on four widely utilized antiseptics: chlorhexidine, octenidine, povidone-iodine, and alcohols. It was discusses their antimicrobial activity, mechanisms of action, and applications, including available preparations and the minimum effective concentrations required for reliable pathogen eradication. Current evidence regarding the mechanisms underlying decreased susceptibility to these agents is summarized. Furthermore, the review presents data from studies investigating the impact of prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of antiseptics on the induction of reduced antimicrobial efficacy and the potential for co-selection of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the review presents methods of adaptation of bacteria and fungi to increasing concentrations of antiseptics, including techniques using liquid media - gradient method and incremental method, as well as methods based on solid media. Findings from recent studies suggest that long-term exposure of microorganisms to subinhibitory concentrations of antiseptics may result in reduced effectiveness of these agents and selection of mutants with changed sensitivity to antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial substances is one of the most serious epidemiological problems present on a global scale. The widespread use of same classes of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine, often without laboratory confirmation of the efficacy of active compounds used, contributes to the selection of resistant bacteria in humans and animals, and their spread in nature. The increasing resistance of pathogenic bacteria leads to serious consequences for both human and animal health. However, the resistance of commensal bacteria is equally important as they constitute a reservoir and vector of resistance determinants in the environment. Exposure to antimicrobials belonging to different classes can lead to cross-resistance and the selection of genes that may spread horizontally on mobile genetic elements. The emergence of plasmid-encoded resistance to critically important antibiotics for human medicine e.g. carbapenems or polymyxins is alarming. On the example of antibiotics classified as critically important for human medicine, it is possible to discuss almost all bacterial mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. For effective combat against the growing antibiotic resistance of bacteria, it is necessary to know the mechanisms of resistance and the methods of their acquisition by bacteria. The aim of the paper is to review the ways that critically important antimicrobials act on bacterial cells and present complex mechanisms that are responsible for resistance to these substances as well as genes conferring for resistance. 1.

This case report documents a rare instance of P. sanguinis bacteremia in a 69-year-old homeless patient presenting with thigh phlegmon. The patient was admitted with elevated inflammatory markers and treated empirically with antibiotics. Blood cultures identified P. phenylpyruvicus , later confirmed as P. sanguinis via 16S rRNA sequencing. Despite initial antibiotic therapy, the patient’s condition necessitated surgical intervention for phlegmon drainage. The antibiotic regimen was adjusted based on susceptibility profiles, leading to gradual clinical improvement. This case underscores the significance of accurate microbial identification in managing infections caused by less common pathogens. The severity of infection was doubtlessly influenced by the patient’s homeless status and associated risk factors, such as poor hygiene and potential environmental exposure.

Due to the absence or inefficacy of vaccines for deadly protozoal illnesses, chemotherapy is a primary means for preventing such diseases. Growing drug resistance, rising cross-resistance, and a lack of new agents with novel modes of action all significantly reduce the effectiveness of current antiprotozoal treatments. Society seems to be ignorant of the extent and repercussions of drug resistance associated with anti-infective agents, even though it is a reality. Evidence suggests that reduced drug uptake, reshaped drug targets, genetic modifications resulting in loss of drug activity, and decreased drug export from parasites contribute to resistance development. Recently, there has been a significant gain in our understanding of drug resistance by isolating and characterizing genes and proteins associated with resistance. This fact has also paved the way for the discovery of potential new drugs. This review focuses on drug resistance in the most common vector and foodborne human-recovered parasites.",

Among the emerging contributors to oral carcinogenesis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis , two Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that reside in the human oral cavity as part of the normal microbiota, have gained attention for their pathogenic roles. Both species play key roles in periodontal disease and exhibit significant tumour-promoting activities through distinct and synergistic mechanisms. They modulate the tumor microenvironment by promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, facilitating immune evasion, and contributing to microbial dysbiosis. Clinical studies have identified their presence in OSCC tissues, correlating with advanced tumor stages, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Their involvement underscores the critical interplay between oral microbiota and host-pathogen interactions in cancer development. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms through which F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis contribute to oral carcinogenesis, emphasizing the need for further research to explore their diagnostic and therapeutic potential in oral cancer management. Addressing these microbial drivers could pave the way for innovative strategies in cancer prevention and treatment.",

The spectrum of OCT’s activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. For most species, it exhibits activity at concentrations ranging from approximately 1 to several μg/mL. OCT also exhibits strong antibiofilm activity, both against biofilm formation and mature biofilms. The compound has limited virucidal and antiparasitic activity. The Clinical Efficiency of MIC (CEMIC) index for most pathogens is classified as excellent, meaning that the MIC is much lower than the clinical concentration. The required contact time for OCT microbicidal action is fast, at just 1 minute. The possibility of adaptation to OCT has been described; however, the Karpinski Adaptation Index (KAI) for most species is below 0.2, indicating a very low or low risk of developing clinical resistance. Only in some isolates of Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa the risk of resistance development considered moderate. According to guidelines (Statement of the Polish Wound Management Association, German Consensus on Wound Antisepsis, and International Consensus Document “Use of wound antiseptics in practice”), OCT is the first-choice antiseptic for critically colonized wounds, infection-prone wounds, burns, wounds colonized by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens or infected wounds, and for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSI). OCT is also used in umbilical stump care, the treatment of oral infections, skin and mucosal candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis.",

Symbiotic microbiota helps in acquirement of nutrients, regulates action of the immune system protecting mucosa and whole organism against pathogens, neutralizes some xenobiotics, thus acts as a preventive measure against carcinogenic mutations. This beneficial microbiota may be supported by uptake of probiotics and/or prebiotics in foods, diet supplements and drugs. They can be found in milk and dairy products, in particular fermented ones (e.g kefir, yoghurt and cheese), which contain both probiotics and prebiotics, including lactoferrin. This protein has a confirmed action promoting growth of symbiotic microbiota of intestine and urogenital tract. Such activity, associated with antimicrobial action regarding pathogenic microorganisms, restores equilibrium of microbiota within mucous membranes that effectively eliminates pathogens and inflammatory processes. Youngest children are supported by lactoferrin acquired with maternal milk. Later we can relay on our own, endogenous proteins, secreted by mucous membranes and neutrophils and supply of dairy products (not subjected to aggressive thermal processing) or diet supplements. We can find in the market the products containing lactoferrin alone, with another prebiotic, e.g inulin or oligosaccharides, and also with probiotics. Orally taken lactoferrin is effective as proved in a number of clinical studies. The protein is relatively resistant to digestion, may reach intestine, where acts on gut microbiota and local lymphoid tissue.

    "abstract": "Abstract Organic pollutants are released into the environment as a result of various human activities. Traditional physical and chemical methods for the clean-up of contaminated soil and water are often costly and invasive. A good alternative to the above methods is bacteria-assisted phytodegradation. Recently, particular attention has been focused on endophytic bacteria equipped with appropriate metabolic pathways, increasing the efficiency of organic compound degradation, and promoting plant growth. Endophytic bacteria are known to degrade various classes of organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile and monocyclic organic compounds, explosives as well as pesticides. They may also assist the bioremediation of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide. Additionally, endophytic bacteria can promote the growth and development of plants through a wide range of direct and indirect mechanisms, which also affect the effectiveness of phytoremediation processes. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil microbiome is composed of groups of microorganisms which are structurally and functionally very different. For many years soil microbiome has been the subject of numerous studies, but still is not fully recognized. It is well known that soil microorganisms play a key role in biogeochemical processes. Knowledge of their structural and functional diversity makes it possible to assess the condition of the soil environment, which is extremely important for agronomy and ecology. The agricultural and industrial activities of humans cause changes in soil activity, which should be monitored. There are many different research methods developed to analyze soil activity and microbiological soil diversity and refined by researchers from around the world in. Biochemical methods used to analyze microbial activity are based on the determination of the ability of microorganisms to synthesize, assimilate or decompose specific chemical compounds, as well as on the analysis of microbial cell components. This study presents the research methods used for the analysis of both: the functionality of microorganisms and their structural diversity. 1. Introduction. 2. Determination of enzymatic activity. 3.

    "abstract": "Abstract Biosurfactants are a group of surface-active agents mainly produced by microorganisms and have a wide range of applications in industries as well as agriculture. Global usage of such biologically active compounds as detergents, bioremediation agents, cosmetic products is hugely dependent on their high production. New avenues of research have opened up due to this increased interest, most of which are focused on identifying specialized microorganisms capable of biosurfactant production. Screening methods for selection of biosurfactant producing bacteria are, therefore, of utmost importance in this endeavor. The aim of this review was to discuss various conventional and novel methods that can overcome the hurdles encountered in time effective, economical microbial biosurfactant screening. This review lists several important biosurfactant screening methods based on supernatant, biomass as well as culture media. New methods devised for biosurfactant screening in the last half decade such as surfactant dependent dye solubilization, metagenomic studies etc. are also explained in detail. A thorough grasp of both contemporary and anachronistic screening methodologies will not only lead to discoveries of novel native strains capable of biosurfactant production but also form the basis on which new screening methods can be devised.",

The amoeba from the genera Acanthamoeba and Naegleria as well as the following species: Sappina diploidea , S. pedata , Balamuthia mandrillaris , and probably Hartmannella vermiformis , are the major cause of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) and amoebic keratitis (AK). Furthermore, free-living amoeba can be vectors of bacteria, including Legionella pneumophila , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter baumannii , Stenotrophomonas maltophila , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Serratia marces cens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis .

Multidisciplinary studies conducted worldwide by microbiologists and physicians suggest that the microorganisms which colonize the human body can more actively influence the state of health than previously thought. The most important role in the regulation of the homeostasis is played by ontocenoses of the intestine. Imbalanced taxonomic composition and number of intestinal microbiota may contribute to the development of numerous infectious (HIV), metabolic (diabetes, obesity) and immunological (allergy, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis) diseases, as well as conditions associated with various organs (kidneys, liver, heart, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease), cancer (colon) and the nervous system (autism, sleeping problems, stress, chronic fatigue syndrome, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease).

    "abstract": "Abstract Brucellosis is a transmissible bacterial zoonotic disease caused by Gram-negative coccobacillus bacteria of the genus Brucella. The disease severely hinders the livestock industry and human health. In several instances, infected animals act as carriers for the cross-species transmission of brucellosis. Social issues, poor husbandry practices, irregularities in the marketing and movement of domestic animals, and lack of coordination between veterinary and human health services are some of the key factors responsible for the transmission and prevalence of Brucellosis. Human contact with infected domestic animals is often the transmission route of Brucellosis infection. Therefore, human brucellosis could be eradicated globally by eradicating animal brucellosis.

    "abstract": "Abstract Antimicrobial resistance is becoming a paramount health concern nowadays. The increasing drug resistance in microbes is due to improper medications or over usage of drugs. Bacteria develop many mechanisms to extrude the antibiotics entering the cell. The most prominent are the efflux pumps (EPs). EPs play a significant role in intrinsic and acquired bacterial resistance, mainly in Gram-negative bacteria. EPs may be unique to one substrate or transport several structurally different compounds (including multi-class antibiotics). These pumps are generally associated with multiple drug resistance (MDR). EPs are energized by a proton motive force and can pump a vast range of detergents, drugs, antibiotics and also β-lactams, which are impermeable to the cytoplasmic membrane. There are five leading efflux transporter families in the prokaryotic kingdom: MF (Major Facilitator), MATE (Multidrug And Toxic Efflux), RND (Resistance-Nodulation-Division), SMR (Small Multidrug Resistance) and ABC (ATP Binding Cassette). Apart from the ABC family, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to drive the export of substrates, all other systems use the proton motive force as an energy source. Some molecules known as Efflux Pump Inhibitors (EPI) can inhibit EPs in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. EPIs can interfere with the efflux of antimicrobial agents, leading to an increase in the concentration of antibiotics inside the bacterium, thus killing it. Therefore, identifying new EPIs appears to be a promising strategy for countering antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR). This mini-review focuses on the major efflux transporters of the bacteria and the progress in identifying Efflux Pump Inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new class of feed additives and nutritional supplements, known as probiotics, include bacterial, fungal, and yeast cultures from various sources. Overall, probiotics are believed to promote the health and well-being of animals, birds, and humans in a variety of settings. Incorporating probiotics into the diets of cattle and poultry has been demonstrated to improve growth, feed conversion efficiency, immunological responses, and the animal's ability to manage enteric infections. The use of probiotic-enriched chicken feed has been shown to enhance egg production by as much as 30% among laying chickens. Probiotics may be used to fight off harmful microorganisms, create antibacterial compounds (such as bacteriocins or colicins), and alter the immunological response of the host, according to the National Institutes of Health. Pathogenic microbial strains such as Lactobacillus , Streptococcus , Bacillus , Enterococcus , Pediococcus , Aspergillus , and Saccharomyces are employed in the making of chicken products. The use of subtherapeutic doses of antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, to combat or remove harmful bacteria and promote animal growth and feed efficiency has resulted in the accumulation of antibiotic residues in animal feed as well as the emergence of drug-resistant microbes in the feed supply chain. As a result of public health concerns, there has been a renewed emphasis on the use of probiotics in chicken production rather than antibiotics in recent years. This research examines the effects of probiotics and direct-fed microorganisms (DFM) on chicken health and performance, with a particular emphasis on the favourable effects they have on poultry health and performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The stringent response is a form of bacterial response to adverse environmental conditions. Its effectors are guanosine tetraphosphate and guanosine pentaphosphate [(p)ppGpp], which are synthetized by RelA, SpoT and their homologs (RSH). RelA, a (p)ppGpp synthase, is activated when there is a shortage of amino acids, whereas SpoT, which has the ability to synthetize and hydrolyze (p)ppGpp, responds to fatty acids, iron and carbon limits. Accumulation of (p)ppGpp causes an inhibition of translation, replication, a decrease in the transcription of many genes, e.g. rRNA, tRNA, encoding ribosomal proteins, and an increase in the transcription of genes whose proteins are important in bacterial stress response. The stringent response alarmones are crucial for bacterial resistance to oxidative stress and antibiotics. They also regulate the production of specific molecules, the so-called quorum sensing autoinducers, which help bacteria communicate the density of their own population, which enables them to adjust their metabolism to the prevailing conditions, to form a biofilm – a community of microorganisms attached to a certain surface, ensuring them appropriate conditions to survive in an unfavourable environment, and to colonize new niches. (p)ppGpp has a positive impact on biofilm formation not only via the regulation of quorum sensing, but also by stimulating the synthesis of potential elements of the biofilm. It also appears that the stringent response alarmones decrease the ability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacteria to transform plants and thus their potential to cause disease. (p)ppGpp enables the bacteria to perform swarming motility, a movement that increases their resistance to adverse environmental factors. 1. Introduction. 2.

In the postnatal period, the method of birth is important; when a child is born naturally, passing the female genital tract, it acquires bacteria present in the mother’s vagina, and when through the cesarean section, the child’s organism is first colonized by the mother’s skin microbiota and hospital strains. In female newborns during the first days after the natural birth, the presence of Lactobacillus rods, which acidify the vagina, is readily observed. Later, however, they disappear and during the childhood period, the pH of the vagina becomes alkaline. Only in the period of puberty and full puberty, as a result of the increase in the level of estrogen in the female body, the amount of Lactobacillus strains increases and this continues up to the menopause period, when pathogenic strains begin to dominate. The female vagina is home to not only numerous bacteria, but also fungi, including mainly Candida yeast and filamentous fungi at a lower extent. Dysbiosis of the vagina may be caused by the predominance of pathogenic bacteria over Lactobacillus , resulting in bacterial vaginosis or excess of Candida yeast, resulting in candidiasis. An effective method leading to the homeostasis of the female sexual system is the use of vaginal probiotics, which should consist of strains characteristic to a given female population. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Invasiveness of alien turtles results from their impact on the functioning of the local ecosystem. It is due to predation on or competing with resident species, but also transfer of new and unknown pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi. Salmonella is the most often reported microorganism, both in free-living and captive turtles. Zoonotic aspect of Salmonella spp. carriage has led to the definition of RAS (Reptile Associated Salmonellosis) acquired from domestic pet reptiles. Mycobacterium spp., Leptospira spp. and aquatic bacteria are also found in turtles. Additionally, nematode transmissions from invasive turtles to the autochthonic ones have been described. Alien turtles were less affected by parasitic invasion than animals living in a native location, but the infestation of alien parasites in native turtle species was usually more severe. Reports on viral or fungal infections in turtles are scarce. The identified knowledge gaps justify the need for research which will provide basic and systematic data on microbial threats related to alien and invasive turtles present in the natural environment of Poland. It will also give more insight in the scope and the impact of the problem on epidemiology and public health. 1. Introduction. 2. Invasive turtle species. 3. Bacteria. 3.1. Salmonella spp. 3.1.1.

They are important part of normal human and animal bacterial flora commonly associated with the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract of animals and humans. They are able to produce antimicrobial substances such as bacteriocins, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which have been shown to be beneficial for controlling the overgrowth of other, potentially pathogenic, bacteria. Bacteriocins are low-molecular weight single polypeptides or polypeptide complexes having an antimicrobial activity, synthesized in ribosome and secreted by bacterial cells. Genes encoding bacteriocins have been reported to be present on plasmid or genomic DNA. Lactobacilli are commonly used in the production of probiotics n a live microbial food supplements which beneficially affect the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

Culture-dependent methods have a drawback that only a small number of bacteria can be cultured. Although many modifications in the traditional cultivation approach have been made, such as the use of gellan instead of agar and high throughput dilution to extinction culturing, but a large fraction of microbes still remain uncultured. Culture-independent methods were developed to explore uncultured bacterial diversity but they have their own drawbacks. PCR-based methods have biases during DNA extraction and the removal of substances that may inhibit polymerase activity during PCR and digestion with restriction enzymes. “Omics” approach, i.e., metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics, aim to link bacterial community structure with function. Different combinations of methods can be used to know more precisely about the bacterial diversity. To date, no known method can reveal the exact bacterial diversity of different environments. This lacuna needs to be filled and newer methods must be developed that can help in exploring the immense bacterial diversity created by nature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Multi-resistant bacterial strains currently present the main health problem worldwide. Numerous public health organizations call for the prevention, and control the spread, of antibiotic resistance from any sources. From the literature data, it is well known that agricultural areas are a source of antibiotic resistance because of the use of antibiotics and heavy metals to promote plant and animal growth. Moreover, natural water reservoirs and soil not used for agriculture are also sources of multi-drug resistant bacteria. In recent years bacteria resistant to antibiotics and heavy metals have been isolated from heavy-metal contaminated soils and from metallophytes. Therefore, it seems that heavy metals, an environmental pollutant, may also be a selection factor that promotes the spread of antibiotic resistance. The co-selection phenomenon of resistant genes is most often connected with the lack of bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and heavy metals. Co-selection occurs when different resistant genes that enable resistance to different stress conditions are located on the same mobile genetic elements, or when the same genes determine resistance to different stress conditions. This article presents the current state of knowledge about the co-selection phenomenon observed in bacteria isolated from nonclinical environments. 1. Introduction. 2. Co-selection mechanisms. 2.1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Fungal infections of the skin, hairs, and nails undeniably dominate among all types of fungal infections. The etiological factors of the majority of superficial fungal infections are dermatophytes which, although they are the oldest microorganisms considered as pathogens, have long been unstable in the taxonomic position. From a diagnostic point of view, the species identification of dermatophytes is still a serious problem, often generating therapeutic errors. An increasing number of infections, including zoonoses, lack of taxonomic stability and ambiguous clinical picture of all cases of dermatomycosis induce to search for new, fast, repeatable and at the same time cheap methods of species identification of these fungi. In the last decade, revolutionary progress has been observed in the development of molecular methods for the diagnosis of fungal infections and the reliable identification of species of etiological factors that cause these dermatomycoses. The results of many studies indicate that the direct identification of fungi from dermatological samples based on molecular methods is much more reliable and much faster compared to that carried out by conventional methods. Often, the etiological factor of the observed changes was also identified, while the result of cultivation was negative. Particular molecular methods used in the species identification of fungi directly from the clinical material differ in the procedures of genomic DNA extraction, PCR techniques used, the molecular marker used and the results interpretation system. This paper reviews literature regarding different methods of diagnosing of superficial fungal infections based on molecular biology techniques, their advantages and limitations, as well as critical factors for their implementation for routine use. The position of microbiologists in this matter seems to be a foregone conclusion, the time when molecular diagnostics will replace the conventional techniques, based on the cultivation of dermatophytes and assessing their morphology, inexorably coming. Molecular methods of identifying aetiological factors of dermatomycoses directly from dermatological samples are much more attractive and have many advantages. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the top ten threats to mankind. In a special report published in 2017, the WHO presented a list of microorganisms for which the search for new therapeutic options is a priority. The highest (critical) priority was given to the search for new antibiotics active against carbapenem-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as against carbapenem- and third-generation-cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales strains (so-called critical priority pathogens). Whereas the second (high) priority was given among others to the search for new antibiotics active against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium (VRE). Since the publication of the WHO report the European Medicines Agency has approved 6 novel, broad-spectrum antibiotics, from 6 different groups, addressing the priority pathogens to a different extent. Two of them are new combinations of carbapenems with non-β-lactam inhibitors of β-lactamases (active also against carbapenemases), belonging to two novel groups of inhibitors: diazabicyclooctanes (relebactam, combined with imipenem) and boronates (vaborbactam, combined with meropenem). The third new drug is a siderophore cephalosporin (cefiderocol) with an innovative mechanism of penetration into the bacterial cell. The next two antibiotics are the new fluoroquinolone (delafloxacin) and the new tetracycline (eravacycline), designed and synthesized to be more active than older members of these groups. The last innovative antibiotic is lefamulin – the first pleuromutilin approved for systemic use in humans. New approvals have expanded the number of available therapeutic options in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (meropenem/vaborbactam, cefiderocol), complicated intra-abdominal infections (meropenem/vaborbactam, eravacycline), nosocomial pneumonia (meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/relebactam), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (delafloxacin) and community-acquired pneumonia (lefamulin).",

Microorganisms play an important role in the soil ecosystem and participate, among others, in such processes as the maintenance of soil structure, humification, release of organic compounds, disposal of pollutants and transformation of organic matter. The maintenance of competent state of soil microbial communities, i.e. the appropriate microorganism count, activity and diversity, is a necessary condition for the functioning of a highly complex system such as the soil. Phyllosphere bacteria have the potential to influence plant biogeography and ecosystem function through their influence on plant performance under different environmental conditions, but the drivers of variation in leaf-associated bacterial biodiversity among host plants are not well understood. Hence, undoubtedly, an important research aspect is the selection and development of indicators to evaluate microbial biodiversity of the soil and plant phyllosphere. In this publication, selected molecular methods used for the diversity assessment of microorganisms have been presented. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Presently, the overuse of antibiotics is a great problem all over the world. The reason for this phenomenon is both primary and secondary resistance. Primary resistance is a congenital feature of microbes and does not depend on its contact with a drug. It is chromosomally coded and cannot be transmitted to other species of bacteria. Secondary resistance, on the other hand, develops as a result of contact with the antibiotic substance. Genes located in plasmids are responsible for the formation of this type of resistance. One plasmid often contains resistance genes for several different antibiotics. Plasmids can transfer gene-encoded resistance from one bacterial cell to another by conjugation and transduction. As a result of the overuse of antibiotics in humans and animals, a growing number of infections – such as pneumonia, salmonellosis, tuberculosis, and gonorrhea – are becoming more troublesome to treat. Antibiotic resistance leads also to longer hospital stays, higher medical costs and finally increased mortality. Now people are finally becoming aware of the consequences of the overuse of antibiotics. Thus, interest in natural bacteriostatic materials, such as plant essential oils, has observably grown. A number of scientific studies have confirmed the antimicrobial activity of plant-derived essential oils against pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . A very important advantage of plant oils is the fact that they are active in low, sub-lethal concentrations, without provoking the acquisition resistance mechanisms in bacteria. The aim of this review was to explain the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance formation on the example of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to demonstrate that it is worth looking for alternative treatment methods which can lead to limiting the use of antibiotics. Finally, this work tries to explain how the oils work. 1.Introduction. 2. The characteristics of Pseudomonas genus. 2.1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 3.

The ability of bacteria to lead a saprophytic and parasitic existence as well as insensitivity to many physicochemical factors greatly facilitates the spread and guarantees access to a wide range of vulnerable organisms. Although the factors predisposing to infection result in a relatively low incidence of disease, infections are characterized by high mortality and often the need of hospitalization. The disease most often manifests itself in the form of bacteremia, meningitis and encephalitis as well as perinatal infections. The way Listeria spreads in the body contributes to the identification of new types of the disease. Recent studies on the acquisition of pathogenicity traits, dose and development of antibiotic resistance as well as numerous reports on incidence of these bacteria and the epidemics they caused, have led to more efficient monitoring of the pathogen .

    "abstract": "Abstract Dermatophytes are pathogenic fungi with high affinity for keratinised structures present in nails, skin, and hair causing superficial infections known as skin mycoses or dermatomycoses. The disease is characterised by variable prognosis. Its clinical picture is largely dependent on the immune status of the host and can range from local skin or subcutaneous infections to invasive, disseminated, and life-threatening infections. In the first decades of the 20th century, the first concerns were raised about the growing prevalence of fungal infections in humans, which was ascribed to various environmental factors and anthropopressure. Consequently, the first therapeutic attempts were made to treat these infections. At present, at least several different groups of antifungal drugs are available for medical treatment. Nevertheless, the overlapping mechanisms of action of these substances and discontinuation of therapy by patients may contribute to the emergence of resistance of strains, including multi-drug resistance. The aim of this study is to review the literature focused on the mechanisms of resistance developed by dermatophytes to antifungal substances. Through evolution, these fungi have developed complex cellular response systems comprising elements of the environment-cell signalling system, responses to stressors, and tolerance to harmful chemical substances. Such stimuli as exposure of dermatophytes to an antifungal drug, damage to their cell wall, and disturbances in the osmolarity of the environment with generation of reactive oxygen species can be activators of signalling pathways targeted at mitigation of the effects of sudden cellular stress. A majority of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to these stressors also constitute a mechanism of tolerance and resistance to antifungal substances. In the future, elucidation of these mechanisms may lead to development of new chemotherapeutics that will become a key strategy in the treatment of dermatophyte strains exhibiting resistance to currently available antifungal drugs. 1.

Based on its biochemical properties, infective dose and geographical location , four subspecies have been distinguished within the species F. tularensis : the highly infectious F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (type A) occurring mainly in the United States of America, F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (type B) mainly in Europe, F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica isolated mostly in Asia and F. tularensis subsp. novicida , non-pathogenic to humans. Due to its ability to infect and variable forms of the disease, the etiological agent of tularaemia is classified by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) as a biological warfare agent with a high danger potential (group A). The majority of data describing incidence of tularaemia in Poland is based on serological tests. However, real-time PCR method and MST analysis of F. tularensis highly variable intergenic regions may be also applicable to detection, differentiation and determination of genetic variation among F. tularensis strains. In addition, the above methods could be successfully used in molecular characterization of tularaemia strains from humans and animals isolated in screening research, and during epizootic and epidemic outbreaks. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered as one of the most important threats for public health with global dimensions. The aim of this paper is to analyze the causes and consequences of antimicrobial resistance and the actions which should be taken in order to reduce this threat. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics are believed to be responsible for the emergence of resistant pathogens. These occur not only in human medicine but also in veterinary medicine, animal husbandry and plant production. Another factor which contributes to the global spread of resistant pathogens is low sanitation, mainly encountered in low and middle income countries. However, low quality infection control programs and the lack of antibiotic stewardship programs also contribute to the dissemination of resistant strains. Other factors which were shown to have impact are population movement, medical tourism, intensive trade exchange and climate change. The consequences of increased resistance such as medical, microbiological, epidemiological, psychological and economic are also discussed. Finally, several documents of WHO and European Union underlying “One health” approach in the combat of resistance as well as international projects addressing problem of AMR are described. The importance of broad education campaigns targeting medical professionals, health care decision makers and general public in combat of AMR such as European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EU) and International Antibiotics Awareness Week (WHO) are also discussed. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Antimicrobial resistance is becoming a paramount health concern nowadays. The increasing drug resistance in microbes is due to improper medications or over usage of drugs. Bacteria develop many mechanisms to extrude the antibiotics entering the cell. The most prominent are the efflux pumps (EPs). EPs play a significant role in intrinsic and acquired bacterial resistance, mainly in Gram-negative bacteria. EPs may be unique to one substrate or transport several structurally different compounds (including multi-class antibiotics). These pumps are generally associated with multiple drug resistance (MDR). EPs are energized by a proton motive force and can pump a vast range of detergents, drugs, antibiotics and also β-lactams, which are impermeable to the cytoplasmic membrane. There are five leading efflux transporter families in the prokaryotic kingdom: MF (Major Facilitator), MATE (Multidrug And Toxic Efflux), RND (Resistance-Nodulation-Division), SMR (Small Multidrug Resistance) and ABC (ATP Binding Cassette). Apart from the ABC family, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to drive the export of substrates, all other systems use the proton motive force as an energy source. Some molecules known as Efflux Pump Inhibitors (EPI) can inhibit EPs in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. EPIs can interfere with the efflux of antimicrobial agents, leading to an increase in the concentration of antibiotics inside the bacterium, thus killing it. Therefore, identifying new EPIs appears to be a promising strategy for countering antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR). This mini-review focuses on the major efflux transporters of the bacteria and the progress in identifying Efflux Pump Inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fungal pathogenicity to plants, animals, and humans leads to several detrimental effects in our society by causing diseases that impact livelihood and food security. While the recent pandemic shifted focus to viral pathogens, fungal pathogens are still impacting the world that we live in. It is important to study fungal pathogenicity with the latest scientific advancement. One way to do that is to understand the conservation of pathogenicity in the fungus kingdom which will further elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind fungal pathogenicity across all species of fungi. This review provides an outlook on the various bioinformatics and genomics approaches and currently available resources in understanding fungal pathogenicity. It also discusses the current state of affairs and emerging trends in the study of fungal pathogenicity. Finally, this review also provide suggestions different approaches for the study of fungal pathogenicity to see further improve our understanding in this field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Listeria monocytogenes bacilli are a known cause of non-invasive gastrointestinal listeriosis with diarrhea, less frequently they cause invasive infections: meningitis and encephalitis, bacteremia and its complications: endocarditis, intraocular inflammation of the eye and others. The risk of human infection is mainly associated with consuming food contaminated with these bacteria. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), infections with L. monocytogenes etiology caused the highest hospitalizations and deaths among zoonotic diseases reported in 2022. A report by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported 0.44 cases of listeriosis per 100,000 population in 2021, with the highest incidence rate for people over 64 years old at 1.7. The study aimed to review and describe cases of invasive listeriosis diagnosed in adult patients in Europe between 2010 and 2023. Fifty-two cases of the disease were included, of which 19 were meningitis, 13 showed bacteremia, nine were associated with endocarditis and 10 with intraocular inflammation. One case had a clinical form of hepatitis. Only seven cases of L. monocytogenes infection were related to consuming contaminated food. Eleven cases ended in the death of patients. Invasive listeriosis is a difficult-to-treat infection with a significant mortality rate. It requires decisive action by monitoring the prevalence and extent of food contamination with these microorganisms and preventing epidemic outbreaks. Research on listeriosis should focus on improving the clinical treatment of severe cases of infection and studying the complex mechanisms of their pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The uricase enzyme yields allantoin, hydrogen peroxide, and carbon dioxide by catalyzing the oxidative opening of the purine ring in the urate pathway. This enzyme is important for biochemical diagnosis and reduces toxic urate accumulation during various diseases (hyperuricemia, gout, and bedwetting). Direct urate oxidase injection is recommended in renal complications-associated gout and to prevent chemotherapy-linked hyperuricemia disorders. Thus, uricase is a promising enzyme with diverse applications in medicine. Microbial production of uricase is featured by high growth rates, cost-effective bioprocessing, and easy optimization of the medium. Microbes produce the enzyme extracellular or intracellular. Extracellular uricase is preferred for biotechnological applications as it minimizes time, effort, and purification processes. This review provides insights into uricase-producing microbes, bacterial uric acid degradation pathways, degrading enzymes, and uricase-encoding genes. Furthermore, aspects influencing the microorganisms’ production of the uricase enzyme, its activity, and its purification procedure are also emphasized. Cell disruption is mandatory for intercellular uricase production, which elevates production costs. Therefore, extracellular uricase-producing microbial strains should be investigated, and production factors should be optimized. Future techniques for obtaining extracellular enzymes should feature reduced time and effort, as well as a simple purification methodology. Furthermore, uricase gene-carrying recombinant probiotic microorganisms could become an effective tool for gout treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transplantology is a branch of medicine that is developing rapidly. Transplanted whole organs or segments of organs may be recovered from either living or deceased donors. New methods of preserving transplanted solid organs, including the kidney, liver, heart, lung, and pancreas, as well as tissues, such as the cornea and skin, are being developed. Preservation fluid, which is used to perfuse and store the donated organ or tissue, should reduce biological deterioration of organs and tissue, attenuate ischemia/reperfusion-induced cell/tissue injury, and protect against damage. Lowering the storage temperature of organs significantly reduces the risk of damage. Efforts are also made to shorten the time between collecting the organ or tissue from the donor and transplanting it in the recipient. However, during transplantation, the recipient may become infected, primarily with bacteria and fungi. Infections of organ recipients occur most often due to unhygienic organ collection, improper handling and transport, and inappropriate preservation conditions, especially contamination of preservation fluid. The literature on contamination of organ preservation fluid and infections in graft recipients is very diverse, both in terms of the isolated bacterial and fungal species and the number of incidents. A large percentage of contaminating microorganisms belong to the generally non-pathogenic skin microbiota, but there are also cases of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Besides, the transplanted organs themselves may pose a danger. They may contain latent microorganisms, mainly viruses and parasites, that could be activated in a patient who has been subjected to immunosuppression to reduce the risk of organ rejection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Screening tests are now readily accessible, quick and highly sensitive. Diagnostics of HIV infections involves serological testing followed by confirmation tests by molecular biology methods (NAAT). Fast, accurate, anonymous and free HIV testing has been provided by Voluntary Counselling and Testing Points (VCTs) for over 20 years to any adult in Poland, regardless of nationality. Additionally, the educational activities are conducted aimed at informing people from various social backgrounds about HIV prevention and diagnostic possibilities, as well as other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The aim of the article was to present the procedures for the operation of VCTs in Poland, their location, testing scheme and a summary of the activities that promote such points in the medical community. Between 2019 and 2023, 157,833 people registered for HIV testing in VCTs in Poland, of which 10,177 (6.45%) were foreigners. In the analyzed period, the number of tests among foreigners visiting VCTs in Poland almost doubled, from 1,552 in 2019 to 2,827 in 2023. In addition, a higher percentage of positive results was recorded among foreigners – 5.08% compared to Poles – 1.24%. The frequency analysis of positive results detection reported in VCTs vs. National Institute of Public Health NIH – National Research Institute showed that, on average 26% (2,342/8,891) of positive results in Poland from 2019–2023 were detected in the framework of tests carried out in VCTs. The operation of VCT points in Poland enables the reaching of a larger group of people, especially key adult populations. It is a valuable complement to routine diagnostics outside the health care system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Staphylococci constitute an important component of the human microbiome. Most of them are coagulase-negative species, whose importance in the pathogenesis of human infections has been widely recognized and is being documented on a regular basis. Until recently, the only well-known coagulase-positive staphylococcus species recognized as human pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus . Previously, the ability to produce coagulase was used as its basic diagnostic feature, because other coagulase-positive species were associated with animal hosts. Progress in the laboratory medicine, in which automatic or semi-automatic systems identify the staphylococci species, revealed a phenomenon of spreading of the coagulase positive staphylococci to new niches and hosts, as they are being isolated from human clinical materials with increasing frequency. As a result, many reaserchers and laboratories have turned their attention to the phenomenon, which caused an inflow of new data on these species. An increasingly expansive pathogenic potential of coagulase-positive staphylococci against humans has been documented. In the presented study, recent data on both S. aureus and species previously considered to be animal, i.e. S. intermedius , S. pseudintermedius , S. delphini , S. lutrae , S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans , S. hyicus as well as newly described species S. agnetis , were shown. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Arsenic is an ubiquitous element present in the environment either through geological or anthropogenic activities. Millions of people all over the world are exposed to arsenic mainly via air, drinking water and food sources, which results in higher incidence of cancer. Several mechanisms by which arsenic compounds induce tumorigenesis have been proposed. Arsenic mediates its toxicity by generating oxidative stress, inducing protein misfolding, promoting genotoxicity, hampering DNA repair and disrupting signal transduction. Thus, all organisms have developed multiple pathways for arsenic detoxification. In this article, we review recent advances in the understanding of arsenic toxicity and its transport routes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including a dual role of aquaglyceroporins in the uptake and efflux, active transport out of the cell via secondary ion pumps and sequestration of metalloid-thiol conjugates into vacuoles by primary ABC transporters. We believe that such studies are of high importance due to the increasing usage of arsenic-based drugs in the treatment of certain types of cancer and diseases caused by protozoan parasites as well as for the development of bio-and phytoremediation strategies for metalloid-polluted areas. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified as a member of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. BVDV is one of the most important viral pathogens of ruminants worldwide, causing severe economic losses. Infection results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory disease to fetal death and mucosal disease. The virus particles are small and contain a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA molecule of approximately 12.3 kb with one large open reading frame flanked by two untranslated regions (5’UTR and 3’UTR). The polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved by viral and host proteases resulting in the formation of mature viral proteins. It is well established that BVDV strains show considerable genetic diversity. BVD viruses are classified as two species: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Quite recently, a new putative species, BVDV-3, was detected. The viruses exist as one of two biotypes: cytopathic or non- cytopathic, based on their activity in cell cultures. The phylogenetic analysis of the 5’UTR and N pro region has revealed at least 21 distinct subtypes of BVDV-1 and 4 subtypes of BVDV-2. Genetic diversity of BVD viruses has serious clinical implications such as immune evasion, increase of virulence, host range alteration and also affects the efficacy of vaccination programmes and diagnostic methods. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The global production of L-amino acids is largely based on microbiological synthesis. The largest bioproduction concerns L-glutamic acid (1.5 million tons per year), and L-lysine (850,000 tons per year). Among other amino acids, ectoine and hydroxyectoine are mentioned in the growing demand. Currently, the main producer of ectoine based on the biotechnology process is the German company Bitop. The organism used in the ectoine production is Halomonas elongata isolated from a solar salt facility on Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. The production of ectoine described in the literature is based on the so-called “milking” process. The great demand for amino acids is related to their properties and potential use. Ectoine, as a kosmotropic substance, has the property of stabilizing the structure of water molecules. Just like other osmolytes in aqueous solutions, ectoine increases the hydration of macromolecules, preventing them from denaturation. The industrial use of ectoine is based mainly on the ability to protect the skin and alleviate its inflammation but also applies to other, broad possibilities of its application in biotechnology, cosmetology, medicine and pharmacy. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the widespread problem of overweight and obesity is the fifth most important risk factor for deaths in the world. The most frequently mentioned are the genetic and environmental factors that lead to the absorption of excess energy from food and to accumulate it in the form of spare adipose tissue. Another important fact is that even the use of a low-energy diet does not support the effective reduction of excessive body weight. It turns out that the cause may be intestinal microbiota, the composition of which changes in people with overweight and obesity. The intestinal microbiota dysbiosis is additionally perceived by many researchers as the cause of the development of metabolic diseases, including obesity or type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria constituting a component of the intestinal ecosystem are the source of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), responsible for the development of systemic inflammation and endotoxemia. Based on a literature review related to the subject, it can be concluded that intestinal microbiota disorders, intestinal barrier damage and increased LPS levels in patients adversely affect the obesity and components of the metabolic syndrome and hinder the treatment of these diseases. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The food industry is one area of industrial activities that requires the frequent implementation of technological and product innovations. Foodstuffs obtained both in technologically advanced factories, as well as in small manufacturing enterprises, are increasingly produced using innovative food additives, which include natural polysaccharide ingredients. One of these substances is bionanocellulose – microbially produced cellulose (most commonly by the genus Komagataeibacter xylinus , formerly known as Gluconacetobacter xylinus ). Bionanocellulose is a polymer with exceptionally valuable functional properties resulting from its unique molecular structure (formed by the chemically ultra-pure β-1,4-glucan). The main features of bionanocellulose are high hygroscopicity, flexibility and mechanical strength. Various physical and chemical forms of bionanocellulose (produced both during surface and submerged cultivation) are increasingly used in the production of food products. The need to produce highly diversified (e.g., usable or sensory) food products as well as the increasing difficulties associated with access to conventional sources of external coal, necessitate the search of alternative culture media for the production of bionanocellulose. The aim of the work is to describe the use of alternative carbon sources for the microbiological synthesis of bionanocellulose and its application in the food industry. Introduction. 2. Structure and physico-mechanical characteristics of bionanocellulose. 3. The process of synthesis of bionanocellulose and its importance for microorganisms. 4.

    "abstract": "Abstract Paradoxically, despite the progress in medicine, the prevalence of fungal infections is increasing from year to year. At the beginning of the third millennium, practical therapeutic options are still very limited. Currently, only eight classes of antifungal compounds are in clinical use, only four of which are used in the treatment of dermatomycoses. The intense search for the “Holy Grail” of antifungal therapy that has been going on since the second half of the 20th century faces serious obstacles arising from the eukaryotic model of fungal cell structure. In this paper, new groups of chemical compounds of mainly natural origin have been synthetically described, which due to their interesting antifungal activity, including pathogenic species of dermatophytes, may constitute new therapeutic options. Among compounds currently arousing great interest, compounds from the group of terpenoids, alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids and essential oils deserve attention. Many of these compounds are in clinical trials as potential antifungal agents, while others are in preclinical studies. Future research should focus on attempting to determine the applicability of the given substances in implementation for routine use and their effectiveness, toxicity and side effects. 1.

The first human coronaviruses were described in the sixties of the twentieth century, the last one, HCoV-MERS, in 2012 y. Coronaviruses can cause mild, asymptomatic infections as well as severe respiratory diseases, like pneumonia and bronchiolitis. The symptoms of HCoV infection are mainly: fever, nasopharyngitis, cough, bronchiolitis, pneumonia. Infections due to HCoV occur during the whole human life, but aremost frequent in children. They can occur throughout the year, but are most common in the winter season. Treatment of HCoV infections is usually symptomatic. Diagnosis of HCoV is mainly based on molecular technics such as quantitative PCR. Serological tests are only used for epidemiological purposes. 1. History. 2. Taxonomy and occurrence. 3.

    "abstract": "Abstract Helicobacter pylori commonly colonizes the human gastric mucosa. Infections with this microorganism can contribute to serious health consequences, such as peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Chronic persistence of this bacteria in the host organism is probably strongly dependent on the secretion of outer membrane vesicles (OMV). These organelles are small, electron-dense, extracellular structures which are secreted in large amounts during stressful conditions, among others. H. pylori OMV mediate transfer of virulence factors such as toxins and immunomodulatory compounds. They contribute to avoiding a response from the host immune system and inducing chronic gastritis. OMV secretion also affects the formation of cell aggregates, microcolonies and biofilm matrix. Enhanced OMV production is connected to maintenance of direct contact through cell-cell and cell-surface interactions. A key component of OMV, which determines their structural function, is extracellular DNA (eDNA) anchored to the surface of these organelles. eDNA associated with OMV additionally determines the genetic recombination in the process of horizontal gene transfer. H. pylori is naturally competent for genetic transformation and is constantly capable of DNA uptake from the environment. The natural competence state promotes the assimilation of eDNA anchored to the OMV surface. This is probably dependent on ComB and ComEC components, which are involved in the transformation process. For this reason, the OMV secretion mediates intensive exchange of genetic material, promotes adaptation to changing environmental conditions and enables persistent infecting of the gastric mucosa by H. pylori . 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the last few years, there have been works in literature describing clinical cases of infections with bacteria previously considered to be non-pathogenic. So far, these bacteria have been commonly isolated from the natural environment: water, soil, plants, and isolation from a sample of clinical material has often been considered an impurity. Therefore, the aim of the paper was to draw attention to newly emerging bacterial species, their characteristics, biochemical properties, virulence factors and predisposition to selected forms of infection in groups of patients with specific risk factors. The impact on the more frequent isolation of species of bacteria previously considered to be non-pathogenic has several aspects: reliable diagnostic methods, including correct identification of the species, enabling the differentiation of closely related bacteria, the growing group of immune-compromised patients and with infectious risk factors (such as older age, diabetes, tumours, organ transplantation), more susceptible to infection, also with less pathogenic microorganisms. Greater adaptability of bacteria to new environmental conditions, including the human body, are also worth mentioning. The pathogenic effect of these bacteria, mainly related to the production of biofilms and factors conditioning adhesion to host cells or biomaterials, facilitating colonization and subsequent infection, is also important. The progress in medicine that has taken place in recent years has positively influenced the life expectancy of patients with certain diseases and in many situations, it contributed to an improvement in its quality. Unfortunately, it also made it possible to cause infection with bacteria that were previously considered to be low or non-pathogenic. 1. Introduction. 2. Gram-positive rods 3.

    "abstract": "Abstract The fast development of the biopharmaceutical market is correlated with the growing number and availability of technologies for the production of so-called biodrugs. One of the main procedures for therapeutic protein production is based on bacterial expression systems. In order to maintain the constant quality and homogeneity of the initial inoculum, the cell bank must be created in full accordance with quality standards. The first step should be the establishment of a Master Cell Bank (MCB), which must be performed in a laboratory that meets high quality standards and according to well-described main procedures. The MCB should be initiated from a single well-characterised bacterial colony. A Working Cell Bank (WCB) is usually prepared as a second step from one or few vials deposited in the MCB. The WCB must be characterised for bacterial strain homology and be free of any biological cross contamination. This paper describes the main requirements and good practises for the preparation of a cell bank suitable for constant and reproducible production of biopharmaceuticals. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Naturally occurring entomopathogens are important regulatory factors of insect populations. Among them, entomopathogenic fungi play a meaningful role. The invasion of insects by parasitic fungi occurs through penetration of the host integument. Death of the host is a result of tissue destruction, exhaustion of nutrients, and the production of toxins. Many recent studies show that entomopathogenic fungi are not only considered as insect pathogens, but also play additional roles in nature, including endophytism, plant disease antagonism, plant growth promotion, and rhizosphere colonization. These newly understood attributes provide possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. Such additional roles recently-discovered to be played by entomopathogenic fungi provide opportunities for multiple uses of these fungi in integrated pest management strategies. This article reviews the literature currently available on entomopathogenic fungi. It also addresses the possible mechanisms of protection conferred by endophytic fungal entomopathogens and explores the potential use of these fungi as dual microbial control agents against both insect and pathogen pests.

    "abstract": "Abstract Chitin is the main structural component of fungal cells and of the exoskeletons of insects. Plant and bacterial cells are equipped with chitinases, enzymes that break down chitin. Chitinases participate in many interactions between organisms, including symbiosis and antagonism. These interactions are significant drivers of many ecosystem functions and are important for the health of plants and animals. Additionally, due to the common occupation of habitat, fungi and bacteria engage in complex interactions that lead to critical changes in the behavior of microorganisms like endosymbiotic bacteria of mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, chitinases are of interest in environmental science, medicine and biotechnology. The present review describes the role of plant and bacterial chitinases in mutual interactions. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years in Poland as well as globally at an alarming rate, the number of bacteria producing mechanisms of antibiotic resistance has been increased. The major source of concern is the emergence and dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Carbapenems are considered as last resort drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. At the present time the greatest menaces to public health are strains producing KPC ( Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases), NDM (New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase) and OXA-48 (Oxacillinase-48). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales have been resistant to most and sometimes even to all drugs that would be considered for treatment. Therefore, the accurate therapeutic options for the treatment of infections due to CRE strains are limited to the following antibiotics: colistin, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides. Moreover, combination therapy containing two or more antibiotics has been recommended for the treatment of severe infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. Due to the rapid spread of carbapenem-resistant strains and the lack of new antibiotic drug development, there is an urgent need to broaden our knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Lyme borreliosis, an infectious disease caused by tick-borne spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, is regarded as the most commonly reported vector-borne infection in the Northern Hemisphere. Currently, the basis for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease is a two-step serological examination. The first is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the test result is positive or questionable, a Western blot is used as the second phase test. In both methods, the total cell lysates of B. burgdorferi s.l. are used as the main source of antigens. However, the huge diversity of genospecies within B. burgdorferi s.l. and the low degree of preservation of the sequence of their proteins means that using the cell lysates of one of the species is not sufficient to correctly diagnose Lyme disease. Numerous literature reports show that the use of B. burgdorferi s.l. recombinant or chimeric antigens may be a potential solution to problems occurring in Lyme disease immunodiagnosis. However, for diagnostic tests based on recombinant proteins to be as effective as possible, carefully selected antigens or fragments should be used. With this approach, a test can be developed with a sensitivity that remains independent of the B. burgdorferi s.l. species which caused the disease. In addition, the exclusive use of protein fragments may definitely reduce the frequency of cross-reactions. 1. Introduction. 2. Characterization of selected B. burgdorferi s.l. antigens. 3.

    "abstract": "Abstract Antibiotics are widely used medicines in the treatment of infectious diseases. However, some of them show also non-antibiotic properties, which are increasingly used in the treatment of non-infectious diseases. The authors of this publication believe that this is one of the reasons behind antibiotic dissemination in the environment and, ipso facto , behind the increasing risk of bacterial resistance. It is worth remembering that, along with the progress in science and better knowledge of the new properties of antibiotics, every extension of indications for antimicrobial agents may restrict their primary indications. Progress in science does not always mean progress in therapy. In fact, it may sometimes have an opposite effect and we should be able to assess the benefit/risk ratio. The aim of this study was to present other than antibacterial properties of antibiotics which currently are or may be used in the future in the treatment of non-infectious diseases, as well as to assess the long-term effects of extending the indications for medicines commonly used in the treatment of infectious diseases. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, such attempt has not been made so far, therefore authors decided to review the most important, useful or promising reports on non-antibiotic use of antibiotics. The article summarizes the latest data on prokinetic action of erythromycin, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action of azithromycine, potential use of doxycycline as an anticancer and anti-inflammatory agent, and also anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties of minocycline. Futhermore, the basics of demeclocycline application in the treatment of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypesecretion syndrome and rifaximin use as an anti-inflammatory and eubiotic agent are presented. Neuroprotective action of ceftriaxone and anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory action of fusafungine were also described. 1.

Food additives are widely used to improve the taste, texture or attractiveness of food. Due to the proven occurrence of intestinal dysbiosis in many diseases, various types of food additives and their impact on the intestinal microbiome should be tested.

The most common HPV types responsible for carcinogenesis of head and neck areas are types 16 and 18. The virus infects human epithelial cells, for example during a sexual intercourse. Transmission from mother to child during birth is also possible. There is evidence linking HPV with laryngeal cancer, leukoplakia, tonsil cancer or Bowen’s disease.

    "abstract": "Abstract Historically, the term amyloid was used strictly with reference to human neurodegenerative diseases. Nowadays, it is known that many proteins have the potential to conformational changes into β-sheet structures with tendency to form insoluble amyloid fibrils. Moreover, amyloid proteins are widespread among microorganisms. Bacteria and fungi produce functional amyloids which exhibit all characteristics of amyloid proteins, but in contrast to a numerous group of human toxic amyloids, they play important physiological functions in microorganisms. There is growing evidence that functional amyloids are important in bacterial adhesion and invasion. Furthermore, amyloids make biofilms thicker, rougher, and more resistant to drying out. The increasing interest in better understanding of the nature of these unusual microbial proteins and their role in pathogenesis are likely to contribute to the effective treatment or prevention of infectious diseases in humans. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The beginnings of predictive microbiology date back to 1920 when Bigelow developed a logarithmic-linear dependence of kinetics on the death of microorganisms. Predictive microbiology is a sub-discipline of food microbiology, whose task is to predict the behavior of microorganisms in food using mathematical models. The predictive model for microbiology is usually a simplified description of the correlation between the observed reactions and the factors responsible for the occurrence of these reactions. There are several main conceptual models (empirical vs. mechanistic, stochastic vs. deterministic, dynamic vs. static), in which there are model divisions depending on the type of examined microorganism or the nature of the problems caused by microbes (kinetic vs. probabilistic), described variables (first, secondary and tertiary) or the influence of environmental factors on microbial populations (growth, survival, inactivation). The new generations of models include molecular and genomic models, transfer models, Artificial Neural Network, interactions between species, and single cell models. The process of creating a mathematical model requires coordination of work and the knowledge of: microbiology, statistics, mathematics, chemistry, process engineering and computer and web science. It also requires appropriate hardware and software. There are four stages in the construction of a mathematical model: planning; data collection and analysis; mathematical description; validation and storage of data. In recent years, numerous computer software programs have been developed: FISHMAP, FSSP, Dairy Product Safety Predictor, Symbiosis, GroPIN, Listeria Meat FDA-iRISK, TRiMiCri, Microbial Responses, GlnaFiT, FILTREX, PMM-Lab. ComBase database, on the other hand, is a pioneering achievement as an on-line tool. Some programs meet the requirements for creating Food Safety Model Repositories (FSMR). 1. Introduction. 2.

Their fruiting bodies are valued for their distinctive aroma. The aroma might be partially due to complex bacterial community which colonizes their fruiting bodies. Some bacterial species are also believed to promote the truffle’ fruitification due to the fixation of nitrogen inside the developing truffles. Although truffles, especially of the species Tuber aestivum , are getting more popular and are widely cultivated, little is still known about their biology, composition and the role of their associative microbes. The aim of this study was to present the current knowledge about the bacterial communities associated with black truffles and their potential influence on the truffle life cycle and maturation. 1.

To date, no strains have been observed in nature which possess all of the above-mentioned characteristics. For many years, intensive research has been carried out to improve the technological properties of industrial strains. A number of methods have been developed to allow genetic improvement of distillery yeasts. One of the most promising and effective methods is genome shuffling, allowing the creation of hybrids whose genome is a combination of large DNA fragments derived from strains with distinct phenotypic traits. Genome shuffling creates a chance that the new strain will have valuable functional genes, including their full operons. This, in turn, increases the chance of a long-term maintenance of beneficial technological features by the obtained hybrids. 1. Introduction. 2. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . 2.1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Orthomyxoviruses is a family of viruses with its most common representatives being the influenza viruses (A, B, C and D types), which constitute a significant clinical problem. Influenza is a disease affecting animals and people. It is transmitted by airborne droplets and manifestes itself with such symptoms as coughing, sneezing, muscle pain or fever. Influenza often leads to complications, including pneumonia and myocarditis. In the past, influenza viruses were responsible for pandemics, including the most infamous pandemic of the Spanish influenza. It took place in the years 1918–1919 and is thought to have been responsible for the death toll of as many as 100 million people. The family also includes Isavirus , responsible for fish anaemia, Quaranjavirus and Thogotovirus , among which there also species causing diseases in humans. For example, a human infection with the Bourbon virus was diagnosed only once, in 2014. These viruses are much more rare then influenza viruse and also less known. New species are still discovered. 1. Introduction. 2. Characteristics. 3. Replication of a model Influenzavirus A. 4. History. 5. Diagnostic methods. 6. Pathogenicity. 6.1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacterial competition, defined as a local neighbour interactions, can lead to competitors coexistence, bacterial community self-organization or as travelling waves of species dominance in ecological niches. Bacteria have developed many mechanisms to communicate and compete. Kin discrimination mechanisms in bacterial populations allow species to distinguish a friend from a foe in bacterial environment. Type Vb and VI secretion systems (TVIbSS and TVISS) play crucial role in this phenomenon. A contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI), primarily found in Escherichia coli strains, utilities CdiB/CdiA protein of type Vb secretion system, described also as two-partner secretion (TPS) system, to inhibit growth of non-kin strains, where cell contact is required. Presence of an intracellular small immunity protein (CdiI) protects E. coli cells from autoinhibition. Other bacterial competition system, primarily found in nodulation process of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Trifolii strain, engages type VI secretion system. The structure of TVISS is more complicated and comprises the series of proteins with structural homology to bacteriophage tail proteins and membrane proteins which builds the core of the system (Tss proteins). Meanwhile, other proteins of the TVISS was described as associated proteins (Tag proteins). Important proteins for TVISS are haemolysin coregulated protein (Hcp) which has hexameric, tubular structure and VgrG protein (valine-glycine repeat G) which play a dual role in the process: as a chaperone protein in secretion of effector toxin or/and as a secreted toxin itself. Despite the structural differences of both secretion systems they show functional homology in competition phenomenon and govern the social life of bacterial community. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Staphylococci belong to bacteria often isolated from clinical material obtained from animals. Unlike in human medicine, in veterinary, different species of coagulase-positive staphylococci are isolated from clinical specimens, and except Staphylococcus aureus , Staphylococcus pseudintermedius , and other species are also often recognized. Recently, the taxonomy of staphylococci has been updated, therefore, now it is necessary to recognize the new species as well. Currently, coagulase-negative staphylococci are considered an important group of opportunistic pathogens. The accurate identification of species within the genus Staphylococcus is important because, according to the EUCAST and CLSI recommendations, the interpretation of the results of susceptibility testing for S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci is different. Furthermore, the resistance to methicillin in S. aureus strains is detected using a cefoxitin disk, whereas in the case of S. pseudintermedius – using an oxacillin disk. An important problem for veterinary microbiological laboratories is a limited number of unified guidelines on methodology and guidelines specifying the interpretation of the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing. The lack of available recommendations for some antibiotics testing results in the fact that veterinary laboratories often use the guidelines established for human pathogens. There is an urgent necessity for harmonization of methods and to develop guidelines for the interpretation of results of susceptibility testing for different bacteria, including various species of staphylococci from the individual animal host. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Heavy metals are found in all living organisms where, as indispensable microelements (e.g. zinc, iron, copper), are involved in endless metabolic processes. However, living organisms are also at a risk of exposure to highly toxic metals, including cadmium or lead, which do not play any physiological role. Among multiple mechanisms associated with the maintenance of micronutrient homeostasis and detoxification of unwanted metals, there is a family of low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich proteins, able to chelate multiple metal ions i.e. the metallothioneins (MTs). They are widely distributed among Eucaryota , however, they have also been found in some limited Procaryota , including cyanobacteria, pseudomonads and mycobacteria. These bacterial MTs differ in terms of primary structure, the number and type of metal ions they bind, as well as with regard to their physiological functions. The expression of bacterial MTs is regulated by metals via metalosensors. MTs from cyanobacteria seem to be involved in zinc homeostasis, while in Pseudomonas they are linked to cadmium detoxification. In Mycobacterium , MTs bind copper ions and may play a pivotal role in the virulence of these bacteria. The presence of MTs in other groups of bacteria remains questionable. Problems with identification of new bacterial MTs are mainly associated with low level of homology between MT amino acid sequences of different bacterial groups. Further research is needed to evaluate the physiological functions of metallothioneins in Procaryota . 1. Introduction. 2. The history of discoveries of bacterial metallothioneins. 3.

This virus was identified in Alkhumra district of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 1995 from a butcher patient. The infected individual develops symptoms febrile flu-like illness, hemorrhagic manifestations and less like encephalitis. Several cases have been reported from various locations of Saudi Arabia and a few from Egypt and is further expanding in tropical and subtropical regions of Western Asia. The virus is transmitted to human by direct contact to animal, raw meat, and biproducts as well as either tick or mosquito bites. Based on the recent status, a great concern of public health was raised with the AHFV epidemics and infection. Currently, there is no effective vaccine and antiviral therapeutics against AHFV. So, there is an urgent need to design and develop an effective preventive measure using interdisciplinary approach. This review will provide the status of research work based on the latest published information about AHFV. The provided information will be highly useful to design the effective preventive measures to control the disease in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In health, the relationship between gut microflora and the host is of a mutualistic kind. Microbiota offers many benefits to the host, including harvesting energy, regulating host immunity, and the synthesis of vitamins. Alteration in gut microflora can lead to homeostasis disruption and development of various diseases. Dysbiosis is commonly observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nutrient processing by gut microbiota results in the production of some uremic toxins, and these accumulate in CKD causing deleterious effects. Increased permeability of the intestinal barrier, which is also seen in CKD contributes to the development of the uremic state. These factors are associated with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress and therefore are involved in CKD-related complications, including disease progression, cardiovascular disease, anemia, mineral-metabolism, and insulin resistance. This review describes connections between altered gut microflora and development of CKD and its complications, as well as possible therapeutic options. 1. Microbiota – short characteristic. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract The most frequent etiologic agents of the urinary tract infections (UTIs) are UPEC strains (Uropathogenic Escherichia coli ), which are responsible for 75–95% of UTIs. The virulence factors of UPEC bacteria, as well as their ability to form biofilm, play a significant role in the pathogenicity of UTIs. Limiting iron availability is a major host defense against the growth of microorganisms within hosts. That is why UPEC strains produce various types of siderophores as well as siderophore receptors, which facilitate the uptake and transport of iron to the bacterial cell. Moreover, in order to modulate an inflammatory response and host signaling pathways, UPEC strains produce the following toxins: α-hemolysin (HlyA), cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF-1) and vacuolating autotransporter toxin (VAT, Vat-like/ Vat-ExEc). Moreover, Usp is a novel genotoxin of UPEC strains which provokes DNA fragmentation and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the presence of protein Ag43 enhances adhesion of UPEC within the urinary tract, aggregation and biofilm formation. It is important to underline that all of the virulence factors mentioned above and the ability to form biofilm facilitate and enable UPEC colonization and dissemination in the urinary tract. In conclusion, UPEC harbors an arsenal of virulence factors which promote persistence within the adverse settings of the host urinary tract and finally lead to the development of UTI. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract After the success of the Human Genome Project, which lead to estimating the number of human genes at only about 30–40 thousand, researchers started paying attention to a great number of genes present inside and on the surface of the human body. The gastrointestinal tract alone is a habitat for up to 1000 species of bacteria and other microorganisms. These microorganisms add a pool of 2–4 million additional genes. In 2009, a hypothesis was proposed that changes in microbiota are sensed by neurons localized along the entire bowel length, and communicated to the brain, making up the gut-brain axis. The vagus nerve seems to serve as the main communication path. Besides affecting gastrointestinal tract functions, primary neuropsychological studies show that gut microbiota is linked to HPA activity, and thus with arousal regulation and emotional functions. Research also suggests a link to cognitive functions. For now, mechanisms of those connections remain, for the most part, unknown. History of the research on human microbiota shows a complex nature of human functions and the need for integration of knowledge from, as it may seem, distant branches of science, like microbiology and psychology. While connections between microbiota and host organism remain unrecognized, our knowledge of human biology will be incomplete. 1. Human Genome Project. 2. In search for the missing genes. 3.

    "abstract": "Abstract The MALDI-TOF MS method is a new technique, which is being increasingly used in clinical laboratories for identification of microorganisms. The wide interest in this method has been aroused by its high accuracy, instantaneous identification results, and relatively low cost of analyses. However, the application of this technique for identification of dermatophytes poses difficulties. They are caused by the natural biological complexity of filamentous fungi, very slow growth of cultures, and frequent production of pigments. Furthermore, identification of dermatophytes with this technique is a challenge due to the lack of a clear species definition for some taxa or within certain species complexes. A review of scientific literature indicates that the reliability of identification of dermatophytes based on MALDI-TOF MS is in the range between 13.5 and 100%. This variability is determined by many critical factors associated with routine laboratory procedures, i.e. the type of culture medium, incubation time, protein extraction technique, type of device, or version of the reference spectrum library. Despite these numerous limitations, the MALDI-TOF MS method is part of the significant technical progress in mycological diagnostics and an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive identification of dermatophytes based on morphological traits and DNA sequencing. Nevertheless, before the technique can be implemented into routine diagnostic tests, it is necessary to expand the reference spectra library and develop procedures for direct analysis of dermatological samples. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Lyme disease is a multisystem disease caused by bacteria belonging to the group Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The vector that carries the infection is a tick of the genus Ixodes , that infects subsequent hosts of the spirochete during blood-meal. The varied course of Lyme disease makes it impossible to recognize it on the basis of clinical symptoms. Therefore, the diagnosis of Lyme disease is based mainly on laboratory methods, both direct (detection of the presence of DNA or infectious agent proteins in the biological material collected from the patient) and indirect (mainly serological tests). A commonly recommended approach is serodiagnosis, however, due to the time required for the body to produce specific antibodies, it is not useful in the earliest period of infection. Microbiological diagnostics also can not be used to diagnose Lyme disease in the first weeks of the disease due to its low sensitivity and long waiting time for the result. The solution seems to be molecular diagnostics based on the detection of the spirochete DNA using PCR reaction that is highly specific and sensitive. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on many factors, therefore it is necessary to develop a standardized protocol ensuring reproducibility of results in all laboratories. 1.

Penicillin G bio- synthesis is a compartmentalized process mainly located in sub-apical productive vacuolated non-growing cells of the mycelium. The cellular localization of the pathway of penicillin G biosynthesis is presented, including some putative enzymatic and transport steps of precursors, intermediates, side-products and end-products.

The possibility for using this technology as an alternative therapeutic strategy for controlling microbial biofilms, colonizations and infections has been the subject of intense investigations. Even though, the potential toxicity and disadvantage of using nanoparticles, researchers focused on their high penetrability into bacterial membranes, capabilities to disrupt biofilm formation and the role of chemotaxis in this interaction. Face to this significant debate, we discuss the link between metal resistance, bacterial chemotaxis and the promising use of nanoparticles (NP). P. aeruginosa has emerged as a model organism for biofilm studies, the aim of this review is to provide a concise and comprehensive survey of certain relevant aspects related to the research on nanoparticles and these bacteria.",

Importantly, G. mellonella offers an alternative, low-cost, and ethically acceptable method of assessing pathogens. These insects have a number of advantages, including ease of breeding, a rapid developmental cycle, low maintenance costs, and ease of experimental manipulation. Most importantly, G. mellonella larvae have a complete immune system and a nonspecific immune response similar to that of humans, making them a valuable model for studying pathogen-host interactions. Furthermore, using this model, it is possible to test the efficacy of various chemical compounds or natural substances that show antimicrobial activity. In this literature review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent studies of the use of G. mellonella in virulence analyses and as a platform for testing the efficacy of new drugs.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiology of the selected subspecies of Clavibacter michiganensis and methods of its identification and control Abstract: The genus Clavibacter belongs to the Gram-positive bacterial phytopathogens, which cause serious diseases that lead to heavy economic losses. The genus Clavibacter consists of only one species Clavibacter michiganensis (Cm) which is subdivided into five subspecies according to their host specificity. Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm) causes bacterial wilt and canker of tomato, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Cms) is responsible for ring rot of potato, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. insidiosus (Cmi) causes wilting and stunting in alfalfa, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis (Cmn) induces wilt and blight of maize, and Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. tessellarius (Cmt) causpots in wheat. Bacteria from different subspecies are highly specific for their host plants although another plant species can be infected artificially. Latent infection with no or mild symptoms also occur. The bacteria from subspecies Cmm, Cms, and Cmi are quarantine organisms, under strict quarantine control. The virulence factors typical for Clavibacter are, extracellular cellulase, hpersensitive response inducing proteins, exopolysaccharides, and secreted enzymes such as xylanse, polygalacturonase and serine protease. For Cmm it was shown that the essential pathogenicity determinants are located on plasmid while all the gene functions required for infection, successful colonization, and suppression of plant defenses are carried on the chromosome. In case of Cms it is similar but more detrminats have chromosomal origin. The detection and identification of these Gram-positive pathogens are based on biochemical and physiological characteristics, as well as pathogenicity assays. For immunological tests, diagnostic kits are available for some subspecies, but these kits have experimental limitations because of serological cross-reactivity. Recently several PCR based techniques have been proposed for Cmm and Cms detection and identification.",

Adherence allows microorganisms to survive and temporarily colonize the digestive system, which is necessary to induce beneficial effects on the host. Adhesion is a very complex, multistep process and, although there are many proposed theories, the exact mechanism is still not fully understood.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic relationship between living cells of the roots of higher plants and non-pathogenic fungi which inhabit soil and belong to Glomeromycota (endomycorrhizae) and Basidiomycota , Ascomycota (ectomycorrhizae). Although the phenomenon of mycorrhiza was discovered by a Polish botanist F.D. Kamieński already in 1881, various stages of establishing the symbiotic relationship between the partners are still not fully understood and explained. According to the current knowledge, the roots of host plants release strigolactones, which stimulate germination and branching of spores of arbuscular fungi. As a result, the fungi synthesize molecular signals, i.e. chitooligosaccharides (COs) and lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOS), called MycF factors. Thanks to the development of molecular biology techniques the probable cascade of events during the recognition of fungal MycF factor by the host-plant has been outlined. The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase 1 (HMGR1) and also its product, mevalonic acid (MVA), play an essential role in the biosynthesis of sterols and isoprenoids in a plant cell. The recent studies indicate that these compounds may also play a very important role during establishing of the symbiotic mycorrhizal relationship. It is believed that MVA detects and transmits MycF factor to a cell nucleus of a host-plant triggering numerous necessary mechanisms in the plant cell to activate next steps of the mycorrhizal symbiosis. The discovery of HMGR1 and MVA sheds new light on symbiotic nature of mycorrhiza. This paper is a review of the current knowledge on the signal exchange during symbiotic interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and host plants. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized peptides or proteins exerting anatagonistic activity toward organisms which are closely related to the producer strain. Circular bacteriocins are produced by Gram-positive bacteria, mainly lactic acid bacteria, and to a lesser extent by Bacillus , Clostridium and Staphylococcus genera. These bacteriocins are characterized by the head-to-tail cyclization of their backbone. The circular nature of these peptides makes them resistant to many proteolytic enzymes and provides great thermal and pH stability. Circular bacteriocins are divided into 2 subgroups based on their physicochemical properties and sequence identity. These bacteriocins are synthesized as linear precursors with a leader sequence which is cleaved off during maturation. The mature circular peptides are composed of 58–70 amino acid residues. Biosynthesis of circular bacteriocins requires three stages: cleavage of the leader sequence, circularization and export out of the cell. Circular bacteriocins have broad antimicrobial activity spectrum, including many food spoilage bacteria and pathogens, such as Listeria , Staphylococcus and Clostridum spp. Circular bacteriocins permeabilize the membrane of sensitive bacteria, causing loss of ions and dissipation of the membrane potential, and finally cell death. Enterocin AS-48 was the first identified circular bacteriocin and is best characterized so far. Circular bacteriocins or bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria have great potential in food preservation, and possibly in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Thanks to their properties, circular bacteriocins could be an alternative not only to preservatives and methods used to provide microbial food safety presently, but also to less stable, linear bacteriocins. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing demand for natural gas is primarily due to an increase in the share of gas in electricity production. Replacing coal with natural gas results in a significant decrease in emissions of greenhouse gases and dusts. The presence of microorganisms may be the cause of underground gas storage (UGS) facilities and pipelines deterioration. Microorganisms and their metabolic products contribute to the formation of sudden and unexpected failure causing loss of energy security by: decline in the quality of stored gas or disruption of its transmission. The paper presents a variety of microbiomes of the underground storage facilities and pipelines, showing that not only the sulfate-reducing bacteria are able to grow and develop in these extreme environments. Microorganisms producing CH 4 may change the composition of the gas, and the produced H 2 S and CO 2 are not only gas pollutants, but also generate corrosion of transmission networks. At the same time, the presence of bacteria and archaea in pipelines hinders the correct operation of the network, through the accumulation of biofilm and reduction in the pipe diameter. 1.

This process is critical for the correct folding and structural stability of many secreted and membrane proteins. The rapidly expanding number of sequenced bacterial genomes has revealed the enormous diversity among bacterial Dsb systems. While the Escherichia coli oxidative protein folding has been studied in great details, the mechanism of the Dsb systems functioning in other bacteria are rather poorly understood. Herein, we present the current methodology, both in vivo and in vitro experimental techniques, which allow us to understand the functioning of the Dsb proteins and has broaden our knowledge in the field of biochemistry and microbiology of this posttranslational protein modification. Many bacterial virulence factors are extracytoplasmic Dsb-dependent proteins. Thus, this system plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis and the proteins of the Dsb network represent possible targets for new drugs. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Appropriate decontamination of hospital textiles depends heavily on specifically defined proceedings for handling decontaminated hospital textiles (collection, segregation, packing, transportation) and appropriate disinfection in the laundry process. It is becoming increasingly common to disinfect hospital textiles in a chemical-thermal process. Disinfectants used in this process should be applied according to functional parameters defined in validated and repeatable test methods. Changes in assessing the activity of agents used in chemical-thermal disinfection of hospital textiles refer primarily to the standardization of testing methods for these agents. PN-EN 16616 Standard which regards chemical-thermal disinfection of textiles clearly regulates the rules of assessing the effectiveness of agents used in the disinfection of hospital textiles and defines a possible scope of their biocidal activity (bactericidal, tuberculocidal and fungicidal activity). It is assumed that further assessment of the activity of sporicidal agents will be developed in the future. 1. Introduction. 2.

Spirulina is a valuable source of protein (55n70% d.w.), vitamins, microelements, polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, carotenoids and polysaccharides. It has been demonstrated that ispirulinai (Arthrospira-based dietary supplements) as well as water extracts of Arthrospira activate immune system, mainly by modulation of cytokine levels. C-phycocyanin, one of the major biliproteins of cyanobacteria, is a potent selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, engaged in prostaglandins synthesis, inhibition of histamine release from mast cells and is characterized by high antioxidant properties. Compounds extracted from Arthrospira have inhibitory activity against a wide range of viruses such as HIV-1, HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, influenza type A, measles, and many more. Extracts from cyanobacteria have antimutagenic and anticancer effect and can prevent development and growth of tumor as well as inhibit metastasis or proliferation of cancer cells. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins are components of the adaptive immunity system, protecting against foreign DNA, which are present in many bacteria species. Recent years have brought extensive research on this system however, not all of its biological properties have been discovered so far. It was recently discovered that CRISPR-Cas can regulate the formation of biofilm and is closely associated with the DNA repair system in bacterial cells. It is also likely that some of the spacer sequences are complementary to short sequences in the bacterial genome, which may have an influence on regulation of bacterial genes, e.g. virulence factors. Besides, phages can synthesize anti-CRISPR genes, which could be of use in the future for the purpose of development of an alternative therapy against multi-drug resistant bacterial strains. Here we present an elementary characteristic of CRISPR-Cas system, including the structure and the brief mechanism of action, systematic classification and its importance for medicine and biotechnology issues. We would like to stress the huge potential of CRISPR-Cas by discussing the selected but varied aspects. 1. Introduction. 2. Structure, operation and differences. 3. Bacterial typing. 4.

There are two independent ways of developing resistance to vancomycin, connected with the common use of vancomycin for MRSA treatment and the non-medical use of this antibiotic. Nine phenotypes of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains can be distinguished: VanA, VanB, VanC, VanD, VanE, VanG, VanL, VanM, VanN. These phenotypes differ at the molecular level to a different extent. Current treatments of enterococcal infections usually include drugs such as linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, daptomycin, tigecycline, and chloramphenicol. Data available from Europe and other parts of the world indicate a constant increase in the number of emerging VRE isolates, as well as strains resistant to antibiotics other than vancomycin. 1.

Epidemiological studies show that most cases of campylobacteriosis are the result of the consumption of undercooked, contaminated poultry meat. Although campylobacteriosis is largely a self-limiting disease with low mortality, a specific treatment is required for patients infected with strains resistant to clinically important antibiotics and for patients who develop neurological symptoms or bacteremia in course of infection. Despite intensive efforts to improve an on-farm biosecurity practice over the past decade, about 70% of EU broiler chicken flocks remain Campylobacter -positive at slaughter. Control of spreading the Campylobacter infection in flocks of chickens by biosecurity actions turned out rather ineffective. The most efficient strategy to decrease the number of human Campylobacter infections may be to implement an immunoprophylactic method, namely, the protective vaccination of chickens.

Killer toxins are proteins, usually glycoproteins, that are able to kill strains of susceptible yeasts. Each killer toxin has unique properties that vary depending on the strain of yeast that produces it. These differences concern the location of genes that encode toxins, molecular weight, as well as mechanisms of action. Some strains of killer yeast are characterized by a wide range of antagonistic activity, inhibit the development of a number of yeast strains, as well as molds, and have been studied for many years in terms of their biotechnological potential. Killer yeast and its toxins can find potential application in many fields: in the production of food and beverages, especially during wine fermentation and maturation, in biological control of plant pathogens, in yeast biotyping and as new antifungal agents. 1.

The pathogen, after infection of the host, has to overcome the host’s defensive barrier. For this, bacterial pathogens use virulence-related factors, such as cell and tissue invasion, adhesion to the surface and toxin production. Numerous pathogenic microorganisms combine their virulence pathways with general mechanisms that allow their adaptation to changing environmental conditions. For this purpose, many bacteria use the global mechanisms of reaction to a stress condition, the stringent response.

    "abstract": "Abstract Human Cytomegalovirus (hCMV) or human herpesvirus 5 (HHV5) is one of the most common pathogens. Studies indicate the presence of infection in 60–100% of individuals. The ability to cause asymptomatic, infection and a latency promotes the persistence and spread of the virus. hCMV infection is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment, but in some cases especially in immunocompromised persons (e.g., transplant recipients, patients with hematological malignancies, untreated HIV infected individuals) symptoms can be serious and life-threatening. The paper presents drugs currently used for treatment or prevention of hCMV infection, as well as the prospect of new treatment options. Currently, ganciclovir or valganciclovir are used as the first-line drugs and foscarnet and cidofovir are used alternatively. These drugs usually allow to control hCMV infections, however, there are important limitations. These include the toxicity and the possibility of the development of resistance, including the cross-resistance to all four drugs because they have a common mechanism of action, inhibition of viral DNA polymerase. Therefore, the creation of new drugs, with different mechanisms of action, lower toxicity and better pharmacokinetic parameters is important. Recently, the new drug, letermovir have been registered. Letermovir acts as hCMV DNA terminase inhibitor and due to the different mechanism of action the drug is active against hCMV strains resistant to DNA polymerase inhibitors, and potentially can act synergistically with them. The other drugs that are in the research stage or clinical studies include: brincidofovir, a cidofovir derivative, maribavir, a competitive inhibitor of ATP, cyclopropavir, a guanosine analog and antiviral peptides. 1.

Methanotrophs are a large group of microorganisms, which live in different kinds of environment, but they preferably occupy places with high methane production, such as swamps, peat bogs, rice fields, or widely understood geological deposits. Methanotrophic bacteria are an important object of research for specialists of environmental biotechnology, are increasingly identified in environmental samples. Methanotrophs are Gram-negative microorganisms, they belonging to the group of Proteobacteria and classified as methylotrophs. In their metabolic cycle, they use methane as the main source of coal and energy. PHB is a linear polyester of 3-hydroxybutyric acid, PHB is accumulated in microorganisms during physiological stress, triggered by the deficit of biogenic elements, such as nitrogen or phosphorus and when the concentration of carbon source is high. Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate belongs to a large group of biodegradable polymers known as polyhydroxyalkanoates. PHB has a similar physico-chemical properties as conventional polymers. PHB is environmentally friendly due to the fast biodegradation and production non-toxic waste during degradation.

    "abstract": "Abstract The major aspect of the consequences of antibiotic resistance usually concerns people. The animals are often seen as a source of pathogens or resistance genes implying a potential risk of their transmission to humans and thereby a potential hazard on public health. Despite the fact that transmission of resistant pathogens from animals to humans is possible we must also recognize that the animals for veterinarians are patients, which suffer from different bacterial infections, and require antibiotic treatment. Similarly to human infections, loss of effective therapy causes suffering for the affected animals, negative emotional and social effects on their owners, economic losses, and subsequently contributes to social costs. Infections in humans and animals with Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP), as well as with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria have rapidly emerged worldwide. Most of these bacteria, usually in a high density, inhabit the respective body compartments of animal and human hosts and are in close contact with each other. In such conditions genetic material can be transmitted between different bacteria, often belonging to phylogenetically distant taxons. Staphylococci harbor a wide variety of resistance genes and resistance-mediating mutations. Many of them are located on the same plasmid or SCC mec cassette. MRSP originates from animal reservoirs. It is a major cause of infections in dogs, also posing a zoonotic risk to humans. However, the transmission of this species is limited. The population of MRSP is highly diverse and include several clonal complexes (CCs) usually exhibiting specific antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. Increasing antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative rods is also a grooving issue in veterinary medicine. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a common problem in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter spp. and many others. ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli strains are found both in companion and food-producing animals as well as in food of animal origin. Reports of carbapenemase-producing bacteria in companion animals include E. coli Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. In a single case, the carbapenemase VIM-1 producing strains of Salmonella Infantis and E. coli were recovered from diseased piglet and fattening pigs, respectively. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Two Coronaviruses , HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, causing generally mild respiratory tract infections in humans, were described in the XX c. Pandemic Coronaviruses were first discovered as late as in the XXI c.: SARS-HCoV in 2002 – causing severe respiratory tract infections (SARS) in China; MERS-HCoV in 2012 – circulating mostly on the Arabian Peninsula. The SARS epidemic ended in 2004 resulting in morbidity of &gt; 8000 and &gt; 770 deaths, while the MERS epidemic is still ongoing (&gt; 2000 ill, &gt; 700 deaths) although its intensity decreased. Both viruses are zoonotic and require at least two “host jumps” for the transmission of the infection to humans: for HCoV-SARS – from bat to palm civet and then to human; for HCoV-MERS – from bats to camels and subsequently to humans. Primary mode of transmission is droplet in close contact (&lt; 1 m), but both viruses remain active in aerosol (up to 24 h), so infection can be also spread by air (ventilation). The ability for human-to-human transmission is higher for HCoV-SARS than for HCoV-MERS (8 generations vs. 4, respectively). Moreover, there are differences in genome structure and pathogenic mechanisms: different receptor, cell entry mechanism, different way of host response modulation (e.g. inhibition of IFNβ cascade), etc. Probably, these differences influence the overall manifestation of the disease in humans. Infection caused by HCoV-MERS might manifest itself as ARDS, a mild-mannered and asymptomatic disease. HCoV-SARS infections seem to be associated with severe disease only. In this paper, a comparison of the structure of these viruses, the mechanisms underlying their ability to cross the interspecies barrier and to multiply in the human body, including modulation of IFNβ cascade, as well as routes of infection transmission and symptoms caused, were presented. 1.

In 1994, Polly Matzinger published a theory of danger, a new view in immunology, describing the response of the immune system to danger, caused by trauma and/or presence of pathogens. This theory brings a different view on the current theory, that the IS distinguishes between own (self) and foreign (non-self) structures and reacts only to non-self factors. According to the danger theory, the IS has the ability to verify “safe” and “dangerous” factors, thus explaining immune reactions caused by tissue damage, referred to as “sterile inflammation”, but also occurring during the infection. It is believed that the fundamental elements in danger theory are dangerous molecules-damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), which are released from damaged or dead tissue and cells, but they are also present in physiological conditions and give analogous immune response to this induced by self/ non-self factors. 1.

The dynamics of colonization of the nasal vestibule by Staphylococcus aureus and the development of the prevention strategies against infection are different for various populations. Moreover, the colonization of the nasal vestibule might involve both molecular and epidemiological ctorsfa. Researchers have reported that the identification of methicillin-resistant strains S. aureus (MRSA) with similar molecular characteristics allows to assess the ability of the microorganism to spread and the risk of infection in diabetic patients. Knowledge of these characteristics allows to take precautions in patients exposed to S. aureus . S. aureus is an ethiological factors of many severe diseases both in people with weakened immune system and in healthy individuals. Usually, excess weight and obesity contribute to the incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). However, the colonization by S. aureus is a probable risk factor for infection. Among S. aureus virulence factors, superantigens (SAgs) are essential for pathogenicity. The long-term effect of the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) might be glucose intolerance. This toxin also induces systemic inflammation as a result of the increased exotoxin concentration in blood, and, therefore, may be the causative factor of diabetes. Chronic exposure to staphylococcal superantigens may contribute to the development of diabetes, suggesting a need to conduct targeted therapies against S. aureus superantigens. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nocardia spp. bacteria are Gram-positive aerobes occurring worldwide. They cause nocardiosis, of which the most common forms are pulmonary nocardiosis and cutaneous nocardiosis. The pulmonary form progresses as a result of aspiration of pathogens into the respiratory tract, whereas the cutaneous nocardiosis, can spread to other organs (often to CNS) and includes Madura foot, both mycetoma and systemic. Infections usually affect people with immunodeficiency, for example infected with HIV or after immunosupression therapy. Nocardia asteroides is responsible for the majority of infections in humans. Diagnostic methods include cell culture and PCR. The symptoms vary depending on the form of the illness. Cough and hemoptysis are characteristic for pulmonary nocardiosis, while abscesses are typical for the cutaneous form. When the illness spreads, the symptoms vary depending on the organ. The treatment of choice is sulfonamide. 1. Introduction. 2. History. 3. Characteristics of Nocardia spp. 4. Systematics. 5. Pathogenicity. 6. Diagnostics. 7. Treatment. 8. Summary",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fluoroquinolones(FQ) are broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents widely used to treat a range of infections in clinical medicine. However, the surveillance studies demonstrate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates increased in Enterobacteriaceae in the past years. FQ inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis by interfering with the action of two bacterial enzymes - DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. There are two categories of quinolone resistance mechanisms: chromosomally encoded and acquired. Mutations in chromosomal genes encoding gyrase and topoisomerase IV are the most common mechanisms responsible for high-level fluoroquinolone resistance. Mutations can occur also in regulatory genes which control the expression of native efflux pumps located in bacterial membrane. Furthermore, three mechanisms of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) have been discovered so far, including Qnr proteins, the aminoglycoside acetylotransferase variant - AAC(6’)-Ib-cr, and plasmid-mediated efflux pumps - QepA and OqxAB. Although the PMQR mechanisms alone cause only low-level resistance to fluoroquinolone, they can complement other mechanisms of chromosomal resistance and facilitate the selection of higher-level resistance. Moreover, plasmids with PMQR mechanisms often encode additional resistance traits (ESBLs, pAmpC, KPC) contributing to multidrug resistance (MDR). This review is focused on a range of molecular mechanisms which underlie quinolone resistance. 1. Introduction. 2. Mechanisms of fluoroquinolone action. 3.

The members of the Alicyclobacillus genus are characterized by the presence of ω-alicyclic fatty acids (ω-cyclohexane or ω-cycloheptane), the iso and anteiso branched-chain fatty acids, and the hopanoids as the major membrane lipids. There are 23 known species and 2 subspecies, with Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris as the most significant. Certain species cause food spoilage in the fruit- and-vegetable juices industry. The spores of Alicyclobacillus are highly tolerant to high temperatures and low pH-values of fruit juices. What is more, they are naturally present on fruit surface and can readily enter the production environment of the fruit and vegetable processing. Due to high thermophilicity of these bacteria, the typical juice pasteurization conditions can stimulate spore germination. This is the reason why they can proliferate in juice and ipso facto cause fruit products spoilage. The family of Alicyclobacillaceae has continuously been modified and each successive year brings new species. Additionally, A. acidoterrestris is recognized as bacterium with a high evolution rate due to its rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions. 1. Introduction. 2.

Genus Borrelia is divided into two large groups. The first of these is Borreli aburgdorferi sensulato– the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, first isolated from the Ixodesdammini tick. The second large group of Borrelia spirochetes contains more than 20 species associated with relapsing fever, which are mainly transmitted by soft ticks, with the exception of B. recurrentis transmitted by lice. Comparision of the DNA of different species within this genus showed that the similarity between them is often small, e.g. the DNA homology between B. miyamotoi and B. burgdorferi s.s. or B. garinii is 13%, and B. afzelii only 8%, whereas the B. miyamotoi DNA has a profile similar to the representatives of the tick-borne relapsing fevers, such as B. hermsii (44%), B. turicatae (41%), B. Parkeri (51%). Symptoms of relapsing fevers transmitted by lice and by ticks are very similar. The following symptoms are characteristic for both types of relapsing fevers: high fever with sudden onset, chills, severe headache, muscle and joint pain, drowsiness, photophobia and cough. 1.

Improper lifestyle is considered the primary cause of the disease; however, many other factors contribute to the problem. In recent years, attention has been drawn to the role of gut microbiota in developing and controlling obesity and overweight. Microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract are responsible for the fermentation of certain nutrients, causing efficient digestion, stimulation of intestinal transit, vitamin production, and modulation of the host’s immune system. Numerous studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota composition differs between obese individuals and those with a normal body mass index (BMI). It has also been shown that altering gut microbiota can influence the phenotype of the host organism, promoting metabolic changes, including BMI reduction. Recent studies aimed at using probiotics to modify gut microbiota composition to reduce body weight are still inconclusive.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are examples of yet not entirely understood etiology. They are linked to immune system dysfunction, which becomes immunologically overactive, damaging the body’s tissues and organs. At least three major factors underlie the development of autoimmune disorders: environmental factors, including the oral and intestinal microbiomes, genetic predisposition, and aberrant autoimmune response. The dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, in particular, exerts a significant effect on RA, clinically manifested by damage of the joints. RA is significantly associated with periodontitis, which is caused by an increased abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the subgingival niche, which disturbs the homeostasis of the oral microbial community. P. gingivalis is considered to contribute to the development and progression of RA. Although this bacterium may escape detection by the host immune system, it still induces an immune imbalance. RA and periodontitis also share similar pathological and clinical features. The progression of both chronic periodontitis and RA is linked to the dysregulation of the immune system and the damage caused by the immune response. Previous detailed studies have indicated that a specific enzyme of P. gingivalis , peptidyl-arginine deiminase, which catalyzes the citrullination of proteins, may trigger the autoimmune response resulting in the development of RA.",

However, the cause of miscarriage or preterm labor in some cases remains unclear. Determination of the etiology about these clinical conditions may reduce the rate of reproductive failure. Similarly, the etiology of other obstetric disorders, such as preeclampsia or postpartum hemorrhage, has not been fully explained. One of the postulated and still under-researched causes of these disorders may be dysbiosis within the reproductive tract. A disturbed microbial balance is not always associated with the presence of an acute infection with clear clinical symptoms. Dysbiosis in conjunction with other pathophysiological factors may increase the risk of the mentioned clinical conditions. The aim of this paper is to show the information indicating the existence of a correlation between dysbiosis and an increase in the risk of obstetric disorders. Further analysis is also required to clarify the mechanism of the effect of dysbiosis on the disruption of metabolic and biochemical processes within the reproductive system during pregnancy.",

These bacteria often have high pathogenic and epidemic potential, contributing to infection outbreaks worldwide. K. pneumoniae is part of the natural microbiota of humans. At the same time, as an opportunistic microorganism, when the host organism is weakened, it can cause serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septic infections and intra-organ abscesses. Widespread distribution in nature and exceptional adaptability provide K. pneumoniae with the opportunity to master new niches in the hospital environment, which poses a threat to hospitalized patients. Also, the bacteria are increasingly causing life-threatening infections in the non-hospital environment. The pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae is determined by the presence of many virulence factors such as capsular polysaccharide (CPS, K antigen), lipopolysaccharid (LPS, O antigen), fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesins, siderophores (aero-bactin, enterobactin, salmochelin and yersiniabactin), heat-stabile and heat-labile enterotoxins, cytotoxins and biofilm-forming ability.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cronobacter spp. are considered opportunistic pathogens in all age groups, especially in premature babies, children with low birth weight, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Currently, the genus Cronobacter includes seven species: C. sakazakii, C. malonaticus, C. turicensis, C. muytjesii, C. universalis, C. dublinensis and C. condimenti . The first three species of Cronobacter have been associated with clinical infections of newborns and premature babies. Cronobacter bacterial infections can cause neuritis, encephalomyelitis, the formation of abscesses and cysts of the brain leading to hydrocephalus and necrotizing enterocolitis. Often infected with Cronobacter spp. are rare, the mortality rate is very high, as well as the costs associated with temporarily treating post-infection complications. Cronobacter spp. due to the production of capsule and biofilm, high thermotolerance is resistant to drying and survival loads in milk replacers and other products with water activity. Cronobacter spp. isolated from milk replacers used for the initial feeding of infants, with vegetables, cereals, potatoes, spices, meat, fish, cheese, tofu, rice, pasta, chocolate, tea and abiotic surfaces in a hospital, with medical products and equipment. Under the Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005, Cronobacter spp. should be absent in thirty 10 g samples of infant formulas and infant dietetic powders intended for infants up to 6 months old. The subject of the study is the assessment of the occurrence the hazard caused by Cronobacter in food in the light of applicable requirements. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract The fear of blood transfusion-borne infections has been a problem since the beginning of the blood therapy era. One of the phases of all infectious diseases, including those transmitted by ticks, is the incubation period, during which there are no clinical symptoms due to the presence of microorganisms in the blood. For this reason, blood drawn from an infected donor can be a potential source of infection for the recipient at this time. Literature data show that there are no documented reports of the possibility of transmitting B. burgdorferi infection (Lyme etiological factor) to healthy man by blood transfusion. However, cases of transfusions of such infections as babesiosis, anaplasmosis, rickettsiosis, and fever, bartonellosis have been reported. Tick-borne infections are not included in the criteria for permanent (except tularemia) or temporary disqualification for blood donor candidates and for contraindications for blood sampling. Tests for routine detection of tick-borne pathogens in blood therapy are also not used. Therefore, knowledge of the dynamics of the phases of these diseases, periods of infectivity and occurring in the blood in conjunction with medical history, physical examination and the results of auxiliary diagnostic tests are of fundamental importance for the safety of blood recipients. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The World Health Organizations (WHO) scientific brief on the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and asthma from 2021, states individuals with asthma to be at a higher risk of respiratory infections as recorded in the annual influenza season. However, existing data from the COVID-19 pandemic does not till date establish an association of the disease with asthma. The disease burden of COVID-19 among asthmatic patients has not been very evident. This paucity of information forms the main rationale of our literature review, which is focused on collecting scattered literature around transmission, risks, as well as disease characteristics of COVID-19 among asthmatics world over including Saudi Arabia. Methodology This study report has been generated after detailed literature survey using keywords “asthma”, “coronavirus”, “COVID-19” and SARS-CoV-2 including quality high impact publications on relevant focus area through Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed. Publication between year 2019 and 2021 were selected in specific to ensure the focus of the current literature review does not lose relevance in space of time. Results Our literature review identified elderly to have been reported to have high susceptibility to COVID-19; the risk being exacerbated among those with comorbidities. Further, no specific directives on asthma being one of the risk factors was found to be reported, especially with the current disease management strategy for COVID-19. The severely diseased COVID-19 patients also have been reported to exhibit increase in multiple cytokines, which may increase airway inflammation and exacerbate asthma attacks. However, contrary literature reports indicate an increase in T cells to reduce the disease impact of COVID-19. Conclusion There is paucity in significant evidence as of writing this review article to highlight exclusive negative impact of COVID-19 on asthmatics. Asthma patients however need to be recommended care pertaining to having their controller medication as new data continue to emerge on the clinic-pathological factors of the novel coronavirus.",

    "abstract": "Streszczenie Krztusiec jest zakaźną chorobą, typową dla wieku dziecięcego. Znamiennym objawem jest napadowy, silny i bezproduktywny kaszel, pogarszający się w nocy, który może prowadzić do wymiotów, bezdechu oraz sinicy. Pod względem klinicznym diagnostyka krztuśca jest problematyczna, ponieważ u zaszczepionych dzieci, nastolatków oraz dorosłych objawy mogą być znacznie łagodniejsze i mniej charakterystyczne, a więc trudniejsze do zdiagnozowania. Wprowadzenie szczepionki pełnokomórkowej (DTwP) oraz obowiązku szczepień skutecznie zredukowało liczbę przypadków. W wielu krajach, szczepionki DTwP zawierające pełne komórki bakteryjne, ze względu na swoją reaktogenność, zostały całkowicie lub częściowo, zastąpione szczepionkami bezkomórkowymi (DTaP) zawierającymi kilka wybranych i oczyszczonych białkowych antygenów bakteryjnych. Pomimo powszechności szczepień ochronnych notuje się wzrost zachorowań na krztusiec, nie tylko wśród najbardziej wrażliwej grupy – noworodków, ale również zaszczepionych nastolatków i dorosłych. Główną przyczyną wzrostu zachorowań jest niepełna ochrona oraz słaba skuteczność szczepionki bezkomórkowej w zapobieganiu transmisji Bordetella pertussis , która jest głównym czynnikiem etiologicznym krztuśca. Nowoczesne metody badawcze pozwalają także na identyfikację innych gatunków bakterii z rodzaju Bordetella , tj. B. parapertussis oraz B. holmesii wywołujących parakrztusiec o podobnych objawach. Obecnie stosowane szczepionki nie chronią przed szczepami gatunku B. holmesii , który staje się drugim, pod względem częstości zachorowań, czynnikiem etiologicznym krztuśca. Niedoskonałość dostępnych szczepionek jest przyczyną intensywnych poszukiwań nowych antygenów szczepionkowych i adiuwantów, powtórnego zainteresowania szczepionkami pełnokomórkowymi oraz podejścia hybrydowego przy projektowaniu szczepionki bezkomórkowej opartej o pęcherzyki zewnątrzbłonowe. Największe szanse na wprowadzenie ma szczepionka BPZE1, która jest osłabionym szczepem bakterii B. pertussis i jest przeznaczona do podawania w postaci żywej szczepionki donosowej.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) is a human pathogen, the aetiological agent of gonorrhoea, which is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the world. The structure of N. gonorrhoeae cell wall is typical of Gram-negative bacteria, poses variable antigens porin B (PorB), and opacity-associated proteins (Opa proteins), lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and type IV pili (TFP) playing an essential role in pathogenesis. In addition to adhesins, gonococcus presents other virulence factors such as reducing modifiable protein (Rmp), iron transporters, membrane pumps, and IgA peptidase. The pathogen produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), releases peptidoglycan (PG) fragments and is well adapted to develop infection in diverse niches of the female and male reproductive tracts. The characteristic genotypic trait of N. gonorrhoeae is the state of natural competence, which allows DNA uptake from the environment. The antigenic and phase variability is essential to gonococcal defence against the human immune system. Because of the increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of N. gonorrhoeae and the high incidence rate of gonococcal infections, developing an antigonococcal vaccine has become an urgent need. Vaccine development difficulties are mainly due to the gonococcal ability of immune evasion, the lack of an animal model, and the limited understanding of protective immune response mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sepsis is a leading cause of hospital mortality, closely linked to gut dysfunction and dysbiosis. The gut microbiome’s role in sepsis pathogenesis and progression necessitates a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to elucidate current research trends. Utilizing the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) database, literature was systematically retrieved using the terms: sepsis AND (“gut” OR “gastrointestinal”) AND (“microbiome” OR “microbiota” OR “microflora” OR “bacillus”). After data refinement and duplicate removal, 2485 articles were included for statistical analysis using R software’s bibliometric package, with Excel used to visualize publication trends. Findings demonstrate a progressive annual increase in published studies and citations. The United States and France emerged as primary contributors, exhibiting extensive international collaboration. Among leading institutions, the University of California ranked highest in research output, while Wiersinga WJ from the University of Amsterdam led in publication volume and collaborative networks. Research predominantly focuses on critical care medicine, immunology, and microbiology, with keywords such as sepsis, microbiome, microbiota, and microflora recurring. Current trends indicate a growing focus on the relationship between sepsis and gut microbiome dynamics, with a notable gap in evidence-based clinical applications. The prominence of the United States in the field underscores the need for welldesigned clinical trials and prospective cohort studies to advance therapeutic strategies. Strengthening global collaboration, particularly through increased involvement of Chinese researchers, is crucial for a comprehensive understanding and future advancements in this complex and evolving field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Given the dynamic growth of antibiotic resistance observed over the past few decades, new therapeutic methods for life-threatening infections are crucial. Effective treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms increasingly requires the use of last resort drugs, and new antibiotics generate resistance in less time than it takes to bring them to the therapy. Therefore it is advisable to seek solutions using currently available antibiotics. Effective therapy of infections with multidrug-resistant microorganisms may be enabled by the use of additive and synergistic interactions, resulting from the combination of different groups of antibiotics with the same or different modes of action – including those to which a particular bacterial strain is resistant. This paper describes methods for determining the synergistic and additive effects of antibiotics in vitro , including the CombiANT method under testing. The purpose of this study is to present possible methods for determining the additive and synergistic effects between antibiotics in vitro and to propose appropriate laboratory procedures for their use. This paper reviews the latest literature on methods for determining the antimicrobials interactions. Clinical studies indicate significant benefits of using the phenomenon of antibiotic addition or synergy in clinical practice, not only improving the effectiveness of therapy, but also minimizing side effects and reducing the risk of developing de novo antibiotic resistance. Despite the significant problem of increasing antibiotic resistance level, clinical practice still lacks clearly standardized methods for determining synergism. Further research is needed to determine the most beneficial standard available for a wide range of microbiology diagnostic facilities.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of bacterial translation and growth by antisense peptide nucleic acids and their potential applications in biotechnology Abstract: The broad use of antibiotics has resulted in the survival and spread of resistant bacterial strains. Bacteria can effectively acquire resistance when exposed to antibiotics. Therefore, it is crucial to find new antimicrobial drugs to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Antisense technology involving targeting or modifying gene expression in a sequence-dependent manner has been applied to distinguish bacterial species, design antibacterials or in diagnostic applications. Typically, the bacterial target is either DNA or mRNA but there exist examples of bacterial ribosomal RNA targets. Natural oligonucleotides are unstable so in the antisense applications most often their modified versions are used. Synthetic nucleic acid analogues include locked nucleic acids, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. We will focus on the applications of PNAs, which are neutral DNA analogues containing a pseudo-peptide backbone instead of a charged phosphate one. PNA oligomers are not degraded by proteases and nucleases. Furthermore, PNAs are not recognized by RNases. PNA oligomers can efficiently hybridize with DNA or RNA strands, and form stable duplexes or triplexes. Here, we review the studies on the development of antisense PNA sequences targeting bacterial mRNAs and rRNAs. In addition, the future prospects on the use of PNA in biotechnology are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans normally exists as harmless commensal inhabiting mucosal surfaces of healthy individuals. Yet, this opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised hosts causes superficial or invasive life treating infections with high mortality rate. The incidence of candidiasis appeared to have several predisposing factors such as immunosuppressant or steroids treatments, long-term catheterization, invasive medical procedures, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotic, destruction of skin by deep skin burns, local disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, diabetes mellitus, premature very low birth weight infants, immunologically compromised individuals, spread of HIV infection. This serious problem causes a need for better understanding of C. albicans virulence and antifungal treatment. This review features characterization of chosen virulence factors i.e.: adhesion, pleomorphism and enzymatic activity. Currently natural antifungal substances as well as synthetic derivatives are used at broad scale in candidiasis treatment. Recently, an increase of resistance to antifungal agents commonly used in fungal infection management has been observed. This world-scale problem generated a need for a search for novel antifungals.",

    "abstract": "Fungal infections constitute a vital clinical issue concerning various groups of patients, among them patients with total parenteral nutrition. The most common etiological infection factors, affecting the aforementioned group of patients, are among others yeastlike fungi. In clinical specimens, the predominant genus of yeastlike fungi, as isolated from the patients with total parenteral nutrition, is Candida spp. The species of yeastlike fungi of the Candida genus generate various pathogenic factors enabling invasion process and the progression of the subsequent infection stages. The most crucial of them are: • ability to adhere and ability to form biofilms. This feature, with the mediation of adhesion proteins, enables the fungi to grow on the biomaterial surfaces, to invade the host’s tissue, and conditions survival and existence in the environment; • dimorphism. Creation of two antigenically different forms – yeast and hyphae – conditions specific escape from the immunological system of the macroorganism; • high enzymatic activity. Hydrolytic, proteolytic and lipolytic activity, featuring primarily the adaptative function, is the indicator of the metabolic stimulation required for the infection process, Due to the insignificant pathogenic potential of the Candida genus fungi, associated with the fact of their natural existence on skin and mucous membrane, the research is currently often directed at detection of the factors responsible for the colonisation and development of the fungal infections. These research attempts are aimed at differentiating between both processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern research in food science and nutrition is transferring from classical methodologies to advanced molecular strategies in which next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology plays a crucial role. In this context, Foodomics has been recently defined as a new and global field using advanced “omics” technologies in food analysis. In recent years, “food-omics” technologies are widely applicated in food microbiology to identify, quantify and to track food microbial consortia in the food chain, as well as in the food safety and quality assessment. Metagenomics, referred to as community genomics is a sequence-based analysis of the collective genomes of microorganisms present in a given environment. This rapidly developing technique has provided new knowledge about taxonomic diversity and the dynamics of microbial communities at the genus, species and even strain level. An comprehensive metagenomic approach has proven to be a powerful tool in profiling the microbial ecology of complex ecosystems such as fermented foods. Currently, research focuses on understanding and controlling the fermentation process to ensure the consistent sensory properties of food products, increase safety and reduce food spoilage. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the latest achievements of the “food-omics” technologies applied to biodiversity and functionality of food microflora, food safety and quality control. Furthermore, we discuss current challenges and future applications of “food-omics” technologies in the food industry. 1. Introduction. 2. Methodologies and technologies in the field of food-omics. 3. Application of “food-omics” technology in food analysis. 3.1. Metagenomics as a tool for monitoring the fermentation process. 3.2. Monitoring food storage conditions. 3.3. Food safety monitoring. 4.

The formation of biofilm, its abnormal growth combined with impaired functioning of the defense mechanisms of the body and disorders in the quantitative and qualitative composition of the oral microbiota can lead to the development of caries, gingival inflammation, parodontosis or peri-implantitis. The paper discusses the stages of biofilm formation as well as microbial interactions within this organized community. It also addresses the significance of multispecies biofilm in oral infections and, very importantly, the methods to combat it. 1.

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium with an ability to colonise the gastric pylorus. It is estimated that more than half of the human population may be carriers of this pathogen. Unfortunately, the collected data concerning H. pylori infections is inaccurate as the symptoms occur only in 20% of people infected. The presence of the bacteria may lead to inflammation, stomach ulcers, or even cancer. In the cases of confirmed infection, the treatment usually involves a so called \"triple therapy\" with a proton-pump inhibitor and antibiotics. However, a decrease in the effectiveness of this therapy is observed as a result of increasing antibiotic resistance in bacteria. New solutions are being researched that could both help in the treatment of H. pylori infections and prevent the spread of the pathogen. Numerous scientific studies confirm that the use of plant-based products can be a good addition to the treatment of various infections. Phytotherapy is a science-based medical practice that uses the knowledge about active compounds naturally occurring in plants, in order to improve overall health. From existing research, it is known that the consumption of certain plant-derived products, for example olive oil and green tea, can lead to H. pylori eradication. On the other hand, licorice can be used to support the classic treatment method by increasing the eradication rate of the pathogen. Plants with anti-H. pylori properties include: cinnamon, cranberry, oregano, aloe vera and many others. The aim of this work is to review literature that is focused on a potential use of phytotherapy to support the treatment, combat, or prevent infections caused by H. pylori.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SIBO) is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by an increase in the number and/or presence of atypical bacteria in the small intestine. Aetiology of SIBO is usually complex, associated with disorders of protective antibacterial mechanisms such as achlorhydria, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, immunodeficiency syndromes and anatomical abnormalities such as small intestinal obstruction, diverticula, fistulae, surgical blind loop, previous ileo-caecal resections and motility disorders. Clinical signs of SIBO may be non-specific. Most often there is dyspepsia, diarrhoea, bloating and abdominal discomfort. SIBO can sometimes lead to malebsorption, severe malenutrition and/or other syndromes associated with nutritional deficiency. The gold standard for diagnosing SIBO is still microbial investigation of jejunal aspirates. Non-invasive hydrogen breath tests are most commonly used for diagnosis of SIBO. Therapy for SIBO must be complex. It should include treatment of the underlying disease, nutritional support and cyclical gastro-intestinal selective antibiotics. Prognosis is usually serious, determined mostly by the underlying disease that led to SIBO.",

Niezmiernie istotna w przypadku zakażeń ran oparzeniowych jest diagnostyka mikrobiologiczna. Prawidłowe pobranie materiału klinicznego i wykonanie badań mikrobiologicznych pozwala na ustalenie czynnika etiologicznego zakażenia i dobranie antybiotykoterapii celowanej. Jest to szczególnie istotne w dobie narastania oporności drobnoustrojów na antybiotyki i częstego izolowania szczepów wieloantybiotykoopornych. Oparzenie bowiem, zwłaszcza rozległe, stanowi unikalne środowisko, które – wraz z nieprzemyślaną, bądź niecelowaną terapią – determinuje u drobnoustrojów nabywanie oporności na antybiotyki. Fizjologiczna obrona organizmu przed urazem prowadzi do sytuacji, kiedy w ranie oparzeniowej środki przeciwdrobnoustrojowe mogą nie osiągać MIC/MBC, co drastycznie zmniejsza szanse powodzenia terapeutycznego.",

    "abstract": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) constitute a heterogeneous group of bacteria, which are found in diverse environments, such as the human body or plants, and are traditionally used to produce fermented food. Food bio-transformation in industrial processes increases the economical importance of LAB. However, conditions that exist in industrial facilities do not seem to be an optimal environment for bacteria. During technological processes, which take place in enclosed space, the intensity of physical (temperature shift), chemical (acids) or biological (phages) stress factors raises dramatically. In the dairy industry, bacteriophage contamination is regarded as a serious problem due to the disturbance or arrest of the production processes, which results in significant economical losses. It is well documented that LAB evolved defense systems against bacteriophages, which allow them to survive in harsh conditions. Therefore, bacteria used in food industry are selected for high level of bacteriophage resistance. According to the mode of action, natural bacterial defense systems against their predators were divided into 5 categories: (i) inhibition of phage adsorption, (ii) blocking of phage DNA injection, (iii) phage abortive infection systems, (iv) restriction modification systems, (v) CRISPR/Cas systems. Remarkably, the majority of known bacteriophage resistance systems are plasmid-encoded. In this context, future studies on phage resistance mechanisms as well as plasmid sequencing may have an impact on solving the problem of phage infections in the dairy industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are extracellular structures produced by most gram-negative bacteria, including pathogens of humans and animals. OMVs play an important role in the physiology of microorganisms and are an integral part of many biological processes. Following the discovery that they are able to transport many biomolecules, also these which have the ability to interact with the immune system, their potential use as non-replicating vaccines has become an important aspect of immunotherapeutic researches. These nano-sized elements exhibit remarkable potential for immunomodulation of immune response, thanks to the ability to deliver naturally or artificially incorporated antigens within their structure. First vaccine based on outer membrane vesicles was developed almost 30 years ago against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. This review presents some basic information on biogenesis and functions of OMVs. It also provides examples of pathogens, whose OMVs (in natural or modified form) have been used in the development of immunogenic vaccines against the organisms from which the vesicles had been obtained. OMVs are proving to be more versatile than first conceived and may become important part of biotechnology research, not limited to medical applications. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes are unique in many aspects. They are the etiological agents of Lyme borreliosis, meta-zoonotic, tick-borne disease of mammals, including humans. Ixodes spp. ticks are the vector. With the exception of erythema chronicum migrant (EM), manifestations of the disease may vary depending on the genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. One of the symptoms is Lyme carditis . To date, the causative factors and the mechanisms of pathogenesis have not been well-described. Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes are considered as one of the most invasive mammalian pathogen. They are able to move through the skin, as well as break into and out of blood vessels, easily crossing the blood-brain barrier. Genes encoding various motility forms are bound with chemotaxis signaling system which leads and coordinates motion functions. The attachment of bacteria to host cells or extracellular matrix may promote colonization and disease development. Lyme disease spirochetes encode several surface proteins including decorin binding adhesion (DbpA), which varies among strains contributing to strain-specific differences in tissue tropism. The strains demonstrating the greatest decorin-binding activity promote the greatest colonization of heart and cause the most severe carditis. Moreover, the manifestation of Lyme carditis in certain hosts may be a result of an autoimmunological reaction due to molecular mimicry between B. burgdorferi and host self-components. In mammals, infection with B. burgdorferi induces the development of antibodies which may cross-react with myosin and neural tissue. 1. Introduction. 2.

This therapy is selected following the sensitivity analysis of the proposed drug in all species of bacteria which can cause a similar type of infection and on the basis of the clinical efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Established schemes based on data collected from many centers in the world, including type of antibiotic, dose and duration of his administration, and the stage and form of Lyme disease have been created. Number of in vitro methods of spirochetes susceptibility to antibiotics has been also developed. Unfortunately, the lack of standardization often makes it impossible to compare the results of MIC and MBC. Furthermore, little is known about the interactions of the various antimicrobial substances and spirochetes. There is a need for testing of clinical strains isolated from patients after treatment, which would explain the problems associated with “refractory” cases of Lyme disease.

It is known that lactobacilli have a beneficial effect on our health and are used in the production of fermented milk, yoghurts, cheese, and probiotics. However, in this article I show that lactic acid bacteria also cause many diseases. Lactobacilli produce lactic acid which acidifies the environment. There are some factors increasing the risk of infection caused by lactobacilli, such as neutropenia in immunocompromised patients and certain underlying diseases, especially diabetes. Also, lactobacilli have a natural resistance to some antibiotics, especially vancomycin. The identification of lactobacilli can be very difficult due to the number of species, subspecies and genotypic or phenotypic traits. The most advanced procedures are molecular DNA-based techniques. Conventional biochemical tests can be also used to determine some differences. Lactobacilli infection can affect both a single organ and the whole organism, causing for example lactobacillemia. The main disease caused by lactobacilli is endocarditis. 1. Introduction. 2. Risk factors. 3. Identification. 4. Pathogenicity. 5. Conclusions 1. Wstęp. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Existence of moonlighting proteins in microorganisms is a known phenomenon, yet still not well understood. Moonlighting proteins have at least two independent biological functions, which must be performed by one polypeptide chain without separation into protein domains. Most of these proteins, beside their role in the cytoplasm, play an important role outside of the cell i.e. they take part in the process of pathogenesis by binding and activating host’s plasminogen. The existence of moonlighting proteins complicates the understanding of pathogenicity and virulence of many common bacteria as well as their role in commensal bacteria. Many of moonlighting proteins occurring in commensal bacteria appear to perform similar functions to proteins discovered in pathogenic bacteria, e.g. binding extracellular matrix. Moonlighting proteins found in bacteria are mostly housekeeping enzymes, especially from the glycolytic pathway, such as enolase, aldolase, dehydrogenase as well as heat-shock proteins and transcriptional factors. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to the development of civilization, people’s needs and expectations increase. The global development of civilization, the desire of some countries to expand their borders and achieve a higher political, social and military influence, cause insecurity among the people. Security is one of the main factors for the proper functioning of individuals and whole societies. Currently, a major threat to people is terrorism. Especially dangerous is the use of biological weapons for this purpose, which significantly interferes with a sense of security and restricts the freedom of human activities. Currently, biological terrorism is a global threat associated with the use of weapons for political or religious reasons. The threat from radical religious fundamentalists is particularly dangerous. The most common biological threat agents are microorganisms causing zoonoses, i.e. diseases which can be transmitted from animals to humans. The most dangerous are Bacillus anthracis , Yersinia pestis and Francisella tularensis . They are characterized by high virulence, ease of spread and the possibility to obtain and use them at low cost. The aim of this paper is to characterize, based on the available literature, the most dangerous microorganisms which pose a potential threat to humans as biological warfare.

    "abstract": "Abstract More and more attention has been paid to environmental chlamydiae in recent years. They were classified as pathogenic bacteria for both humans and animals. Thanks to molecular biology techniques, the following nine families of environmental chlamydiae were assigned to the order of Chlamydiales : Candidatus Clavichlamydiaceae, Criblamydiaceae , Parachlamydiaceae , Candidatus Piscichlamy- diaceae, Rhabdochlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae , Waddliaceae, Candidatus Actinochlamydiacae and Candidatus Parilichlamydiaceae. These bacteria are considered the infectious factors of zoonoses due to the fact that they can be found among pets and livestock such as cats, guinea pigs, sheep, cattle, and even fish. Many of these animals also suffer from diseases caused by these bacteria. In this study, while characterizing environmental chlamydiae, special attention has been paid to illnesses of the respiratory tract caused by Simkania negevensis , and to the abortions among people and ruminants caused by Waddlia chondrophila . Furthermore, the species of the Rhabdochlamydiaceae family , as well as the bacteria from the Parachlamydiaceae family responsible for eye illnesses in humans and animals, are also characterized in this work. Lastly, newly discovered fish chlamydiae, which are potential factors of illnesses in humans and terrestial animals, are also presented in this paper. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Coxsackieviruses (CV), as all enteroviruses, are small, non-enveloped, icosahedral-shaped capsid viruses. They belong to the family Picornaviridae . This group was named after the town of Coxsackie in New York State (USA) where was recognized the first human case of coxsackievirus infection in the 40s of the XX century. Coxsackie B (CVB) are distinguished from other enteroviruses by ability to infect many types of tissues and organs. This wide tropism reason that these viruses are etiologic agents of large number of different diseases. CVB cause infection of the heart, pleura, pancreas, lungs and liver, causing myocarditis, pleurodynia, pericarditis, pneumonia and hepatitis. They can invade the central nervous system and induce meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis. They also cause systemic neonatal disease and chronic infections such as type 1 diabetes and chronic myocarditis. This pantropic character of CVB can be determinate by specific virus – receptor interaction, which initiate the infection and viral spread. CVB attach at least two receptor proteins: the coxsackievirus – adenovirus receptor (CAR) and the decay – accelerating factor (DAF). Moreover, other anonymous determinant may play a role in tissue permissiveness and disease severity. This article summarizes the main aspects of Coxsackieviruses B infection: replication, virus-receptor interaction, genetic variability, pathogenesis, epidemiology and diagnostics.",

Studies in humans and animal models show that LPS from P. agglomerans may have beneficial effects in the treatment of certain diseases. A huge challenge today is the prevention and treatment of skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), and hard-to-heal wounds. Reports show that LPS from P. agglomerans may be useful in the treatment of skin diseases through its effects on the immune response.

It constitutes an important etiological factor of many diseases, for instance, soft tissue and skin infections (including skin boils and abscesses), as well as life-threatening necrotizing pneumonia or toxic shock syndrome. It is estimated that about 25–30% of people are carriers of S. aureus mainly in the anterior nostrils. A smaller percentage of people are carriers of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In accordance with its definition, methicillin-resistant S. aureus is resistant to almost all β-lactam antibiotics. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the presence of penicillin-binding protein in the cell wall – PBP2a, which is the product of the mecA gene, which is part of the complex called SCCmec (staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec ). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) results in endemic in hospitals around the world and are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in society. Infections initiated by hospital strains of MRSA (health care-associated MRSA, HA-MRSA) concern mainly immunocompromised patients after surgery. In addition, there are populations of acommunity-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains and populations of livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) strains. The treatment of infections with MRSA etiology, after exhausting the possibilities of standard antibiotic therapy with the use of i.e. vancomycin, is based on treatment with new-generation antibiotics, such as dalbavacin.",

Coronavirus, HIV and Herpes viruses are causing mortality all around the world. To control the spread of disease, early detection and treatment is required. CRISPR system due to its high efficiency provides a platform to restrict the viral entry into host cell, viral genome editing and eliminate the latent infections. In this review, the CRISPR strategies against three major viral diseases are put under consideration: Coronavirus, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome and Herpesvirus associated diseases. Three CRISPR/Cas systems have been discussed including CRISPR/Cas12, CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas13 that are used against the above listed viruses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microorganisms are ubiquitous and have far-reaching effects on human life. Since their discovery in the 19th century, microorganisms have fascinated biologists. Microbes play a crucial role in the material and elemental cycles of the natural world. Growing own microbes for research purposes requires a significant time and financial investment. On the other hand, high-throughput sequencing technology cannot advance at the same clip as the culture method. The area of microbiology has made substantial use of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle this problem. Classification and prediction have emerged as key avenues for advancing microbial community research in computational biology. This research compares the advantages and disadvantages of using different algorithmic approaches in four subfields of microbiology (pathogen and epidemiology; microbial ecology; drug development; microbiome and taxonomy).",

    "abstract": "Streszczenie Ziarenkowce z rodzaju Enterococcus spp. są składnikiem mikrobioty ludzi i zwierząt oraz powszechnie występują w środowisku naturalnym. Należą do patogenów warunkowo chorobotwórczych, mogących wywoływać zakażenia o różnej lokalizacji. Bakterie te rzadko wywołują zakażenia pozaszpitalne. Mimo, że do niedawna były uważane za drobnoustroje o niskim potencjale chorobotwórczym, stały się jednym z istotnych patogenów szpitalnych. Ich powszechne występowanie i zdolność do przeżycia w środowisku szpitalnym przyczyniają się do notowanej od kilku lat i nadal wzrastającej częstości ich izolacji, również z zakażeń inwazyjnych. Gatunki najczęściej izolowane z przypadków zakażeń to E. faecalis i E. faecium , stwarzające problemy terapeutyczne w związku z ich narastającą wielolekoopornością. Z powodu rosnącego znaczenia klinicznego, mechanizmów naturalnej i nabytej oporności na antybiotyki oraz potencjalnych czynników wirulencji, ziarenkowce z rodzaju Enterococcus stały się przedmiotem wielu badań. Celem pracy jest przedstawienie aktualnej wiedzy dotyczącej najistotniejszych czynników wirulencji mogących występować u bakterii z rodzaju Enterococcus , do których należą – antygen wydzielniczy SagA, białko EfaA, białko powierzchniowe Esp, białko wiążące kolagen Ace, cytolizyna, hialuronidaza, hemaglutynina, lipaza, proteaza serynowa, substancja agregująca, zewnątrzkomórkowe nadtlenki oraz żelatynaza.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Iron is one of the most important micronutrients used by bacteria, essential for their basic metabolism. Over 70% of bioavailable iron in mammals is in the heme molecule. Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria during colonization and infection of the host organism use heme as the main source of iron. Bacteria have developed two types of outer membrane receptors/transporters involved in the heme uptake. The first one focuses on the receptors recognizing heme or hemoproteins and transporting the ligand through the outer membrane. The second type of receptor recognizes and takes up heme in a complex with a hemophore, a small protein released from a bacterial cell. Microorganisms have developed appropriate transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that control the iron/ heme uptake, protecting against their toxic excess. One of the most important regulatory systems is based on the functioning of the Fur protein, a repressor of gene transcription. More and more is known about the role of non-coding RNAs in post-transcriptional regulation of Fur regulon gene expression. 1. Introduction. 2. Hem and heme compounds in the host organism. 3.

Lyssaviruses are spread mainly through direct contact with the carrier that contains the viral reservoir. The gold standard in diagnostics is the method of direct immunofluorescence, through which viral antigens are detected – mainly in the saliva of a patient.

They are characterized by a single-positive-strand genomic RNA and as others RNA viruses have a great potential for genetic variation, the rapid evolution and adaptation. Genus Parechovirus has been established in the 90s and currently, 19 types of human parechoviruses (HPeV) are discovered. They usually cause mild respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, mainly in young children, but also can cause severe diseases such as encephalitis, meningitis, myocarditis, acute flaccid paralysis and sepsis. Severe HPeV infections in infants are also associated with a risk of long-term complications. Although it is known that HPeV plays a significant role in severe pediatric diseases, routine diagnostics are not performed in clinical practice. No antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of HPeV infections, and only symptomatic treatment is available. Increased detection of human parechovirus infection in infants and connection of serious clinical complication with parechovirus infection was the reason why surveillance was established in some countries, while the worldwide extensive surveillance needs to be performed in order to monitor prevalence, genetic diversity, and clinical significance of HPeV. Although the first HPeV strains were discovered 6 decades ago, recognition of HPeV biology, epidemiology, evolution and pathogenicity still requires more research to appreciate the risk for public health that these small viruses can be. 1.

Extremoviruses have genetic material mainly in the form of dsDNA, both circular and linear, whose average length varies between 14 and 80kbp and is optimal because it is not degraded by high or low temperature, salt solutions or elevated pressure, and encodes all features necessary to function in extreme conditions. This also confirms the much higher resistance of DNA to external factors compared to delicate RNA. Further studies on extremophilic viruses can lead to full sequencing of their genomes, recognition of genes determining resistance traits to unfavorable environmental conditions, and a closer understanding of the full history of the evolution of organisms on Earth. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infections are a major epidemiological problem in humans and farm animals. So far, a number of human and animal RV strains have been identified. Based on the antigenic properties of the VP6 capsid protein, they have been classified into eight serogroups (A-H). The most important of them are viruses from group A (RVA), which are responsible for more than 90% of cases of rotaviral diarrhoea. The segmented structure of the virus genome and the presence of animals in human neighbourhood favour genetic reassortment between RV strains originating from different hosts. This could result in an emergence of zoonotic virus strains. The increasing number of human infections caused by virus strains having genotypes which have only been identified in animals indicates the need for epidemiological surveillance of infections. Additionally, the identification of epidemic virus strains in the outbreaks of disease in humans should be conducted. The identification of RVA strains circulating in humans and animals will allow the assessment of the impact of vaccination on the selection and emergence of zoonotic RVA strains. 1. Introduction. 2.

This protein was first discovered as a host factor necessary for Qβ bacteriophage development. Following the discovery, the Hfq role in bacteriophage development was not investigated in depth. In subsequent years, however, many studies revealed various riboregulatory functions of this protein, mainly focused on facilitating sRNA and mRNA pairing, regulating both the degradation and stability of many transcripts. The Hfq protein has the ability to bind to nucleic acids – it binds more efficiently to RNA, but can also attach to DNA. It has been also proved that Hfq is involved in the nucleoid organization. These observations open room for discussion on the potential role of Hfq in the regulation of DNA replication. Since Hfq protein affects many cellular processes, the deletion of the gene encoding this protein has a pleiotropic effect on the cell. 1. Introduction. 2.

They both develop latent infections in B lymphocytes. Infection with these viruses in immunocompetent patients is usually mild and self-limiting, but it can have more severe course in immunocompromised individuals. Failure of the immune system often leads to oncogenesis related to gammaherpetic infection. Thus, immunocompromised patients are far more likely to develop proliferative diseases caused by EBV or HHV-8. This problem also applies to HIV-positive individuals coinfected with EBV or HHV-8. Gammaherpesviruses can also be the cause of post-transplantation issues in patients on immunosuppressive drugs and EBV is known to induce severe clinical syndromes in people with specific genetic disorders.

Despite global vaccination programs, this disease remains endemic in many countries and is still recognized as a significant public health problem. It is estimated that in 2014, around 24 million people worldwide contracted pertussis, of whom 160,700 children under the age of 5 died. Two types of pertussis vaccines are available: suspensions based on whole, killed, B. pertussis cells and acellular pertussis vaccines containing highly purified bacterial antigens. Due to concerns of potential neurological side effects of the whole-cell vaccines, less reactogenic acellular vaccines are now more commonly used. In recent years, many developed countries have reported a resurgence of pertussis disease despite of the high vaccine coverage. Several causes have been suggested for the re-emergence of pertussis including waning immunity and bacterial adaptation resulting from the selection pressure of the used vaccinations. 1.

The SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses, nevertheless, differences were observed. Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by cleavage of spike protein by furin. The receptor-binding motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein forms a larger binding interface and more contacts with host receptor ACE2 compared those of in SARS-CoV. Unlike other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a motif, known to bind integrins. Nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 display some structural differences compared to those of SARS-CoV as well. These features may increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate the putative targets for specific antiviral therapy. 1. Taxonomy of Coronaviridae . 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract S. cerevisiae var. boulardii yeasts, historically recognized as a separate species, are now considered a subspecies of S. cerevisiae. Strains of S. cerevisiae var. boulardii are widely used for prevention and treatment of disorders of human digestive system. The use of preparations based on S. cerevisiae var. boulardii impacts the functioning of the intestinal barrier, which leads to a change in the composition of the digestive tract microbiota and alleviates intestinal epithelial defects. Despite the clinically confirmed probiotic properties of these unicellular microorganisms, the number of reports of infections in humans has been increasing. Population studies suggest that S. cerevisiae yeasts are responsible for 0.1–3.6% of all cases of mycoses in patients receiving therapy with probiotics containing S. cerevisiae var. boulardii . The presence of a central venous catheter, parenteral nutrition, immunosuppression and co-morbidities in patients are considered as factors predisposing for infection. This work summarizes the most important information on biology of S. cerevisiae var. boulardii and presents the latest epidemiological data on fungemia caused by these fungi. 1. Introduction. 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract During pregnancy many agents can be teratogenic i.e. can be dangerous for embryo or fetus and cause differentiated adverse effects. Teratogenic agents include substances (e.g. many pharmaceuticals, mycotoxins – e.g. aflatoxins and ochratoxin A), radiation (e.g. X/RTG, γ) and infectious agents. The latter include bacteria (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes, Treponema pallidum ), protozoa (e.g. Toxoplasma gondii ) and viruses (e.g. ZIKV, parvovirus B19, herpesviruses: CMV, HSV, VZV). Quite a few pathogens can be vertically transmitted, i.e. through placenta (poorly understood mechanism), but not all are typical teratogenic agents (TORCH group). Infection during gestation can be oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic for the mother, nevertheless can also be fatal for the child, causing among others IUGR, SNHL, malformation (e.g. microcephaly, limb defects), abortion. Some (but not all) of these abnormalities can be non-invasively diagnosed by ultrasonography (USG) and prevented by vaccination (in case of the rubella and varicella). In some countries routine serological diagnostics for selected pathogens are performed during pregnancy. Generally transplacental transmission occur mostly during initial (primary) infection and are most dangerous during the first and second trimester (intensive morphogenesis and organogenesis). Conversely chance of fetus infection usually increases with time and is highest in the third trimester. 1. Introduction. 2. Placenta. 3. Preterm delivery and vaginosis. 4. TORCH group. 5.

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-component signal transduction systems composed of histidine sensor kinase and response regulator are involved in adaptive response of pathogenic bacteria to environmental signals by regulating gene expression involved in many physiological processes, bacterial virulence, and antibiotic resistance (antibacterial compounds). Antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria is one of the most important public health problems worldwide. The paper describes a signal transduction mechanism based on phosphotransfer, functioning in two-component systems and the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance governed by these systems. Several signal transduction pathways associated with resistance to antibacterial compounds and functioning in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Aeromonas, Salmonella and Yersinia spp. have been characterized (PhoP-PhoQ, PmrA-PmrB, ParR-ParS, CzcR-CzcS, CopR-CopS, PprB-PprA, CbrB-CbrA, BlrA-BlrB and OmpR-EnvZ systems). Their role in modifying the bacterial cell surface, limiting the inflow or increasing the drug efflux from the cell, producing antibiotic-degrading enzymes or the biofilm formation is presented. 1. Introduction. 2. Mechanism of action of two-component regulatory systems. 2.1. Histidine sensor kinases. 2.2. Response regulators. 2.3. Signal transduction in two-component systems. 3. Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance controlled by two-component signal transduction systems. 3.1. Cell surface modification. 3.2. Regulation of drug inflow and outflow. 3.3. Regulation of the level of enzymes modifying/inactivating antibiotics. 3.4. Other alternative forms of resistance. 4. Characteristics of two-component signal transduction systems modulating resistance to antibacterial compounds in selected Gram-negative bacteria. 4.1. PhoP-PhoQ and PmrA-PmrB systems. 4.2.

Podsumowanie Genomics — new perspective for understanding bacterial pathogenicity. Abstract: The powerful combination of the gene cloning methods with the rapid progress in the sequencing techniques followed by the combination of genomics and bioinformatics provided fresh insight into physiology and pathogenicity of many important agent of human diseases. Analysis of the complete genome sequence allows to classified annotated ORF, potentially encoded the proteins, into three broad categories: those, whose putative function can be assigned, those haying an orthologues of undefined functions and orphan genes confided to the analyzed pathogen. The complete sequencing of a number of microbial genomes is providing an opportunity to study global gene expressions and protein — protein interactions by DNA microarray technology. Genome-wide approaches will advance our knowledge and understanding how a whole cell function and how it responds to its environment. The availability of the complete genome sequences of closely related bacterial species as well as pairs of isolates from the same species resulted in comparative analysis to select small set of genes that may be of relevance of specific physiology and life style of the pathogen. Finally, rapid genomes and bioinformatics progress allow better understanding of the speciation and evolution of bacterial genomes.",

Tryptophanase isolated from several bacterial species allows to use tryptophan as the only carbon and nitrogen source. The enzyme is well characterized and its important amino acid residues are known. The expression of tryptophanase structural gene, tnaA, is controlled on the transciption level and includes variety of strategies operating at the initiation, elongation and termination steps. The precise mechanism of transcription termiantion (attenuation) and the inducing role of tryptophan are described in details. Examples of control mechanisms other than transcription regulation are briefly mentioned.",

Analiza małej ilości krwi może być bogatym źródłem informacji o stanie zdrowia pacjenta chorującego na nowotwór. Płynna biopsja może być alternatywą do biopsji z guza, ale przedstawia szczególną wartość w przypadkach niedostępności materiału tkankowego oraz możliwości wielokrotnego jej powtarzania. Frakcja cfDNA pochodząca z guza nazywana jest w onkologii ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA). Przykładem ctDNA mogą być sekwencje genomu wirusa brodawczaka ludzkiego (HPV, Human Papillomavirus ), który jest czynnikiem etiologicznym niektórych raków regionu głowy i szyi (RRGiSz), a w szczególności gardła środkowego (RGŚ). Najczęstszym genotypem występującym w RGŚ jest HPV16. Bezinwazyjne i częste oznaczanie DNA HPV16 we krwi (ctHPV16, circulating tumor HPV type 16) daje możliwość monitorowania przebiegu choroby w trakcie leczenia i po jego zakończeniu. Bardzo dobrymi narzędziami do detekcji DNA HPV są techniki bazujące na reakcji łańcuchowej polimerazy (PCR), do których należy ilościowy PCR w czasie rzeczywistym (qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction) i cyfrowy emulsyjny PCR (ddPCR, digital droplet PCR). Użycie tych technik do oznaczania DNA wirusa daje wysoką specyficzność i czułość badania. Wykrywanie ctHPV16 po zakończonym leczeniu może być pomocne w rozpoznaniu choroby resztkowej, którą trudno ocenić w obrazowaniu radiologicznym. Biomarker jakim jest ctHPV16 można z powodzeniem zastosować do diagnostyki efektów leczenia chorych na RGŚ, który w przyszłości może być pomocny w podejmowaniu decyzji terapeutycznych.",

Retrospektywne badania występowania epidemii chorób wodopochodnych wykazały, że opieranie się jedynie na założeniach związanych z brakiem lub obecnością bakterii Escherichia coli , może nie być wystarczające do oceny bezpieczeństwa wody przeznaczonej do spożycia przez ludzi. Colifagi w porównaniu ze wskaźnikami bakteryjnymi, wykazują większą odporność na dezynfekcję i utrzymywanie się w znacznych odległościach od źródła zanieczyszczenia. Ich zastosowanie w celu wzmocnienia kontroli i bezpieczeństwa wody do picia zostało zarekomendowane przez ekspertów WHO i wprowadzone w dyrektywie (UE) 2020/2184. Colifagi somatyczne są nowym wskaźnikiem jakości mikrobiologicznej wody, w tym występowania wirusów jelitowych i mogą służyć do weryfikacji procesów uzdatniania wody i oceny ich skuteczności w usuwaniu chorobotwórczych wirusów.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Anaerobic bacteraemia is not frequent (1.2–13.7%), but is associated with a high mortality rate of 16–27%. Anaerobic infections including bacteraemia nearly always arise from contamination by endogenous bacteria into contiguous or other sites like gastrointestinal tracts, genito-urinary tracts, abscesses etc. Factors leading to anaerobic bacteraemia are mainly surgical procedures, crush injuries, the presence of foreign bodies, tissue necrosis, tumours, diabetes. The most common infectious anaerobic agents are Gram-negative bacilli belonging to the Bacteroides / Parabacteroides , which under normal conditions constitute the natural human microflora. An important factor in the virulency of B. fragilis is the ability to form abscesses; a limited infection may progress to bacteraemia and then systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis. Anaerobic bacteraemia mainly affects adults, with elderly patients over 65 years with underlying diseases. The importance of anaerobic bacteria in neonatal bacteraemia and sepsis is a relatively new phenomenon. In contrast the prevalence of anaerobes in bloodstream infections in children is extremely rare with children between 2 and 6 years of age having the least risk ranging 0–0.5% overall. The incidence of recovery of anaerobes in neonatal bacteraemia varies between 1.8% and 12.5%. The majority of cases reported in the literature were due to Bacteroides spp. (41%) other cultured anaerobes belonged to Clostridium spp. (32%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (20%). Blood cultures remain the gold standard for detection of the etiologic both anaerobes and aerobes agent of bloodstream infection. In recent years significant progress has been made in the methods used in the diagnosis of anaerobes, which significantly reduced the time and cost of the examination. Currently, the mass spectometry MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA sequencing are increasingly used for anaerobic bacteria identification. In 2022, EUCAST published standardized disk diffusion method for the drug susceptibility testing of Bacteroides spp. and other 4 clinically significant anaerobes. Determining the sensitivity of anaerobes to antibiotics is important due to the increasing drug resistance in this group. Number of B. fragilis strains resistant to clindamycin and moxifloxacin is increasing. According to the published studies sensitivity to clindamycin and moxifloxacin is significantly rare and occurs in 64% and 68% of isolates and in 50.8% and 58.2% respectively. Carbapenems and metronidazole continue to be the most effective active antibiotics to be used in the empirical therapy of anaerobic bacteraemia. There are case reports of infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides spp, meaning resistant to at least three antibiotics from different groups. Rapid microbial diagnosis, targeted therapy and surgical treatment of a possible source of infection are crucial in treatment of sepsis caused by anaerobic bacteria.",

Zaburzenia w równowadze mikrobioty mogą być regulowane poprzez dostarczanie do organizmu probiotyków. Niestety, ich podawanie wiąże się z pewnymi ograniczeniami. Probiotyki są głównie wykorzystywane w profilaktyce wielu schorzeń, a w terapii wykazują jedynie działanie wspomagające. Ponadto probiotyki w czasie obróbki technologicznej oraz w czasie przechodzenia przez przewód pokarmowy mogą tracić swoją biologiczną aktywność. Ograniczenia te mogą zostać pokonane dzięki wprowadzeniu modyfikacji genetycznych do komórek bakteryjnych. Aktualne badania wykazują, że takie modyfikacje mogą zmienić właściwości biologiczne bakterii i znacznie rozszerzyć zakres ich wykorzystania w medycynie o właściwości diagnostyczne i terapeutyczne.",

Recently, considerable progress has been made in the finding of new drugs and suitable therapy for anthrax. Very promising research considers the use of antimicrobials against selected bacteria species, including antibiotic-resistant strains. However, alternative therapeutic options should also be considered, among them vaccines. Bacillus anthracis spores are still the most dangerous weapon amongst pathogens which can be used in a bioterror attack. In this case, research for new anti-anthrax preparations is of primary importance for the protection of humans and animals. The overview of the most recent data shows the many new and promising possibilities for effective strategies in the development of vaccines and anti-anthrax preparations. The most effective of them should be available in the National Stockpile in the event of a biological crisis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nitrosative stress is an adverse physiological condition mediated by an excessive level of reactive nitrogen species (RNS). RNS react with the different macromolecules in vivo and result in the inactivation of these molecules. But the mechanism to counteract the effect of nitrosative stress is poorly understood. Escherichia coli is one of the best understood and well-studied microorganism. Although several studies have been reported on Escherichia coli to characterize the effect of various stress response but fewer works are there to see the effect of nitrosative stress. Escherichia coli encounter numerous stresses during its growth, survival, and infection. They respond to various stress conditions by activating common regulator proteins and thiols. These stress conditions result in the accumulation of these regulator proteins and thiols that allow cells to adjust to specific stress situations, conferring stress tolerance and survival. In this review, different enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms to counteract the effect of nitrosative stress in Escherichia coli have been discussed and a hypothesis for the working mechanism of hybrid cluster protein that helps to combat nitrosative stress has been proposed. Here, we have tried to give a clear scenario about the mode of action of stress-responsive elements present in Escherichia coli .",

    "abstract": "Abstract This year we are celebrating the 200th anniversary of the birth of Louis Pasteur, one of the fathers of microbiology. Interestingly, the time when Pasteur disproved the doctrine of „spontaneous generation” and announced the “germ theory of disease” coincides with the discovery of Cryptococcus neoformans and its role in cryptococcosis. Today, only in the realm of guesswork can remain the correct answer to the question „whether the observed parallelism of these events was accidental?” or „whether Pasteur’s discoveries constituted a solid foundation of the research on the etiological factors of cryptococcosis?”. Until recently, it might seem that all major virulence factors of pathogenic fungi of the Cryptococcus species complex have been thoroughly described. Meanwhile, the simultaneous publication in 2018 of three in vitro protocols for the induction of Titan cells, also known as giant cells, opened up new possibilities for research on the relatively uncharacterized virulence factor that is crucial for Cryptococcus spp. Research on the titanization process makes us realize how little we know about the virulence factors of these fungi, and how much more can be improved in the context of the treatment and prevention of cryptococcosis. The following review is not only a historical outline of research on Cryptococcus spp. and cryptococcosis, but also synthetically describes the virulence factors of these basidiomycetous yeasts, with particular emphasis on the titanization process. The phenomenon of titanization as a process of a specific morphological transformation, like Titan cells, are completely new terms in Polish literature, which will be introduced to readers here. We live in a post-antibiotic era where the lack of effective and non-toxic drugs affects patients all over the world. Specifically, the availability of only fluconazole, amphotericin B and flucytosine in therapy of cryptococcosis constitutes a significant limitation. For this reason, research on the virulence factors of Cryptococcus spp. will allow to find new effective antimycotics, including inhibitors of the titanization process.",

Przewód pokarmowy człowieka podzielony na jamę ustną, gardło, przełyk, żołądek, jelito cienkie i grube, zasiedlany wyżej wymienionymi drobnoustrojami, tworzy swoisty jakościowo-ilościowy, bogaty i zróżnicowany swoisty ekosystem. Dzięki stosowaniu metod bioinformatycznych, molekularnych oraz dzięki sekwencjonowaniu metagenomowemu jest on nadal poznawany, a dzięki tym metodom możliwe jest jego lepsze poznanie. W niniejszej pracy scharakteryzowano grupy systematyczne bakterii, archeonów, wirusów i grzybów występujące w poszczególnych odcinkach przewodu pokarmowego i wskazano także na enterotypy jelita grubego. Analizując wymienione grupy mikroorganizmów w poszczególnych odcinkach przewodu pokarmowego człowieka, należy zauważyć, że odcinek jelita grubego i jamy ustnej jest „wyposażony” w najbardziej bogaty mikrobiom, natomiast gardło i przełyk posiada najmniejszą liczbę drobnoustrojów wchodzących w skład mikrobiomu. Wśród całości mikrobiomu przewodu pokarmowego człowieka najliczniejszą grupę stanowią bakterie usytuowane w jamie ustnej i jelicie cienkim, zaś najbardziej ograniczoną grupę bakterii rejestruje się w gardle i przełyku.

Jego charakter i pewne działania są przedmiotem krytyki lub co najmniej kontrowersji. Zawarty w niniejszym artykule przegląd dokonań francuskiego uczonego, przygotowany z okazji dwusetnej rocznicy jego urodzin, pokazuje, że, mimo formułowanychz różnych stron zarzutów, Pasteur w pełni zasługuje na miano „dobroczyńcy ludzkości”.",

    "abstract": "Kilkanaście ostatnich lat jest okresem rozbudzonego zainteresowania etyką, ale tylko w odniesieniu do szczegolnej sfery dzialalności czlowieka — biologii, oraz, w pewnym zakresie — medycyny. Pojawila sie nowa galąź etyki „branzowej” — bioetyka. Nestor biochemii światowej, Erwin Chargaff sceptycznie patrzy na to zjawisko pisząc o etyce, ze „do niedawna nikt nie oczekiwal stosowania etyki w kontekście dyscyplin nauk podstawowych. Etyka chemii lub geologii wydawala sie nie miec wiekszego sensu niz etyka szachow lub gry na skrzypcach” [1]. Mozna wiec sie zastanowic dlaczego wlaśnie ta dziedzina badan wywolala taki przyplyw wrazliwości etycznej. Czy oznacza to, ze dotychczasowa formacja kulturowa spoleczenstwa zawierala ustabilizowany, spojny system etyczny, ktory przestal sobie dawac rade z nowymi sytuacjami stwarzanymi przez nauki biomedyczne, czy przeciwnie, wrazliwośc etyczna byla na bardzo niskim poziomie i dopiero wstrząs wywolany przez te nauki zbudzil ją z letargu? E. Chargaff zauwaza dalej, ze era nauki „jako niekonczącego sie poszukiwania prawdy o naturze, poszukiwania, ktore mialo pomoc nam zrozumiec funkcjonowanie świata, skonczyla sie. Zaczela sie nowa era; nauka jest teraz rzemioslem, sztuką manipulowania, modyfikowania i ukierunkowywania sil natury”. Sformulowania te szczegolnie odnoszą sie do biologii i jej medycznych zastosowan. Przyznac trzeba, ze w biologii w ciągu ostatnich kilkudziesieciu lat dokonala sie rewolucja, zwlaszcza w genetyce, i mozliwościach jej zastosowania w hodowli i medycynie. Rewolucja ta dala mozliwości niezwykle glebokiej ingerencji w wyposazenie genetyczne organizmow, szczegolnie w polączeniu z nowoczesnymi technikami embriologicznymi. Symbolizują ją takie pojecia jak inzynieria genetyczna czy klonowanie. Wlaśnie ze wzgledu na lawinowy postep w tej dziedzinie, zdaniem wielu autorow warto przemyślec mozliwe konsekwencje etyczne planowanych przedsiewziec zanim okaze sie, ze na refleksje etyczną jest za poźno. M. J. Reiss i R. Straughan [2] zwracają uwage, ze pojawiają sie twierdzenia, iz postep wiedzy juz w tej chwili przekroczyl nasze zdolności oceny moralnej. Czy rzeczywiście wlaśnie przed biologami stają dziś jakieś szczegolne problemy moralne, a jeśli tak, czy są to nowe warianty starych problemow, czy pojawia sie tu nowa jakośc? Byc moze jest tak i tak. Inzynieria genetyczna pozwala izolowac pojedyncze geny i wprowadzac je do organizmu tego samego lub innego gatunku, a nawet przedstawiciela znacznie odleglejszych jednostek taksonomicznych. Jest to nowa jakośc. W tym przypadku mowimy o organizmach trasngenicznych. Mozliwe jest tez modyfikowanie, unieczynnianie lub wymienianie poszczegolnych genow. Oczywiście, najwiecej tego typu prac prowadzi sie na mikroorganizmach, ktore najbardziej sie do tego nadają. Dziś zmodyfikowane genetycznie mikroorganizmy sluzą do wytwarzania wielu cennych związkow potrzebnych w lecznictwie, np. ludzkich hormonow, a zasieg mozliwości stale sie zwieksza. Istnieje tu niebezpieczenstwo, przynajmniej teoretycznie, pojawienia sie genetycznie zmodyfikowanych szczepow, ktore moglyby stanowic zagrozenie dla czlowieka lub środowiska. Dlatego tez trzeba uwazac zeby szczepy te nie wymknely sie spod kontroli. Warto przypomniec, ze sami biologowie, jeszcze przed rozwinieciem bioetyki, oglosili w 1975 roku w Asilomar moratorium na pewnego typu eksperymenty, aby miec czas na rozeznanie, co do ewentualnych niebezpieczenstw z nich plynących. W zasadzie jednak chodzilo o przestrzeganie, moze bardziej rygorystycznie, dawno przyjetych zasad postepowania w pracy z chorobotworczymi mikroorganizmami i wirusami. Podobnie ma sie sprawa z genetyczną modyfikacją roślin. Jeśli do rośliny uprawnej wprowadza sie gen uodparniający ją na stosowane w jej ochronie herbicydy, to trzeba sie dobrze zastanowic, czy nie",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacterial proteins of the Dsb (disulfide bond) system catalyze the formation of disulfide bridges, a post-translational modification of extra-cytoplasmic proteins, which leads to stabilization of their tertiary and quaternary structures and often influences their activity. DsbA – Escherichia coli monomeric oxidoreductase is the best studied protein involved in this process. Recent rapid advances in global analysis of bacteria have thrown light on the enormous diversity among bacterial Dsb systems. The set of Dsb proteins involved in the oxidative pathway, varies, depending on the microorganism. In this article we have focused on characterization of structural and phylogenetic groups of monomeric DsbAs. This review discuss their physicochemical features and interactions with redox partners as well as with substrate proteins. The last part of the review concentrates on dimeric oxidoreductases responsible for disulfide generation. Many virulence factors are the substrates of the Dsb proteins. Thus unraveling the machinery that introduces disulfide bonds and expanding knowledge about Dsb protein structures and their activities may facilitate the discovery of an effective anti-bacterial drugs. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Sandboxes are present on almost every playground. They enjoy constant popularity among the youngest. Are we sometimes wonder who is responsible for their sanitary condition? Play in them can be a threat to children? This article will discuss the subject of monitoring the sanitary condition of sandboxes. The microbiological threat of contact with contaminated sand will also be presented. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are bacteria that can inhabit sandboxes and pose a threat to health. Both of these microorganisms should not be found in the environment. Their presence means contamination of sand, and contact with it can be hazardous to human health. What’s more, these bacteria increasingly show resistance to antibiotics routinely used to treat infections. The problem of microorganism resistance to therapeutics is very important because the number of drug-resistant strains is growing alarmingly. The pool of effective antibiotics is contracting and new ones are not developing. In this work, antibiotics used during the treatment will be presented: aminoglycosides, ansamycins, β-lactam antibiotics, quinolones, fusidans, MLS group, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines. The paper also presents information concerning so far known mechanisms of antibiotic action. The article also presents the resistance mechanisms of Enterobacteriaceae ; ESBL mechanism (extended-spectrum β-lactamases), production of MBL (metallo-β-lactamase), CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ) and resistance mechanisms of S. aureus , to penicillin, MRSA – methicillin-resistant S. aureus , and for vancomycin VRSA resistant S. aureus . Drug resistance has become a global problem. The presence of drug-resistant strains carries the risk of spreading antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms in natural environments like water, air, soil and sand. Infections caused by such microorganisms are very difficult to treat, because the small pool of antibiotics that can be used during treatment, and thus reduces the effectiveness of therapy. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The infections caused by orthohantaviruses were already known in the Middle Ages as “English sweats.” There are two main diseases caused by these viruses – HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) and HFRS (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome). Rodents are the main reservoir of these microorganisms, and humans usually catch them by inhalation, as a result of contact with secretions and droppings of carriers. HPS is characterized by a sudden onset, and symptoms include primarily cough, fever and difficulty breathing, and in extreme cases – respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. HFRS begins suddenly and the main manifestation includes fever, renal failure, hemorrhage, hematuria and proteinuria, as well as shock. At present, anti-hantavirus therapy with proven effectiveness does not exist. A key role in the treatment is resting lifestyle, electrolyte control, fluid therapy and prevention of hypotension, and in harder cases – administration of oxygen.

    "abstract": "Abstract Fungal diseases affect over 300 million people worldwide each year and cause over 1.6 million deaths. Even with such a high prevalence of fungal infections, relatively few fungal species are pathogens, and invasive fungal infections are rarely diagnosed in healthy subjects. Comparative analyses of mycobiomes reveal that the human organism is colonized by specific fungi soon after birth, and the quantitative and qualitative composition of the mycobiota changes throughout life. In recent years, correlations between the mycobiome structure and health status, also in disease conditions, have been analyzed at the level of fungus-mycobiome-host interactions. The relationship between the colonized area of the human body defined as anatomical location, and fungal species specific for this area, indicates a strong selective pressure that promotes the growth of species specific for a given ecological niche within the organism. Another issue is the validation and standardization of mycobiome analysis methods. In this respect, metagenomic sequencing methods are currently arousing considerable interest. The review presents the current knowledge about the mycobiome in physiological and disease states induced by the dysbiosis of the existing microbiome.

Multiple bacterial glycoproteins are involved in adhesion, invasion or evasion of host defense mechanisms. A range of glycosylation pathways has recently been an object of intense research. Their activity is based on the glycosyltransferases – enzymes that transfer sugar moieties directly to the acceptor protein (sequential glycosylation) or to a lipid carrier from which the glycan is transferred by an oligosaccharyltransferase onto the target protein (en-bloc glycosylation). Successful implementation of complete glycosylation systems in Escherichia coli cells resulted in rapid development of bacterial glycoengineering. Oligosaccharyltransferases are characterized by a broad substrate specificity which may be exploited to produce glycoconjugate vaccines.",

Because the biofilm structures are significantly more resistant to environmental stress conditions than the planktonic forms of bacteria, it is often impossible to remove them through conventional disinfection or sterilization practices. Therefore, it has become necessary to develop effective strategies in combating biofilms, which are defined as the dominant form of microbial life. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to understand the genetic regulatory mechanisms that control the transition from planktonic form to the biofilm form and the related changes in gene expression. In this review, the current state of knowledge regarding gene regulation systems that affect the biofilm formation in Salmonella, has been summarized and discussed.",

It has been shown that the optimal substrate for the CAMP test to identify Listeria sp. is an agar with the 5% addition of human blood cells. While sheep’s erythrocytes were the best substrate for hemolysis of C. perfringens. The optimum distance and incubation time for the tested bacterial species was 1–4 mm and 24 h.

Proper composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome is necessary to maintain human health. According to the latest studies, the imbalance in the composition of intestinal microorganisms, called dysbiosis, can result in development of numerous diseases, including metabolic disorders e.g. diabetes. The incidence of this disease is constantly increasing. The pathogenesis of diabetes is complicated and not yet fully understood. However, it is known that many factors influence its development. Intestinal microbiota is increasingly mentioned among them. Based on a literature review related to the subject, it can be concluded that dysbiosis, intestinal barrier damage and endotoxemia adversely affect metabolic parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Some microorganisms are characterised by the ability to create specific morphological varieties called Small Colony Variants (SCVs). This characteristic was noted, among others, in Gram-positive cocci, mainly staphylococci, but also in Gram-negative bacilli. The properties of Small Colony Variants that differentiate them from wild-type colonies (mainly their small size) facilitate their intracellular survival (e.g. in epithelial or endothelial cells) as a result of which they can escape host immune response. In this way, SCV forms avoid the effects of complement components or antibodies. They are also characterised by resistance to antibiotics, mainly aminoglycoside or combination drugs, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The above features, which are important from a clinical point of view, namely small size and antibiotic resistance, make SCV one of the main causes of chronic, latent and recurrent infections which are difficult not only to diagnose, but also to treat. According to the literature, SCV of various microorganisms can be isolated from systemic infections of various organs and therefore from different clinical materials (e.g. blood, bones, soft tissues). SCV forms of Staphylococcus aureus are often isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis or osteomyelitis. The paper presents the characteristics and clinical relevance of this unique morphological form of bacteria.",

The following article provides information on the structure, classification and applications of hydrogenases.",

    "abstract": "Zakazenia drog moczowych (ZUM) stanowią jedne z najcześciej wystepujących infekcji bakteryjnych, dotykających kazdego roku miliony osob na świecie. Problematyka tych zakazen wynika z ich przewleklości i nawrotow, pomimo stosowania terapii antybiotykowej oraz ciągle wzrastającej lekooporności uropatogenow je wywolujących. Dominującym czynnikiem etiologicznym ZUM są uropatogenne szczepy E. coli (UPECs), wykazujące zdolnośc do adhezji, inwazji, tworzenia wewnątrzkomorkowych agregatow bakteryjnych i zlozonych struktur biofilmu w obrebie skolonizowanych drog moczowych. Szczepy E. coli Dr+ stanowią trzecią grupe UPECs, ktore produkują homopolimeryczne struktury adhezyjne, wystepujące na powierzchni komorek bakteryjnych w postaci fimbrii Dr. Są one odpowiedzialne za zapalenie pecherza moczowego u dzieci i odmiedniczkowe zapalenie nerek u doroslych, zwlaszcza u kobiet ciezarnych (40% przypadkow, w III trymestrze ciązy). Zdolnośc do tworzenia biofilmu stanowi rowniez przyczyne przewleklości tych zakazen i trudności terapeutyczne. W toku prowadzonych badan wykazano, ze fimbrie Dr i bialko DraD stanowią glowne determinanty urowirulencji klinicznego izolatu E. coli IH11128 Dr+, odpowiedzialne za tworzenie biofilmu, natomiast autoagregująca adhezyna Ag43 moze wplywac na jego rozwoj i zwiekszenie przezywalności bakterii w komorkach uroepitelialnych. Wstepne analizy wykazaly rowniez, ze bakterie te wzrastające na podlozu polistyrenowym, tworzą biofilm o rozgalezionej, drzewiastej strukturze z komorkami uwiezionymi w rozleglej macierzy pozakomorkowej. Powyzsze dane eksperymentalne wymagają jednak dalszych badan, dotyczących struktury i skladu biochemicznego biofilmu, w odniesieniu do aktywności metabolicznej komorek bakteryjnych.",

Celem pracy było dokonanie przeglądu dostępnej literatury na temat źródeł szerzenia się zakażeń szpitalnych w kontekście higieny rąk personelu. Ocena, czy procedury te są wykonywane prawidłowo oraz czy ręce i paznokcie mają wpływ na rozprzestrzenianie się drobnoustrojów w środowisku szpitalnym. Literatury szukano w bazach danych PubMed oraz Google Schoolar, wpisując odpowiednie słowa kluczowe. Zebrane dane literaturowe jednoznacznie wskazują jak istotną rolę w przerwaniu łańcucha epidemiologicznego zakażeń szpitalnych ma prawidłowa procedura mycia rąk; krótkie oraz niepomalowane paznokcie a także brak biżuterii na rękach personelu szpitalnego.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative saprophytic rod inhabiting both moist niches and dry surfaces. The wide spread of the microbe in the environment by means of minimal nutritional requirements and exceptional survival capabilities give the opportunities to occupy hospital niches, and thus to create threats for hospitalized patients. This bacterium may be a part of the human microbiota as an opportunistic pathogen which upon the host’s weakening, causes less or more serious diseases. A. baumannii is an etiological factor of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is especially dangerous for patients in intensive care units (in Poland every fifth patient suffers from such infection). Due to the increasing multidrug resistance of A. baumannii , this bacterium belongs to the group of priority pathogens. Fighting such dangerous bacteria is difficult due to their natural resistance as well as acquired resistance mechanisms in response to environmental threats. The unique ability of A. baumannii to cause diseases and acquire resistance to numerous antibiotics, make it necessary to control and prevent these infections.",

Zainteresowanie tą grupą bakterii w dużej mierze związane jest z ich właściwościami, które mogą być wykorzystywane w rolnictwie. Najnowsze badania opierają się na zaawansowanych metodach molekularnych i bazują na poznanej sekwencji genomów dwóch gatunków: Azotobacter vinelandii i Azotobacter chroococcum . W 2009 roku Setubal i in. opublikowali pełną sekwencję genomu Azotobacter vinelandii DJ, z kolei pełną sekwencję genomu Azotobacter chroococcum 8003 opublikowali Robson i in. w pracy z 2015 roku. Obie bakterie mają pojedynczy, kolisty chromosom o wielkości odpowiednio 5,365,318 pz. i 5,192,291 pz. Poznanie i porównanie sekwencji genomów Azotobacter vinelandii DJ i Azotobacter chroococcum 8003 pozwoliło odpowiedzieć na wiele pytań dotyczących ewolucji, różnorodności i miejsca tych bakterii w środowisku. Zsekwencjonowanie większej liczby genomów innych szczepów A. chroococcum i A. vinelandii przyniosłoby wiele korzyści i pozwoliłoby uporządkować dotychczasową wiedzę na ich temat.",
