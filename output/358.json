    "abstract": "Core Ideas Drought causes significant yield reductions both for rainfed and irrigated crops. Drought can have impact on cropping areas and crop yield. Changing crop types can be used to cope with drought challenges during drought periods. Increased crop yield is required to meet the needs of future population growth, but drought causes significant yield reductions for rainfed and irrigated crops. This study evaluates the impact of drought on crop yield and cropping area over 10 climate zones in Texas from 2008 to 2016. It also depicts the spatiotemporal distribution of crop yield and cropping area changes at each climate zone across the state. We analyzed the impact of drought on crop yields and cropping areas before and after the 2011 severe drought using annual crop yields of four major crops. Results show that drought had a greater impact on winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and corn ( Zea mays L.) and lesser impact on cotton ( Gossypium spp.) and sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production across Texas. Cotton and corn hectarages were reduced during the drought period and increased after that, whereas winter wheat hectarage was reduced in the northern climate zones and increased in the southern climate zones before the drought. Results also indicate that drought impact on crop production may be reduced by replacing water‐demanding crops such as corn with drought‐tolerant crops such as sorghum and expanding irrigation hectarage during drought periods. It may be beneficial for Texas agricultural production to increase the hectarage of sorghum and other grains especially during drought periods. This study provides valuable information that can be used to adopt appropriate measures to cope with future drought challenges in drought‐prone regions.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas The extraction protocol for “glomalin” extracts protein from a wide variety of sources. The term glomalin or glomalin‐related soil protein is inaccurate and limits the utility of the method. The extracted protein pool should be viewed more broadly as a soil health indicator of potentially available organic N. Increased interest in practical, routine evaluation of soil health has created a need for rapid and inexpensive indicators that reflect soil nitrogen (N) status. Here we propose a soil protein measurement as an indicator of a functionally relevant and sensitive pool of organic N that can be rapidly quantified in soil testing laboratories. The procedure is based on a method that was historically used to measure “glomalin,” a pool putatively of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal origin. Laboratory validation experiments demonstrate that the procedure extracts proteins from a wide range of sources, not just glomalin, and that continued use of the term glomalin is inaccurate and limits the application of the method. Therefore, we propose that the pool of proteins extracted by this method can be viewed more broadly as a soil health indicator that reflects the primary pool of organically bound N in soil and thus as potentially available organic N. We provide a laboratory protocol that details autoclaving soil in a neutral sodium citrate buffer solution followed by clarification and protein quantification steps.",

Field calibration is underway to relate the flush of CO 2 to nitrogen availability. Health of agricultural soils depends largely on conservation management to promote soil organic matter accumulation. Total soil organic matter changes slowly, but active fractions are more dynamic. A key indicator of healthy soil is potential biological activity, which could be measured rapidly with soil testing services via the flush of CO 2 during 1 to 3 d following rewetting of dried soil. The flush of CO 2 is related to soil microbial biomass C and has repeatedly been shown strongly related to net N mineralization during standard aerobic incubations. New research is documenting the close association with plant N uptake in semicontrolled greenhouse conditions ( r 2 = 0.77, n = 36). Field calibrations are underway to relate the flush of CO 2 to the need for in‐season N requirement in a variety of crops. An index of soil biological activity can and should be determined to help predict soil health and soil N availability.",

Service interactions also create trade‐offs among services and disservices. Cover crop mixtures can mitigate disservices to increase multifunctionality. Agroecosystems are increasingly expected to provide multiple ecosystem services. We tested whether and how cover crop selection (identity and number of species) affects provisioning of multiple services (multifunctionality). In a 3‐yr study of 10 cover crop treatments and eight ecosystem services, certain services consistently co‐occurred. One such service “bundle” included cover crop biomass production, weed suppression, and nitrogen retention. Another set of bundled services included cash crop production, nitrogen supply, and profitability. We also identified trade‐offs: as some services increased, other disservices arose, limiting multifunctionality. However, functionally diverse mixtures ameliorated disservices associated with certain monocultures, thereby increasing cover crop multifunctionality.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Despite nationwide emphasis on soil health in the USA, current measurements lack consistency. A meta‐analysis showed 8 of 42 soil health indicators reported &gt;20% of time. Only 13 indicators showed short‐term (1–3 yr timescale) responses to cover cropping. Wide variation in soil sampling protocols suggests standardization is needed. Translating soil health research across systems requires a common framework. Despite a nationwide emphasis on improving soil health in the United States, current measurement protocols have little consistency. To survey assessment practices, we conducted a meta‐analysis of cover crop ( n = 86) and no‐tillage ( n = 106) studies and compiled reported indicators, cropping systems, and soil sampling protocols from each. We then analyzed which indicators significantly responded to cover crop usage after 1 yr and 2 to 3 yr. Our results showed that out of 42 indicators, only 8 were reported in &gt;20% of studies. Thirteen indicators showed &gt;10% relative response after 1 to 3 yr; the remainder lacked either sufficient observations or consistent results. Looking forward, we propose that emphasis should be placed on (i) pursuing dynamic indicators (e.g., aggregate stability), (ii) standardizing sampling protocols, and (iii) developing a common framework for information sharing. These efforts will generate new insight into soil health across systems, ultimately ensuring that soil health science is useful to producers and regulators.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas After 3 yr, soybean yield was higher from multispecies than from single‐ and double‐species cover cropping. Multispecies cover cropping had higher soil water and inorganic N content than less‐diverse treatments. Soil organic C was unaffected by cover crop species diversity. Several years of cover cropping are needed to achieve ecosystem benefits. Multispecies cover cropping has become popular in recent years because of the multiple ecosystem benefits compared with single‐ or double‐ species cover cropping. However, scientific studies on the effects of multispecies cover cropping—especially in the southern United States—are limited. A field study was initiated in 2013 at the University of Tennessee's Research and Education Center in Milan, TN, to assess the agronomic and soil responses from single‐, double‐, and multispecies cover cropping in corn ( Zea mays L.)–soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems. After 3 yr, we found that a multispecies mixture of legumes, grasses, and Brassica spp. significantly increased soybean yield, gravimetric soil water content, and soil inorganic nitrogen as compared to the less‐diverse treatments and a no‐cover control. However, after 3 yr, cover cropping did not increase soil organic carbon. Although multispecies cover cropping exhibited a positive effect on yield and some soil properties after 3 yr, we plan to continue collecting multiple years of data from this field trial.",

As a proof‐of‐concept experiment to evaluate the interpretation of POXC as “labile” C, we tested 17 compounds ranging in biological lability under standard POXC assay conditions at a fixed C mass (25 mg) in a quartz (2–0.053 mm diameter) matrix. POXC was high for lignin, whereas carbohydrates did not differ from the quartz control. Functional group‐based reactivity partly explained permanganate reduction. These findings indicate that (i) POXC is not a labile C fraction and (ii) corroborate previous concerns that the stoichiometric oxidation–reduction assumptions in the calculation of C oxidation from permanganate reduced are not sound. POXC interpretation should regard POXC as a chemically defined fraction, report in units of moles permanganate reduced per kg soil, and avoid terms such as “labile” and “active.”",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Soil test phosphorus remains an important factor in studying dissolved reactive P loss. Identifying higher risk fields with STP could inform future management practices to reduce DRP loss. STP was linearly related to DRP concentration loads in tile‐drained fields. Monitoring STP in addition to implementing other BMPs should be considered to decrease DRP loss. Harmful and nuisance algal blooms resulting from excess phosphorus (P) have placed agriculture in the spotlight of the water quality debate. Sixty‐eight site years of P loading data (combined surface runoff and tile flow) from 36 fields in Ohio were used to see if a soil test P (STP) concentration could be identified that allowed P application while still meeting recommended loss thresholds. Regression analysis revealed that P application to soils with STP concentration in the “critical level” range would result in P losses above the recommended Annex 4 thresholds. In addition, fertilizer application increased the risk of dissolved reactive P (DRP) loss as compared to years in which fertilizer was not applied. We determined that STP was a good screening method to identify fields that are at risk for greater P loss, but STP alone was not a good predictor of DRP loss, suggesting that a more holistic approach that includes upland management, edge‐of‐field practices, and in‐stream approaches will be required to decrease DRP loading.",

Current use patterns violate core principles of integrated pest management. We present an overview of these products, focusing on some key limitations. Deploying neonicotinoids more judiciously will reduce their negative side effects. Educational materials guiding the use of pesticides are often sponsored or co‐created by pesticide manufacturers, raising potential conflicts of interest. For example, early in 2017, two registrant‐sponsored webinars from the American Society of Agronomy addressed benefits of neonicotinoid seed coatings, which are routinely applied to seeds of many field crops. While these products can protect yield in certain situations, they also carry significant limitations; unfortunately, these presentations avoided such downsides. Here, we provide an overview of key limitations of neonicotinoid seed treatments (NST). First, we address Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and how current use of NST violates its key principles and ignores lessons learned. Second, we address inconsistent yield responses, resistance concerns, and nontarget effects. Third, we return to IPM to discuss how this proven framework can be used to more effectively guide and steward NST to avoid mounting reports of negative side effects.",

CO 2 increase to 540 ppm partially compensates yield losses due to increased temperatures. Accounting for soil feedbacks is critical when evaluating climate change impacts on crop yield. A critical omission from climate change impact studies on crop yield is the interaction between soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) availability, and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). We used a multimodel ensemble to predict the effects of SOC and N under different scenarios of temperatures and CO 2 concentrations on maize ( Zea mays L.) and wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) yield in eight sites across the world. We found that including feedbacks from SOC and N losses due to increased temperatures would reduce yields by 13% in wheat and 19% in maize for a 3°C rise temperature with no adaptation practices. These losses correspond to an additional 4.5% (+3°C) when compared to crop yield reductions attributed to temperature increase alone. Future CO 2 increase to 540 ppm would partially compensate losses by 80% for both maize and wheat at +3°C, and by 35% for wheat and 20% for maize at +6°C, relative to the baseline CO 2 scenario.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Up to 19% of common commercial P fertilizer applied to soil can be lost via runoff. Liquid fertilizers or banding fertilizers 1 cm below the surface can reduce P loss. Inherent fertility inefficiencies must be balanced with water quality concerns. Surface water eutrophication is a pervasive global problem, with P losses from agriculture often identified as a significant contributor. This study was conducted to evaluate the implications of fertilizer source and placement on soluble P (SP) losses in runoff. Using the National P Runoff Project protocol, SP losses in runoff from eight P fertilizers broadcast on the soil surface and three P fertilizers banded 1 cm below the surface were compared with a nonfertilized control. Results showed that 16 to 19% of the surface‐applied inorganic P fertilizers was lost in one rainstorm, except for liquid polyphosphate, which lost less than 0.2% of the applied P. Banding monoammonium phosphate and poultry litter below the surface decreased SP loading by 98 and 84%, respectively. These results indicate that critical examination of current fertilizer management may be needed to diminish eutrophication while ensuring sufficient P for crop uptake.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Globally, food systems face multiple challenges, including minimizing environmental impacts, adapting to a changing climate, increasing yields, and maintaining and/or increasing crop nutritional quality. Management techniques that focus on soil health (SH) are promising solutions to mitigate some environmental impacts and may increase economic returns. However, claims that SH increases will concurrently increase crop quality and productivity merit careful examination. Factors beyond SH metrics determine crop nutritional quality. Yield outcomes of SH management are of significance, as there are concerns that yield increases are insufficient to meet future food demands. While SH frameworks are comparatively recent initiatives, there are thousands of published conservation agriculture studies that examine yield outcomes with cover crops, no‐till, and rotation. This literature indicates that SH practices can also have neutral or negative yield impacts—only in select systems have consistent yield increases been realized, highlighting the need for language clarification and improvements in mechanistic understanding of regional‐scale yield impacts.",

The rate of phenological development increased at higher temperatures; however, the relationship of leaf collar and leaf tip appearance to growing degree days was the same between temperature regimes. There was no effect on total leaf area or vegetative dry matter production, but grain yields decreased from 84 to 100% because of exposure to high nighttime temperatures and disruption of the pollination process as evidenced by the large reduction in kernels per ear.

Simulations from a process‐based model (SALUS) indicated achieving 5 Mg ha −1 requires substantially earlier fall planting and later spring termination in most years, conflicting with typical cash‐crop planting and harvesting.

Multispecies mixtures did not affect maize, soybean, or wheat yields. Cover crops with high biomass and C/N ratios provide unique ecosystem services. Both mixtures and diverse rotations may enhance cover crop ecosystem services. Despite the popularity of multispecies cover crop mixtures, there is little published evidence of their effects on subsequent crop yields, especially for multiple crops grown in rotation. We examined the effects of fall‐planted cover crops—both mixtures and their component monocultures—on subsequent crop yields in an organically managed maize ( Zea mays L.)–soybean [ Glycine max (L.)

This held true for maize ( R 2 = 0.134, p &lt; 0.0001), but there was no cover crop effect on soybean or wheat yields. All multispecies mixtures produced high biomass, and none affected maize yield relative to fallow.

Lack of information about effective CC management and the costs and benefits of CCs may contribute to low adoption. We use CC management data from 112 farms in the Soil Health Partnership network (2015–2021) to characterize CC management practices and costs. Soil Health Partnership farmers spent a median of US$98.84 per hectare to plant CCs on trial fields in the 2021 crop year, and costs varied with management practices. Farmers also experimented with CC management practices; more than half of 100 farmers providing panel data used more than one seeding method, and the share “planting green” increased over time. This diversity of CC management practices, heterogeneity in costs (and benefits), and experimentation process—among other factors—may make it challenging for farmers to develop expectations about whether CCs will be profitable on their farm in the short, medium, or long‐run.",

However, excessive fertilization leads to P build up in soils, increasing its potential to cause environmental pollution. The objective of this study was to evaluate the average P drawdown rate of 56 sites with drawdown management presented in 14 publications. Soil test P (STP) results were converted to Mehlich‐3 equivalent and resampling analysis was used to compare the annual drawdown rate in fields grouped by four initial STP classes. The STP was reduced by 4.3%–8.2% per year, depending on the initial STP class. It took from 8.4 to 15.9 years to reduce the STP by half. The resulting equations from this meta‐analysis can be used by landowners to estimate the time needed for STP drawdown by cropping without additional P to achieve the desired STP concentration. Core Ideas Cropping without phosphorus (P) fertilization is one of the few options to reduce soil test P (STP). A meta‐analysis of the annual P drawdown rate was performed using 56 sites presented in 14 publications. Fields were grouped into four initial STP classes based on Mehlich‐3 STP equivalent.

This study indicates a lack of accuracy and bias in the TE approach when future crop water requirements were estimated. High maize yields are achievable using on average 700 mm of water as demonstrated by the current record maize grain yield of 34 Mg ha −1 , which is ∼23 Mg ha −1 higher than the US average. These yields are achievable with approximately the same ET even under projected changes in vapor pressure deficit, through improved genetics and optimum agronomic management.",

The most common method for estimating the agronomic optimum N rate (AONR) is to design a field experiment with several N fertilizer rates and fit a regression model to the yield observations. Here, we concentrate on its accuracy and precision given choices of experimental design and statistical analysis. Our first finding is that the choice of functional form has a large agronomic effect on the estimate of the AONR, and this depends on the data‐generating model. Our second finding is that improving the precision and accuracy of AONR estimates will demand an increase in the number of N rates and replications. Finally, we propose that using either the best‐fitting model or a weighted model is preferable to always choosing either the linear‐plateau (negative bias) or quadratic‐plateau (positive bias) models.",

However, uncertainties in the reduction reaction (Mn 7+ → Mn 4+ /Mn 2+ ) and even greater uncertainties in the oxidation reaction (C ? → C ? ) as well as the reaction of non‐C reductants in the soil sample preclude the calculation of milligram C per kilogram of soil oxidized. Combined variation in the reduction–oxidation reactions can entail up to fivefold variation in how much soil organic C is oxidized per unit permanganate reduced. Without determining final reduction state of Mn and the initial and final oxidation states of C, the amount of C oxidized cannot be calculated. Unless a concrete understanding of the reduction and oxidation half‐reactions is achieved, an alternative expression of permanganate reactivity of a soil sample (i.e., not mg C kg −1 soil) is needed.",

We evaluated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) as an alternative to sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) for PO 4 ‐P elution.

The network aims to promote sustainable, climate‐smart land management. Delta‐Flux is open to collaborators from strategic sites and relevant disciplines. Networks of remotely monitored research sites are increasingly the tool used to study regional agricultural impacts on carbon and water fluxes. However, key national networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network and AmeriFlux lack contributions from the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB), a highly productive agricultural area with opportunities for soil carbon sequestration through conservation practices. The authors describe the rationale to create the new Delta‐Flux network, which will coordinate efforts to quantify carbon and water budgets at seventeen eddy covariance flux tower sites in the LMRB. The network structure will facilitate climate‐smart management strategies based on production‐scale and continuous measurements of carbon and water fluxes from the landscape to the atmosphere under different soil and water management conditions. The seventeen instrumented field sites are expected to monitor fluxes within the most characteristic landscapes of the target area: row‐crop fields, pasture, grasslands, forests, and marshes. The network participants are committed to open collaboration and efficient regionalization of site‐level findings to support sustainable agricultural and forestry management and conservation of natural resources.",

There are limitations of soil health practices and reducing P losses. Educators should discuss BMP trade‐offs associated with P loss. Soil health has gained widespread attention in agronomic and conservation communities due to its many purported benefits, including claims that implementation of core soil health practices (e.g., conservation tillage, cover crops) will improve water quality by curtailing runoff losses of nutrients such as phosphorus (P). However, a review of the existing literature points to well‐established findings regarding trade‐offs in water quality outcomes following the implementation of core soil health practices. In fact, both conservation tillage and cover crops can exacerbate dissolved P losses, undermining other benefits such as reductions in particulate P (sediment‐bound P) losses. Soil health management must be pursued in a manner that considers the complex interaction of nutrient cycling processes and produces realistic expectations.

The practice of extending maize–soybean rotations with small grains and forages has great potential to balance production and environmental goals, but adoption of these practices is low. Because little is known about farmers’ perspectives on extended rotations, we conducted social survey research with Iowa farmers to address this knowledge gap. Results show that farmers understand the potential benefits of extended rotations using small grains, but they perceive major barriers to use. The highest‐rated barriers were structural, such as lack of markets. Structural barriers cannot be easily addressed by individual farmers, indicating that efforts to address negative impacts of specialized commodity production through extended rotations with small grains will require transformative changes in agri‐food policies, programs, and ultimately markets.",

Five River Thames tributaries were used to assess the utility of stoichiometric plots. &lt;13% total dissolved P limited chlorophyll a to &lt;30 μg L −1 . Primary productivity in aquatic systems relies on carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) availability, with a reference stoichiometric ratio of 106 C/16 N/1 P, known as the Redfield ratio. This paper presents a methodology to visualize river water C/N/P stoichiometry and examine phytoplankton response. Redfield total dissolved C/N/P concentration ratios (TDC/TDN R /TDP R ) from five River Thames tributaries were plotted in a ternary diagram, allowing relationships between nutrient stoichiometry, total P concentrations, and chlorophyll a, as a surrogate for phytoplankton biomass, to be explored. Chlorophyll a concentrations above 100 μg L −1 were not observed below 14% TDP R , and concentrations above 30 μg L −1 were not observed below 13% TDP R . This indicates a potentially lower TDP R limit for highly eutrophic waters.

Recent advances in open‐source software and hardware technologies, such as the Arduino project, show potential for the development of low‐cost (∼$100) automated dataloggers required for continuous data collection. We developed an Arduino‐based datalogger (the Ecohydro Logger) coupled with water sensors providing digital output to establish a hydrologic monitoring network in the data‐scarce wet‐dry tropics of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. While we experienced some challenges with a first iteration of our Arduino‐based datalogger, an improved version was robust and able to capture long periods of high‐frequency stream discharge data. Integration of the monitoring program into the local community was also key to successful deployment, allowing exchange of local knowledge and support. The accessible and low‐cost nature of Arduino‐based dataloggers can provide a means to extend continuous environmental monitoring into data‐scarce regions.",

With more sophisticated data compilation and analytical capabilities, the evolution of “big data” analysis has occurred rapidly. We examine the meta‐analysis of “big data” representing phosphorus (P) flows and stocks in global agriculture and address the need to consider local nuances of farm operations to avoid erroneous or misleading recommendations. Of concern is the disconnect between macro‐needs for better P resource management at regional and national scales versus local realities of P management at farm scales.

Integrated agricultural systems (IAS) are uniquely adapted to variable land types. Socioeconomic barriers to IAS implementation are significant. Considerable research and education is needed to facilitate IAS adoption. Contemporary agricultural land use is dominated by an emphasis on provisioning services by applying energy‐intensive inputs through relatively uniform production systems across variable landscapes. This approach to agricultural land use is not sustainable. Achieving sustainable use of agricultural land should instead focus on the application of innovative management systems that provide multiple ecosystem services on lands with varying inherent qualities. Integrated agricultural systems (IAS) represent an alternative approach to prevailing land use, whereby site‐adapted enterprises are implemented to enhance synergistic resource transfer among enterprises and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services. Sustainable deployment of IAS on agricultural land involves placing the “right enterprise” at the “right intensity” at the “right time” on the “right location,” with the inherent attributes of location providing guidance for management decisions. There is an urgent need to design IAS that enhance delivery of ecosystem services while ensuring land potential thresholds are not exceeded.",

Commodity moisture content and equilibrium relative humidity are uniquely related. Relative humidity can be measured easily using electronic meters or indicator paper. Commodity moisture content can be conveniently measured using such indicator strips. Declines of seed viability in storage and losses of stored commodities due to fungal spoilage and insect pests are promoted by high moisture content. However, measuring seed or grain moisture content in the field can be difficult, particularly in rural locations in developing countries. Because seed/commodity moisture content is uniquely related to equilibrium relative humidity at a given temperature, moisture content can be estimated by measuring the relative humidity of a sample enclosed in a sealed container. Relative humidity can be measured using electronic meters, or even more inexpensively using indicator paper that changes color in response to relative humidity. We describe this method and provide a spreadsheet to convert relative humidity to moisture content for many common seeds and commodities. This simple method can be used in the field for quickly estimating seed or commodity moisture content to determine whether further drying is needed or is suitable for storage, milling or other uses.",

Many states had their highest levels of diversity between 1940 and 1960, but trends varied strongly among states. In 1900, the states with highest diversity were in the Northeast, but in 2012 the highest diversity was found in California, North Dakota, and the southeastern states. Diversity in the central US Corn Belt was very low throughout the 142‐yr period studied.

Significant response of SOC to long‐term tillage was observed mostly in the surface 5 cm. SOC accumulation was favored by corn and cotton systems than soybean systems down to 22.5 cm.

Arsenic concentrations in porewater and plant tissue increased with soil warming. Grain arsenic concentrations were not significantly affected by soil temperature. Future studies should explore links between climate conditions and arsenic uptake by rice. Arsenic uptake by rice ( Oryza sativa L.) threatens yield and contaminates grain. Climate warming could affect these hazards. We tested the effect of elevated soil temperature on arsenic availability to and uptake by rice plants. Rice was grown in arsenic‐amended soil in rhizoboxes that facilitated porewater sampling and synchrotron X‐ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging of the rhizosphere. Plants were subjected to similar atmospheric conditions but different soil temperatures. The XRF imaging revealed greater arsenic sequestration in root iron plaques with a warmer soil temperature. Mean and median arsenic concentrations in porewater and root, straw, and husk tissue were positively correlated with average daily maximum soil temperature. Grain arsenic concentrations did not change. Warmer soil temperatures likely increased plant‐available arsenic by increasing reductive dissolution of arsenic‐bearing iron minerals, but the plants effectively regulated grain arsenic. The impacts of changing environmental conditions on arsenic contamination of rice should be further explored.",

We compared EPA 3050B and 3051 (with/without HCl) on various acidic and alkaline soils. Both EPA 3050B and EPA 3051 gave reliable and comparable results. The emphasis on controlling environmental phosphorus (P) losses from agriculture has expanded the role of agricultural laboratories in testing a variety of media for P, including soils, waste residuals, manures, and runoff waters. To estimate total P in soils, strong acid extraction methods, which actually measure total recoverable P, are generally used because true total digestion methods (e.g., USEPA method 3052 or perchloric acid digestion) possess an array of operational concerns and safety limitations and also typically extract forms of P that are of limited environmental import. We sought to assess the merits of two strong acid extraction methods, USEPA method 3050B and USEPA method 3051 (both with and without hydrochloric acid [HCl] addition), on a variety of acidic and alkaline soils typical of the northeastern United States. Both methods gave reliable results, although method 3050B without HCl showed somewhat lower (though not statistically significant) extraction efficiencies. Method 3051 was unaffected by the addition of HCl, and its extraction efficiencies were approximately 7% greater when compared to method 3050B, although the differences were only significant in one of the seven soils tested.",

There was a linear relationship between canopy cover measured with pictures ( R 2 = 0.94) and videos ( R 2 = 0.92) in Canopeo and light interception.

Climate change effects on catchment P processing are complex and poorly understood. Modeling of P flows and catchment P buffering is needed to inform management. Research should consider the effects of climate change on each tier of the continuum. Phosphorus inputs to agriculture and their fate in the environment contribute to poor water quality and degradation of linked ecosystem services at great cost to society. Climate change is likely to alter the forms and timings of P fluxes from land to water and their ecological impact, the effects of which are uncertain and need to be considered to inform future catchment management for eutrophication control. The P transfer continuum is an established conceptual model that we propose as a suitable framework to consider the potential effects of climate change on catchment P transfer. Consideration of this continuum suggests that predicted changes in temperature and precipitation will likely increase P transfer and associated eutrophication costs in some regions. Further research should examine climate change effects on each tier of the continuum to inform the necessary land management adaptations and transformations to ensure future food system P efficiency and resilience.",

Glandless (Gl) cottonseed is a new type of seed containing only trace levels of gossypol. This work quantitatively compared the content and migration pattern of Gd and Gl protein isolates. Both protein samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)‐gel electrophoresis, and the protein gel bands were separated into seven partitions for peptide mass spectroscopic analysis. While multiple peptide fragments (isoformers) of vicilin and legumin proteins were present in both samples, the percentage of vicilins in total seed protein was higher in Gd (74.9%) than in Gl (63.4%). In contrast, legumin proteins were more abundant in Gl (30.4%) than Gd (23.6%). Minor protein components such as lipid‐related oleosins and vicilin‐like antimicrobial peptides 2‐2 were also observed at a relatively higher incidence in Gl compared with Gd, potentially reflecting a need for increased protein‐related defense capability in the absence of gossypol against natural predators or adverse growth environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil respiration is one of the main soil health indicators and is influenced by several factors in agricultural fields. Identifying key factors that control soil respiration is desirable for informed soil management decisions and for promoting and scaling up soil health. This study aimed to (i) quantify the relationships between potential soil respiration and selected soil properties, crops, and slope positions, and (ii) identify key factors controlling these relationships using a neural network model. Ninety soil samples from 0‐ to 5‐ and 5‐ to 20‐cm soil depth were collected from footslope, backslope, and summit in three fields planted with soybean ( Glycine max L. Merr.), alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.), and corn ( Zea mays L.). The model provided great accuracy (coefficient of determination: 0.96; root‐mean square error: 7.8; and mean absolute deviation: 3.8) and explained nearly 96% of variations in soil respiration across soil depth, crop, and slope positions. Soil depth, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH 4 ‐N), crop types, slope position, and silt content were identified as the top five factors influencing potential soil respiration at the field level. Potential soil respiration was more sensitive to potassium, phosphorus, pH, cation exchange capacity, and mean weight diameter and less sensitive to NH 4 ‐N, nitrate nitrogen, soil organic matter, and clay content. It increased with pH, electrical conductivity, mean weight diameter, potential nitrogen mineralization, and potassium, and it decreased with increasing silt content. Soil from 0 to 5 cm under soybean or at the summit slope position exhibited a higher respiration. Using a small dataset, this pilot study accurately predicted potential soil respiration in agricultural fields and identified key drivers controlling it. The results from this study highlight the complexity of using potential soil respiration as a standalone test for evaluating soil health. This does not diminish the usefulness of potential soil respiration as a soil health indicator to support agricultural management decisions and as a reference in future soil health studies. However, it emphasizes the importance of considering multiple factors when interpreting the significance of soil biological indicators for soil health assessments.",

Over the past two decades, land management agencies and research groups have adopted a suite of standardized methods for monitoring rangelands, which have been implemented at over 85,000 monitoring locations globally. However, the ability to use these data to understand agroecosystem dynamics and change across scales and across land ownership has been limited because, until now, these data have not been available in a harmonized, accessible format for analyses, modeling, and decision‐support tools. We present the Landscape Data Commons, a cyberinfrastructure platform that harmonizes and aggregates standardized agroecosystem data, enables linkages to models, and facilitates analysis and interpretation of data within decision‐support tools. The Landscape Data Commons provides a community platform for users to contribute data and develop next‐generation tools to support agroecosystem management through the 21st century.",

Cotton stems with less ash are better suited for lignocellulosic feedstock of bioenergy and bio‐products. Feed quality characteristics of cottonseed are comparable to those of forage crops. Cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an important crop in the southern and southeastern parts of the United States, but cotton plant biomass residues are underutilized because the high‐value lint receives the most attention. In this study, whole cotton plants were collected at midseason and just before harvest and were chemically characterized to explore multiple uses. The plant samples were separated into six (midseason) or eight (pre‐defoliation for harvest) biomass fractions. We determined the macro‐ and trace elements, protein, fiber, and lignin contents in the biomass materials. Growth stages affected the relative contents of some, but not all, of the measured parameters. Correlation coefficient analysis of the measured data revealed that some of the parameters were well related to each other, whereas some were quite independent. The information reported in this work will be helpful in exploring and optimizing management practices and processing strategies for best utilization of these types of cotton crop biomass materials as renewable natural resources.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Sustainability indicators for US agriculture demonstrate improvement since 1980. Emerging multi‐stakeholder initiatives are seeking to drive further improvement. Collaboration with the scientific community is key to achieving improvements. Consumers and corporations are increasingly interested in understanding the sustainability of agricultural supply chains and reducing the environmental impacts of food, fiber, feed, and fuel production. This emerging need to quantify environmental impacts from agricultural production creates an opportunity for collaboration with the scientific community. Without such collaboration, sustainability efforts risk failure by adopting unrealistic goals or misguided approaches. This commentary explores the role of science in Field to Market, a nonprofit organization developing a sustainability program for US commodity crops, and highlights opportunities to address emerging science challenges. We evaluate changes over the past 35 years in key environmental impacts of crop production used to inform land managers as well as companies that are committed to improvements. Achieving improvements will only be possible if three key gaps are addressed regarding available simulation models and data, scale of implementation and uncertainty, and effectiveness of conservation practices. Filling these gaps presents an opportunity for dialogue between scientists, farmers, and private‐sector stakeholders to advance scientific knowledge and promote the common objective of sustainable agriculture.",

No‐tillage compared with plow tillage was functionally enriched for most nutrient cycles. Many other functions integral to soil health can be explored by the PICRUSt omics approach. Soil microbial communities affect the soil's biological, chemical, and physical properties, but there is still a knowledge gap regarding the long‐term impact of tillage practices on soil microbial dynamics. Additionally, the accurate identification of belowground microbial functions is a topic of active interest. In this study, microbial community profiles and functions in soil from a 50‐plus‐year‐old experiment in Ohio, representing one of the world's longest running comparisons of a plow‐tillage system and a continuous no‐tillage system, were compared. The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) algorithm was used to predict associated functional traits from 16S rRNA gene sequences. Analysis of the sequences revealed a large number of unidentified operational taxonomic units (67%), which is consistent with expectations of the soil ecosystem. Next, we investigated gene and enzyme predictions for nitrogen, sulfur, and methane metabolism and hydrocarbon degradation in soil. Results indicated that no‐tillage was functionally enriched for most nutrient cycles. This study has allowed us to predict distinct functional profiles as a result of legacy land uses. It serves as an example of improved analysis of the functional differences in soil managed by long‐term tillage versus no‐till.",

Roughly 75,520 km of US Midwest stream banks could host a saturated buffer. 248,000 to 360,000 saturated buffers could be implemented across the Midwest. Saturated buffers could potentially treat 3.85 million ha of Midwest drained land. Wide implementation could result in a 5–10% overall tile drainage N load reduction. Because saturated buffers are a new conservation practice, there has been no large‐scale assessment of their potential to aid in meeting water quality goals. Publicly available data were used in a stepwise fashion within a geographic information system to estimate the total stream length suitable for saturated buffer implementation across the US Midwest region and the resulting potential nitrate loading reduction from widespread saturated buffer implementation. Approximately 37,760 km of streams (or 75,520 km of stream bank) was deemed suitable to host a saturated buffer, and 3.85 million ha of drained land has the potential to drain to a saturated buffer. These results suggest that implementing saturated buffers widely could result in a 5 to 10% reduction of the estimated N load from midwestern tile‐drained land. Saturated buffers can be an important component of plans to achieve water quality goals.",

While European Union (EU) member states have not been permitted to account for this offsetting potential in their efforts to meet the EU 2020 reduction targets, this policy is now changing for the period 2020 to 2030, creating a demand for land management plans aimed at maximizing the offsetting potential of land.

A strong exponential relationship between Solvita and GC method was observed. CO 2 emissions from soils increased with drying temperature to a maximum at 65°C. The data presented highlight the narrow linear range of the Solvita method. The standardized procedure increased rate of analysis and reduced costs. A gas chromatography (GC) headspace method was developed for soil microbial respiration (CO 2 emission) analysis after a 24‐h incubation of a rewetted soil. The GC method was compared with the Solvita CO 2 burst method by analyzing 18 different soils that were air‐dried (22°C) or dried at 45, 65, and 105°C for 24 h before rewetting. A strong exponential relationship between the Solvita color number and GC headspace CO 2 –C emission was observed. Compared with air‐dried soils, drying at 65°C led to increased CO 2 emission and reduced variation among sample replicates, while drying at 105°C led to a reduction in CO 2 emission and an increase in variability. The GC method does not require sample dilution, provides data that is highly correlated to the Solvita method, and has a wider dynamic test range than the Solvita method. The developed GC method could be adapted to automation for commercial laboratory use.",

Special attention is required in vulnerable areas such as the northern Great Plains. Global climate change is typically characterized by warming average temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events. An understudied component of climate change is the occurrence of false springs, where warm temperatures in early spring prematurely release plants from dormancy, only to be harmed by a late spring frost event. Only limited research has investigated the nature, extent, and impacts of false springs, despite their potential for extreme environmental and economic consequences. More resources should be devoted to false spring research because they are predicted to increase in several regions, especially the northern Great Plains. We review the existing literature on false springs and identify knowledge gaps in both cropland and natural systems. Further, we propose avenues of research, focusing on ecosystems of the northern Great Plains.

The SOC content was 36.9% greater in grasslands than croplands irrespective of grazing management, and POXC/SOC ratio was 41.2% greater in strip‐tilled croplands than other land uses. Soil inorganic N was 270% greater in croplands than grasslands. The wet aggregate stability in conventional‐tilled grazed cropland was 22.6% lower than other land uses.

Gravimetric soil water content (SWC) was determined at WHC and at saturation. Both clay and SOC concentrations strongly influenced SWC; the effect of SOC was strongest and nonlinear. To achieve 50% WFPS, gravimetric SWC was 0.69 ± 0.10 times that of WHC and 0.59 ± 0.03 times that of saturation. For soil biological assays, 50% WFPS could be accurately and simply achieved with calculations using gravimetric SWC at saturation multiplied by 0.59.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Continuous corn ( Zea mays L.) yield increases are required to promote economic development and support a larger population. Reducing the existing yield gaps is a potential strategy to accomplish this goal. The objective of this study was to evaluate yield trends, and gaps at different production levels in Mississippi using data from 2012 to 2021. Production levels considered were Mississippi yield contest (Yc), Mississippi State University hybrid testing trials under irrigation (Yp) and dryland (Yw), and actual yield (Ya) from USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Since 2012, Yc, Yp, and Ya are stagnant, and Yw has a nonsignificant positive trend. Averaged over 10 yr, a yield gap of 5.6 Mg ha −1 between Yc and Ya, 4.1 Mg ha −1 between Yp and Ya, and 2.0 Mg ha −1 between Yw and Ya were noted at state level. Existing yield gap underlines current production limitations and necessitates adoption of improved agronomic practices. Core Ideas In the last 10 yr, contest yield, potential yield, and actual yield in Mississippi have been stagnant. State level yield gap ranges between 2.0 to 5.6 Mg ha ‐1 at different levels. Washington County showed the lowest (25.9%) and Lee County (48.8%) the highest yield gap in Mississippi.",

At four on‐farm CC experiments in Nebraska, we quantified soil health relative to a reference soil. We examined physical, chemical, and biological properties in near‐surface soil. Cover crops reduced the soil health gap between bare (no‐CC) and reference soil in the short (3‐yr) timescale, but the magnitude of responses depended on cropland management history and ecological dynamics of reference site plant communities. Increases in soil health relative to reference soils showed some relationship to increases in soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and corn ( Zea mays L.) yields. Clear discrimination of reference from bare soils was most influenced by organic matter and infiltration measurements conducted under the highest sampling intensity. Framing soil metrics relative to reference soils and ensuring appropriate sampling intensity are important to quantify the effects of CC on farm landscapes.",

One month after tilling grassland surface microbial biomass (0–10 cm) decreased 52%. Soil organic C decreased by 20% in the top 30 cm after one growing season. Alternative grassland conversion methods are needed to sustain soil health. Intensive tillage of grassland has negative long‐term effects on soil health, but little data exist to understand how quickly this decline occurs. We sampled a commercial field in the semiarid Southern Plains of the United States before and after tilling grassland and compared the results to adjacent row crop and perennial grass fields. Within the first month of tillage, we detected losses of 52% of microbial biomass C (505 to 241 mg kg −1 soil), 33% of organic C (11.6 to 7.78 g kg −1 soil), 30% of total N (1.09 to 0.760 g kg −1 soil) and 64 to 70% of β‐glucosidase and phosphodiesterase activities. The rapid decreases in these soil health indicators demonstrate that tillage management decisions are crucial for maintaining soil health if perennial grasses are converted to row cropping.",

Rumen and feces are dominated by firmicutes, 70% of which are in both compartments. Abomasum, small‐, and large‐intestine samples each had distinct taxonomic composition. Ingesta had more proteobacteria and bacteroidetes; tissue had more clostridia. One‐third of the OTUs in the pre‐gastric samples were also found in the rectum. Biological processes within beef cattle gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) influence animal health, and the output (feces) is an important vector for zoonotic pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria. Historically, outside of the rumen, little attention was paid to the bacteria along the GIT, despite their essential role in catabolizing feed into feces. Here we characterize bacteria from 15 GIT sites within a beef steer and examine the proportion of bacteria contributed by upstream compartments. This animal displayed characteristic differences between tissue and digesta communities in gastric and large‐intestine, but not small‐intestine, samples. The GIT sites shared between 50 and 80% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with their neighboring upstream compartment, with the exception of the ileum. The ileum shared only 11% with the jejunum but displayed a similar phylum‐level taxonomic distribution with the jejunum. It is unclear whether the observed changes between compartments represent a nonrandom decrease in bacterial number or rapid multiplication of certain taxa.",

Harvesting fertilized rye ( Secale cereale L.) cover crop has been suggested as a method to increase producer revenue and biofuel feedstock production, but drainage N loss impacts are currently unknown. Using the tested Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) across several N rates, spring application of 120 kg N ha ‐1 prior to winter rye harvest reduced drainage N loss by 54% compared with no cover crop and by 18% compared with planted rye that was neither fertilized nor harvested. Estimates of producer revenue and net energy were also positive, with 8.3 Mg ha ‐1 of harvested rye biomass.

We found, on average, 253 kg ha −1 of mineral N, 115 kg ha −1 in the NO 3 –N form, remaining after summer cash crop growth in the mid‐Atlantic region. Of this residual mineral N, 55% was 90 to 210 cm deep. More residual NO 3 –N remained after soybean than after corn. These substantial pools of mineral N remaining deep in the soil profile after productive cash crops, even unfertilized soybean, suggest that practices should be designed to scavenge residual N from deep soil layers in the fall, before it is lost over winter.",

Oxbows have largely disappeared from midwestern landscapes modified for agriculture. Restoring multipurpose oxbows provides multiple benefits in the agricultural Midwest. Nutrient export from the agricultural US Midwest influences streams and rivers and contributes to the development of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Oxbows are natural waterbodies formed when a river cuts off a meander loop as it migrates within its floodplain. Creation of multipurpose oxbows by restoration of former oxbows can potentially reduce export of nitrate‐nitrogen (nitrate) from agricultural land as well as provide important habitat for many species, including the endangered Topeka shiner. Recent studies of nitrate export reduction by oxbows in Iowa are encouraging, demonstrating a 45% reduction in nitrate export of water entering oxbows from subsurface tiles compared with water discharged to the adjacent stream. Oxbow restorations are as effective as several other nutrient reduction practices, are relatively inexpensive, last for decades if not centuries, remove little or no land from agricultural production, and provide significant ecosystem services. Multipurpose oxbows are a promising new best management practice for reducing nitrate export from agricultural lands.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Manure redistribution adds fertility benefits to recipient fields. Subsurface application of poultry litter has environmental benefits. Redistribution plus subsurface application benefits both farmers and the environment. Sustainable nutrient management requires redistribution of livestock manure from nutrient‐excess areas to nutrient‐deficit areas. Field experiments were conducted to assess agronomic (i.e., corn yield) and environmental (i.e., ammonia volatilization and surface nutrient loss) effects of different poultry litter application methods (surface vs. subsurface) and timings (fall vs. spring) in a potential manure‐importing region in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed in the United States. All four litter treatments (205 kg nitrogen ha −1 ) produced grain yields (10.9–12.8 Mg ha −1 ) nearly equivalent to or higher than the 11.5 Mg ha −1 yield expected from the same mineral nitrogen rate. Compared with surface application, subsurface application significantly reduced ammonia emission ( p &lt; 0.0001), runoff volume (fall: p = 0.02; spring: p = 0.004), and loads of nitrate nitrogen ( p &lt; 0.0001; p = 0.003) and dissolved phosphorus ( p &lt; 0.0001; p = 0.004) soon after application. Integrating subsurface manure application technologies into the manure redistribution programs would help ensure that the surplus nutrients being relocated provide a maximum agronomic impact and minimum environmental impact to the importing region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agriculture faces a dilemma with nitrogen (N)—it is often the most necessary external input to optimize production, several generations of farmers became accustomed to its relatively inexpensive cost, and it contributes to widespread pollution due to numerous loss pathways to the environment. However, standard N fertilizer recommendations have not accounted well enough for a key source via mineralizable soil N. Soil‐test biological activity (STBA) is strongly associated with mineralizable soil N, both of which become surface‐enriched with conservation agricultural management using soil health principles. A series of field experiments assessed the contribution of mineralizable soil N to the N supply needed to optimize corn ( Zea mays L.) grain and fall‐stockpiled tall fescue [ Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort.] production. This essay synthesizes how STBA along with cost‐to‐value threshold can be used to modify the N fertilizer factor to optimize economic return and avoid environmental degradation.",

Over a 3‐year period, we assessed the impacts of N application timing and cereal rye ( Secale cereale L.) cover crop on subsurface drainage NO 3 ‐N leaching and N 2 O emissions to quantify changes in total N loss and corresponding social and environmental damage costs under continuous corn ( Zea mays L.). While NO 3 ‐N losses were reduced by 37% with the combination of in‐season split N application and cereal rye cover crop relative to pre‐season N application, soil N 2 O emissions increased by 26%, highlighting a tradeoff between N loss pathways. As a result, total N losses and social and environmental damage costs from each system were not different. These results demonstrate the importance of addressing agricultural N pollution using a holistic framework accounting for the environmental and social risks of both NO 3 ‐N losses and N 2 O emissions.",

All mid‐Atlantic ditch bioreactors tested removed nitrate from drainage water. Practical concerns will require adjustments to design and installation. There is strong interest in adapting denitrifying bioreactors to mid‐Atlantic drainage systems to help address Chesapeake Bay water quality goals. Three ditch drainage‐oriented bioreactors were constructed in 2015 in Maryland to evaluate site‐specific design and installation concerns and nitrate (NO 3 –N) removal. All three bioreactor types removed NO 3 –N, as measured by load and/or concentration reduction, showing promise for denitrifying bioreactors in the mid‐Atlantic's low gradient Coastal Plain landscape. The ditch diversion bioreactor (25% NO 3 –N load reduction; 0.97 g NO 3 –N removed m −3 d −1 ) and the sawdust denitrification wall adjacent to a ditch (&gt;90% NO 3 –N concentration reduction; 1.9–2.9 g NO 3 –N removed m −3 d −1 ) had removal rates within range of the literature. The in‐ditch bioreactor averaged 65% NO 3 –N concentration reduction, but sedimentation is expected to be one of the biggest challenges.

Soil disturbance reduces plant‐residue cover and can leave bare soil susceptible to erosion, extreme temperature fluctuations, and increased evaporation. Under such conditions, establishing vegetation is difficult. To overcome these difficulties, managing disturbed lands by applying surface cover may be a good step toward soil reclamation. Hydromulch is often applied to stabilize soil after disturbance, but its influence on soil temperature and evaporation has not been described. This study assessed soil temperature over time and used the surface energy balance to quantify evaporation from bare soil (0×), and two rates of hydromulch application, 1× and 3× (by weight) of manufacturer's recommended rate. Diurnal temperature extremes were highest in the 0× and least in the 3×. Evaporation was highest in the 0× during the final 18 d of data collection and lowest in the 3×. These findings indicate that temperature fluctuations decrease and evaporation is reduced when hydromulch is applied to bare soil, suggesting it may aid in soil reclamation.",

Separate calibration equations exist for different cover crop types in fall and spring. Rapidly estimating CC‐N could facilitate management of N‐related services provided by cover crops. Cover crop (CC) biomass nitrogen content (CC‐N; kg ha −1 ) is related to a number of ecosystem services but is rarely measured by farmers and agronomists because of the expense of sampling and analysis. We hypothesized that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured by a handheld meter could predict CC‐N.

Spring biomass N was predicted with three separate calibrations for (i) cereal grain CCs, (ii) brassicas, and (iii) CCs consisting of pure legumes and grass–legume–brassica mixtures. Quality of the calibrations ranged from r 2 = 0.72 to r 2 = 0.87.

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Array GPR can be used to monitor infiltration into sand dune seamlessly. Array GPR enables sequentially acquired multi‐offset gather data. Array GPR data agree well with data measured independently with soil moisture sensors. Because an array ground penetrating radar (GPR) electrically switches any antenna combinations sequentially in milliseconds, both common‐offset gather (COG) and multi‐offset gather (MOG) data can be acquired almost seamlessly. The main objective of this study was therefore to determine if COG and MOG surveys by array GPR, which allows 110 different antenna combinations, could detect a wetting front during vertical field infiltration. An infiltration experiment was conducted in an experimental field inside Tottori Sand Dune, Japan. Time‐lapse radargrams of COG and MOG by array GPR clearly show the wetting front evolution with time. Reflection signals in MOG radargrams agree well with two‐way travel times predicted from dielectric constant observed independently with a soil moisture sensor. This study confirms the usefulness of array GPR for monitoring and quantifying the infiltration process in the field.",

Thirty‐eight soil samples were collected from five agricultural fields across the Animas watershed to develop and validate soil Fe prediction models. We used color space models to develop three different parameter sets for Fe prediction with Nix Pro. The different color space sets were used to develop three new predictive models for Nix Pro‐based Fe content against the lab‐based inductively coupled plasma analyzed Fe content. The model performances were assessed using the coefficient of determination, root mean square error, and model p ‐value. Three models (International Commission on Illumination's lightness, ±a axis (redness to greenness), and ± b axis (yellowness to blueness) [CIEL*a*b]; red, green, blue [RGB]; and cyan, magenta, yellow, key [black] [CMYK]) were significant in predicting the Fe content using colorimetric variables with R 2 ranging from 0.79 to 0.81. The mean square prediction error (MSPE) and Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) Index were calculated to validate models and CMYK was predicted to be a better model (MSPE = 0.13; KGE = 0.601) than CIEL*a*b and RGB models. The results suggest Nix Pro is useful in predicting soil Fe content.",

Despite containing appreciable nitrogen (N), ammonium phosphate fertilizers are generally considered P fertilizers. However, the approximately 8.5 million Mg N co‐applied with P annually as ammonium phosphate fertilizers represents 8% of global N fertilizer input flux to agroecosystems. Despite this, a systematic review of the literature revealed only one direct assessment of N losses from ammonium phosphate fertilizers. An additional five studies reported NO 3 ‐N leaching and N 2 O‐N emissions from soils fertilized with ammonium phosphates, but inadvertently as observations from failed or control treatments that are confounded (e.g., not accounting for non‐fertilizer contributions to N losses). The magnitude and fate of N co‐applied with P in ammonium phosphate fertilizers is a blind spot in agroecosystem N budgets and environmental footprints that necessitates quantification.",

Nitrate removal rates increased proportionally with dissolved organic C leaching. A previously reported experiment showed weekly drying–rewetting (DRW) cycles increase nitrate removal rates in woodchip‐based denitrifying bioreactors. A follow‐up experiment determined the effect of duration of unsaturated conditions on nitrate removal after rewetting. Three different levels of DRW duration were tested in a 105‐d column experiment ( n = 2), with woodchips left unsaturated once a week for either 2 h, 8 h, or 24 h. Increasing duration of unsaturated conditions significantly increased nitrate removal rates. The longest DRW duration of 24 h resulted in the greatest increase in nitrate removal rates, relative to constantly saturated woodchips, with mean rate increases reaching 172% by the end of the experiment. Results suggest nitrate removal in denitrifying bioreactors is carbon limited, with labile carbon made available during aerobic periods of DRW cycles the most likely cause of observed rate increases. Both studies show DRW cycles dramatically increase the nitrate removal efficiency of denitrifying bioreactors.",

A crystallization inhibitor allowed for 29 to 57% of salts to be harvested from the soil surface. Methods for surface extraction of salts can aid in expediting brine spill remediation timelines. Well drilling for energy resources innately produces brine waters. These brines often contain sodium in the 10,000 to &gt;100,000 mg L −1 range. In situ soil remediation of brine spills traditionally consists of diluting salts with organic materials and then infiltrating divalent cations. This leaching technique can require years to centuries, as a function of soil clay content, to remove salts from the root zone. We present a new in situ remediation method that extracts salts from the soil surface and expedites remediation. Surface application of a crystallization inhibitor (ferric hexacyanoferrate) to brine‐contaminated soils followed by an evaporative flux resulted in dendritic crystal growth above the soil surface. This process allowed easy harvest of 29 to 57% of salts within 7 d without mechanical disturbance to the soil. Future studies should include loading‐rate optimization, in‐field testing, evaluation of reaction product fate and transport, and identification of other amendments to rapidly extract salts.",

However, their effectiveness at decreasing phosphorus (P) loss has been mixed. This study investigated the effectiveness of a VBS and a forested riparian zone (FRZ) in decreasing P loss from pasture soils receiving swine manure and aimed to determine the potential factors controlling P release, using water extractable P (WEP) as a proxy for P loss. The inorganic WEP concentrations were significantly greater in the fertilized pasture zone soils than the VBS or FRZ soils. However, there was no significant difference between the field and riparian soils for total WEP due to increased contribution from organic WEP in these soils. Degree of P saturation, which is a function of soil test P, was a good predictor of inorganic WEP, but not organic WEP, where the variation in concentrations was better explained by variables involved in biotic P release.",

Higher‐order polynomial regressions do not result in more accurate forage estimates. The rising plate meter (RPM) provides rapid estimates of herbage mass (HM). Accurate calibration of the RPM is difficult due to variability in forage management, growth, and species composition. The RPM is typically calibrated by linear regression of HM and RPM height; however, the r 2 is usually low. Curvilinear regression, with the X intercept set to zero, could provide a more robust calibration equation and decrease variability in RPM estimates. Three Pennsylvania organic dairy farms grazing lactating dairy cattle on multispecies pastures were used to determine measured HM and estimated HM using a RPM. Removal of the X intercept increased the adjusted r 2 of all equations between 42.8 and 89.0%. Use of quadratic and cubic regression only resulted in 0.01 to 0.02 increase in adjusted r 2 . Linear regression remains the simplest and preferred method of calibration; however, error can be reduced by setting calibration equations so that zero RPM height is associated with zero HM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plants, such as sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ), have been shown to secrete root exudates involved in biological nitrification inhibition (BNI), an ability to suppress the conversion of ammonium to nitrate and thereby minimize its loss. Johnsongrass ( Sorghum halepense ), a weedy relative of cultivated sorghum, may also possess BNI potential, but little is known in this regard. Here, we conducted a field survey at seven different sites in Southeast Texas to determine this evolutionary trait of johnsongrass in different soil environments. It was found that johnsongrass rhizosphere retains high levels (&gt;60%) of ammonium within the total available N (ammonium + nitrate). Furthermore, the degree of ammonium retention by johnsongrass rhizosphere was significantly greater (up to 40%) in the roadside habitat compared to cultivated fields. The high ammonium retention potential by johnsongrass may explain, in part, their persistence and dominance, especially in marginal environments. Core Ideas Nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for plant growth, and nitrification causes loss of nitrogen. Ammonium retention was higher in roadside johnsongrass biotypes compared to that of cropland biotypes. The high rhizoshpheric ammonium retention by johnsongrass may explain, at least in part, its invasiveness. This trait could be further investigated and integrated into modern sorghum cultivars.",

Some potential roadblocks to creating a successful bio‐based circular economy from Louisiana's sugarcane by‐products are highlighted.

However, multiple methods are used for measuring aggregate stability, making it difficult to compare results and limiting universal interpretations in soil health assessment frameworks like Soil Health Assessment Protocol and Evaluation. We cross‐correlated three common water‐stable aggregate methods (WSA CASH , WSA ARS , and WSA SLAKES ) using a dataset of nearly 1400 samples and developed pedotransfer functions using random forest models to evaluate method performance. We found that the WSA ARS and WSA CASH methods can be reasonably cross correlated through pedotransfer functions because they use similar processes for estimating aggregate strength. Conversely, the WSA ARS and WSA SLAKES methods are not transferable. We suggest that the WSA ARS aggregate stability method is the most established and best reference method for use in soil health analysis frameworks. Interpretation consistency will lead to more robust comparisons of aggregate stability as a key physical soil health indicator.

To determine whether CCs result in a net positive balance between N fertilization and crop utilization, we used US field trial data comparing corn systems with and without CCs, and estimated the amount of N fertilizer that CCs would replace and lead to equivalent grain yields under both systems. Overall, applying lower nitrogen rates to corn without cover crops resulted in similar or higher yields when legumes were used as cover crops (indicating positive nitrogen replacement in the amount of 62 kg ha −1 ), but lower yields when grasses were used as cover crops (indicating negative nitrogen replacement in the amount of 24 kg ha −1 ). Our results illustrate the benefits and trade‐offs of integrating single CC species into a corn system, that is, reducing N inputs with legume CCs or supplementing N fertilizer to avoid possible grain yield penalties in the case of grass CCs. Quantifying the N replacement value of CCs would facilitate field‐level recommendations and policy regulations aimed at promoting sustainable corn production in the United States. Core Ideas Managing N fertilizer rates is essential for maximizing the benefits of legume and grass cover crops in corn‐based systems. N fertilizer replacement of grass and legume cover crops was assessed based on data from field experiments in the United States. Legume cover crops were found to positively replace N fertilizer; potentially reducing corn N inputs. Grass cover crops were found to negatively replace N fertilizer; potentially requiring supplementary fertilizer to reduce corn yield penalties.",

A decision‐support tool was developed to quantify environmental and economic impacts of TG. Greatest C equivalent emission reductions and cost savings occurred with Cotton‐Only scenario. TG was profitable for operations evaluated and led to C equivalent emissions reductions. This tool may improve agricultural sustainability and enhance technology adoption. Tractor guidance technology allows for more spatially precise input applications, which leads to efficiency gains that are difficult to quantify at the systems level. A decision‐support tool, Tractor Guidance Analysis (TGA), was developed to quantify carbon equivalent (CE) emission reductions associated with this technology for three scenarios (500 ha each): (i) cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), (ii) soybean [ Glycine max (L.)

Nationwide, a substantial amount of resources has been targeted toward improving water quality, particularly focused on nonpoint‐source pollution. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between nutrient concentrations observed during baseflow and runoff conditions from 56 sites across five watersheds in Arkansas. Baseflow and stormflow concentrations for each site were summarized using geometric mean and then evaluated for directional association. A significant, positive correlation was found for NO 3 –N, total N, soluble reactive P, and total P, indicating that sites with high baseflow concentrations also had elevated runoff concentrations. Those landscape factors that influence nutrient concentrations in streams also likely result in increased runoff, suggesting that high baseflow concentrations may reflect elevated loads from the watershed.

It needs a calibration equation to convert its measurement to a prediction of forage mass, and predictions can vary across crops, seasons, and locations. Our research objective was to derive new calibration equations for wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and rye ( Secale cereale L.). Most past literature used a linear model, but recent literature has suggested that using a quadratic model without an intercept could improve predictions. A non‐nested test was used to test among these two non‐nested models for wheat and rye calibration equations. The results favored the more encompassing model of a quadratic with an intercept; however, with wheat the quadratic with no intercept was not rejected. A pooling test indicated different equations were needed for species, seasonality (winter and non‐winter), and tillage type (tilled or no‐till).",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Production‐scale conservation tillage systems had few effects on crop yields. Strip till had the least costs per hectare and may be more economical for farmers. Tillage affected only fungi/bacteria ratios out of 19 soil properties. Farmers’ presumed yield losses among tillage systems did not reflect actual yields. In the US upper Midwest, the narrow growing season causes many farmers to presume yield losses when reducing tillage. The purpose of this study was to determine how four production‐scale tillage systems affected residue cover, stand populations, crop yields, and soil chemical, biological, and physical properties. Tillage systems (chisel plow, fall strip‐till with shanks, spring strip‐till with coulters, and shallow vertical till) were continued for 4 yr. Tillage effects within a site were few and mixed (0.17–0.36 Mg ha −1 difference), whereas site effects were common (0.50–3.00 Mg ha −1 difference). Among 19 soil properties, only fungal/bacteria ratios differed among strip‐till with shanks (0.078) and strip‐till with coulters (0.066) at one site. Our results suggest that many farmers’ concerns about using conservation tillage practices do not necessarily translate into yield losses when compared to standard chisel plow practices. Economics and the level of erosion control among the tillage practices compared here, rather than yield alone, should guide farmer preferences.",

A new precision sprayer with a dual tank/boom system can apply two herbicides simultaneously through separate nozzles, potentially reducing chemical antagonism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the interaction of QPE + 2,4‐D choline applied via single tank or dual tank/boom system for controlling glufosinate/glyphosate‐resistant corn volunteers in Enlist corn. Bin‐run glufosinate/glyphosate‐resistant corn was planted at 54,000 seeds ha −1 to mimic corn volunteers. At 14 days after application (DAA), the dual tank/boom application of QPE (39 g a.i. ha −1 ) and 2,4‐D choline (1064 g a.e. ha −1 ) achieved 85% volunteer corn control, compared to 70% control with single tank mix. The single tank application of QPE + 2,4‐D choline was 7%–26% antagonistic until 28 DAA. Conversely, dual tank application of QPE and 2,4‐D choline was additive. Although dual tank application of QPE and 2,4‐D choline did not have transient antagonism (14 DAA), it was otherwise eliminated by 28 DAA using the higher rate of QPE (77 g a.i. ha −1 ) in the tank mix. By 28 DAA, volunteer corn control was ≥92% across all treatments, with similar corn yield and no crop injury. The results suggest that a dual tank/boom system provided better volunteer corn control at 14 DAA; however, control was similar when using a higher rate of QPE (77 g a.i. ha −1 ) with 2,4‐D choline in tank mix at 28 DAA.",

However, early LTEs commonly lack treatment randomization, replication, and initial measurements of SOC. This creates a potential problem of unmeasured confounding. We address this problem using the Morrow Plots (established 1876) as a case study. We start with a standard mixed effects model of SOC and add (i) a spatial kriging component and (ii) SOC measurements in the sod perimeter of the experiment as an additional treatment level. We find that much of the observed SOC variation between treatments after 145 years is not due to treatments but other factors (e.g. initial SOC), attenuating treatment effects by about 50%. Our study demonstrates that creative measurement and innovative modeling can mitigate some deficiencies in early LTEs. However, our improved estimates still have limited precision, suggesting the importance of careful design and measurement in the first place.",

Annual DRP loading from 41 fields categorized into low/medium (&lt;75 mg kg −1 ), high (75–150 mg kg −1 ), and very high (&gt;300 mg kg −1 ) STP were upscaled using three scenarios (i.e., 5%, 10%, and 20% of fields contained STP &gt; 75 mg kg −1 ).

Assuming 5% of the WLEB had STP &gt; 75 mg kg −1 , the contribution reduced to 17% (±5%).

Moreover, peer‐reviewed literature and regulatory legislation utilize “biostimulants” while industry and farmers have recently adopted the term “biologicals,” confusing discussions related to product regulation and policy. To better understand the challenges associated with this input sector, we have focused on four critical aspects: (1) the current regulatory status, (2) terminology disparity of biostimulants and biologicals, (3) key attributes that distinguish microorganisms from non‐living biostimulants, and (4) mechanism of action differences between plant growth‐promoting microorganisms and plant growth regulators. Therefore, we propose that living beneficial microorganisms and non‐living biostimulants be separated with distinct regulatory requirements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microplastics are contaminants of global concern that are primarily studied in marine and urban environments. Understanding of microplastics in drained agricultural watersheds is lacking. We aimed to evaluate microplastics in ditch and tile drainage water through periodic sampling. Water samples were filtered to capture particulates that were digested to remove organics, then stained and evaluated using fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. Further, we compared and contrasted microplastic abundance, the current reporting standard, with microplastic mass concentration, often unreported, to determine the most accurate assessment. Open‐ditch drainage had greater microplastic contamination than drainpipe outlets. Agricultural drainage contained 2–6 orders of magnitude less mass concentrations of microplastics than sampled urban surface waters and laundry graywater. However, when evaluated by abundance, the difference was not apparent. These findings improve our understanding of microplastics in agricultural watersheds and demonstrate the importance of evaluating microplastic contamination based on mass concentrations for accurate assessments. Core Ideas Mass concentration (ng/L) is a better predictor of microplastic contamination than abundance (counts/L). Agricultural drainage water had lower microplastic mass concentrations than surface water or laundry graywater. Open‐ditch drainage had greater microplastic contamination than drainpipe outlets. Mass of microplastic pieces from smallest to largest: drainage water &lt; river water &lt; lake water = laundry water.",

The abundance of canopy‐dwelling arthropods among OWB, OWB–alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.), alfalfa, and native grass pastures was compared by sweep‐net sampling over 3 yr (2014–2016). Forty‐six families of nine insect orders and a single family of spider (Araneae: Araneidae) were identified. Among total individuals, 85% were insects and 15% were spiders. Housefly ( Musca spp., Diptera: Muscidae), potato leafhopper ( Empoasca spp., Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), lygus bug ( Lygus hesperus , Hemiptera: Miridae), and spur‐throated grasshopper ( Melanoplus spp., Orthoptera: Acrididae) were other abundant taxa. Among the insects collected, spur‐throated grasshoppers were the most abundant, comprising 12% of total taxa. Alfalfa hosted the greatest number of total insects, including pests such as potato leafhopper and lygus bug. Lower abundances of pestiferous insects were found in OWB while still hosting greater abundances of some arthropods of ecological significance such as spider and ladybird beetle ( Hippodamia spp., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).",

We applied fertilizer with a wheel spreader and herbicides with a boom sprayer on six and four fields, respectively, with and without TG. This study developed novel postprocessing methodology to calculate spatial coverage efficiency from TG systems. Overlap and gap estimation was implemented using the individual pass polygon method (IPPM). We propose a correction factor to adjust biased estimation of overlap area by IPPM. Results from IPPM suggest TG systems reduced overlaps (up to 6% of field area) and gaps (up to 16%) during field operations and improved overall efficiency up to 20%. Consequently, TG systems lead to reduced input use and in‐field operation time, as well as improved equipment efficiency, leading to potential economic and environmental savings for small‐scale producers.",

To gauge the use of p NA substrates to assay soil aminopeptidases, a systematic literature review was conducted. We identified 61 studies that were nearly all limited to measuring leucine and/or glycine aminopeptidases, despite the commercial availability of at least six other aminopeptidase‐specific p NA substrates. Assay parameters of scale (slurry vs. direct incubations), matrix type, buffer pH, substrate concentration, assay duration and temperature, termination, and colorimetry indicated a lack of standardization and a confusion of p NA with p NP substrates despite important differences in abiotic hydrolysis and absorbance maxima. Future studies should systematically evaluate and standardize these parameters and assess the sensitivity of other amino acid‐specific aminopeptidases to carbon (C), N, and sulfur (S) cycling.",

This study investigated time‐dependent environmental releases of fenclorim from rice seeds treated with the safener and insecticide with five different treatments. The treatment with fenclorim alone caused the greatest fenclorim releases from the seed, and the release magnitude was similar to the treatment that had fenclorim and insecticide in mixture. The fenclorim release was the least when treated with safener and insecticide in sequence. Based on the previous literatures, all fenclorim release magnitudes observed in this study were at toxicologically safe levels for various living organisms in the soil, and fenclorim residues determined in the final rice harvest were also safe levels below the instrumentally detectable level. Core Ideas Seed treatment with safener alone causes the largest fenclorim release to environments. Seed treatment with safener and insecticide in sequence minimizes fenclorim releases. Fenclorim residues in the final rice harvest were below the detectable level. The fenclorim used will not cause residual issues in the ecosystem and harvested rice.",

The objective is to identify factors influencing P management and evaluate differences between P‐overapplying and non‐overapplying farmers. Overapplication is based on self‐reported P use and soil P levels, and differences are tested using chi‐square tests. Results show significant differences in attitudes, perceptions, and management practices between the two groups. Overapplying farmers express greater concern about nutrient runoff, suggesting they may be receptive to interventions. This study emphasizes the need to address P overapplication and improve information dissemination through agricultural consultants, soil testing laboratories, and extension services, as 55% of farmers reported not receiving recent information on P yield response. Core Ideas Farmer attitudes and perceptions are critical factors influencing management practice adoption. Self‐reported survey data for 1650 corn farmers in Michigan reveal phosphorus (P) fertilizer overapplication. Farmers that overapply P fertilizer have different attitudes than other farmers.

Penetration resistance was measured across the 0–45.7 cm profile using both profile‐level and depth‐stratified analyses. Among the biological treatments, the sudangrass‐based mix achieved the greatest compaction alleviation, particularly at the site with higher initial severity. At the northern site (Health Hero [HH] Farm), this mix produced significantly lower median penetration resistance (1.59 MPa) and a narrower interquartile range (0.93 MPa) than other treatments, indicating more uniform soil improvement. At the southern site (Philo Ridge [PR] Farm), keyline plowing resulted in the lowest median resistance (1.41 MPa) but showed greater variability across replicates. Depth‐wise trends revealed that biological mixes, particularly the sudangrass‐based mix, provided consistent alleviation across soil layers. These findings highlight the value of biologically tailored strategies not only for reducing compaction but also for achieving spatially uniform soil structure recovery. Tailoring species composition to compaction depth offers a practical and lower disturbance alternative to mechanical tillage for improving pasture systems.",

Predicting soil P loss after ceasing biosolids application remains challenging. In a laboratory experiment, 80 leaching events were applied to sandy soils with biosolids application histories from active use to 15 years post‐application. Soils with recent applications showed an early peak in P release that later stabilized, while those with legacy applications exhibited lower but more consistent P release. These results suggest that fresh biosolids contained a highly mobile P fraction that depletes over time, leaving behind more fixed P that may persist for decades. These P release trajectories could be reasonably modeled by two‐pool exponential decay models. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of biosolids aging in regulating P dynamics and identify the hot moments in P loss in biosolids‐impacted systems.",

Water availability for agriculture depends on winter precipitation; however, a more even distribution of precipitation throughout the year would better support agricultural planning and management. We examine the occurrence, frequency, and trends of dry spells in Central Chile (32°–40° S) as a proxy for changes in the timing of dry‐wet seasons, using a gridded daily precipitation dataset spanning the period from 1960 to 2021. Our results indicate a significant increase in dry spells (+1 event/decade), but shorter (−2 days/event), and a significant decrease in precipitation per wet spell (−2 mm/event/decade). Findings suggest that changes in dry spells should also be considered in planning and policy, as some regions may be experiencing water shortages due to shifts in timing and access, rather than simply having less water.

Actual impacted land area may range up to 30%, resulting in a range of US$0 to $1.76 billion of actual costs. Precise large‐scale, deep‐compaction reports/sensing is needed to determine actual fractions of impacted land. Policies incentivizing conservation practices to reduce the occurrence of field traffic on wet soils are strongly encouraged.",

Farmers rely heavily on applied chemicals to suppress many of the economically important pests present in peanut. The effectiveness of this approach to pest management may not be sustainable, however, due to evolved resistance in pests to chemicals, reluctance of basic chemical manufacturers to invest in product development because of the relatively small market for peanut compared with other crops, cost to initially register or re‐register chemicals, and the desire for peanut buyers and processors to capture international markets that may have varying agrochemical residue restrictions for peanut. Heavy reliance on chemical control could leave peanut production systems vulnerable to yield loss; thus, a more concerted research effort is needed to increase the number and availability of nonchemical tools that protect peanut from pests in order to ensure long‐term sustainability of peanut production systems.",

The standard POXC protocol calls for air‐dried soil samples, but commercial laboratories typically dry samples in a forced‐air oven before routine analysis. In order to evaluate if heat would change POXC measurements, we treated soil (52 silty clay loam and 51 sandy loam samples) with oven drying at 45 and 65 °C and compared their POXC values with those from air‐dried samples. We also examined relationships between POXC values and soil organic matter, pH, and electrical conductivity across drying treatments. Drying soil did not substantially change POXC values for either soil texture and did not change the relationships between POXC and other measured soil properties. This work suggests that commercial laboratories could perform POXC analysis on soil samples dried using heat.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cover crops are promoted by agronomists and governments due to their on‐farm and off‐farm benefits. Incentive programs were created because high planting costs have hindered cover crop adoption in the United States. Crop insurance discount programs are novel incentives that subsidize farmers’ crop insurance premiums by $5 per acre ($12.36 ha −1 ) on cover cropped land. While this payment is smaller than those typically offered through the Natural Resources Conservation Service and state‐level cost‐share programs, crop insurance discount programs have the potential to reach a significant proportion of farmers who purchase crop insurance. This paper uses data from a survey of Iowa farmers to quantify whether participation in the Iowa Crop Insurance Discount Program (ICIDP) affects the area planted to cover crops. I find that 11% of the ICIDP area would not have been planted to cover crops in the absence of the program, which is similar to other programs after considering the lower payment rate.",

For incorporation into nutrient management decisions, ppm‐based concentrations have to be converted into pounds per acre, and a conversion factor (multiplier) of 2.0 is typically recommended universally to do so. However, this conversion factor stems from an assumed value of bulk density ( ρ b ) corresponding to silt loam soil and is invariant to any deviation beyond assumed ρ b . Here, we quantify and evaluate the potential ramifications of assuming a constant ρ b value on calculating soil nitrogen credits. A true dynamic conversion factor that is sensitive to variation in ρ b ranges between 1.28 and 2.68 for soils across US cropland. Failure to account for this dynamic conversion factor was shown to result in an underestimation of soil N credits by up to 40%. In addition to spatial variation, management‐induced changes in ρ b are also important to incorporate into the conversion factor.",

The HV and NT treatments exhibited higher growing season soil oxygen availability ( p &lt; 0.05) and experienced three to four times fewer hours of oxygen limitation (i.e., oxygen concentration &lt;10%) as compared to no cover crop (NC) and conventional tillage (CT) treatments.

This study investigated how DOM extracted from crop residues, animal manures, and compost affected P adsorption onto iron (oxy)hydroxide (FeOOH) and its bioavailability using a plant bioassay.

However, the pre‐adsorbed DOM treatment did not significantly affect P uptake by tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum L. ‘German Johnson’) plants in a 5‐wk agar‐culture bioassay. The results of these laboratory‐based studies suggest that the initial DOM leached from C‐rich soil amendments such as crop residues and animal manures is unlikely to affect soil P bioavailability because orthophosphate forms strong inner‐sphere bonds to the FeOOH and this DOM fraction does not.",

We used long‐term (30+ yr) atmospheric and watershed data from a USDA experimental watershed to investigate whether daily agricultural practices masked the declining sulfur (as sulfate‐sulfur) trends seen in mainly forested watersheds. Over the study period, atmospheric wet deposition of sulfate‐sulfur decreased 75% while sulfate‐sulfur at the watershed decreased by approximately 30%. While the deposition of sulfur is detrimental to stream quality, the reduction of sulfur deposition in recent years has caused many soils in the watershed to develop sulfur deficiencies.

Although our limited sample size prevented a meaningful statistical evaluation, we found that bees from urbanized areas had higher THg than those from rural areas, with suburban samples intermediate. The MeHg concentrations in all samples were below the detection limit. Despite its limited scope, this first preliminary dataset on Hg levels in honey bees across the United States suggests that urbanization may play a role in increasing Hg exposure to these pollinators, and that honey bees may be a useful biomonitor of the environmental presence of chemical pollutants.",

The goal of this letter is to describe experimental design strategies and modeling approaches to create PGR models for different PGRs, application rates, and turf species. Results from testing the models indicate that clipping yield should be measured until the growth response has diminished. This is in contrast to reapplication of a PGR at preselected intervals. During modeling, inclusion of an amplitude‐dampening coefficient in the sinewave model allows the PGR effect to dissipate with time.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Nutrient concentrations are low at Big Creek relative to expected biological‐response thresholds. Nutrient concentrations at Big Creek are typical of streams draining watersheds with similar land use. Flow‐adjusted nutrient concentrations at Big Creek have not increased over the short‐term. Nutrient concentrations in streams increase as watershed land area in pasture and urban uses increases. Nutrient concentrations in several streams of the Boston and Ozark Mountains region of Arkansas, including the Buffalo National River and its tributaries, have garnered tremendous interest. In particular, Big Creek has been the center of attention within the Buffalo River watershed because of a permitted concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO). The objectives of this paper were to put nutrient concentrations of Big Creek into the context of the stream nutrient and watershed land‐use relationship and develop a framework to evaluate regional land‐use impacts on regional water quality. Nutrient concentrations in streams draining the Boston and Ozark Mountains region were related to the intensity of watershed land use. Concentrations in Big Creek were similar to other watersheds in the ecoregion with similar land use, suggesting limited impact of the CAFO on Big Creek at the present time. However, this does not preclude future impacts, and longer‐term monitoring continues.",

    "abstract": "McGowen et al. (2018) recently reported a gas chromatograph (GC) method for soil CO2 respiration, claiming advantages in time, labor, and precision compared with Solvita (Woods End Laboratories), a commercial soil respiration method. Herein we address core ideas that we find insufficiently supported and outline gaps in their description of methods. When two methods are compared, circular reasoning is invoked, and therefore it is ideal to have additional method comparisons. We applaud the fact that the authors agreed and provided our team the same set of refrigerated soils from which their conclusions were drawn. We performed several respiration tests, including Solvita and three differing infrared gas analyzers (IRGA). Two methods may be considered equivalent when the r2 is high, slope approaches 1.0, and the intercept is close to zero. The authors demonstrated significant correlation between GC and Solvita (r2 = 0.73). However, the slope was very low (0.226); thus, their GC method measured CO2 significantly lower than Solvita. We found that their GC method also gave much lower results compared with IRGA methods. Moreover, when we compared a LiCor 7000 CO2 IRGA to Solvita, we obtained a slope of 1.05 at a zero intercept (r2 = 0.887)—essentially, a perfect correspondence. We corroborated Solvita's accuracy by the new IRTH method, embedding an infrared sensor inside a Solvita jar during the test, resulting in r2 = 0.92 and a slope of 0.945. Incidentally, this confirms earlier work by Chitraker et al. (2006) showing a linear range of detection for Solvita compared with calibration gases from 0 to 3% CO2 (r2 = 0.99). In Table 1, we show several of the comparisons we made with the respective r2 values and slopes (intercepts adjusted to zero). We question the time advantage claimed for GC over Solvita. Both methods require similar setup and incubation. The authors report GC requires 8 min per test (McGowen et al., 2018). The Solvita digital reader enables four samples per minute, including labor. Recognizing GC autosamplers as generally labor saving, it is still difficult to comprehend how the GC method will ever allow the high-throughput per day for which Solvita is designed. We ran all our trials in similar-sized 475-mL jars, which is very common for IRGA soil methods. We obtained the best data with the 475-mL jars as compared to the 265-mL jars commonly used for Solvita. Increasing jar size would address the concerns raised in the original paper about oversaturation of Solvita at higher values (presumably >3% CO2). Larger jars dilute the CO2 concentration to be within an acceptable range. This is likely to eliminate or minimize the need for dilution and sample rerun with the Solvita method, which may have been part of the authors' calculation regarding time disadvantages. We had difficulty understanding the authors' reported free air space in GC vials, an important number since CO2 mass is calculated via the Ideal Gas Law. Normally, airspace is jar volume minus soil volume corrected for particle density. The authors refer to headspace as 0.015 L (vials were 0.020 L), suggesting that their 5-g soil sample equated to 5 mL, which would skew calculations. The authors indicated difficulty rewetting soils for respiration, which may explain differences comparing Solvita results. Presently, 50% water-filled pore space is favored over a blanket addition of water. Brinton and Burger (2015) reported the need for this new wetting protocol to avoid respiration suppression caused by the Haney method (Haney and Haney, 2010), which was discontinued in 2016 (Solvita, 2016). A factor that may influence the amount of CO2 determined after dried soil is rewetted is the ratio of headspace volume to soil in jars or tubes used. We are skeptical that micro-methods can be made reliable for soil respiration. We speculate that the miniaturized GC method is problematic, possibly because the small quantity of soil is difficult to moisten properly or because aerobic respiratory suppression occurs. Using our own data, we calculated that with the authors' jar configuration, CO2 concentrations as high as 7.75% of headspace may have resulted, whereas the GC was calibrated only to 40,270 μL L−1 CO2. A semiautomatic respiration method has been reported using a IR CO2 alarm detector limited to 0 to 2% CO2 (Haney et al., 2018), which presumably must be dealt with similarly by increasing jar size, reducing soil quantity, or recalibrating beyond the design specifications for the instrument with potential loss of resolution. Therefore, issues of accuracy related to calibration and design limits of instrumentation are a common feature for all methods of measuring soil respiration. We commend Oklahoma State University for the choice of soils in this study representing a wide range of respiratory activity, ideal for method comparisons, and for offering insight into soil health. The authors' team selected nine regions with paired comparisons of tilled and no-till farms. Our ANOVA analysis showed that all methods differentiated no-till versus conventional at a high degree of statistical significance. This implies that all these soil respiration tests do illuminate real differences in soil health. The path to method improvement will undoubtedly be never-ending; however, we should not lose sight of the enduring importance of distinguishing management impacts on soil health.",

Swine manure did not increase nitrous oxide compared with synthetic fertilizer. Manure application method and conditions dictate yield and environmental impacts. Swine manure has potential for reuse as fertilizer on cropland and pastureland. Currently, producers may be hesitant to land apply swine manure because information regarding the impacts to crop production and environmental quality has been inconsistent. The objective of this research was to synthesize the literature investigating impacts of swine manure application on crop yield and soil nitrous oxide emissions as compared to synthetic fertilizer. Overall, the meta‐analysis of 39 studies shows that swine manure does not affect either crop yield or nitrous oxide emissions. However, a moderator analysis indicated that crop yield using manure fertilizer may be adversely affected in fine‐textured soils or when applied to the soil surface. While these results suggest that swine manure may be safely applied as fertilizer, producers should still be cautious with how manure is applied to capture its N value without yield losses or detrimental effects to environmental quality.",

Results presented demonstrate that there was no significant difference in overall N removal rates from these column bioreactors as a function of flow direction. There was the suggestion of lower N 2 O production in the downflow direction, although this was not statistically significant due to the high variability of the N 2 O production observed in the upflow direction.

Although the actual minimum costs vary situationally and regionally, mowing golf putting greens optimally requires about US$34 per acre per month, whereas other turfgrass areas cost less than US$11 per acre per growing month. Fertilizer applications to turfgrass cost US$22 or less per acre per growing month.

There was a significant exponential relationship between the Shannon index of cultivar diversity and the number of hybrid cultivars and the total number of cultivars across the 10 provinces and the two 5‐yr periods.

Soil health was positively correlated with protein and oil content, but the relationship was rather weak. Soil health accounted for up to 13% of the variability in protein ( p &lt; .001) and between 2 and 17% in oil content ( p &lt; .1) depending on soil map unit.

Soil chemical and physical properties were little affected by long‐term tillage and N fertilization. The lack of tillage to distribute soil phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) nutrients within no‐till treatments resulted in lower P and K values below the surface. In no‐till, the accumulation of organic matter in the surface soil (0 to 7.5 cm) was countered by lower organic matter in the 7.5‐ to 15 ‐cm zone, resulting in no net increase compared with the other two tillage systems.

Urea fertilizer amended by biological inhibitors was foliarly applied to turfgrass. Flux chambers were used to measure NH 3 volatilization over 24 hours.

Low cost, high N content, and favorable handling characteristics of urea fertilizer (46–0–0) make its use common in turfgrass management.

No significant differences in fiber quality were observed among the irrigation treatments. In addition, reducing irrigation application improved the IWUE of lint and seed by 9 and 8%, respectively. Based on these findings, reducing groundwater extraction by 25% appears to be an effective strategy to achieve water conservation while limiting negative impacts on yield quantity and quality for cotton production in west‐central Oklahoma.",

We compared manure storage in environmental and economic model outputs. Introducing 6 mo of storage on a PA dairy farm decreased whole‐farm NUE without manure injection. Manure injection and 6 mo of storage gave the best combination of profit and environmental outcome. Application of livestock manure to farm soils represents a priority nutrient management concern in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Historically, strong emphasis has been placed on adding manure storage to dairy operations, with the recognition that manure application methods can be improved. The Integrated Farm System Model was used to simulate manure management on a typical Pennsylvania dairy farm (100 milking cows, 80 ha). Converting the operation from daily haul to 6 mo of storage with broadcast application did not substantially change nitrogen (N) losses to the environment. However, switching to manure injection conserved ammonium N and improved manure N use efficiency by crops, even though it increased N leaching by 27% with 6‐mo storage and 13% with 12‐mo storage. Increasing manure storage from 6 to 12 mo with manure injection reduced nitrate N leaching by 38%, due to better timing of manure application to crop growth, but lowered annual net returns. Overall, manure injection and 6 mo of storage resulted in the best combination of profit and environmental outcome.",

Emerging needs for spatiotemporally dynamic θ FC and θ PWP are difficult to achieve with lab determinations. Therefore, we used long‐term data from 182 sites across the United States to evaluate whether soil moisture extremes defined by 95th and 5th percentiles represent θ FC and θ PWP , respectively. Soil moisture extremes and lab‐measured θ FC and θ PWP were well correlated ( R 2 = 0.71−0.92), however, both 95th and 5th percentiles overestimated θ FC and θ PWP at most depths (RMSE = 6%–16% vwc). Percentiles of soil moisture distribution that corresponded to lab‐determined θ FC and θ PWP varied widely and were a function of precipitation received at the site and site‐ and soil‐depth specific clay content. These findings imply that while θ FC and θ PWP may not be broadly represented by soil moisture extremes (95th and 5th percentiles), there may be potential to statistically infer the positioning of θ FC and θ PWP within long‐term soil moisture distributions using biophysical determinants such as aridity and soil characteristics.",

If adopted on registered product labels, it enables a prospective registrant to meet more stringent ESA criteria for registration, even during non‐ESA‐issued interim decisions. This paper identifies and evaluates complexities posed by the mitigation menu approach that could undermine good intentions underlying this new process and uses existing economic considerations to analyze positive and negative externalities. Several points of complexity demonstrate how the mitigation menu approach would benefit from further regulatory development or refinement. Changes should be informed by fundamental questions about the dynamics between landowners and land managers and, crucially, different motivations decision‐makers face in adopting voluntary versus regulatory mitigations.",

Nitrogen was depleted relative to C and P at two sites on the agricultural ditch during extreme low‐flow conditions, whereas P was depleted to C and N at the third. Tile drainage N and P losses during high flows shifted stoichiometry toward the Redfield ratio.

This method may expedite remediation of brine‐impacted soils with shallow water tables. Accidental releases of brine, derived from oil and gas development, in the Williston Basin in North America have become frequent in recent years. Oil‐field brines are primarily composed of sodium chloride and exhibit electrical conductivities exceeding 200 dS m −1 and total dissolved solids exceeding 250 g L −1 . Current in situ remediation strategies involve the incorporation of divalent‐cation rich amendments to displace and then rain and irrigation to leach sodium out of the soil profile. These methods in semiarid climates, where the evaporative demand exceeds precipitation, often achieves limited results. This study assessed the effectiveness of remediating brine‐contamination by “wicking” salts from the soil surface when a shallow water table is present. During a 5‐wk period, two engineered paper‐based humidifier wicks and two nonengineered wicks (wheat straw and hydraulic mulch) placed on the surface of brine‐contaminated soils reduced the total soil Na concentrations by 65 to 88% and 5 to 80%, respectively. Our results indicate that deployment of engineered wicks or similar, more cost effective materials may be an effective in situ remediation strategy that merits further field‐scale investigation.",

Soil organic matter showed a significant decrease after the burn as a result of fuel combustion. However, a significant increase in soil fungal and bacterial communities in postburn samples was observed, possibly resulting from higher P, N, and micronutrient availability in the soil after burning. Our study indicates that culturable soil microbes can respond to even small and undetectable soil chemical changes. This case study suggests that fast‐growing soil microbes respond more rapidly than chemical properties to a prescribed burn and may have an impact on recovering of native vegetation communities.",

In order to minimize competition with food production, it has been suggested that bioenergy crops could be directed to land areas less suitable for commodity crops, commonly referred to as “marginal” lands. These are land units with inherent limitations to vegetative growth and production, which may be due to several factors (soil physical and chemical properties, climatic conditions, etc.). However the term “marginal” is an adjective with imprecise meaning, and objective criteria for determining “marginal” lands for siting bioenergy crops are necessary. Here we propose that such criteria may be based on soil survey classifications and realistic yield estimates, and we show an example of its use to justify site selection for bioenergy crops in different regions of North Carolina.",

A differential equation is solved for the small flow that is exhausted. The system allowed using linear fit to mixing ratio versus chamber closure time. V eff increased by 7% due to GHG adsorption and 4% due to soil porosity. We present a method of simultaneously measuring soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes using a laser‐based cavity ring‐down spectrometer (CRDS) coupled to an automated non‐steady‐state chamber system. The differential equation describing the change in the greenhouse gas (GHG) mixing ratio in the chamber headspace following lid closure is solved for the condition when a small flow rate of chamber headspace air is pulled through the CRDS by an external pump and exhausted to the atmosphere. The small flow rate allows calculation of fluxes assuming linear relationships between the GHG mixing ratios and chamber lid closure times of a few minutes. We also calibrated the chambers for effective volume ( V eff ) and show that adsorption of the GHGs on the walls of the chamber caused V eff to be 7% higher than the geometric volume, with the near‐surface soil porosity causing another 4% increase in V eff .",

Water treatment residuals decrease P release rates, providing a potential mitigation option. The growing concern over phosphorus (P) and water quality has led to questions as to where the loads originate and how to control landscape inputs from the watershed. We collected soil cores from two locations in the Illinois River watershed to examine the relationship between stored soil P and the amount of soluble reactive P (SRP) released into the water when soils are flooded. After inundation, P flux calculations for durations of ∼24 h ranged from less than 0.1 to 9.3 mg SRP m −2 h −1 . Soil test P (STP), measured as water‐extractable P and Mehlich‐III P, correlated with SRP flux, where higher STP resulted in increased P flux to the overlying water. Floodplain soils have the potential to be a P source, potentially releasing more than 1600 mg m −2 yr −1 (&gt;16 kg ha −1 yr −1 ) depending on length and frequency of inundation and on STP content. Applying water treatment residuals (WTRs) significantly reduced P flux from the cores. Hence, WTR application to critical source areas provides a mitigation strategy to manage floodplain soils and potential SRP release.",

Residue particle composition and decomposition influence soil properties, i.e., soil C and N. Mechanical harvesting operations affect soil properties via residue size distributions. Field operations may differentially influence crop residue size distributions, altering residue decomposition rates and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics. In a laboratory microcosm study modeling corn residue distributions observed in a no‐till cropping system, microbial respiration was initially (first 30 d) inversely proportional to residue particle size across four size classes. Subsequently (30–60 d), respiration in the smallest particle size decreased in relation to the larger size classes. Residue particle size significantly increased soil C levels, with the smallest sizes producing the longest‐lasting effects (150 d). Smaller residue size classes initially (30 d) immobilized more soil N compared with larger size classes; however, at 150 d, the smaller size classes had mobilized increasing amounts of N while the larger size classes had progressively immobilized more N. We conclude that crop residue management operations changed characteristic residue size distributions that moderate decomposition activities and result in unique soil C and N dynamics, possibly influencing soil properties, including nutrient availability.",

Range parameters were consistently smaller when cover crops were planted (20–25 m less) and tillage area and/or intensity was reduced (12–27 m less) compared with no cover crop and chisel plowing, respectively, except in a clayey Vertisol. Nugget and sill parameters did not have consistent trends across soil management practices or sites. These data, although brief and preliminary in scope, provide clear proof of concept that spatial pattern shifts can be clearly detected in newly imposed soil‐management systems even though differences in SWC means are not always evident.",

Microfluidics and automated sensing enhance tracking of N cycle intermediates and products. Model microfabricated systems offer greater control of microbial habitat conditions. Multiple approaches can achieve parallel quantification of N cycling genes. Insights from small‐scale studies can inform field‐scale management to reduce N losses. Roughly half of all nitrogen (N) added to soils is not incorporated by crops and is lost to the environment, but our ability to reduce N loss from soils is hampered by an inadequate grasp of microbial processes affecting N retention and mobility. High‐throughput sequencing (HTS) of microbial DNA is enabling fundamental insights into N cycling microorganisms and their metabolisms. This commentary describes six emerging technologies that could be combined with HTS to enable real‐time collection of metadata on N transformations, intermediates, and products to link soil properties, microbial processes, and the fate of N. These technologies include microdialysis and microfluidics, automated sensing, microfabrication of model soils, parallel quantification of N functional genes, sorting active cells, and stable isotope probing.

When assessing ash and C concentrations along a gradient of soil contamination among 260 samples, a common regression was developed that had &lt;1% coefficient of variation [Ash (g kg −1 ) = 999 − 1.89 × C (g kg −1 ), r 2 = .99, p &lt; .001]. This association was consistent with available data in the literature, which also showed a negative relationship between ash and C concentrations of organically derived materials.

However, residents and environmentalists have questioned the potential water quality benefits of TWR systems. In the southeastern United States, research shows that TWR systems decrease agricultural inputs of phosphorus (P) to surface water by 23%–92%. Additionally, a case study in Massachusetts demonstrated the efficacy of TWR and other best management practices in reducing P concentrations in White Island Pond. Although TWR systems appear effective as part of a P management strategy, more research is needed to quantify their environmental benefits and allay public concerns. We propose filling three critical research gaps to strengthen and broaden support for TWR systems in cranberry agriculture in Massachusetts: (1) quantifying physical properties, (2) quantifying water storage potential, and (3) quantifying P retention capacity. Core Ideas Excess phosphorus (P) from cranberry farms may contribute to the eutrophication of freshwater lakes. Agricultural tailwater recovery (TWR) systems are increasingly used to conserve water and improve water quality. Earth removal, critical to create TWR ponds and provide sand for cranberry farms, has drawn public opposition.

This objective was motivated by the need for accurate estimation of optimal nitrogen recommendations and to understand why optimal nitrogen rates have changed over time. Yields increased over time, except at the 0 and 22 kg N ha −1 rates of applied nitrogen. Bayesian methods were used to estimate linear plateau models where each parameter has its own time trend. Results show no trend in intercept, an increase of 1.3% per year in the slope coefficient, a 1.9% per year increase in the difference between the plateau and intercept, and a 33% increase in the optimal nitrogen rates from 1971 to 2023. These trends suggest the need to update nitrogen recommendations and help explain why the yield goal approach became imprecise over time due to changing yield potential. Core Ideas The yield of winter wheat went up over time with nitrogen rates of 45 kg N ha −1 or higher. The yield on check plots with no nitrogen did not change. The slope and plateau of the linear plateau model of wheat yield response went up over 1% per year.

Temperature and precipitation had no value in predicting enzyme activities; however, enzyme activities were affected by crop rotational diversity and responded to current crop and previous crop. These findings are pertinent to the use of soil extracellular enzymes in soil health assessments and as indicators of microbial substrate preference with implications for soil carbon stabilization.",

To provide the statistical rigor needed to give clear recommendations for greater or less N need based on specific management practices, we propose a bootstrapping approach that resamples residuals with replacement. While bootstrapping is not new to data processing in agronomic fields, we provide an example of how to conduct residual‐resampled bootstrapping with nonlinear regression to identify differences in response curves, optimum N rates, and maximum yields using the FertBoot package in R. Our example dataset provides clear evidence of the value of the bootstrapping approach, as it can aid in determining significant differences between even relatively small differences in optimum N rate. We encourage adoption of this approach as a way to accurately evaluate differences in optimum fertilizer levels between or among treatments to better inform future agronomic decision making.",

Because public speaking is among the greatest fears for many people, it is critical to provide students with the tools needed to communicate effectively with diverse audiences, particularly as only a fraction of them will go on to give regular research seminars once they enter the professional world. Better communication can lead to more constructive engagement with the public as well as with policy‐makers, toward improved understanding of the science they are funding and from which they are benefiting. Purposeful instruction in public speaking should help alleviate the common anxieties that student presenters often experience. Here, we summarize general communication strategies that can be incorporated into any graduate agricultural science course to help address this need.",

Lamina mass ratio is an important correlate of fatty acids in warm‐season annuals. Managing for greater lamina intake may greatly influence animal fatty acid supply. Forage fatty acids (FA) are linked with consumer‐desired FA composition of ruminant meat and dairy products. Maturing forage grasses decrease in α‐linolenic acid (ALA) and ΣFA content, and this is exacerbated in tall summer annuals. We compared ALA and ΣFA content within pearl millet [ Cenchrus americanus (L.)

Samples were collected six times, from early vegetative to late boot stage. Lamina and pseudostem fractions were separated, and whole plant FA composition was calculated from the weighted average of the fractions. As pearl millet matured, ALA and ΣFA content decreased by 55 to 56% within pseudostems and on a whole‐plant basis, although only by 10% in laminae. The ALA proportion of ΣFA decreased by 14% on a whole plant basis, despite not changing within constituent fractions.",

Surface energy balances in tilled soils are affected by changes in bulk density. Surface energy balance (SEB) partitioning is critical to heat and water budgets at the soil–atmosphere interface. Tillage can alter SEB partitioning by initially decreasing soil bulk density (ρ b ), after which ρ b increases with time due to rainfall and other factors. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of ρ b changes on SEB partitioning. We measured SEB components for two 4‐d periods (Period 1 and Period 2) at an early‐tilled (T1) and late‐tilled (T2) bare soil site. During Period 1, ρ b , net radiation , and soil heat flux were similar for T1 and T2, but evaporation was higher at T2. During Period 2, ρ b was 0.11 g cm‾ 3 larger at T2 than at T1. This resulted in a 7% higher soil heat flux at T2, which in turn caused 13% less evaporation. These results highlight the importance of considering dynamic ρ b with time when determining SEB partitioning for tilled soils.",

Much litigation has a local focus but broad implications to agriculture. Agricultural stakeholders must proactively advocate environmental stewardship. Food service companies are driving change and widening the sphere of who pays. Despite conservation practice (CP) adoption over the last 20 years, less than expected improvement in water quality has led some to question whether farmers are doing enough or have implemented appropriate CPs. As a result, environmental action groups have called for expansion of more restrictive land management measures. Based on the number of lawsuits from non‐agricultural against agricultural stakeholders, those affected by water quality impairment feel agriculture has changed little. Much litigation is based on geographically localized concerns, although the broader implications to agriculture are immense. In most cases, litigation has increased divisiveness among stakeholders. Thus, agriculture must advocate sound, sustainable environmental stewardship, which includes metrics that transparently track CP adoption and outcomes. Even though cost‐effective CPs are available that decrease nutrient loss under a range of settings, it will be increasingly costly and challenging to decrease losses further to achieve reduction goals to mitigate water quality impairment.",

Soil surface temperature plays an important role in the rate and quantity at which these resources cross the interface, as temperature regulates numerous physical, chemical, and biological processes. Many current management practices manipulate soil surface temperatures, especially through tillage or residue management, to create conditions suitable for early‐season crop growth. However, these conditions persist beyond plant establishment and have the potential to develop extremely high temperatures, even in historically mild climates. We show the potential for extreme maximum soil surface temperatures in Iowa after crop establishment but before canopy closure and discuss possible consequences of those temperatures. Given the conditions required to develop extreme maximum temperatures, we contend that soil surface temperatures may be an indicator of conditions that are inconsistent with highly productive, sustainable, efficient agroecosystems.",

Controlled environment conditions were tested to evaluate yield parameters commonly observed in the field for MON 87460 maize expressing the cold shock protein B (CspB) protein. Maize plants subjected to water‐limitation treatment in the controlled environment exhibited phenotypic characteristics of drought stress consistent with those observed under field conditions. MON 87460 exhibited significant relative increases in ear length, kernel number, and grain weight following water‐limitation treatment.

After sample preparation, high resolution X‐ray diffraction and fluorescence were used to determine the amount of Si found in wheat chaff. Heat treatments were also applied to convert SiO 2 to silicon carbide (SiC), which can be used in industrial nanoparticles and electronics. We found that the four wheat cultivars tested have differing amounts of Si in the chaff. Those with high amounts of Si can have the Si converted, through a simple heat‐treatment process, to SiC.

    "abstract": "Abstract Raindrop impact derives from the kinetic energy of falling raindrops. Determining the kinetic energy of rainfall requires the size distribution and terminal velocity of raindrops, which necessitates complex instrumentation. To avoid this, empirical relations have been developed that relate rainfall intensity and the rate of kinetic energy, i.e., time‐specific kinetic energy (KE time ). In this study, a dynamic rain gauge system (DRGS) was used to quantify the KE time generated by a rainfall simulator without need of measuring raindrop size distributions or impact velocities. In a series of 10 rainfall tests, the KE time and rainfall intensity were 860.9 (±88.6) J m 2 h −1 and 72.1 (±1.9) mm h −1 , respectively. Estimated KE time was found to agree well with the power‐law relation presented by Petrů and Kalibová for high‐intensity simulated rainfall, which are the conditions when higher deviations occur. The DRGS may be a useful tool in quantifying the KE time of rainfall simulators in hopes to better understand raindrop impact mechanisms.",

A 2016 LGU faculty survey revealed strong support for open source/open access science. Most based research choices around scientific curiosity than commercialization potential. Plant scientists had the highest reliance on licensing revenues but still only 3% of total lab revenues. It may be time to reassess the research model of public universities. Based on a nationally representative survey done in 2016, this article examines the attitudes and activities of agricultural and life science faculty at US land grant universities with respect to open access/open source versus commercialization of research. The findings reveal pervasive faculty support for open scientific inquiry and sharing of knowledge and relatively low levels of participation in and laboratory market funding associated with commercialization activities. These results point toward the potential timeliness of a reassessment of public universities policies and public relations with respect to open science and commercialization.",

Sediment P release data is essential for calibrating lake and reservoir models used in a TMDL. Sediment P release at Lake Tenkiller was very high relative to that predicted by the model. Sediment P release was also very high relative to that observed in regional reservoirs. Internal P sources need to be addressed in watershed management strategies. Watershed management for lakes and reservoirs largely focuses on external sources, but internal sources, such as sediment P release, can be important. This study quantified sediment P release in Lake Tenkiller, Oklahoma, in summer 2016. Eight intact sediment–water cores were collected from the riverine and transition zone and then incubated at 22°C for 8 d under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Phosphorus mass in the overlying water of all cores increased with time, and the rate of increase was significantly greater under anaerobic conditions. Sediment P release was reflective of eutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions, measuring up to 15.2 mg m −2 d −1 . Sediment P fluxes were four to five times greater than the net flux predicted by the model of Lake Tenkiller, suggesting that internal P sources need to be considered in the total maximum daily load process.",

Although new genetic seed testing is making detection easier, methods to separate seed from contaminated manure are needed. Six methods were compared for their ability to recover 100 Palmer amaranth seeds added to bedded or nonbedded cattle manure: dry sieving, rinse sieving, manure saturation sieving without blending and with blending, and dispersion sieving without blending and with blending. Seed recovery was highest (&gt;90%) with the rinse sieving method regardless of manure type. The dispersion methods are not recommended as they recovered &lt;24.7% of seeds.

    "abstract": "In a recent commentary article, Randall Jackson (2022) claims that U.S. maize croplands currently growing cattle feed can be converted to perennial pastures without incurring either a loss of beef production or agricultural expansion. Grass-finished cattle fatten up slower and reach lower slaughter weights than grain-finished cattle (Pelletier et al., 2010). Therefore, to support present beef production using only pastures, more finishing cattle must be raised and slaughtered. The author recognizes this and attempts to quantify whether current maize production regions could instead grow sufficient perennial grasses and forages. He finds that an additional 7.6 million finishing cattle must be raised to produce exclusively grass-fed beef. He then calculates that 4.9 million ha of maize croplands growing cattle feed could, instead, grow sufficient grass to support these cattle. However, the author makes a fundamental oversight—those 7.6 million additional finishing cattle must come from somewhere; they need mothers. Finishing cattle are supported on the “back end” by large cow-calf and stocker herds on pastures, who replace the current finishing cattle when they are slaughtered. Unlike pigs and chickens who can have many offspring per year, cows have long gestation periods of 9 mo, like humans, birthing at most one offspring each year. Cow gestation periods are so long and cattle maturity is so slow that cattle on pastures outnumber finishing cattle in feedlots by nearly five to one (Figure 1). To raise 7.6 million more grass-finished cattle, U.S. ranchers would need to raise 7.7 million more cows, along with 7.8 million more calves and stocker cattle on pastures. Altogether, an exclusively grass-finished system requires 23.1 million (30%) more cattle to produce the same quantity of beef (Table 1), not 7.6 million (10%) more as the author models. We published these findings in a study that was cited by the author (Hayek & Garrett, 2018), but he missed this central finding. Larger grass-finished cattle herds require additional resources. Optimistically, a maximum of 71% of current production could be met if the United States shifted its maize feed crops for finishing cattle to perennial forages (Hayek & Garrett, 2018). We assumed a similar potential forage yield on current maize croplands of 10.3 dry matter (DM) ha–1 yr–1, which lies within the author's range of 8–12 DM ha–1 yr–1. Maintaining these yields requires fertilizer inputs: we assumed forages were produced using conventional hay and alfalfa production, and the author's range of 8–12 DM ha–1 yr–1 is derived from a study of U.S. Upper Midwest pastures that applied fertilizer at a rate of 57 kg N ha–1 yr–1 (Oates et al., 2011). These findings are consistent with multiple other studies, which demonstrate that grass-finished beef land requirements are 40–150% higher than conventional (Capper, 2012; Pelletier et al., 2010; Rowntree et al., 2020; Stanley et al., 2018). Some of these studies were cited by the author, but the major discrepancies in land use requirements within these findings were not acknowledged. Jackson (2022) also underestimates grass-finished beef's greenhouse gas emissions. The author models a 29% increase in enteric fermentation methane for larger finishing cattle populations and increased roughage in their diets. Correctly accounting for the increase in cow-calf and stocker herds raises this amount to 43% (Hayek & Garrett, 2018). Furthermore, the author unrealistically assumes that there are zero fossil fuel emissions associated with fertilizer production and on-farm equipment in grass-finished pasture beef systems. The author has conducted prior studies of intensively grazed pasture systems, from which he derived the high pasture yield assumptions for the present analysis, where fertilizers and equipment were in fact used (Oates et al., 2011). Agricultural and environmental policy analysis must account for impacts across interconnected systems. While Jackson (2022) correctly reasons that perennial grasslands may confer local benefits and support additional finisher cattle, the analysis did not account for higher upstream demand for more cows, calves and stocker cattle. Shifts to grass-fed beef must therefore be accompanied by a reduction of beef demand to avoid land clearing. Specifically, demand must decrease by 29–73%, depending on the assumed land use for grazing and forage production (Hayek & Garrett, 2018). More broadly, agricultural incentives that alter demand or displace production can lead to land clearing elsewhere (Meyfroidt et al., 2018; Searchinger et al., 2018). For instance, maize-derived ethanol fuel production emits fewer greenhouse gases than gasoline when considering inputs, production, and consumption, but adding carbon emissions from the land clearing that was triggered by ethanol fuel mandates and demand increases the emission footprint of maize ethanol to be greater than gasoline (Lark et al., 2022). Due to historical and ongoing demand for ruminant meat and dairy, over 6 million km2 of native forests have been displaced and are continuously maintained as livestock pastures (Hayek et al., 2021), while most native grasslands are maximally or overgrazed (Erb et al., 2018; Fetzel et al., 2017; Hilker et al., 2014). Scientific consensus, as reflected in “high confidence” positions within the IPCC 2019 report on Climate Change and Land chapter on food security and climate (chapter 5), points to an urgent need to reduce land use pressures through (a) sustainable intensification (i.e., producing more food efficiently on a given amount of land) and (b) demand shifts (e.g., reducing food waste and shifting toward plant-rich diets; IPCC, 2019). Lastly, a major problem throughout Jackson (2022) lies in its framing. In the introduction, the author states “This is not an exhaustive literature review, nor is it a replacement for a proper life cycle analysis. Rather, the exploration is meant to stoke the imagination of the reader to consider the possibilities of a transformed beef production system.” Despite the soft introduction, the conclusion authoritatively claims that converting cropland for pasture-finished beef “does not require displacing food production. It does not require more land to be converted to agriculture. And it will improve our quality of life overall.” These are not imaginative musings, but declarative statements of fact, proclaiming that such shifts will create net benefits. This framing, and the faulty assumptions that underpin it, erase real environmental risks and tradeoffs. The author's conclusions mirror policy recommendations of his organization, Grassland 2.0. Policy memos and position papers on their website date back to 2020—including a letter lobbying the USDA to fund (a) cropland conversion to pasture, (b) slaughter operations, and (c) government procurement of pasture-raised meats—but not to lessen meat and dairy consumption (Grasslandag.org, 2021). These positions overlap the conclusions of the author, suggesting that the analysis was not performed in a completely objective manner. Jackson (2022) ends on an inspiring note, proclaiming “We must envision an agriculture that provides for our needs now while building the capacity of future generations to do the same.” Such an envisioning should not just selectively support one's preferred interventions in isolation. Scientific and policy analysis must critically evaluate difficult tradeoffs and find cobenefits in a systematic manner.",

Yields had positive correlations to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at black layer but often had negative correlations to corn yields 0–14 DAH. After harvest, NDVI could be associated with weed growth, and negative correlations to yield could point to reduced corn canopy allowing light to reach late‐season weeds. In fertility studies, excess nitrogen appears to increase weed biomass after harvest, which can be easily identified through drone imagery. Flights should be performed after corn harvest as weed growth may provide additional insight into management decisions.",

Results of the laboratory study showed that up to 11.8% of the sample volume evaporated when samples were stored in an autosampler at 35°C for 24 d. To prevent significant water isotope fractionation, samples should be retrieved from autosamplers &lt;7 d following sample collection when air temperatures are &lt;22°C and &lt;3 d following sample collection when the air temperature is 35°C.

Profitability for no‐till and chisel plow systems were equal due to lower machinery costs. Cost‐efficient stover harvest is essential for bio‐economy development. Developing a bio‐economy by harvesting crop residues from highly productive corn ( Zea mays L.) cropping systems requires science‐based management decisions to maintain or enhance grain yield and soil, water, and air resources. Which tillage and stover harvest practices are best for accomplishing these goals? Continuous corn grain yield response to either no‐till or chisel plowing with two stover harvest rates (3.4 or 5.1 Mg ha −1 yr −1 ) was evaluated for 10 yr in central Iowa. Each tillage and stover removal combination was replicated four times. Year‐to‐year variation affected grain yield more than tillage practice (0.2 Mg ha −1 ) or stover removal (0.1 Mg ha −1 ). Grain yields were not statistically different ( p = 0.33) between tillage systems. Including machinery costs made return on investment for chisel plow and no‐till equivalent even though no‐till yields were numerically lower. Net stover income per megagram was US$2 to $4 greater at the 3.4 versus 5.1 Mg ha −1 harvest rate because of more efficient harvesting. Among the four practices, no‐till with 3.4 Mg ha −1 stover harvest met multiple goals, including providing acceptable corn grain yields, positive net income per megagram stover, and sufficient residues to protect the soil.",

Total number of PM 2.5 released from GB was 1.63 times greater than that from SB. Total time of burning (flaming + smoldering) phase during GB was 1.5 to 2.1 times longer than SB. The flaming phase for both GB and SB was shorter than the smoldering phase but emitted 5.2 to 7.5 times more PM 2.5 . Average particle density of PM 2.5 from burning operations was 1.12 g cm −3 for GB and 0.52 g cm −3 for SB. The GH and BH released lower PM 2.5 but higher PM 2.5‐10 as compared to SB and GB. Overall, biomass burning, regardless GB and SB difference, released significantly higher PM 2.5 than harvest‐cutting operations.",

Sustainability must begin at the source of the supply chain—the farm, ranch, mine, or well. Rural areas have strengths, critical vulnerabilities, opportunities, and threats. Regional threshold indicators can be used to prevent tipping points and avoid system collapse. The expected worldwide demand for agriculture, energy, and manufactured products will result in a supply chain that is increasingly dependent on exported rural products (e.g., livestock, cereal grains, fossil fuel, and biofuel). Rural areas such as the northern Great Plains are net exporters of food and energy, essentially “mining” valuable water and nutrient resources to do so. Rural areas are the foundation of supply chains; thus, to achieve sustainability, one must begin focusing at the source of the supply chain– with the farm, ranch, mine, or well. There are many knowledge gaps within the food–energy–water nexus in rural areas that shroud regional sustainability thresholds. Research and legislation are needed to address these critical issues.",

We briefly discuss a priori considerations to guide such researchers. Developing successful research questions, experiments, and data analysis is the goal. Amplicon‐based sequencing strategies that include 16S rRNA and functional genes, alongside “meta‐omics” analyses of communities of microorganisms, have allowed researchers to pose questions and find answers to “who” is present in the environment and “what” they are doing. Next‐generation sequencing approaches that aid microbial ecology studies of agricultural systems are fast gaining popularity among agronomy, crop, soil, and environmental science researchers. Given the rapid development of these high‐throughput sequencing techniques, researchers with no prior experience will desire information about the best practices that can be used before actually starting high‐throughput amplicon‐based sequence analyses. We have outlined items that need to be carefully considered in experimental design, sampling, basic bioinformatics, sequencing of mock communities and negative controls, acquisition of metadata, and in standardization of reaction conditions as per experimental requirements. Not all considerations mentioned here may pertain to a particular study. The overall goal is to inform researchers about considerations that must be taken into account when conducting high‐throughput microbial DNA sequencing and sequences analysis.",

Research and extension institutions mainly deliver information from a primary discipline perspective to decision makers. Government and academia recognize the importance of multidisciplinary research and extension teams. Developing successful multidisciplinary research and extension teams is challenging. There are no proven metrics yet to measure goal achievement or models that support growth. Team‐based research is not an innovative concept; however, the current models of team research are based principally on self‐formed teams with a defined duration. Current trends seem to point toward the development of administratively designed multidisciplinary teams. Although this seems logical, minimal guidelines exist to aid in team development or evaluate team outcomes. Critical processes in a team‐based research atmosphere have not been identified, much less described, and strategies for successful implementation have not been proposed. The strength of this approach can be summarized as a unified focus during the course of problem definition and solution. Many trade‐offs and obstacles are apparent with a broad‐based focus. Chief obstacles and barriers include sustaining the balance between remaining small in size and focused on a problem while fitting into the departmental culture. Internal administrative support is mandatory for building a successful multidisciplinary research team. The required interdependence of multidisciplinary team research requires administrators, as well as peers, to recognize the positive value of each contribution.",

N supply needed for max. yield was 179–204 kg N ha −1 for Idaho studies in 1977, 1997, and 2011. Research is needed to evaluate a static N management approach in sugarbeet production. Nitrogen (N) management is important in sugarbeet ( Beta vulgaris L.) production. This paper presents data to support additional research to evaluate a new N management approach in the northwestern United States. Evaluation of historic data suggests that static N management (fixed N supply independent of yields) may have advantages compared with yield goal‐based N management in the northwestern United States. From the early 1970s to 2011, the amount of N supply needed to maximize yields in research studies was within a narrow N supply range of 179 to 204 kg N ha −1 . Recommended N supplies (179–204 kg N ha −1 ) have not increased as yields have increased. Evidence suggests that following the past recommendations under current yield levels will likely oversupply N. On the basis of this analysis, a regionwide project has begun to determine if a static N management approach is appropriate.",

However, the expenses of acquiring large numbers of images with large overlap and creation of ortho‐rectified mosaics may make unmanned aircraft system (UAS) monitoring slow and cost prohibitive.

When aggregated by field, UAS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) agreed with NDVI from a corresponding Landsat image, with an R 2 of 0.958 and an RMSE of 0.058.

Within North Dakota, USA, our research group initiated research in 2015 on pollinator conservation and management. We synthesized results across five projects, producing 12 publications and providing baseline data on pollinator diversity and rangeland management to improve conservation efforts while land‐sharing with livestock. We detected 76 species of butterflies and ∼318 bee species. Butterfly diversity and relative abundance were driven by floral resources and less exotic plant invasions, with a positive relationship between flowers and pollinators. Invasive forbs were visited by pollinators, primarily honey bees. We also found management influenced vegetation characteristics within pastures, but landscape context was important for determining the specific outcome. Although pollinator abundance did not distinctly respond to management, diversity was affected by regime and grazer type. Using fire and grazing may benefit flowers to support pollinators. Our research will help guide rangeland management decisions that promote land sharing and benefit pollinator conservation efforts. Core Ideas We synthesized pollinator data from research conducted over six years in North Dakota. Pollinator diversity correlated with more forb diversity and less invasive plant species cover.

Changes in these demographic variables are therefore important for designing long‐term environmental policies.

Here, we used mail survey data ( n = 3069) to determine whether education levels of landowners in rural southwestern Ontario, Canada, varied with age, gender, and occupation (“farmer” or “non‐farmer”). Education level increased with decreasing age in all landowners with the exception of male farmers, where the opposite trend was observed.

Peat carbon dioxide flux and water table depth were monitored throughout the growing season at two locations previously disturbed to different degrees by row‐crop agriculture. Flux ranged from 0.55 to 12.71 µmol m −2 s −1 and was highest during peak growing season. Lower flux corresponded to elevated water table conditions. The more disturbed location often had lower flux, indicating success in hydrological restoration. The water table is an important factor in peatland restoration, and water table management should be considered to maximize carbon sequestration.",

Reference ranges identify “normal” nutrient ranges by using turf quality as a metric. Reference ranges should be considered as an alternative tissue test interpretation. Tissue testing is a common practice in turfgrass management and is intended to guide nutrient applications. However, standard interpretations are a product of agricultural cropping systems and use yield as the primary metric. Yield is often of little importance in turfgrass systems and, thus, traditional test interpretations may be of little value. Reference ranges interpret test results by first defining a ‘normal’ population followed by analysis and determination of the 95% confidence interval for each nutrient. Moreover, reference ranges can be determined for cultivar, season, and age‐specific populations, which would result in a more precise interpretation and nutrient recommendation for turf managers. Because reference ranges use the accepted turf quality metric, reference ranges should be considered as an alternate option to traditional turfgrass tissue test interpretations.",

Consumers with high income and educational levels, who are more concerned with the environment and their health and have greater trust in government supervision of rice quality, as well as inland consumers, are more likely to purchase high‐priced japonica rice, whereas the price factor has a negative relationship with such purchases. The results provide sufficient information to the japonica rice industry to expand its market and improve its profitability.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Frost events in June affected late‐flowering cultivars of canola. Subsequent heat stress disproportionately affected early‐flowering cultivars. Frost stress likely primed late‐flowering cultivars for subsequent heat stress. Canola ( Brassica napus L.) is most susceptible to frost damage from budding stage through early seed fill stage. In early June 2017, a late spring frost occurred while early‐flowering (EF) canola cultivars were at the flowering stage and late‐flowering (LF) cultivars were at the budding stage. A second frost 12 d later occurred after flowering had ended among EF cultivars but was still underway among LF cultivars. Subsequently, both EF and LF cultivars were exposed to high summer temperatures. There was a disproportionately greater negative impact from exposure to frost and subsequent heat stress among EF cultivars, indicating possible cross‐stress tolerance among LF cultivars. The LF cultivars were primed by frost for the heat that followed, while no priming was possible among EF cultivars since flowering was underway when the first stress (i.e., frost) occurred. If correct, this study represents the first known field evidence of frost‐induced cross‐stress tolerance in canola.",

    "abstract": "This letter is provided in response to a letter (Brinton and Vallotton, 2018) regarding our recent publication (McGowen et al., 2018). We welcome the constructive discussion to advance laboratory methods for assessing soil health indicators. This is why we shared soil samples from our work with Dr. Brinton's team in hopes of extending efforts to better understand the relationships between CO2 burst methods and the experimental conditions that influence the observed differences. It is expected that different laboratory methods seldom yield the same absolute values but are often correlated with one another. Our goal was to contribute to the science and in-depth understanding for method standardization in soil health assessment. Our conclusion of lower labor requirement for the GC method was based mainly on the time required washing dishes for the methods. For each analysis, the GC method uses a gas vial with a crimp top closure and gray butyl septa. The closure and septa are discarded, leaving only the vial to be washed. The components needed for one analysis using the Solvita (Woods End Laboratories) method include a jar, a rubber gasket, a lid, and a plastic beaker. The washing of these components combined with manual reading of the Solvita paddle contributes to considerable labor requirement. We agree with Dr. Brinton that the Solvita method could run >60 samples per day as permitted by the GC setup, providing that labor and incubation chambers are not limited. However, the XYZ sampler could be programmed to inject water into the vials, allowing the GC to run continuously with precise incubation times after water introduction. Regarding the correlation between the two methods, the slope between the two methods presented in McGowen et al. (2018) was low, but the r2 was 0.90 for the linear range of the Solvita method. Additionally, the r2 for the curvilinear relationship between the Solvita color number and the GC CO2 burst was 0.92 when all data were used. We agree with Dr. Brinton's team that the low slope is probably the result of differences in headspace volumes and soil sample sizes used in the measurements. We believe that sensitivity analysis is needed to better understand how these two experimental conditions affect emissions per gram of soil. However, in McGowen et al. (2018), we did not attempt to dilute the headspace in the Solvita method as our preliminary experiments using soils within the linear range of the Solvita method did not result in values that were proportional to the Solvita values generated without dilution. In other words, we could not simply use a dilution factor of two when we used half the soil of the original method and arrive at the same value. Therefore, we are currently evaluating the impact of sample size and chamber volume for both the GC method as well as the hydroxide trap method to further understanding. The data provided by Dr. Brinton and his team show clearly that the paddles used for the Solvita method are accurate in providing a measurement of headspace CO2 concentrations based on the relationships between the other CO2 analytical methods presented in their letter. The data also show the discrepancy between the Solvita values as measured in our laboratory and the current method they used. In fact, the data provided in Brinton and Vallotton (2018) comparing the OKSU-SOL (Oklahoma State University data, Solvita) and WE-SOL (Woods End Laboratory data, Solvita) analysis with linear regression has a slope of 2.29. Similarly, the slope between the OKSU-SOL and WE-CZ (Woods End Laboratory data, COZIR infrared cell) was 1.99. These slopes indicate that when we used the smaller 200-mL jar sold by Woods End Laboratory, we generated values that were approximately twice those generated in the 475-mL jar now used for the Solvita method. This discrepancy warrants the need, as mentioned earlier, to conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of CO2 burst methods with respect to chamber size but does not discount the potential of using micro-chambers as used in the GC method. Regarding the calibration of the GC, we reviewed the raw CO2 data prior to conversion to the CO2 burst values and found that 5 out of the 72 samples analyzed were above the 40,000 μL L−1 standard. This would be a limitation to the methodology described in McGowen et al. (2018). We agree that a sensitivity analysis with respect to the headspace volume of 0.015 L is warranted. We measured the volume of the samples after they were placed into the vials and found that the average density was 0.96 g cm−3 and ranged from 0.8 to 1.14 g cm−3. As a result, the average water-filled pore space was approximately 40%. We did not vary the water applied based on bulk density but agree that a sensitivity analysis would ensure reproducible data for meaningful interpretation. Dr. Brinton and his team correctly point out that we used paired samples from nine locations of cultivated and their native grass or no-till counterparts across Oklahoma. Comparison of the two field conditions was not presented in McGowen et al. (2018) due to space limitation. However, the data do allow for the assessment of soil management differences. As shown in Table 1, the absolute values of CO2 burst from the GC method is well below those measured by the Solvita method. The relative differences between the soil management practices were detected by both methods. On average (excluding data obtained at 105°C), we found that the CO2 burst in the no-till soils were 1.7 times higher than those of tilled soils by the Solvita method. The CO2 burst for the no-till soils was 2.5 times the cultivated soils based on data obtained by the GC method. These results suggest that GC method, although it yielded lower values of CO2 burst, was more sensitive than the Solvita method in detecting differences resulting from management practices Method comparison and validation are crucial initial steps in advancing soil health assessments. We appreciate Dr. Brinton and his team for their interest in our research. I agree that we must work toward sound methodologies for soil health indicators that are highly reproducible and robust to differentiate treatment differences in soil management for meaningful comparison and interpretation. Although the GC method produced values that are lower than Solvita method, the GC method did generate data that differentiate soil management history, and with a greater linear range than the original Solvita method as provided to us at purchase. We will continue the effort to better understand the impact of chamber size, soil mass, incubation temperature, and timing on the GC method as it lends itself to automation. Again, we appreciate Dr. Brinton and Mr. Vallotton's insightful comments and suggestions.",

This paper merges two mathematical formulations, clearly illustrated in two‐dimensional graphics, to create a direct representation of crop growth responses to a range of both CO 2 concentrations and air temperatures.

Results from the study indicated calibration curves for the Solvita gel system could be developed within an approximate range of 1 to 30 mg IC. Comparison of the Solvita gel system with the pressure calcimeter resulted in a near 1:1 relationship, where slight overestimation occurred when IC was less than 13 g kg −1 and slight underestimation above this level.

Among these benefits is the ability to conduct experiments using PATs and collaborate with researchers in a process known as on‐farm precision experimentation (OFPE). OFPE is a citizen‐science approach that fosters relationships and knowledge‐sharing to address challenges of mutual interest. While the literature on precision agriculture is extensive, little research has addressed farmers’ willingness to conduct OFPE with researchers. Interviews with 11 Illinois farmers revealed high adoption rates of PATs. Interest in collaborating with researchers to conduct OFPE was mixed, with farmers identifying clear channels of communication as the most important factor in their decision to collaborate. While additional study is needed among the larger farming community, these initial insights may contribute to the larger effort to encourage greater collaboration between researchers and farmers to find real‐world solutions to agronomic, economic, and environmental challenges. Core Ideas Precision agriculture technologies (PATs) allow farmers to engage in on‐farm precision experimentation (OFPE). OFPE fosters farmer and researcher collaboration to help address agronomic challenges. This study provides initial insight into farmers’ perceptions of and interest in OFPE.",

    "abstract": "The decision whether to manage agriculture according to organic farming principles or conventional farming is a question bigger than scientific inquiry; it constitutes a political question. Similarly, deciding the regulations governing organic and conventional production does not fall within the pursuit of science. Rather, science should show how different management practices influence the environment. The regulatory framework of organic farming is derived from normative values rather than scientific principles, which now categorizes the production. McGuire (2017) contend that ideology and science do not blend well. However, researchers inherently possess normative values, which shape their research interests and perspectives. It could be argued that this is only problematic when the goal of the scientific pursuit and ideology crosses, thus becoming activistic. This can harm the scientific process by drawing wrongful conclusions upon poorly constructed experiments, and thus the scientific process in general. All scientific decisions—for example., formulating a research question, designing the study, and analyzing the data—are conducted by humans, with values and experiences influencing their choices, therefore including some normative values (Reed, 2011; Risjord, 2016). While this is generally recognized by social sciences, natural sciences often neglect it. Analysis of studies comparing the environmental impacts of organic and conventional farming show variation in environmental impact, as for dairy production (Cederberg & Mattsson, 2000; De Boer, 2003; Kristensen et al., 2011; Thomassen et al., 2008). When assessing the two production regimes the production level between the systems is seemingly important. This is because emission or environmental impact are often divided upon the emission per produced product, which as an effect of production levels obtained is favoring higher production. Organic farming utilizes less resources per produced product, but often has a lower productivity. Organic farming, however, often claims other ideologic values besides production, such as health, ecology, fairness, and care (IFOAM, 2005). Comparison of organic and conventional management also raises the question of whether the production systems are similar enough to be comparable. Both organic and conventional production can be described with the goal to produce goods to sell, while somehow having different aims. Organic farming emphasizes different values, complicating direct statistical comparisons with conventional systems, since these values are not described with a reductionistic approach. The external values in organic production seem to have a cost, often resulting in lower productivity than conventional production. The reasoning of McGuire (2017), who advocates that organic agriculture should change its means to become environmentally friendly (by increasing yields), could also imply that the conventional production has something to learn from the organic production that is, reducing its input in production without strongly compromising output. The article also possesses a normative opinion that science should change the attitude toward organic farming, while the main role of science is to evaluate the impact of production, rather than being political.

This has led countries to become more similar to each other in their mix of winegrape varieties and more varietally concentrated. What are the drivers of those changes? In this study, we focus on one of those drivers, that is, climate similarities. We estimate statistical models to quantify the potential influence of 16 climate variables on varietal similarities across countries, as well as on how their varietal mixes have become more or less similar since 2000. The results indicate not only that countries with more similar climates have more similar varietal mixes but also that in recent years countries with more similar climates have become even more similar in their mixes. This, however, does not necessarily mean that vignerons have been planting the varieties that are better adapted to their climates. Core Ideas Wine‐producing countries have become more similar and concentrated in their mix of winegrape varieties. This similarity extends particularly among countries sharing similar climatic conditions. In recent years, countries with similar climates have continued to converge in their winegrape varietal mixes.

    "abstract": "Matthew Hayek's response to my commentary (Jackson, 2022) is a valuable contribution to an important conversation about how we can provide for our wants and needs while improving our environment. My commentary purposefully simplified a complex topic to encourage interrogation of whether we have the capacity to meet current beef supply (5.9 billion kg yr–1) by finishing cattle on grassland rather than grain in feedlots. Hayek and I agree that this would require 7.6 million additional finishing cattle because grass-finished cattle take longer to finish and grow less overall (Hayek & Garrett, 2018). My assessment was that we would need ∼16.1 million ha for all 20 million finishing cattle and that we could use the 4.9 million ha currently growing maize for cattle in feedlots, plus ∼12 million ha growing maize for ethanol, which constitutes a net loss of energy coupled with devastating environmental outcomes (Lark, 2020). We seem to agree that there's enough land for the finishing cattle, but Hayek encourages us to consider the upstream supply chain and its ramifications. Hayek observes that these additional finishing cattle would require more cows, calves, and stocker cattle (∼23.1 million more animals) to reproduce and replace the finishing cattle (Hayek & Garrett, 2018), resulting in ∼18.6 million more grassland ha needed for grazing these feeder cattle. I argue that we desperately need this increased demand for grassland, especially if it replaces cropping systems prone to soil, carbon, and nutrient loss to the atmosphere and waters, where conservation interventions such as no-till, cover crops, and semi-annual forages (e.g., alfalfa) improve, but do not stop, these losses (Lintern et al., 2020; Osterholz et al., 2019; Roland et al., 2022). Inasmuch as most of this feeder-cattle rearing is currently done on rangelands of the West, nearly half of this could occur on the ∼9 million ha of Great Plains land growing corn, soybeans, and alfalfa irrigated with water that is drawing down the Ogallala Aquifer (Carnes & Sanderson, 2022; Evett et al., 2020). Much of these products are fed to livestock, but according to the Iowa Corn website (www.iowacorn.org), much of the corn grain in the United States is exported (11% or ∼4.4 million ha) and much of it is considered “surplus” for “residual use” (9% or ∼3.6 million ha). It is important to note that the exports are sold by aggregator corporations to relatively affluent countries to build corporate wealth and often the surplus corn grain is “dumped” on global markets to suppress prices elsewhere (Hansen-Kuhn & Murphy, 2017). In more humid regions where feeder cattle are raised on pastures, most of this is done with continuous grazing, which undermines the yield potential of the pastures compared with well-managed rotational grazing that stimulates forage quantity and quality (Zegler et al., 2018; Oates et al., 2011). And none of this invokes use of the ∼9 million ha of Conservation Reserve Program land, largely grassland without any herbivory, which is critical to grassland ecosystem function (Teague & Kreuter, 2020; Sollenberger et al., 2019). In all cases above, the current land cover and land use would be replaced by land cover and/or land use that has the capacity to restore much, but not all, of the function of the North American prairie, while still providing the livestock products being fed grain, grain by-products, and forages in our current beef system. Displacing these grains and forages does not require us to consider where they will be grown otherwise. While these changes might have other ramifying effects on society and economies, we cannot avoid restoring grassland ecosystem function in one place because it might drive poor land use decisions elsewhere or reduced wealth accumulation by corporations in the export sector. While my commentary addressed a particular slice of the U.S. beef supply chain (finishing cattle), and Hayek pushes us to look upstream at the ramifications (feeder cattle production), we also must look downstream in a holistic way. If we consider the additional 43% methane sent to the atmosphere by including feeder cattle into the equation as Hayek has done, we also must consider the additional fossil fuel combusted for individual and ecosystem health costs. For example, Hill et al. (2019) estimated ∼4,300 premature human deaths in the United States each year related to elevated airborne particulate matter levels from corn production, which has an unknown but estimable fossil fuel C cost. Growing annual crops in the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin has been linked to increased flooding frequency and intensity (Bendorf et al., 2021), which has resulted in entire communities being moved upslope with tremendous financial and C costs. Continental fisheries have been devastated largely because of nutrient pollution from annual row crop production in the Upper Mississippi River Basin driving billions of dollars and untold C combusted in addressing the problem (Paudel & Crago, 2020). And none of this addresses the devastating social costs of the current model of vertical integration and consolidation in agriculture that exploits labor and drives small- to mid-sized cattle producers out of business with low prices for their products (Bruckner, 2016; Burchfield et al., 2022). As I mentioned in my commentary, I believe we should consume less industrially produced meat in the United States to reduce our C footprint. I was keen to explore how important the process of soil organic C change is to the C footprint of the beef production system, concluding that it may offset enteric methane emissions from additional cattle. But I also make clear that if soils are not accumulating C, the grass-finishing system will be a net source of C to the atmosphere that is similar to the current system, but still a small contributor relative to fossil fuel combustion that must be reduced for us to address climate change. Hayek takes me to task in his response for providing an analysis that aligns with past advocacy for policies that incentivize more grassland agriculture. The decades of research findings that I and many others have produced demonstrating the critical need to restore the structure and function of North American grasslands for human health and well-being has resulted in little land use and land cover change. In fact, grassland loss and environmental degradation has increased in recent decades (Lark 2020 et al., 2020; Spawn et al., 2019). If I am guilty of advocating for clean water, stable climate, clean air, reduced flooding, and more habitat for biodiversity with a beef production system that approaches current beef demand while driving grassland restoration and improved management—so be it!",

We sampled paired forest and agricultural sites and used multiple linear regression to assess 16 indicators and found four‐ and six‐indicator models predicted the CASH score with varying but reasonable accuracy depending on conversion class. Organic matter, water aggregate stability, and pH were consistent predictors across all classes, as well as one or more micronutrients. The CASH framework appears to be more suitable for agricultural soils and as time since conversion proceeds.",

Similar spikes were observed for possible influences such as the documentary “Kiss the ground,” and SVI related to climate change and carbon sequestration. Notably, SVI for “sustainable development goals” aligned with similar patterns in SVI for “soil health,” indicating a possible link between soil interest and the United Nations’ sustainability goals.

Over 3 years (2020–2022), energy flux observations using the eddy covariance method were conducted to analyze atmospheric cooling in paddy fields. The findings revealed a pronounced atmospheric cooling effect associated with negative sensible heat in paddy fields. Moreover, this cooling phenomenon exhibited heightened activity during periods of increased wind speeds (&gt;3.5 m/s) and subdued net radiation (&lt;400 W/m 2 ). These results highlight rice paddies' potential to cool the atmosphere, acting as a countermeasure against global warming and the urban heat island effect.",

This study investigated the effects of tillage and calcium fertilization on snail populations in peanut. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with four plot replications using the peanut cultivar Georgia 12Y. Treatments combined tillage methods with dolomitic lime or gypsum fertilization. The results showed that conventional tillage with the addition of dolomitic lime significantly reduced the number of snails compared to tillage plus gypsum, no‐tillage plus dolomitic lime, and no‐tillage plus gypsum. A slight increase in yield was noted in plots with tillage and gypsum application. These findings highlight the potential of tillage, especially when combined with dolomitic lime, as an effective strategy for managing B. bonariensis in peanut.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study evaluates cover crop (CC) effects on microbial community structure in a winter wheat–sorghum–fallow rotation with pea, oat, and canola; mixtures of pea and oat; pea and canola; pea, oat, and canola; and six species mixture (SSM) of pea, oat, canola, hairy vetch, forage radish, and barley as CCs, and fallow as treatments. Soil microbial community structure was analyzed at CC termination (phase I), 36 days (phase II), and a year (phase III) after termination using an ester‐linked fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Total microbial biomass (TMB) under oats was significantly greater than under canola (by 47%) in phase I ( p ≤ 0.05). The TMB was &gt;48% under pea, pea + canola, and SSM, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was 70%–93% more under pea, canola, and their mixtures than fallow in phase II. While microbial abundance varied with CCs at and after 36 days post‐termination, these effects did not persist for a year. Long fallow period after cropping or cover cropping appears detrimental to microbial community proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Core Ideas Intact soil column flood studies inaccurately capture short‐term nutrient flux. Filter paper creates barrier to physical disturbance of soil into water column. Filters are permeable to dissolved nutrients to chemically flux into water column. Cone filters prevent floating soil and organic materials from entering water column. Intact soil column studies have been widely used as laboratory simulations in determining the effects of long‐term inundation on nutrient flux in soils, but preliminary studies on total Kjeldahl N (TKN) have shown that physical disturbance associated with current flooding techniques causes an overestimation of TKN flux after short‐term inundation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to create a laboratory protocol that would minimize the effect of physical disturbance associated with current flooding procedures. To determine physical disturbance, total P concentrations were measured as a proxy for soil particles. Within 3 h of inundation, results found that total P concentrations in the water column were significantly reduced when using flat or cone‐shaped filter paper on the soil surface compared with blanks. By adapting the Collins‐filter barrier technique to short‐term flooding simulations, we were able to more accurately predict TKN flux to represent a natural real‐world response to short‐term inundation.",

However, there is a lack of extensive data on its sorption and factors that control its sorption in the soil system. In this study, we evaluated a series of 25 different soils, with a variety of properties to determine if an empirical relationship could be developed to predict the sorption coefficient for bicyclopyrone. Overall, there were no statistically significant relationships observed with organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, or clay content. There was a moderate negative correlation with soil pH ( R = −.61). Additionally, Freundlich isotherm analysis suggests that the partitioning coefficient ( K D ) value could adequately characterize the sorption behavior for the range of soils evaluated here.",

Pastures were associated with greater SOM and biological indicators than annual rotations. Manure use in annual cropping systems was associated with greater POXC and MinC. Combining all five soil health principles is the key to healthier soils.",

This study compared response of soybean [ Glycine max (L.)

FeHBED and FeEDDHA‐1 gave positive responses to all measured parameters (chlorophyll level, dry matter production, Fe uptake) that were not significantly different (.05 level) from each other for the two cropping periods. The two products were similar in performance. FeEDDHA‐2 and FeEDDHSA generally gave lesser responses than FeHBED or FeEDDHA‐1. The relative effectiveness of the four materials to increase dry matter or Fe uptake was predicted by a simple laboratory test, which measures the proportion of applied Fe remaining soluble after a 1‐wk incubation with soil.",
