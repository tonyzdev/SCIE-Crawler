    "abstract": "The taxonomic reference base Florical and characteristics of the native vascular flora of New Caledonia.The floristic inventory presented here comprises the evolving computerised database Florical (http//www.botanique.nc/herbier/florical). As of the date of publication, it lists all native vascular plant species (as well as infraspecific taxa) present in the territory of New Caledonia, whether validly published or in press, along with their basionym, organised according to the most recent classifications systems (APG III 2009 for the angiosperms, Smith et al. [2006] for the ferns and lycophytes, and Mabberley [2009] for the gymnosperms), accompanied by their status (native or endemic) and the various vegetation types in which they occur. After a brief historical review of our knowledge of New Caledonian botany, the characteristics (richness, composition and endemism) of the different taxonomic groups (ferns and lycophytes, gymnosperms and then angiosperms -mono- and dicotyledons) are analyzed, followed by an assessment of the distribution of these groups among the vegetation types. The vascular flora of New Caledonia is characterised by its high level of richness (3371 species, including 3099 for the flowering plants alone), despite the absence or under-representation of some taxa that are abundantly represented elsewhere in the tropics, and especially by its remarkable distinctiveness (with endemism at the species level reaching 74,7%, and 77.8% for the flowering plants). The flora stands out by the presence of several relictual taxa and a high level of speciation among certain groups, despite the fact that the island was re-colonised relatively recently following the total submersion of its much older basement during the Paleocene and the Oligocene. Details of the measures taken to conserve this extraordinary natural heritage show that only 3.4% of the territory's total surface area is effectively protected. Despite the undeniable progress made in recent years by the authorities concerned, significant work remains to be done, especially in the northern Province.",

Two new Pauridiantha species from Atlantic Central Africa are also described and illustrated: Pauridiantha gracilipes O.Lachenaud & Ntore, sp. nov. and Pauridiantha principensis Ntore & O.Lachenaud, sp. nov. The former species is endemic to the Ogooué delta in Gabon, and resembles P. liebrechtsiana (De Wild. & T.Durand) Ntore & Dessein, but differs by the 2-locular ovary, the very long fruiting pedicels (12-18 mm) and the frequent presence of spines on the older stems – the last two characters being unique in the genus. The second species is endemic to Príncipe island, and differs from P. insularis (Hiern) Bremek., from the neighbouring island of São Tomé, by the more ascending secondary leaf veins lacking domatia in their axils, longer pedicels, and glabrous stipules. The conservation status of all three species is evaluated acccording to IUCN criteria: P. chlorantha (K.Schum.) Ntore & O.Lachenaud, comb. nov. is assessed as Endangered, P. gracilipes O.Lachenaud & Ntore, sp. nov. as Critically Endangered, and P. principensis Ntore & O.Lachenaud, sp. nov. as Near-threatened.

Elle se distingue de toutes les autres espèces de Polynésie orientale par la présence d'inflorescences comportant plus de 50 fleurs, par ses fleurs de moins de 7 mm de diamètre, par ses fruits violets à maturité, par ses pyrènes lisses sur la face dorsale et par son écologie particulière puisque se développant sur substrat calcaire. Seule représentante du genre aux Tuamotu, connue par moins de 80 pieds et menacée notamment par l'urbanisation à proximité de sa population principale, cette espèce est considérée comme «En danger» [EN] selon les critères de l'UICN.",

    "abstract": "Native Rubus were brought from North America to European botanical gardens in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and some were described as new species. Limited knowledge of Rubus in that era, typically combined with brief descriptions, led to many incorrect interpretations, causing much confusion (especially in North America). We established a project to clarify the identity of these confusing species by reviewing types and descriptions along with comparative work involving modern collections. We identified seven putative North American Rubus species named from early European garden collections: R. villosus Aiton, R. vulpinus Poir., R. pensilvanicus Poir., R. flagellaris Willd., R. inermis Willd., R. heterophyllus Willd., and R. argutus Link, and four other names in the early European botanical literature of possible North American origin: R. decumbens Thunb., R. inermis Thunb., R. enslenii Tratt., and R. floridus Tratt. We affirmed the current applications of R. flagellaris, R. argutus, and R. enslenii. Rubus villosus is identical with R. leviculus L.H. Bailey, while the taxon to which R. villosus was generally applied in the 19th century, R. allegheniensis Porter, appears to be identical with R. vulpinus. Rubus heterophyllus Willd. was identified as an earlier name for R. plicatifolius Blanch. Rubus inermis Willd. is identical with R. ulmifolius Schott and must have originated in the Old World. Thunberg's other American Rubus, R. decumbens, can be identified as R. arundelanus Blanch. Rubus floridus remains a puzzle. If its type represents a sample of a determinate flowering branch from a large, mounding dewberry, it is closest to R. grimesii L.H. Bailey, but it could also have been taken from a side-branch from an unknown upright blackberry. Another name for which identity could not be definitively established is R. pensilvanicus. It is allied with R. allegheniensis, but its type is insufficient to determine if it is an extreme form of that species, a related taxon, or a hybrid of it with a species of section Arguti (Rydb.) L.H. Bailey. We propose the name, R. revealii sp. nov. for the corymbose to weakly racemose Arguti previously considered as R. pensilvanicus sensu L.H. Bailey. Herein, we lectotypify R. abactus L.H. Bailey, R. arundelanus, R. decumbens, R. grimesii, R. inermis Thunb., R. invisus (L.H. Bailey) Britton, and R. vulpinus, and designate neotypes for R. argutus and R. heterophyllus.",

    "abstract": "The endemic New Caledonian Solmsia Baill. (Thymelaeaceae Juss.: Octolepidoideae Gilg) was founded in 1871 on two species, S. calophylla Baill. and S. chrysophylla Baill. Over the past 150 years, the genus has received little attention taxonomically or otherwise. New morphological, ecological and distribution information gathered from 484 herbarium specimens indicate that the two currently recognized species (evaluated as morphogroups) exhibit continuous, overlapping variation based on statistical multivariate analyses. Both partially sympatric morphogroups are treated here as conspecific under S. calophylla, the lectotype of the genus, and formal recognition of either group at any infraspecific rank is deemed unnecessary. The recircumscribed, single species is completely restricted to Grande Terre, where it occurs in maquis vegetation on ultramafic rocks (peridotite and serpentinite) and some form of ferrallitic soil (ferralsols/oxisols). Lectotypes, selected from a total of c. 55 sheets representing probable or possible syntypes, are designated for both of Baillon's binomials. Full descriptions are provided for the genus and species, accompanied by illustrations, photographs, a distribution map, and a preliminary IUCN conservation assessment of Near Threatened (NT). Morphological and biogeographical relationships of Solmsia are discussed in the phylogenetic context of other Octolepidoideae, a basal subfamily of Thymelaeaceae, along with the closely related, but massively disjunct, Guayana Shield-centered Tepuianthus Maguire & Steyerm. (formerly Tepuianthaceae Maguire & Steyerm.). Dehiscence and capsule size at maturity are also confirmed and documented, respectively, for the first time in the closely related, Deltaria Steenis, another poorly known New Caledonian monospecific endemic genus.",

Cryptocarya conduplicata Munzinger & McPherson, sp. nov. was previously confused with C. aristata Kosterm., which it resembles in its typically numerous lenticels and oblate fruit, but from which it differs most noticeably in its leaf blades partly folded longitudinally (vs blades flat), and its smaller fruits (13-15 mm long vs 20-30 mm long). Cryptocarya ovoidea Munzinger & McPherson, sp. nov. can be distinguished most easily from C. pluricostata, its sister species according to molecular data, by its indument (hairs sparse, whitish, cream-grey to blackish, quickly falling vs. hairs dense, ferrugineous sublanate and subpersistent in C. pluricostata). As well, the fruit of C. ovoidea, sp. nov. is ovoid and its perianth is caducous, in contrast to the fruit of C. pluricostata, which is ellipsoid and retains its perianth. The two new species are trees occurring in dense humid forest, and are restricted to non-ultramafic substrate. Cryptocarya conduplicata sp. nov. is common, known from three protected areas, and is assigned a preliminarily Least Concern IUCN status, while C. ovoidea sp. nov. is only known from two individuals on Mont Aoupinié, a protected area, where many inventory plots were established without finding any individuals; thus, we assign it a preliminary status of Critically Endangered (CR).",

    "abstract": "Faced with ambiguities in a previous typification of Isochilus pauciflorus Cogn., we present a revised typification of this name and comment on its synonyms. Our current study reviews the original materials in open databases of the 23 main herbaria that house orchids from A. Duss, A. Cogniaux or H. G. Reichenbach. Among specimens filed as types, a lectotype (BR0000013217891) is recognized and a presumed isotype (NY00059032) is rejected. However, the lectotype material is not sufficient for precise application of the name. Thus, we designate an epitype based on the specimen K000079638 which refers to the heterotypic synonym Ponera punctulata Rchb. f. to support the name I. pauciflorus. Furthermore, the holotype of P. punctulata commonly accepted and used in the literature is said to be in the Reichenbach Orchid Herbarium, at the Natural History Museum in Vienna (Austria). Unfortunately, this unique gathering is no longer extant or is missing there, but a photograph is available. From this picture, we show that this specimen was not original material, so it was not the holotype. We therefore designate a neotype of P. punctulata Rchb. f. supported by the specimen K000079638. In addition, we designate an epitype of Tetragamestus isochiloides Regel (LE00011188), heterotypic synonym of these above taxa. Finally, the type of Hexadesmia dunstervillei Garay, AMES00287200, is demonstrated to be a lectotype, not a holotype.",

Material of this small tree species was first collected more than fifty years ago but was confused with G. virgata Vieill. ex Guillaumin as both taxa have small leaves. Garcinia urceolata, sp. nov. differs from G. virgata in a number of features of the leaves, flowers and fruits. Garcinia urceolata, sp. nov. also grows at higher elevation and in wetter conditions than G. virgata. Both species are purported to have dehiscent fruit, along with other New Caledonian members of the genus, a distinctive character that was used to justify the description of the genus Septogarcinia Kosterm., which is no longer regarded as distinct from Garcinia L. Line drawings and colour photos are provided for both the new species and for G. virgata for comparison, along with a preliminary risk of extinction assessment for each of them, which indicates that G. urceolata, sp. nov. is Vulnerable (VU) while G. virgata is Near Threatened (NT).",

Adansonia, sér. 3, 31 (1): 47-87.Menispermaceae endocarps were very much used for long in the classification of this family. This organ also presents a definite palaeobotanical interest as it is often present in fossil state. The lack of a detailed knowledge on the endocarps of extant Menispermaceae limits the identification of those fossils. The present paper tries to fill this lack, describing endocarps of 116 species belonging to 55 different genera. The whole Menispermaceae family has drupaceous fruits, but there is an important morphological diversity of the endocarps, the differences between affiliated species being sometimes very slight. However, the comparisons with molecular phylogenies show that the differences between endocarps have a phylogenetic significance, to some extent. Menispermaceae endocarps are straight or underwent an often important curvature during their development. Almost all of these endocarps show a peculiar structure known as a condyle, which can have different aspects. Some characters, such as the endosperm structure and the style scar position on the pericarp, depend of endocarp characters, at least partially and with a few exceptions. Hypotheses on endocarp adaptation are limited by the lack of knowledge on the seed dispersal of this family. A key of the studied genera is proposed.",

Adansonia, sér. 3, 31 (1): 175-189.In spite of a recent publication of eight new species of Planchonella (Sapotaceae) from New Caledonia, three additional novelties are here described and illustrated (P. cauliflora, P. ericiflora, and P. minutiflora). Planchonella cauliflora was discovered in 2006 near La Foa and is the first and sole member in the archipelago with a cauliflorous inflorescence, a genus otherwise having axillary flowers (rarely ramiflorous). The other two were discovered among herbarium material but not earlier identified as new. A recent suggested hypothesis (Swenson et al. 2007b) that fruit morphology indicates phylogenetic relationships within Planchonella is supported. A ridged fruit with acuminate apices and a short style place P. cauliflora in their Clade D1, a clade confined to New Caledonia. Fruits of P. minutiflora are unknown, but based on ITS sequence data it belongs to the same clade as P. cauliflora and it is predicted that the fruit is similar. Molecular sequences of P. ericiflora are still missing, but based on a pear-shaped fruit, round apices and a fairly long style, we believe it is closely related to a different clade of Planchonella that is also restricted to New Caledonia. All three species have very narrow distributions and match the criteria of the IUCN red list as Critically Endangered. Planchonella contains henceforth 36 species in New Caledonia to which we here provide a diagnostic and an interactive online key under Xper2, available at ftp://ftp.ird.nc/pub/outgoing/biologie/herbier-nou/.",

To date, published Floras for Madagascar have recognized only three taxa of Canarium, but here we recognize 33 species, 27 of them new to science; this increases the number of accepted species in the genus by 33% worldwide and establishes Madagascar as a primary center of diversity for the genus. Despite its name, C. madagascariense Engl. proves to be one of the rarest and geographically most restricted species. Most Malagasy Canarium species are narrow endemic, and this is consistent with recent floristic and taxonomic research in other taxonomic groups on the island. The species of Canarium in Madagascar can be distinguished using mostly vegetative characters, and this will prove useful to foresters, ecologists, and conservationists. Most moist forests in Madagascar include multiple species of Canarium, and one important avenue of future research will be to further investigate the interdependence of the species of Canarium and the frugivorous lemurs that eat the pericarp of their fruits and possibly disperse their seeds.",

Les Cyperaceae cespiteuses, entierement detruites par l'incendie, ne se reinstallent que tres lentement a partir de semences. L'espace laisse libre est largement occupe par une espece jonciforme rhizomateuse (Lepidosperma perteres) qui, contrairement aux Cyperaceae precedentes, s'oppose a la progression du feu. La reconstitution du tapis vegetal apres incendie s'apparente donc a une autosuccession qui permet au maquis, si aucun facteur n'intervient pour provoquer un nouvel incendie, de retrouver a terme ses caracteristiques initiales. Toutefois, l'interruption du processus de reconstitution par un incendie precoce, entraine une proliferation de Pteridium esculentum.

La plupart des especes ont une pollinisation croisee assuree par quelques especes d'insectes, alors que quelques-unes sont facultativement autogames. Le type floral determine si une espece est originairement pollinisee par des Coleoptera, Diptera ou Hymenoptera. La plupart des fleurs sont du type Iris, probablement ancestral, consistant en trois unites bilabiees (meranthia) fonctionnellement separees, chacune ressemblant a une fleur gamopetale. Elles sont pollinisees par toute une serie d'abeilles, de taille moyenne a grande, et appartenant a plusieurs familles. Les specialisations liees directement au systeme de pollinisation incluent le raccourcissement des onglets des tepales et l'elargissement du limbe des tepales exterieurs, ainsi que l'acquisition de signaux nouveaux parallelement a la perte du nectar et du parfum. On passe alors du mode de pollinisation ancestral apiphile (abeilles-meranthium), au type cantharophile (coleopteres-« coupe peinte ») utilisant des Hopliinae. Des systemes de pollinisation plus generalistes (petites abeilles, Hopliinae et mouches), tendant a une musciphilie stricte, sont egalement reconnus dans le genre. Ils se caracterisent par une reduction des branches stylaires, une dedifferenciation des tepales externes et internes, formant un perianthe en tasse ou en coupe, et par un changement dans l'odeur florale. Enfin, un systeme de pollinisation tres active, impliquant le raccourcissement des onglets tepalaires et la presentation secondaire du pollen sur une colonne tres etiree, exploite des abeilles femelles de plusieurs familles butinant le pollen afin de nourrir leur progeniture.",

In New Caledonia, Pycnandra is the only sapotaceous genus with flowers that lack staminodes and Pycnandra subgenus Sebertia is characterized by small white flowers and fruits lacking stylar remnants. The fruits are characteristic with a scale-like epidermis that is translucent and peels off in P. acuminata versus brown and persistent in P. canaliculata. Using field data and applying IUCN criteria, we assess the preliminary threat as Least Concern (LC) for P. acuminata and Vulnerable (VU) for P. canaliculata.",

    "abstract": "The bark structure of Adansonia digitata L. is described in detail. Characters of the bark that are shared with other Malvaceae include the presence of strongly dilating rays, mucilage cells and cavities, druses of calcium oxalate in the cells of cortical parenchyma and phloem rays, a storied arrangement of sieve tube members and axial parenchyma strands, the presence of secondary phloem fibers and their arrangement into tangential bands. The secondary phloem fibers are longer (2.8–8.6 mm) and more abundant than the libriform fibers (1.7–2.2 mm) in the wood of this species. The abundance of parenchyma in both axial and radial parts of the secondary phloem and in the pseudocortex is a noteworthy feature. Due to the complementarity of fibrous and parenchymatous tissues, the secondary phloem can provide substantial mechanical benefits and apparently play an important role in the biomechanical stability of the trunk. The meristematic capacity of dilated phloem rays and the pseudocortex allow for substantial bark dilatation with very limited abscission of the outer portions of the secondary phloem. Subsequent phellogen initiation in the outer part of the secondary phloem was not observed, not even in mature bark. Hence no rhytidome is present. The thin translucent phellem, formed by continuous phellogen arising in the subepidermal layer, allows for photosynthesis to potentially occur within the chloroplast-containing cells of phelloderm and pseudocortex, even when the plants are leafless, thus probably assisting them to survive harsh climatic conditions. The formation of sieve tube members by transverse anticlinal divisions from fusiform cambial initials in A. digitata is a first report for the Malvaceae sensu lato.",

    "abstract": "Phytoecological analysis of the woody flora of High Sangha (Republic of Congo). The flora of the High Sangha, just like that of Congo as a whole, develops in the corridor of the \"Sangha River\" of Guineo-Congolian area. Still badly known, it is studied according to a North-eastern South-western floristic gradient, corresponding to a phytogeographical distribution extending from the Atlantic element (Nigero-Cameroono-Gabonese) to the Cameroono-Congolese element. On both side of the Sangha River, the surface of study is subdivided in three sectors whose central zone is the floristic junction between South-west and the North-East. The inventory of the individuals of dbh ≥ 10 cm counts 387 species of which 12 mark the South-western sector, 18 for the North-eastern sector and six for the central sector. The vertical distribution distinguishes three layers from unequal importance, of which the percentage of species oscillates from 24 to 42%. Floristic diversity, interpreted by the indices of biological diversity of Shannon (6.51 à 7.89) and Simpson (0.96 à 0.99), of the correlations of similarity of Jaccard (31 to 38%) and of Sørensen (62 to 76%) authenticates the floristic change throughout gradient of study, without any dominance of taxa. The weakest indices of biological diversity characterize the Central sector. The floristic composition of the three sectors, concomitantly, shows a reduction in the number of individuals for certain species, and concerning some others an extinction of their surface of distribution, as approaching or moving away from the Sangha River. The ecological characteristics of the flora show 77% of sarcochores and 88% of mesophylles. The ecological valence and the abundance-dominance ratio show that 72% of species are ubiquists and their density lies between three and five individuals/ha.",

DC., Pseudophaeopappus Wagenitz. Cypsela characteristics such as shape, size, colour, and surface pattern, hair structure, length, and colour of pappus are studied. Cypselas are 1.99 to 9.95 mm long and their width is between 1.01 and 3.73 mm. The pappus is 2.21 to 3.16 mm long. The pappus is generally straw-coloured, brown or whitish and barbellate but C. goksivriensis distinguished by its purple pappus and C. glastifolia by its plumose pappus. C. calcitrapa subsp. calcitrapa and C. calcitrapa subsp. cilicica do not have pappus. Scanning Electron Microscope analysis shows five different cypsela surface patterns for the studied species: reticulate, smooth, undulate, smooth-undulate, undulate-ruminate. A key to the taxa has been provided on the basis of these characteristics. The cypsela micro-macromorphological characteristics provide distinctive data for infrageneric classification for the studied species.",

Trois systemes de pollinisation, se chevauchant, impliquant des vecteurs polliniques appartenant a trois ordres d'insectes (Coleopteres, Dipteres et Hymenopteres), peuvent etre reconnus chez Sparaxis. Quatre especes (S. auriculata, S. caryophyllacea, S. variegata et S. villosa possedent des fleurs zygomorphes, bilabiees (de type « gosier ») dont les etamines sont appliquees contre un tepale dorsal erige ou encapuchonne; ces especes sont pollinisees essentiellement par des abeilles (Anthophorinae: Apidae) pour lesquelles le nectar est le principal attrait. Sparaxis metelerkampiae, a fleurs pourpre-fonce a long tube perianthaire, appartient a un ensemble local d'especes dont les membres possedent des fleurs de couleur semblable pollinisees par une mouche a longue trompe, Prosoeca peringueyi (Nemestrinidae). Sparaxis parviflora, aux fleurs minuscules bilabiees et odorantes, a antheres apparentes, est pollinise par des abeilles,melliferes autochtones, attirees par le pollen et le nectar. Les autres especes possedent des fleurs a perianthe actinomorphe et a tube floral etroit qui contient des quantites infimes de nectar; il s'agit d'especes non specialisees, visitees par un large eventail d'insectes dont des Scarabees (Hoppliinae), des Tabanidae a trompe courte et parfois des abeilles collectrices de pollen (chez S. bulbifera et S. fragrans). Une analyse phylogenetique suggere que la pollinisation par des Anthophorinae attires par le nectar est le syndrome ancestral dans le genre Sparaxis. Au cours de l'evolution, il y a eu, au moins une fois, changement du systeme de pollinisation impliquant des mouches a longue trompe puis, dans un clade une evolution vers des fleurs de plus en plus actinomorphes, liee au developpement d'un systeme specialise limite aux Tabanidae et aux Hopliinae a partir d'un systeme plus general impliquant des abeilles appartenant a diverses familles.",

Le Jardin botanique de Bogotá, fondé en 1955 et nommé en l'honneur de José Celestino Mutis, a joué un rôle central dans la conservation de la flore andine et des páramos. Couvrant 19,5 hectares, le jardin abrite 34 collections vivantes classées en groupes systématiques, écosystémiques, thématiques et taxonomiques. Ces collections soutiennent la recherche scientifique, l'éducation et la conservation de la biodiversité, en mettant en valeur des espèces issues d'écosystèmes variés, comme les páramos, les zones subxérophiles, les forêts de nuages, les forêts andines et les zones humides. Elles soulignent également la conservation d'espèces comme dans les Magnoliaceae, les Lamiaceae et les Orchidaceae, en mettant l'accent sur les plantes menacées et endémiques. Les recherches incluent la propagation ex-situ d'espèces en danger, telles que Senecio carbonellii S. Díaz et Puya spp., et des études écologiques sur leurs habitats natifs. Des espaces comme l'Arboretum, le jardin des plantes médicinales et le jardin agroécologique démontrent des pratiques durables et éducatives. Le jardin projette d'enrichir ses collections en priorisant les espèces menacées et en développant de nouvelles expositions, telles que les Rubiaceae. La mission du Jardin s'aligne sur des stratégies de conservation nationales et inter-nationales, renforçant son rôle comme centre de recherche, d'éducation et de patrimoine culturel. Avec 70 ans de réalisations, le Jardin botanique de Bogotá demeure un exemple significatif pour la biodiversité en Colombie.",

Ces observations indiquent qu'il existe quatre types de presentation florale parmi les membres sud-africains du genre. Le groupe de Romulea flava est essentiellement pollinise par des abeilles femelles appartenant a quatre familles d'Apoidea indigenes. Par contre, le groupe de Romulea monadelpha est pollinise exclusivement par des Coleopteres Hopliines (Scarabaeidae). Les especes du groupe de Romulea eximia presentent des caracteres morphologiques et de pigmentation rencontres dans les deux autres groupes et sont pollinisees par des abeilles ou des Coleopteres Hopliines, seuls ou en association. Les representants du groupe de Romulea hantamensis possedent des longs tubes floraux et sont pollinises par des mouches a longue trompe (Nemestrinidae). Les modes de pollinisation des Romulea sont, comparativement, moins abondants que chez d'autres genres d'Iridaceae de meme importance (e.g. Ixia, Lapeirousia). Le niveau de radiation adaptative relativement faible chez Romulea est une consequence de la conservation de caracteres de phenologie et de l'architecture florale. Une comparaison avec des extra-groupes semble indiquer clairement que la pollinisation par les mouches a longue trompe et celle realisee exclusivement par les Coleopteres representent un syndrome relativement recent derive d'une pollinisation principalement par les abeilles ou, de maniere moins specialisee, par l'association abeilles-Hopliines.",

Adansonia, sér. 3, 32 (1): 57-107.A review of the Thai species of the Calanthe group (Orchidaceae) is presented, based on the examination of over 500 herbarium and spirit specimens, and is a precursor for a later treatment in the Flora of Thailand. The group comprises the genera Calanthe R.Br., Phaius Lour, and Cephalantheropsis Guillaumin. In the genus Calanthe, 21 species are recognized, one of them being new but incompletely known as only a single flower was available for study. Calanthe angustifolia (Blume) Lindl. is newly reported for Thailand. Unusual forms of C. vestita Wall, ex Lindl. are commented on, and the extensive variation in the spur length of C. triplicata (Willemet) Ames is discussed. Five Phaius and one Cephalantheropsis species are recognized. Identification keys to the three genera and all species are given, and descriptions are provided for all species. A selection is illustrated by line drawings.",

A nomenclatural study of New Caledonia Psychotria s.l. is thus provided here, in order to enumerate valid, unvalid and illegitime names for the two genera Psychotria s.s. and Margaritopsis C.Wright (previously placed under Psychotria s.l.). Herbarium specimens are designated to lectotypify names that are already published in the two genera Delpechia Montrouz. and Douarrea Montrouz. New names and new combinations are proposed to bring names into accordance with the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. The synonymy of several specific and varietal names is provided; the correct names for 59 accepted species are retained for Psychotria s.s. and three for Margaritopsis. However, four species names of uncertain placement (incertae sedis) remain. It is estimated that the species richness of both genera occurring in New Caledonia should be increased to 85 species, due to the discovery of undescribed species found in herbaria and during fieldwork.",

    "abstract": "A colony of a fern, Lygodium hians E.Fournier (Schizaeales), studied on the southwest Pacific Island of New Caledonia, displays a growth form unusual for any member of this genus. Other living species of the genus Lygodium Sw. are characterized by twining fronds, with indefinite growth, which climb extensively on the support provided by other nearby vegetation. These fronds can arise from as early as the sporeling stage and fulfil both vegetative and reproductive functions, with spores produced in lateral sorophores in the upper parts of the fronds. By contrast, in L. hians, climbing fronds are only rarely produced and these carry terminal to subterminal sorophores. The main vegetative growth is of a low-growing (here termed ‘ground-clothing') frond-type, of definite, rather than indefinite, growth and of unusual dichotomous blade structure. This life form has survived, in this rare and little known remote species, under conditions of considerable ecological, as well as geographic, isolation in the mountains of New Caledonia. Blade/pinnule abscission occurs in L. hians in both ground-clothing and climbing fronds, therefore shed foliar units in the fossil record do not imply that ancient Lygodium were climbers. The features of L. hians, uniquely within Lygodium, provide morphological links with Schizaea Sm. and Actinostachys Wall. The morphology considerably expands our concept of variation in the genus Lygodium and suggests that this life form today may represent an evolutionary phase near to the early stages of diversification of the genus. For these reasons L. hians is worthy of inclusion in future molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses and should be incorporated in comparative studies by palaeobotanists studying fossil ferns.",

L'aspect caracteristique de 64 especes d'Iridaceae de morphologie florale similaire, ainsi que l'observation d'un grand nombre d'oiseaux, suggerent qu'en Afrique australe, la pollinisation s'effectue grâce a cinq especes de souimangas (Nectarinia: Nectarinidae) dans huit genres d'Iridaceae subfam. Ixioideae (Babiana, Chasmanthe, Crocosmia, Gladiolus, Tritoniopsis, Watsonia) et subfam. Nivenioideae Klattia et Witsenia. Chez les Ixioideae les fleurs de couleur rouge a orange, le perianthe a tube floral generalement tres long (30-60 mm) et les etamines unilaterales exsertes caracterisent les fleurs susceptibles d'attirer les oiseaux. Chez les Nivenioideae les fleurs vertes ou jaunes sont tubulaires (Witsenia), a etamines incluses, ou l'inflorescence en capitule est composee de petites fleurs actinomorphes enveloppees dans de grandes bractees foliaires formant une poche nectarifere. Toutes les especes pollinisees par les oiseaux secretent d'assez grandes quantites de nectar dont le volume, la concentration de sucres dissous et le rapport sucrose/hexose varient entre et a l'interieur des genres. La pollinisation par les oiseaux dans d'autres membres de la famille est suggeree pour plusieurs especes de Gladiolus d'Afrique tropicale et d'Arabie, ainsi que pour quatre especes de Tigridia (Iridoideae) du Mexique et d'Amerique centrale. I)u nectar riche ou dominant en sucrose caracterise les fleurs des Ixioideae mais quelques especes de cette sous-famille, pollinisees par les oiseaux, produisent un nectar a hexose dominant, le seul type connu chez les Nivenioideae.

Une autre nouvelle espèce, de Gymnosiphon Blume (Burmanniaceae), G. fonensis Cheek, sp. nov. est formellement décrite dans la Forêt Classée de Pic de Fon, Chaîne de Simandou, Guinée-Forestière, République de Guinée (Guinée-Conakry) en Afrique de l'Ouest. La nouvelle espèce était autrefois confondue avec G. bekensis Letouzey d'Afrique centrale et lui ressemble par ses larges lobes tépales externes plats, son tube du périanthe > 10 mm de long et sa fleur (sub) sessile. Cela diffère par ex. en ce que la longueur du tube de la corolle, (13-)14-18 mm, dépasse le diamètre de la corolle (10-11 mm) (vs longueur du tube de la corolle [12 mm] < diamètre de la corolle [12-15 mm]), les anthères insérées c. 4 mm de profondeur dans le tube de la corolle (vs insérées à l'embouchure de la corolle) et le rhizome est dépourvu de feuilles d'écailles (vs feuilles d'écailles présentes). Gymnosiphon fonensis Cheek, sp. nov. est la première espèce connue de son genre et de sa famille dans laquelle une présentation secondaire du pollen a été enregistrée. L'espèce est connue sur cinq sites, tous menacés, dans un seul emplacement basé sur les menaces, elle est donc évaluée comme étant en danger critique d'extinction (CR B1ab(iii)+D) selon la norme UICN 2012, ce qui en fait l'espèce de Gymnosiphon la plus menacée. évaluée en Afrique continentale. Nous fournissons des notes sur l'importance pour la conservation des plantes de la localité type, la forêt de Boyboyba, Simandou, qui possède la plus grande diversité d'espèces de Gymnosiphon et d'espèces mycotrophes achlorophylliennes, en Afrique de l'Ouest. La nouvelle espèce est illustrée par des photos en couleur et des dessins au trait et est cartographiée. Une clé d'identification est fournie pour les dix espèces du genre désormais connues d'Afrique et de Madagascar.",

    "abstract": "La transcription de haute qualité d'étiquettes d'herbiers par des scientifiques citoyens améliore la représentation taxonomique et spatiale d'une famille de plantes tropicales, les Annonaceae. Les spécimens d'herbier constituent une ressource importante et centrale pour la recherche sur la biodiversité. Rendre ces données accessibles sous forme numérique aux utilisateurs représente de nombreux défis, en particulier la transcription des métadonnées associées aux étiquettes des échantillons. Dans cette étude, nous avons utilisé le projet de science participative « Les Herbonautes» et le réseau Récolnat pour retranscrire les données spécifiques de toutes les étiquettes de spécimens d'herbier contenues au Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle à Paris d'une famille de plantes tropicales, les Annonaceae. Nous avons comparé cette base de données avec les données de biodiversité en libre accès et des listes taxonomiques expertes. Nous avons étudié l'apport de ces spécimens nouvellement transcrits au niveau spatial et taxonomique à l'échelle mondiale et nationale. Au total, 20 738 spécimens ont été transcrits sur une période de plus de deux ans, contribuant ainsi à enrichir et à étendre considérablement les données précédemment disponibles sur les spécimens et les espèces d'Annonacées au niveau mondial. Nous montrons que plusieurs régions, principalement en Afrique et en Asie du Sud-Est, non couvertes par les données en ligne, sont uniquement disponibles dans l'herbier P, probablement liées à l'histoire de l'exploration botanique du Muséum. Tout en reconnaissant les défis rencontrés lors de la transcription de spécimens historiques par les scientifiques citoyens, cette étude souligne l'impact positif de l'ajout de spécimens aux données globales à la fois aux niveaux spatial et temporel. Ceci est révélateur pour les chercheurs, les gestionnaires de collections, les décideurs politiques ainsi que les bailleurs de fonds. Ces ensembles de données seront précieux pour de nombreuses études futures dans le cadre de la recherche sur la biodiversité, notamment sur l'écologie, l'évolution, la conservation et sur l'impact du changement climatique sur la biodiversité.",

Currently, eight species are recognised, i.e. E. agharkarii, E. gilletii, E. glaucum, E. holstii, E. homblei, E. perrieri, E. superbum and E. ventricosum, and one variety, E. glaucum var. wilsonii comb. nov. Of the names, eight are illegitimate, and three dubious. A great confusion seems to be connected with E. ventricosum, which is indigenous in Africa. We consider that 14 names are synonymous with it. As herbarium specimens of type material are often of bad quality and sometimes completely undiscovered or perhaps lost completely, some typification is based on the drawings.

Toutes les Phanerogames parasites (sauf Cassytha) sont placees dans les deux sous-classes superieures de la classification des Dicotyledones de CRONQUIST.

On ne connait que peu d'exemples, parmi les Monocotyledones, les Dicotyledones et les Gymnospermes. Ces deux types de parasitisme se sont developpes independamment. Le mycoparasitisme apparait comme un phenomene ancien, issu des associations endomycorhiziales ancestrales. Le parasitisme direct apparait au contraire comme un phenomene moderne, qui se developpe dans des groupes taxonomiques recents; il est probable que les especes parasites deviendront plus nombreuses et plus specialisees dans l'avenir.",

Xylopia vieillardii Baill. is widespread in low elevation humid forests but the remaining two species, X. dibaccata Daniker and X. pallescens Baill., have restricted distributions and their ecology is still incompletely known. Xylopia pancheri shares similarities with the endemic Fijian species X. degeneri A.C.Sm. and X. vitiensis A.C.Sm.; the remaining three species share more traits with the Fijian endemic X. pacifica A.C.Sm.",

    "abstract": "Paepalanthus Mart. sect. Diphyomene Ruhland (Eriocaulaceae) is mainly diversified in the savannas of Central Brazil (Cerrado). This is an unusual pattern regarding the highest diversity of Eriocaulaceae in Southeastern Brazil (in the Espinhaço Range). Despite this interesting contrast, the geographic distribution of these species has yet to be explored. The present work aims to detail the geographic distribution of species of Paepalanthus sect. Diphyomene in order to discuss biogeographical patterns. The species are also categorized according to their risk of extinction, based on the IUCN criteria, establishing their conservation status and implications for the conservation of the Cerrado domain. Distribution maps were constructed for each species based on geographical coordinates obtained in the field or from herbarium specimens. All eighteen species occur in the Cerrado domain, with sixteen species exclusive to it, whilst Paepalanthus erectifolius Silveira and P. chiquitensis Herzog also occur in the Caatinga and Amazonian domains, respectively. We hereby confirm that the center of diversity of the section is situated in Central Brazil, more precisely in the Chapada dos Veadeiros, where eight species occur. Thirteen species are restricted to a single locality, and are categorized as critically endangered. Four species are regionally restricted, two of them are vulnerable, one is endangered, and the other one is considered of least concern, together with P. chiquitensis, a widely distributed species. The extension of occurrence of each species is used as a basis for their assessed conservation status. Our results reinforce the importance of the preservation of the Cerrado as a whole. The distribution patterns in association with the conservation status revealed important areas for conservation of the Cerrado, and corroborate the importance of previously established areas for conserving biodiversity.",

Nine taxa are recognized. Two new taxa from Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) are described and illustrated. Stolzia repens (Rolfe) Summerh. var. cleistogama Stévart, Droissart & Simo differs from the two other varieties of S. repens by its dorsal sepal, which is jointed to lateral sepal on one third of his total length, and by its smaller and non-reflected sepals and petals. Stolzia grandiflora P.J.Cribb subsp. lejolyana Stévart, Droissart & Simo is morphologically close to the type subspecies, endemic to Ethiopia, but differs from it by a longer inflorescence with two flowers that are smaller. The morphological affinity of S. grandiflora subsp. lejolyana appears to lie with the varieties of S. repens (Rolfe) Summerh. However, the new species differs by having inflorescences with two flowers and a longer and thinner peduncle. Stolzia cupuligera (Kraenzl.) Summerh. and S. peperomioides (Kraenzl.) Summerh. are neotypified. The position of S. thomensis Stévart & P.J.Cribb is reconsidered and proposed as S. peperomioides (Kraenzl.)

Recent advances in the molecular phylogeny of Sarcolaenaceae indicate that both Mediusella and Xerochlamys are not part of Leptolaena, requiring a generic recircumscription of the entities in the Leptolaena-Sarcolaena-Mediusella-Xerochlamys clade. The results of a previous multivariate analysis of morphological characters also showed that Mediusella and Xerochlamys include two and eight entities respectively, which are recognized here as distinct species. Three species of Xerochlamys (X. coriacea, X. itremoensis and X. undulata) are described as new, and Mediusella arenaria requires a new combination. The three new species are distinguished by their habit, the size, pubescence and margin of their leaves, and the structure of their inflorescences. A key to the species and information on their distribution, ecology and phenology are given. The conservation status of each species is evaluated according to IUCN Red List criteria; six species are considered endangered (EN), two are vulnerable (VU), one is near threatened (NT) and the last is of least concern (LC).",

    "abstract": "Hitherto characters derived mostly from macromorphology were used to distinguish among the members of Acanthopsis Harv., a taxonomically difficult group of plants endemic to arid parts of southern Africa. The taxonomic significance of leaf and bract indumentum in Acanthopsis was investigated using light, and scanning electron microscopy. Five non-glandular and three glandular trichome types were distinguished on the leaves and floral bracts. None of these trichome types are unique to the genus. Although the indumentum is variable in Acanthopsis, the density/dominance of specific trichome types was useful to distinguish among certain taxa, particularly on the abaxial surfaces of leaves and bracts. Each species of Acanthopsis has a characteristic trichome complement as far as dominant trichome types on both leaves and bracts are concerned. However, no obvious association between the type of trichomes and habitat (degree of aridity) or geographical distribution was evident.",

This species, morphologically close to F. africana Verdc .and F. macrocarpa Bosser, has been found on one single locality on Mayotte Island: Sazilé peninsula. The fact that the unique known population is facing high grazing, stomping, and cutting pressure, leads us to propose the IUCN criteria CR (critically endangered).

Adansonia, sér. 3, 32 (1): 39-55.Floral anatomy of the endemic Chinese species Magnolia decidua (Q.Y.Zheng) V.S.Kumar was studied in order to clarify its disputed relations within the family Magnoliaceae. Its most striking feature is a change in floral merosity, clearly demonstrated by the vasculature, the three perianth whorls being often pentamerous, while only the gynoecium might be considered as trimerous. Interestingly the androecium exhibits an intermediate condition, as the stamens are supplied by 15 vascular trunks, a pattern reminiscent of that previously described in Meiocarpidium Engl. & Diels (Annonaceae), with two levels of 15 trunks each. Perianth pentamery, almost completely lacking sclerenchyma at anthesis, as well as a sharp separation in the vascular supply of the perianth and sexual parts, characterize unmistakably this species from all other known Magnoliaceae, even though its relationship with Magnolia sect. Manglietia is otherwise strengthened by stamen and carpel pattern. This very unexpected pentamery — somewhat comparable to that of the monocot genus Pentastemona Steen. — is briefly discussed. The value of vascular anatomy as an additional but essential source of data to complement the standard phyllotactic and ontogenetic approaches used for the flower, is emphasized again.",

Anther histology is complex, with a thick hypodermal sclerenchyma on the abaxial side, reminiscent of that previously recognized in Uvaria scabrida Oliver, whose fruit resembles a pseudosyncarp. Gynoecial anthotaxy, 1 (2)-ovulate carpels and an outer compitum foreshadow the pseudosyncarpous fruit. Androecial and gynoecial vasculatures are free and both trimerous and pentamerous, following the likely basal condition in Magnoliales. A new kind of food body for the Annonaceae, found at the adaxial concave base of the inner petals, epidermal in origin with a lipidic spongy frame and showing no direct connection with venation, is briefly described.

To understand why ants are frequently encountered on most species of Carapa Aubl. (Meliaceae), we investigated the presence of extranuptial nectaries (ENNs) in all 27 species of the genus, spanning its entire distributional range in tropical Africa and America. We report for the first time in the genus the occurrence of extrafloral nectaries (at the base of the petiole, along the rachis of the pinnately compound leaf, on bracts) petaline nectaries (on the outer surface of petals), and pericarpial nectaries (on the surface of fruits), and confirm the presence of nectaries on leaflets in Carapa. Petiolar nectaries are the most common, occurring in 85% of the species. Nectaries were mainly active in young developing plant organs. Ants were observed foraging on exudates from these nectaries. The secretions from these glands help to explain the abundance of ants on Carapa trees. Although similar nectaries were also found in other members of the subfamily Cedreloideae, their position and frequency provide new characters for the identification of Carapa species in the field and the herbarium. As in other myrmecophilous plants, ENNs probably confer adaptive advantages to Carapa trees.",

    "abstract": "A synoptic revision of Olax L. from Madagascar and the Comoro Island Archipelago is provided based on morphological data gathered from a study of herbarium specimens. We recognize eight species of Olax occurring in this region, including three new species, O. antsiranensis, O. capuronii, and O. mayottensis. Olax antsiranensis has coriaceous leaves with an emarginate apex, a 5-petaled fl ower, and fruit with a weakly accrescent calyx. Olax capuronii has leaves of similar shape and size, but possesses a 3-petaled fl ower and a non-accrescent calyx in fruit. Olax mayottensis has larger acuminate leaves, 5 petals per fl ower, and a fruit which is completely surrounded by an accrescent calyx. All of the newly described species are of conservation concern because of their restricted ranges, with both O. capuronii and O. mayottensis considered endangered. Of the eight species treated here, six species are endemic to Madagascar, O. mayottensis is endemic to Mayotte, and O. dissitifl ora occurs in Madagascar, Tanzania, Mozambique, and northern South Africa.",

Detailed studies on the type specimens, protologue information and herbarium material of the taxa clearly indicated that the taxonomic status of S. marginata Boiss. is not correct. Here, this species is resurrected as a distinct species rather a synonym for S. deserti. In addition, S. cabulica Benth. is an incorrect synonym for S. deserti. In fact, after careful investigation on S. deserti complexities, it is considered as a valid taxon. The status of S. moniliformis Pennell is accepted here as a correct synonym for S. deserti. Also, the situation of S. kotschyi Boiss. is clarified as a printed matter and considered as a new synonym for S. deserti. Finally, S. sinaica Benth. resynonymized for S. deserti. Additionally, S. deserti and S. marginata are assigned to Scrophularia sect. Albomarginatae, sect. nov., based on some special morphological characters. A key as well as detailed descriptions along with illustrations and a distribution map for the studied taxa are provided. Finally, three lectotypes are designated for the group.",

Adansonia, sér. 3, 31 (2): 249-266.The Dioscorea sambiranensis species complex is endemic to Northern and North-Western Madagascar. Its taxa have broad, cordate leaves with petioles roughly equal in length to the blade, lax male inflorescences with flowers on long pedicels arranged in cymules of usually five or more flowers and flat discoid floral tori. Following study of its morphological variation, two new taxa in the complex are described and illustrated. Dioscorea buckleyana Wilkin was part of a mixed taxonomic concept under the invalid name D. sambiranensis R.Knuth subsp. ambrensis H.Perrier. It is glabrous like D. pteropoda H.Perrier, but differs in petiole and leaf blade morphology (especially blade texture), pedicel length and capsule morphology. Clarification of the limits of D. sambiranensis R.Knuth revealed an undescribed subspecies, subsp. bardotiae Wilkin, which differs in leaf blade and petiole dimensions, and lacks the surface ornamentation of the ovary and capsule found in subsp. sambiranensis. The relationship of D. sambiranensis with D. namorokensis Wilkin is revealed. Keys, descriptions and a distribution map are provided for all the taxa covered, and conservation status assessments given. The latter show that all of the taxa of the complex are, or are likely to be, threatened.",

Pour le compte du Musée royal d'Ajuda à Lisbonne, Feijó effectua les premières grandes récoltes botaniques dans tout l'archipel (1783-1789) qui, avec ses manuscrits, offrent un aperçu de la flore du Cap Vert telle qu'elle existait à la fin du XVIIIe siècle. Cette étude révèle des données uniques sur l'héritage des collections de Feijó, avec des détails de son expédition à travers l'archipel du Cap Vert. Ses récoltes, longtemps restées sous l'anonymat et éparpillées dans de nombreux Herbiers, ont été réunies spécialement pour cette étude. En outre, les manuscrits relatifs à ses récoltes d'herbiers sont discutés et les correspondances entre les déterminations du naturaliste et les noms scientifiques actuels ont été établies. Une numérotation de son herbier est proposée ici, fondée sur le système sexuel linnéen afin de faciliter les futures études de cette collection historique. Chaque spécimen d'herbier a été étiqueté avec de précieux renseignements issus des archives (récolteur, date) qui ont pour intentions de rendre hommage au naturaliste et de sortir cette collection du silence dans lequel elle se trouvait depuis plus de deux siècles. Enfin, les diverses tribulations de l'herbier Feijó au fil des années sont décrites et expliquées.",

    "abstract": "Peltiera Du Puy & Labat is a Malagasy genus of two described species thought probably to be extinct at the time of its publication in 1997, when it was known only from a total of three pre-1950 collections. However, recent field work in east-central Madagascar has resulted in the discovery of still extant populations, and therefore it is now possible to reconsider the phylogenetic position and status of the genus and its two species. Phylogenetic analyses based on molecular (chloroplast trnK and nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences) and morphological data corroborate the close relationship between Peltiera and Ormocarpopsis R. Vig., a genus of six species, also endemic to Madagascar. Peltiera differs from Ormocarpopsis mainly by having articulated, dehiscent fruits, and the two genera together are, in turn, sister to the widespread but mainly African Ormocarpum P. Beauv. Morphological, distributional and habitat data gathered from the new collections show that only a single species of Peltiera can be recognized, and as this species shares important synapomorphies with all species of Ormocarpopsis, it is transferred to this genus as O. nitida, comb. nov. A distribution map and photographs of O. nitida comb. nov. are presented, and a conservation threat analysis of the species is provided. The name Ormocarpopsis is lectotypified and an amended description of the genus with its new circumscription is given.",

Il contient des outils pour réaliser facilement et rapidement des analyses morphologiques et morphométriques sur des images de spécimens: mesures physiques (longueurs, périmètres, surfaces, angles), marquage et comptage de points d'intérêts, et annotations descriptives. Les images proviennent de sources variées: outre la base de données de l'infrastructure Récolnat (https://explore.recolnat.org/) en ligne, toute URL d'images en ligne, ou encore les images d'un disque dur, d'un appareil photographique, d'un microscope, etc. Ces bibliothèques d'images peuvent être classées à l'aide de l'outil de gestion de mots-clés du logiciel. Les annotations effectuées avec Annotate-On sont structurées par une liste de caractères descriptifs éditables – observations ou mesures – dédiés à une étude, une espèce, une hypothèse, etc. Ce modèle peut être importé depuis le logiciel Xper 3, logiciel de gestion de données sur la biodiversité (https://www.xper3.fr/), ou exporté vers lui.

The abundant material preserved today in Paris, thanks to the specimens collected in the course of the last 60 years by the botanists of the Museum (Guillaumin and above all H. S. MacKee), of the IRD (formerly ORSTOM), from the Research Center of Nouméa, or coming from foreign countries, mainly from Switzerland (Baumann, Hürlimann, Bernardi) and from USA (Lowry, McPherson), justified a new examination of the group. This examination however has proven to be rather delicate, the distinction between the different species, within a genus with sharp boundaries, appearing sometimes uncertain, their taxonomic features turning out to be enough fluctuating, at least in the case of numerous available specimens. So, the study below has to be considered as a temporary focusing, It is about 39 species, several of them including one or a few varieties. We have retained 11 of the 14 species mentioned by Guillaumin in his Flore analytique et synoptique de la Nouvelle-Calédonie, come out in 1948, all of them, except two, described by Mez. The other ones are introduced as new. But, following the surveys in the field actually going on, subsequent works are expecting to partly modify the proposed classification",

This paper presents a synoptic revision of the genus Lastreopsis Ching (Dryopteridaceae) in Madagascar. A new identification key is presented, along with new distribution maps. The presence of L. barteriana (Hook.) Tardieu, an African species, is indicated for the first time. Three new species are described: 1) L. coriaceosquamata Rakotondr. resembles L. boivinii (Baker) Tardieu but can be distinguished by differences in the morphology of the scales present on its rhizome and petiole base, which is brownish black, coriaceous, flat, and appressed; 2) L. manongarivensis Rakotondr. can be easily distinguished by its upright rhizome covered with red, membraneous scales; and 3) L. fidelei Rakotondr. has median sori similar to those of L. currorii (Mett. ex Kuhn) Tindale but can be distinguished by having non-gemmiferous fronds, median pinnae that are 1-pinnate-pinnatifid and indusia with entire margins. Two African species, L. currorii and L. subsimilis (Hook.) Tindale, have been cited in the literature as occurring in Madagascar, but the material from there differs clearly from the type specimens, and these taxa are no longer thought to occur in Madagascar. The type of Lastreopsis hornei (Baker) Tindale from the Seychelles, is fragmentary, and this name is treated as “insufficiently known”. Finally, a lectotype is designated for Nephrodium granulosum Baker, a synonym of L. boivinii.",

Several workers observed this type of nodal vascular trace in different angiosperm families, but with rather conflicting interpretations. The present study added another family — Euphorbiaceae — in the list of such nodal type and, based on the observation of different nodal configurations of the species Mallotus nudiflorus (L.) Kulju & Welzen (basionym Trewia nudiflora L.), the evolutionary consequences of “split-lateral” were discussed.",

In order to clarify the taxonomy of Phyllobotryon, we conducted univariate and multivariate analyses on sixteen quantitative and four qualitative characters scored from 111 fresh samples. Analysis of Variance revealed nine significant quantitative characters from which the first three Principal Components accounted for 74.6 % of the total variation. Results from Discriminant Analysis strongly support the existence of two groups (96.2 % and 100 %) representing Morphospecies 2 and 3, but morphospecies 2 is only weakly supported (88.9 %) as distinct from morphospecies 1. Characters such as petiole length, fruit surface ornamentation, style & calyx persistence, flower and fruit orientation and leaf shape are of taxonomic importance. A comparison of our three morphospecies to literature descriptions and available herbarium specimens matched up our morphospecies 1 to the published Phyllobotryon spathulatum Müell.Arg., while the two other morphospecies did not correspond to validly published taxa. Based on our results, the analyzed morphological variation suggests three morphological entities and one known species in the genus, and therefore a formal taxonomic status of the species rank should be considered for all three morphospecies. An identification key to taxa of the genus is provided.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of the floral characters in 17 species of Scrophulariaceae Juss. (belonging to 12 genera) was carried out through the tracing of their states as pictured by the organ vascularization. According to the statement of evolution (floral criteria) the character states were given evolutionary grades and the latter were “clipped” to their corresponding taxa. Trends of evolution in the floral characters were found to be gamosepaly, sympetaly, bilateral symmetry, reduction trends in the number of stamens as well as their vascularization and the occasional presence of a placental vascular cord as a fusion product of the carpellary ventral traces. None of the taxa under investigation could be considered as advanced over the other since all retained mosaic evolution expressed by variation in the vascular pattern in sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. In addition the obtained data confirmed that the line of evolution inside tribe Antirrhineae is from Antirrhinum majus L. (representing less advanced case) to Kickxia aegyptiaca (L.) Nábělek (the most advanced studied species). Russelia equisetiformis Schlecht. & Cham. occupied the lowest position vs Scrophularia xanthoglossa Boiss. (tribe Cheloneae). The ventral cord and lateral carpellary bundles pattern supported the taxonomic location of Paulownia tomentosa (Thunb.) and Torenia fournieri Linden ex E. Fourn. under family Scrophulariaceae.",

    "abstract": "One of the most remarkable features of Cactaceae are the areoles, axillary outgrowths, which produce trichomes, spines and leaves. The subfamily Opuntioideae K. Schum. shows the widest diversity of transition forms between leaves and spines, which represents anatomical evidence that spines and glochids are modified leaves. The purpose of this paper is to provide an anatomical description of the areolar structure in four species of Opuntioideae, in order that new anatomical homology between spines/glochids and leaves may be clarified. Different patterns of areole morphology are observed: 1) Austrocylindropuntia subulata (Muehl.) Backeb. showing terete and persistent leaves; areoles with persistent spines, glochids and trichomes; 2) Opuntia monacantha (Willd.) Haw. with terete caducous leaves and persistent spines, glochids and trichomes; 3) Opuntia rufida Engelm. with terete deciduous leaves and areoles with glochids and trichomes; and 4) Opuntia microdasys (Lhem.) Pfeiff. with early caducous leaves and areoles showing trichomes and leaf-spine and leaf-glochid transition forms. The development of the areolar structures is very similar in all species, following the description of the literature for other Cactaceae Juss. In O. microdasys is described a new anatomical character in the family: mucilage cells in the leaf-glochid transition forms, which may have functional importance for water storage in species devoid of persistent leaves.",

Two new species in the genera Goodyera R.Br. and Zeuxine Lindl. are described and illustrated. The morphological characters that distinguish Goodyera suprinii M.Pignal, sp. nov. from G. scripta (Rchb.f.) Schltr. are essentially a lip without internal lamellae at the hypochile (instead of lamellate), flowers and fruits forming an angle of 60° with the floral axis (instead of being erect almost parallel to the axis) and green ovoid fruits (instead of white and ellipsoid fruits). The characters that differentiate Z. mamiefoglianiae M.Pignal, sp. nov. from Z. samoensis Schltr. are an inflorescence with a greyish indumentum on the floral axis and bracts (instead of a green indumentum), lanceolate curved petals (instead of obovate angular petals), narrower, all-white terminal lobes of the lip (instead of bright orange-based lobes), a white throat (instead of bright orange throat), a greenish abaxial face (instead of bright orange face) and light brown internal appendages (instead of bright orange). Due to the high threats to the localities of these taxa, the proposed IUCN conservation status is EN (Endangered). The retention of G. scripta (Rchb.f.) Schltr. in the genus Goodyera R.Br. is proposed. Vrydagzynea albostriata Schltr. is mentioned for the first time in New Caledonia.

Analysis of the new specimens generated and examination of historical collections have resulted in a number of taxonomic advances regarding several endemic species of Atlantic Central Africa, or previously considered as endemic, and have resulted in updates of their known ranges. The following taxonomic changes are made: Ancistrorhynchus constrictus Szlach. & Olszewski is placed in synonymy under Ancistrorhynchus capitatus (Lindl.) Summerh.; Bulbophyllum mayombeense Garay is placed in synonymy under Bulbophyllum schinzianum Kraenzl. var. schinzianum; and B. kupense P.J.Cribb & B.J.Pollard is placed in synonymy under B. teretifolium Schltr., for which a neotype is designated. The geographical distribution of several taxa is amended: Aerangis megaphylla Summerh. is shown to be endemic to the island of Annobon; Polystachya superposita Rchb.f. is recognized as endemic to Cameroon, and Liparis suborbicularis Summerh. is known only from Nigeria and Cameroon. Three new records are indicated: Aerangis bouarensis Chiron for Cameroon, Bulbophyllum schinzianum Kraenzl. var. schinzianum for the Republic of Congo, and Liparis goodyeroides Schltr. for Liberia.

Adansonia, sér. 3, 31 (2): 413-425.The delimitation and relationship of several genera of Solanaceae are not resolved yet. The systematic position of Metternichia principis J.G.Mikan has long been discussed; recently it was split from Cestreae G.Don to a monotypic tribe Metternichieae Miers. The last proposal was supported mainly by the particular chromosome number of Metternichia. In addition, some pollen, anther and seed characters were used to separate Metternichia from Sessea Ruiz & Pav., the genus morphologically most closely related. An anatomical and vascular analysis of the flower was conducted to look for characters that contribute to its systematic position. The placental tissue placed in the base of the septum has never been described before in other Solanaceae species. Moreover, the process of formation of the middle petals, staminal bundles and the two vascular arcs placed on the base of the ovary, are particularities that have not been reported before in the family. The presence of two vascular arcs on the base of the ovary seems to be primitive features in the family as it happens in Humbertia madagascariensis Lam. (Convolvulaceae). The vascular characters in addition to chromosomal, pollen, anther and seed characters, postulated by other authors, support the independence of M. principis from Cestreae. Results are discussed and compared with previous reports on the family.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to study reproductive biology, seed germination and regeneration, through morphoanatomical and field observations and controlled experiments, to assess reproductive strategies in six rare Flourensia endemic to Central Argentina (F. campestris, F. hirta, F. leptopoda, F. niederleinii, F. oolepis, F. tortuosa). Structure of capitula, flowers, and achenes was described. Capitula were visited by a variety of insects. Achenes required 30–45 days to mature. Fruit set varied significantly among species. Flourensia campestris and F. oolepis were self-incompatible. Seed viability decreased after 19 months and was lost after 32 months. Flourensia oolepis and F. campestris had the highest germination percentages (>60%); the addition of gibberellic acid in 2-months old seeds did not influence germination. The remaining species had lower germination percentages (<30%). All species had xylopodia that were root and stem modifications. Burned individuals of F. campestris actively regenerated from underground buds of xylopodia, being suitable for restoration of degraded or burned areas. Flourensia campestris and F. oolepis had better reproductive success, but the remainder species can be considered at risk. Strategies should be implemented to protect them, such as to preserve its habitat together with attempts to increase their population sizes and maintain their pollinators.",

The first one, Gyrostipula comorensis Homolle ex J.-F.Leroy (tribe Naucleeae) was previously thought to occur on Great Comoro and Moheli, but is now also known from Anjouan, making it an endemic of the whole Union of the Comoros. An emended description is proposed here incorporating data from recent new collections. The two other species belong to the tribe Vanguerieae and are endemic to Mayotte. Peponidium ovato-oblongum (K.Schum.) Mouly, newly combined here, was previously placed under Psychotria, while a later name, Peponidium comorense, here placed under synonymy, has also been published. Pyrostria heliconioides Mouly, newly described here, has spathiform inflorescences, unusual within the genus. These three species, restricted to the Comorian islands, show more affinity to Malagasy than to continental African Rubiaceae.",

The inflorescence spathes and floral bracts are distinctive in being short, narrow at the base and attenuate. The species may be most closely related to A. cladocarpa Baker, which has up to four flowers per binate rhipidium and larger floral bracts that conceal the 3–4 mm long pedicels.

Two populations growing in different environmental conditions were studied: one is a coastal forest in the municipality of Rincón and the other is a mountain forest with karstic formations in the municipality of Isabela. The growth pattern in Buxus vahlii follows Champagnat's model. Four stages of development were identified: seedling, juvenile tree, mature tree and senescent tree. The stem and branches of the tree are sympodially built by the superposition of mixed orthotropic axes. Two different crown shapes have been recorded in B. vahlii in Puerto Rico: in the Rincón forest, the shape is laminar, while in Isabela, it is in-between a funnel and cup shape.",

L'acceleration evolutive du gynecee des Erycibeae est suggeree a la fois par la vascularisation et meme par la morphologie externe de l'ovaire.

Le genre comprend 74 especes d'herbacees decidues principalement terrestres croissant en milieux forestiers, dans des fourres ou en savane. Deux sous-genres sont reconnus. Le sous-genre Dryorkis comprend 44 especes, principalement de regions tropicales et subtropicales d'Afrique, de Madagascar et d'Asie. Il est defini par un appendice profondement bilobe et un pollen bacule vraisemblablement apomorphique. De plus, chez plusieurs especes les sepales lateraux sont fusionnes a la base et les bras du rostellum sont simples et non tordus. Le sous-genre Disperis comprend 30 especes surtout d'Afrique du Sud. Il est defini par un appendice entier et un rostellum avec des bras habituellement tordus. Dans les deux sous-genres on peut reconnaitre certains groupes bien definis d'especes morphologiquement proches et vraisemblablement apparentees. Cependant il existe plusieurs « formes » singulieres qu'il semble premature de reconnaitre formellement en tant que taxa. Nous considerons qu'elles forment des « groupes informels ». Le sous-genre Disperis est apparemment un groupe monophyletique, mais le statut phylogenetique du sous-genre Dryorkis reste incertain. La valeur taxonomique de plusieurs structures vegetatives et florales est brievement discutee.",

    "abstract": "1802 : le tout jeune Muséum devient éditeur scientifique et publie les premières Annales. 2018 : presque 220 ans plus tard, les périodiques du Muséum sont publiés en flux continu, disponibles en accès libre diamant et au format XML. Cette modernisation technologique opérée par l'équipe des Publications scientifiques s'est étalée sur 20 ans.En 1997, les Bulletins du Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle changent de forme et prennent les noms des périodiques que nous connaissons aujourd'hui. La Section A, Zoologie, biologie et écologie animales devient Zoosystema ; la Section B, Adansonia : Botanique, Phytochimie devient plus simplement Adansonia ; enfin, la Section C, Sciences de la Terre, paléontologie, géologie, minéralogie devient Geodiversitas. La revue Anthropozoologica, quant à elle, rejoint les rangs des journaux scientifiques du Muséum en 2004, pour ses vingt années d'existence. Elle est suivie par l'European Journal of Taxonomy (EJT), lancée en 2011, qui jouera un rôle d'incubateur pour la mise en place de nouvelles technologies pour les revues du Muséum.Dès 1997, celles-ci entrent de plain-pied dans l'ère des revues scientifiques internationales. Car au-delà d'un simple changement de format, c'est leur mode de fonctionnement dans son intégralité qui vit une véritable révolution : alors que les Bulletins étaient gérés par l'assemblée des professeurs du Muséum, le processus d'acceptation des nouveaux périodiques s'appuie désormais sur une évaluation par les pairs, et chaque revue, gérée par un rédacteur en chef, est cautionnée par un comité scientifique composé d'experts internationaux reconnus. Alors que les Bulletins héritaient d'une longue tradition académique, les nouveaux journaux se dotent de titres courts, favorisant la citabilité des articles d'une part, le bon référencement de la revue sur internet et par le Journal Citation Report d'autre part, ainsi que d'une maquette commune. La parution régulière des articles — les derniers vendredis de chaque trimestre — sur papier et sur internet à partir de 2000, et l'ouverture des revues aux articles en langue anglaise finissent de les professionnaliser aux yeux de la communauté scientifique internationale.L'indexation par le Journal Citation Report et l'obtention d'un facteur d'impact pour Geodiversitas, Adansonia et Zoosystema d'abord, puis pour Anthropozoologica et, enfin pour le tout jeune EJT, consacreront ces efforts. L'élargissement régulier de la distribution des revues du Muséum ces vingt dernières années, via les échanges de la Bibliothèque centrale au départ, puis via le site des Publications scientifiques (en 1999, 2004 et 2015 pour la version actuelle) et le portail BioOne (en 2009), s'est aussi révélé une stratégie gagnante. Les articles publiés dans les revues du Muséum sont désormais distribués dans plus de 2 500 universités, et accessibles en ligne, gratuitement et librement, sur le site internet des Publications scientifiques.Les revues scientifiques du Muséum doivent accroître encore leur rayonnement et maintenir leur haute qualité technique et scientifique. Le passage à un flux de publication continu répond à une demande accrue de réactivité de la part des chercheurs. La conversion des articles au format XML permet, à la fois, l'archivage pérenne des articles et le renseignement des grandes bases de données de la recherche. La distribution des articles, d'un côté via le site des Publications scientifiques et de l'autre, via BioOne, ainsi que l'intégration des anciens numéros dans la Biodiversity Heritage Library permettront aux résultats scientifiques originaux confiés aux revues du Muséum de perdurer encore pendant des décennies.",

Seulement 65 % des espèces actuellement décrites ont fait l'objet d'une révision récente, postérieure à 1967. Les Fabaceae ne font pas exception puisque seule la sous-famille des Mimosoideae (ex Mimosaceae) a été révisée en 1983. Depuis, seules quelques espèces de Fabaceae ont été décrites. La majorité des genres de Papilionoideae de Nouvelle-Calédonie possèdent moins de cinq espèces et seulement deux genres sont endémiques de l'archipel : Nephrodesmus Schindl. et Arthroclianthus Baill., situés dans la tribu des Desmodieae, et possédant respectivement six et 19 espèces. La seule monographie d'Arthroclianthus remonte à plus d'un siècle et la dernière espèce décrite au sein de chacun de ces deux genres remonte à plus de 80 ans. Actuellement, l'identification des espèces s'avère délicate en raison de confusions taxonomiques. Dans le but d'améliorer la connaissance botanique des Papilionoideae de Nouvelle-Calédonie, une clarification nomenclaturale et taxonomique d'Arthroclianthus et Nephrodesmus est ici proposée. Cet article constitue ainsi la première étape de la révision de ces genres. Nous réduisons à 12 le nombre d'espèces d'Arthroclianthus, suite à la mise en synonymie de six taxons et l'exclusion d'une espèce, et à quatre le nombre d'espèces de Nephrodesmus. Le genre Nephrodesmus est typifié. Trois lectotypifications spécifiques sont effectuées pour le genre Nephrodesmus et neuf pour Arthroclianthus.",

Whereas osmophores have been well-documented in flowers of several families, they are barely mentioned in the Asteraceae. The aims of this study are to: 1) determine the occurrence of osmophores in corollas of 39 species of the tribe Onoserideae and the only species of Famatinantheae with histochemical methods; and 2) analyze the morphology and structure of osmophores in these groups. Histochemical and histological techniques revealed osmophores in the marginal and in the central corollas of Famatinanthus Ariza & S.E. Freire and Plazia Ruiz & Pav. at the apex and margin of the corolla lobes, and at the sinuses. Osmophores were confirmed following positive staining reactions for TIOFH and TIOFH3 (Neutral Red, Oil Red O, and Iodine-Potassium-Iodide); the samples reacted negatively for Benedict's test for detecting reducing sugars. The osmophores found in this study are constituted uniquely by a papillose or non-papillose epidermis, or they extend into the mesophyll forming scent glands. In both cases, they are associated to stomata and starch grains. The corollas of the other species of Onoserideae did not react positively for osmophores.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the genetic diversity of species and populations is critical for evaluating extinction vulnerability and provides important information for identifying populations of concern and/or those that should be targeted for breeding material. Baobabs (Adansonia L.) are botanical icons for conservation, with increasing attention regarding their threatened status from both scientists and non-scientists alike. Baobabs are of particular interest especially in Madagascar, where six of the eight species are endemic, and three are listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Although A. madagascariensis Baill., A. rubrostipa Jum. & H. Perrier and A. za Baill. are more widespread and classified by IUCN as Least Concern, they show regional variation, which may reflect hidden genetic diversity or even the existence of cryptic species. Here we assess the genetic diversity of the Malagasy baobabs to serve as a basis for future conservation and management planning. Our study used a targeted sequence capture approach (hybrid enrichment) to obtain hundreds of low-copy nuclear loci with phased alleles to assess genetic diversity in the six species and their major regional subpopulations. We discuss the implications of proper delineation of species taxonomy for management issues associated with conservation. We hope such genetic information will guide more targeted population genetic assessments and inform conservation and management efforts, including identification of isolated or disjunct populations that may warrant targeted actions.",

L'étude a démontré que les caractéristiques générales des glandes et des trichomes étaient constantes parmi les différentes populations d'une espèce donnée, mais qu'elles présentaient une variabilité utile pour la délimitation des espèces et leur regroupement. Les caractéristiques permettant un diagnostic fiable sont la longueur du pédoncule des glandes, la répartition des types de trichomes et des glandes sur les différents organes, la densité des trichomes et des glandes, ainsi que le nombre, la longueur et l'épaisseur des rayons des trichomes. Nos résultats confirment le retrait de Matthiola alyssifolia (DC.) Bornm. du genre. L'espèce était unique dans la distribution des types de trichomes et des glandes sur divers organes tels que les tiges, les pédicelles, les sépales et les feuilles. Parmi les autres aspects importants, citons la présence ou l'absence de glandes et de trichomes, la répartition des trichomes et des glandes simples et à 2-4 rayons sur les surfaces abaxiales (ou sur les deux) des feuilles et sur le bord des feuilles, et la soudure des pédoncules des glandes.

    "abstract": "This monumental monograph is the scientific legacy of one of the greatest botanists of the xx th century, patiently worked out during an exceptional 64-year carreer, meticulously formatted by an active team of about ten collaborators, mainly from the Smithsonian Institute, lavishly illustrated by the famous artists Florence Lambeth and Alice Tangerini and luckily completed by a wide panel of about 25 specialists from Panama, Colombia, Venezuela and Chile.In brief this work combines unusually advantages of unity in research scope by an individual and power of a collective action.The subtribe Espeletiinae Cuatrec.contains eight genera whose seven are dealt here: Espeletia Mutis ex H.&B., Carramboa Cuatrec., Tamania Cuatrec., Libanothamnus Ernst, Ruilopezia Cuatrec., Coespeletia Cuatrec.and Paramiflos Cuatrec.The genus Espeletiopsis Cuatrec., previously studied (Cuatrecasas 1976(Cuatrecasas , 1996)), is no more taxonomically described.This group is highly remarkable by exhibiting strange habits, convergent with those of the giant Senecios also growing at high altitudes, but in East African mountains.The whole treatment, nicely introduced by a history of botanical exploration of northern Andes, demonstrates a deep and accurate knowledge not only of the plant life on the field, but also of the morphoanatomical, ecological and functional researches.For example comparative studies of life forms (Chapter 2) use extensively numerous classical works, among them those of Humboldt, Wilhelm Troll, Francis Hallé, in order to define accurately the characteristic \"caulirosulan\" architecture.Interestingly histological adaptation to freezing and dry conditions is mainly expressed by a multilayered hairy cloak on the stem, crowded lanate leaves able to move (nyctinasty) for sheltering the apical bud and a compact pith.So, as in other plants of high altitudes (e.g.Rheum in Himalaya), a microclimate is created at the body level, and other alteration is no more needed in inner tissues.",

Plus récemment, P. gabrielleana Vanderpl. et P. favardensis Kuethe ont été décrites de Guyane Française et partagent de nombreux traits avec ces taxons. Quatre expéditions en Guyane Française, de 2008 à 2017, ont montré que P. laurifolia, comme décrite dans la dernière révision de l'espèce, n'y est représentée que par quelques individus cultivés, introduits des Antilles. A l'inverse, P. gabrielleana est régulièrement trouvée le long des fleuves et des côtes, et dans des fossés humides, en particulier sur l'île de Cayenne où P. tinifolia était considérée comme commune par Antoine de Jussieu. Les données de terrain et d'herbiers nous montrent que P. gabrielleana est également présente dans les régions voisines du Brésil et du Suriname. La grande fréquence de P. gabrielleana sur le locus classicus de P. tinifolia, l'absence de formes spontanées de P. laurifolia, et les nombreuses similarités entre ces taxons nous poussent à ressusciter le nom de P. tinifolia et à placer P. gabrielleana, P. favardensis, P. oblongifolia et P. laurifolia var. tinifolia en synonymie. En corollaire, seul le nom de Granadilla laurifolia est maintenu comme synonyme de P. laurifolia.",

Mussaenda glomerulata was first studied by Lamarck and later published by Poiret (1797), based on specimens collected by L. C. Richard; a specimen of M. glomerulata was found in the Lamarck herbarium, which is here selected as lectotype. Mussaenda glomerulata was concluded to be synonymous with Amaioua corymbosa Kunth. Because M. glomerulata has priority over Amaioua corymbosa, the new combination Amaioua glomerulata (Lam. ex Poir.) Delprete & C. Persson, comb. nov. is here proposed. The obscure Octavia DC. was published by Candolle based on specimens with ovaries and fruits. After a detailed analysis of the type specimens, we inferred that the flowers of Octavia are always terminal, although sometimes they might appear axillary because of overtopping axillary shoots (pseudoaxillary). Additionally, what Candolle interpreted as 8-merous fruits is a misinterpretation, and they are instead fleshy berries with eight seeds. With these new observations in mind, we concluded that Octavia sessiliflora is synonymous with Cordiera triflora A.Rich in DC. Full synonymy, typification of the taxa involved and representative specimens of this species are here presented.",

The genus was initially described for a species bearing fusiform fruits, and occurring in the southern part of New Caledonia, viz. A. bracteatus Schltr. & K.Krause. Another species, A. heterophyllus (Montrouz.) Guillaumin & Beauvis. with oblong leaves and oblong ovoid fruits was described for New Caledonia, but initially under Gardenia Ellis and this for the North of the archipelago. During later revisions and supplementary descriptions of species in the genus, both species carrying heteromorphic leaves were reconsidered. The name A. bracteatus was placed in synonymy of A. heterophyllus; while keeping a delimitation of the species restricted to the southeastern populations. This situation ended in the re-description of the northern species, named A. balansaeanus Guillaumin. The results of the present work, based on the examination of herbarium specimens and literature, disentangles the collusion for A. heterophyllus vs A. bracteatus. Hence, the correct name typifying Atractocarpus is A. bracteatus. In regard to the destruction of the holotype for A. bracteatus in Berlin (B) and of two of the syntypes for A. heterophyllus in Lyon (LYJB), typifications for these species names are proposed. To clarify their taxonomy, complete descriptions, lists of specimens and illustrations are provided for both species.",

Weinmannia aggregata is clearly related to W. venusta Bernardi (sect.

La proximite moleculaire des genres Cardiochlamys et Cordisepalum est confirmee par la vascularisation originale de leurs receptacles, tres reguliere et avec une composante trimere. La grande disjonction des deux genres (le premier de Madagascar, le second du Sud-Est asiatique) est marquee par la specialisation plus grande des antheres chez Cordisepalum et du gynecee chez Cardiochlamys. L'acceleration evolutive constatee dans les pieces sexuees s'est neanmoins effectuee en maintenant certaines plesiomorphies, notamment les connectifs histologiquement tres proches de ceux des Humbertieae, Erycibeae et meme Maripeae et la permanence du soubassement placentaire, vestige du placenta massif primitif.

Taxonomic, nomenclatural and biogeographical discussions on the species close to O. superba Engl.Description of three new taxa of Ouratea: O. paraguayensis Hassl. ex Sastre & Offroy from Paraguay and Bolivia, distinct of O. superba Engl. which occurs in Amazonian Basin and the Guyanas, by its smaller flowers and the leaf margins serrate, not serrulate; O. paraguayensis f. boliviensis Sastre & Offroy with inflorescences larger than in the forma paraguayensis, and with conical buds, not obovoid, with many specimens intermediate between both forms; O. pastazana Sastre & Offroy, endemic from Pastaza Province in Ecuador, with flowers of the same size as those of O. paraguayensis, but with the leaf margins serrulate as in O. superba. Comparisons are made with two other Venezuelan vicariant species also with small flowers, O. marahuacensis Maguire & Steyerm. (Amazonas state) and O. apurensis Sastre (Apure state). The peri-Amazonian distribution of the species with small flowers, suggests an old area of the ancestral species of which populations became isolated during dry Quaternary periods, each isolated population giving, by genetic drift, endemo-vicariant species. Both O. paraguayensis formas suggest the presence of a cline, perhaps responsible, actually, for a specific sympatric differentiation. Ouratea superba and some synonymous taxa are lectotypified.",

The aim of the present study is to explore the contribution of the micro-floral characters in understanding the relationships among the studied species of Brassicaceae as well as the evolutionary trends in calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium. It was concluded that the vascularization of sepals, petals, stamens, nectaries and carpels was considered diagnostic and reliable characters at the specific level. The reduction and presence of vascular complexes was found to be at the top of the floral evolutionary trends. The micro-floral data were discussed in the view of dicta of evolution which facilitate the construction of proposed schematic presentation showing the line of advancement within each tribe. The line of advancement in tribe Brassiceae (representing 14 studied species) is from the primitive Raphanus sativus L. to the advanced Eruca sativa Mill. To rule the line of evolution within other tribes, the number of studied taxa should be increased.",

Our current paper will continue the researches devoted to the typification of Primula names, on the base of expert studying the specimens in herbaria BM, E, G, K, LE, MHA, MW, NS, NSK, P, W, WU, Z and open databases. In 1886 Franchet published an article: “Observations sur deux Primula monocarpiques de la Chine et descriptions d'espèces nouvelles de la Chine et du Thibet oriental” and described 11 new species: P. davidii Franch., P. forbesii Franch., P. heucherifolia Franch., P. incisa Franch., P. malacoides, Franch. P. malvacea Franch., P. membranifolia Franch., P. moupinensis Franch., P. oreodoxa Franch., P. ovalifolia Franch. and P. poissonii Franch. For P. davidii and P. heucherifolia we found only one herbarium sheet for each and they will be holotypes. For eight species: P. forbesii, P. malacoides, P. malvacea, P. membranifolia, P. moupinensis, P. oreodoxa, P. ovalifolia and P. poissonii were selected lectotypes from several herbarium sheets. The name Primula incisa is later homonym and early was used by Lamarck (1779), so correct name for this taxon is P. blinii H. Lév.",

No original material for Arctotis staticifolia has been traced. The protologue is inconsistent with any known Arctotis L. species and previous treatment of A. staticifolia as a synonym of Gazania linearis (Thunb.) Druce var. linearis is not supported. The protologue for Arctotis staticifolia is most consistent with a narrow-leaved taxon of Dimorphotheca Vaill. ex Moench and specifically D. nudicaulis (L.) DC. var. graminifolia (L.) Harv. A neotype for Arctotis staticifolia is designated consistent with our interpretation and the name is formally placed in the synonymy of Dimorphotheca nudicaulis var. graminifolia. Arctotis tenuifolia Poir. has previously been treated as a synonym of Dimorphotheca nudicaulis var. graminifolia. Original material was located and the name Arctotis tenuifolia Poir. is here lectotypified and is placed in the synonymy of Ursinia tenuifolia (L.) Poir. subsp. tenuifolia. Arctotis tenuifolia Poir. is a later heterotypic homonym of Arctotis tenuifolia L. and is therefore nomenclaturally illegitimate. A lectotype is designated for Sphenogyne tenuifolia (L.) DC. var. heterochroma Harv., a synonym of Ursinia tenuifolia subsp. tenuifolia.",

Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronquist et Solidago chilensis Meyen (Astéracées, Astérées) sont principalement connues comme mauvaises herbes. Le but de cette enquête était de caractériser leurs structures sécrétrices internes aux feuilles, et de détecter les principales substances qui y sont accumulées ainsi que les saponines. Les plantes ont été récoltées à Berisso, Gonnet et La Plata, Argentine. Les spécimens d'herbier ont été déposés dans l'herbier du LPAG. Les feuilles conservées dans de l'alcool à 70°, ont été sectionnées transversalement ou on fait l'objet d'unn éclaicissage, toutes ont été traitées par des colorants et des réactifs. Des réactions colorimétriques histochimiques et phytochimiques ont été réalisées. Les cavités des nervures principales (du 1er au 3e ordres) sont du côté du phloème. Elles se retrouvent au-dessus et/ou au-dessous des faisceaux vasculaires dans les nervilles mineures (ordres 4 à 6) et le mésophylle chez S. chilensis, mais sont absentes dans les veinules (ordres 5 et 6), et le mésophylle chez C. bonariensis. Ces cavités sont entourées de 1 à 3 couches de parenchyme attaché. En vue paradermique, sur les veines majeures, la file de cavités est enfermée dans un faux conduit formé par les cellules de parenchyme attachée ressemblant à véritable conduit. Sur les veines mineures et le mésophylle, des cavités isolées ou en petits groupes ont été trouvées. Dans la lumière des cavités, des résines, des composés phénoliques et lipophiles ont été identifiés. Des saponines dans les feuilles ont également été trouvées chez les deux espèces. Ces cavités sont les structures sécrétrices internes de Conyza bonariensis et Solidago chilensis, accumulant des substances de nature chimique diverse, potentiellement utiles à la médecine et au contrôle biologique des pathogènes afin d'améliorer les systèmes agricoles durables.",

L'article élucide la question de la présence supposée d'une espèce à aire de répartition restreinte, Alopecurus laguriformis Schur ex Griseb. & Schenk, en Ukraine. L'étude montre que cette information provient des publications de Zapałowicz (1889, 1906) basées sur des spécimens d'A. pratensis mal déterminés. La révision de la littérature et des données d'herbier ainsi que les enquêtes de terrain indiquent qu'en fait A. laguriformis n'est pas présente dans la partie ukrainienne des Carpathes et que son aire de répartition est limitée à la Roumanie. La confusion dans la circonscription de l'espèce est clarifiée et son contexte historique est décrit. Le nom Alopecurus laguriformis est lectotypifié ici à partir de spécimens conservés à GOET. Comme le nom de l'espèce a été mentionné pour la première fois par Shur (1850) en tant que nomen nudum, alors que sa description originale a été fournie par Grisebach & Schenk (1852), la citation correcte pour le taxon est Alopecurus laguriformis Schur ex Griseb. & Schenk ou Alopecurus pratensis L. subsp. laguriformis (Schur ex Griseb. & Schenk) Tzvelev, en fonction du traitement taxonomique.

In this study, I describe the anatomy of stem and caudex of ten species of succulent plants from eight plant families in the Rosids clade. There are two characteristics of wood among all species with single continuous cambium or successive cambium: 1) extensive parenchyma tissue in ray system and/or axial system; and 2) extensive thin-walled fiber tissue in the axial system. Out of ten species, five present proliferation of the parenchyma tissue in their radial system: Ceropegia africana R. Br., Momordica rostrata Zimm., Oxalis megalorrhiza Jacq., Adenia glauca Schinz and Cyphostemma juttae (Dinter & Gilg) Desc. Five species were fibrous-wood succulents: Jatropha curcas L., J. macrantha Müll. Arg., Adenium obesum (Forssk.) Roem. & Schult., Pelargonium carnosum (L.) L'Hér. and Moringa drouhardii Jum. Out of ten, one presents an axial system without visible fibers: Cyphostemma juttae (Dinter & Gilg) Desc. Despite to belong to seven different orders, the studied species show structural similarity: extensive parenchyma in the ray system and thin-walled fibers in the axial system. These results suggest multiple independent origins for the anatomical structure of succulence.",

La plante a été séquencée (ITS) et son attribution au genre Oxyrhynchus a été confirmée. Les caractères morphologiques ont ensuite permis de montrer qu′elle se différencie de toutes les espèces déjà connues, et donc qu′il s′agit d′une espèce nouvelle, qui est décrite. La plante n′est connue que d′une seule localité et de sept individus; nous lui attribuons donc un statut préliminaire en danger critique d′extinction (CR).",

    "abstract": "The anatomical and morphological structure of the seeds and vegetative organs of the endemic caudiciform plant of South Africa Petopentia natalensis (Schltr.) Bullock (Apocynaceae) has been investigated at different stages of ontogenesis: seedlings, juvenile and immature plants. It has been noticed that endosperm of P. natalensis seeds is developed similar to endosperm of seeds of mesophytic representatives of the Apocynaceae family. Seedling hypocotyl is also of mesophytic type in contrast to those of such succulents as Adenium obesum (Forssk.) Roem. & Schult. and Pachypodium lamerei Drake. In juvenile plants of P. natalensis the hypocotylous zone is constantly increasing to form an enlarged basal part of the stem. Conducting tissues have a different pattern of development in the hypocotyl and epicotyl. In the basal part of the stem they are represented by collateral vascular bundles scattered among the parenchymal cells, while in the climbing part of the stem, the conducting system is represented by a complete ring. Unlike other immature caudiform plants, P. natalensis has the bundle type of conducting system. As a rule, the basal expanded part of the P. natalensis stem is formed exclusively from the hypocotyl and it occurs mostly due to generation of abundant number of cortical and pith parenchymal cells.",

It is included in the South African Alien and Invasive Species Lists as a prohibited species absent in the country. However, judging from available data, in South Africa it has become a locally naturalised weed of cultivated land and apparently is difficult to eradicate. A. verlotiorum indeed is a pernicious weed in many regions of the world, appearing to be much more invasive than A. vulgaris, especially in warm-temperate and subtropical climates.

A new species of Araliaceae, Meryta puruhi Butaud, J.Florence, Lowry & F.Tronchet, sp. nov., endemic to the raised atolls of Anaa and Niau in the Tuamotu archipelago, French Polynesia, is described. Based on floral and fruit morphology, it clearly belongs to Meryta sect. Meryta Harms, which has been circumscribed to include species whose female flowers and fruits are appressed at the base. It most closely resembles M. lanceolata J.R.Forst. & G.Forst. and M. raiateensis J.W.Moore from the Society archipelago, with which it shares a similar inflorescence structure and free, basally appressed ovaries. It can be distinguished by its leaf shape (obovate to spatulate in M. puruhi, sp. nov. vs lanceolate to oblong in M. lanceolata and M. raiateensis) and the number of carpels [(7-)8-11 in M. puruhi sp. nov. vs 4-6(-7) in the other species]. This new species, the sole representative of the genus in the Tuamotu group, is threatened in part of its range by urban development and by the disappearance of the single bird species that serves as a disseminator, and has been assessed as Endangered [EN] according to the IUCN Red List criteria.",

La Polynésie française possède l'espèce la plus à l'Est du genre Atractocarpus Schltr. & K.Krause pour l'Océanie. Le genre n'était connu que d'une seule espèce dans les îles de la Société, Atractocarpus tahitensis (Nadeaud) Puttock, limitée à Tahiti et Raiatea. L'espèce y est restée non vue pendant plus d'un siècle. Des prospections de terrain dans des zones d'altitude et peu explorées de Tahiti Nui ont permis de trouver de nouvelles populations pour l'espèce. Par ailleurs, un autre taxon aux caractéristiques très atypiques, comme des feuilles brièvement pétiolées et cordées à leur base (vs feuilles longuement pétiolées et atténuées), est reconnu et décrit ici comme une espèce nouvelle pour la science, Atractocarpus teamotuaitaui sp. nov., restreinte à la presqu'île de Tahiti (Tahiti Iti). Une clé de détermination des espèces est fournie, ainsi qu'une liste du matériel, une description morphologique, la phénologie, la distribution et l'écologie. Une planche photographique est présentée pour chaque espèce.",

Des travaux récents ont proposé de nouveaux découpages dans les groupes entièrement lianescents, notamment pour les tribus des Bignonieae et des Tecomeae s.s. Nus avons ici rassemblé, sectionné et analysé les tiges de 83 Bignoniaceae grimpantes, comprenant tous les genres de Bignonieae et trois autres de Tecomeae s.s. largement cultivées, afin de trouver des caractères d'intérêt taxonomique permettant de décrire précisément la diversité anatomique de leurs écorces, en rapport avec les dernières phylogénies. Nous avons pu reconnaître 19 synapomorphies potentielles de la tige et de l'écorce à l'échelle de clades ou de genres lianescents, telles que – entre autres – le phloème fibreux des Fridericia Mart. emend L.G.Lohmann et alliés, la présence exclusive de sclérites dans le phloème régulier de Pleonotoma Miers, ainsi que de fibres étirées radialement chez Manaosella J.C.Gomes. La combinaison de ces caractères nous a permis de construire une première clé d'identification des écorces pour la détermination générique des Bignoniaceae lianescentes, même en l'absence de toute autre donnée morphologique. Nos résultats confirment l'importance de l'anatomie de l'écorce dans la compréhension de la taxonomie et de la phylogénie, et donc de la diversification.",

    "abstract": "The Daniel Pellé herbarium (DP) – The collection of an amateur botanist from Aube (France). Daniel Pellé (-1989) was an inspector of the PTT in Troyes and an amateur botanist. From 1942 to 1989, he harvested plants in the department of Aube, in France in a more general way and abroad during his holidays. Daniel Pellé collected nearly 2000 specimens and assembled as many herbarium plates, advised and assisted in his task by the botanist René Prin, founder of the Société auboise naturaliste, and collector of about 250 of the plates in this herbarium. The herbarium itself contains 1983 plates, precisely dated and located. 1974 plates were digitized and computerized by the authors of this article (EC and SL), the herbarium having been transmitted to them by Daniel Pellé's wife and son in 2008; the nine remaining plates, having no labels, were discarded from the final data set. The specimens of 133 taxonomic families are distributed in 32 folders, the majority of the collections coming from the Aube department (Champagne-Ardenne, Grand-Est, France). The collections range from 1942 to 1989, i.e., from the post-war period until the death of Daniel Pellé. During this period, botanists did not do much herbarium work, which makes his collection even more interesting. 64 plates were recovered via the French Society for the Exchange of Vascular Plants (SFE), and their duplicates in the Paris Herbarium were found. Daniel Pellé's herbarium has been declared in the Index Herbariorum, and bears the acronym “DP”. It is now housed in the collections of the Muséum d'Histoire naturelle de Troyes (Aube, France). All the specimens in the herbarium were studied by Christophe Reveillard, botanist at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle and third author of this article. The determinations made by Daniel Pellé and René Prin have thus proved to be accurate for most of them. Although the physical herbarium is now housed in the collections of the city of Troyes, the aim of this publication is to make known – but also to perpetuate – the digital content of the DP herbarium, by including in the article the plates of the herbarium and their metadata, in the form of a complete catalogue of the plates. The approach taken by the authors of the article to computerize the herbarium is also described, as well as the procedure for compiling the catalogue. Finally, it is a tribute to Daniel Pellé, who died in tragic circumstances.",

    "abstract": "A famous singer who became a botanist: Marianne Gougerot-Nicot (1892-1945) and her herborizations on the Hyères islands (Provence, France). As in many other scientific fields, botany was only very late in becoming feminine. This work presents and discusses the astonishing trajectory of a famous French singer from the beginning of the 20th century, Marianne Gougerot-Nicot (1892-1945) who plunged with passion into botany from the end of her brilliant artistic career, in 1920. Botany will be her outlet and she will be one of the very first women in France to create a scientific herbarium. However, she was totally forgotten and the link between this famous singer and the botanist had never been established at the scientific level. Mrs Gougerot-Nicot actively herborized between 1922 and 1943 in various regions of Europe and the Mediterranean, in the Alps, on the margins of the Sahara and even as far as Spitzberg. She will improve her floristic knowledge under the guidance of her botanist friend Aimée Camus (1879-1965), an outstanding systematist and the first botanist to have practiced in France as a professional, as a correspondent and then associated with the Phanerogamy Laboratory of the National Museum of Natural History of Paris. Marianne Gougerot-Nicot is also the first woman to have botanized in the Hyères islands (Var, France), going several times to the island of Porquerolles. Her insular field trips led to the discovery of some plant species never reported before, including three species of orchids (Orchis provincialis Balb. ex DC.; Orchis anthropophora (L.) All.; Ophrys araneola Rchb.f.) and a new station of the Requien's Larkspur (Staphisagria picta subsp. requienii (DC.) B.Bock), a very rare subspecies endemic to the Hyères archipelago.",

It is divided in two locules rather than one, and two apical apertures per face in contrast to normal specimen possessing only one per face. Icacinaceae Miers is a family with one carpel and two pendulous ovules where only one becomes mature. Here we have cases of two fused carpels, revealed by a wall between the twin lateral parts and by the four apertures, probably corresponding to the vascularisation of the four ovules. Finaly, we hypothesize that the two functional locules found here may correspond to a partial reversion of ancestral characters of the fruit.",

I examined the gender expression over two entire flowering seasons in Sedum praealtum A. DC. (Crassulaceae) in Central Veracruz, Mexico. Specifically, I studied the floral longevity, sexual-phase duration, flower opening within an inflorescence and sex ratio in the species. I observed that the 8-days flower initiated in male-phase and then switched to female-phase. An extended time of pollen presentation by gradual anthers dehiscence caused an incomplete protandry in the species. The basal-positioned floral buds reached anthesis sooner than the distal-positioned floral buds, resembling an acropetal flowering sequence. Inflorescences production ceased in the middle of the flowering season, whereas flower opening remained constant over reproductive season of the species. The opening of flowers in successive cohorts linked to changes in the flower sexual-phase phenology caused an initial sex expression toward maleness and a balanced sexual expression from the peak to the end of reproductive season in the population sampled. This study highlights the important influence that variations in onset and duration of sexual-phase of flowers can have on sex expression in flowering plants.",

Cynorkis ankaranensis Hervouet, sp. nov. a des fleurs semblables à celles de Cynorkis windsorensis Hervouet, sp. nov. mais plus nombreuses, c'est une plante plus grande, aux grandes feuilles ovales, vert uni et très brillantes. Enfin Cynorkis tryphioides var. leandriana (H.Perrier) Bosser, dont le basionyme est Benthamia leandriana H. Perrier, présente de nombreux caractères différents (taille, feuilles, fleurs, biotope) de la variété typique Cynorkis tryphioides Schltr. et est, par conséquent, élevée au rang d'espèce. Elle se distingue des autres espèces citées ici par ses fleurs blanches et son port, avec une inflorescence bien plus grande relativement à la longueur des feuilles.

Dans cette recherche, nous examinons les caractéristiques micromorphologiques des akènes de 21 espèces d'Alchemilla L. (Rosaceae) d'Iran, en utilisant un microscope électronique à balayage. Nos résultats révèlent la diversité des caractéristiques micromorphologiques de l'akène. Selon les résultats, quatre types principaux de motifs de surface de l'akène (élévations réticulées irrégulières, élévations linéaires ruminées, élévations et dépressions ruminées, élévations fines inégales et irrégulières), trois types principaux (réticulé, ruminant et colliculé) et neuf sous-types (réticulé-falsifové, réticulé-falsifové, réticulé-alvéolé, réticulé-fové-tuberculé ruminé, foaveat-tuberculé ruminant, réticulé-tuberculé-linéolé, colliculé avec rugosité, avec plissement fin et avec papilles) de la sculpture des akènes ont été identifiés. Une analyse multivariée a été utilisée pour déterminer les relations entre les espèces. Les résultats montrent que la largeur de l'akène, le type de base, le motif de surface, la sculpture, les types de paroi cellulaire anticline et de couche péricline externe, le type et la forme de la paroi cellulaire épidermique et la position du hile sont des informations taxonomiques qui fournissent des outils utiles pour l'identification des espèces. Les résultats de l'analyse en clusters et de l'analyse en composantes principales expliquent une affinité étroite entre les espèces étudiées. Cependant, cela ne correspond pas à la classification actuelle, sauf pour quatre espèces (Alchemilla sericata Rchb., A. rigida Buser, A. caucasica Buser et A. erythropoda Juz.). Une clé d'identification basée sur les caractères diagnostiques micromorphologiques de l'akène est présentée. Les résultats obtenus par la présente étude confirment faiblement les classifications précédentes.",

    "abstract": "Contribution des explorateurs français à l'étude de la flore de l'Asie Centrale: les collections d'herbier de Guillaume Capus (1857-1931). Les explorations de Guillaume Capus en Asie Centrale entre 1880 et 1887 ont notamment abouti à une collection remarquable de 3000 spécimens d'herbiers, toujours conservés dans l'Herbier de Paris (France). Les récoltes de sa première exploration ont été rapidement déterminées par un autre botaniste français, Adrien Franchet, dans ‘Plantes du Turkestan' publié en 1883-1884. Dans le cadre du projet de ‘Flore d'Ouzbékistan’ en cours, nous avons étudié exhaustivement la liste des plantes déterminées par Franchet, en dénombrant 1387 récoltes. D'abord, nous avons mis à jour la taxonomie pour toutes ces récoltes, et trouvé que les plantes récoltées par Capus représntent une diversité importante consistant en 87 familles, 375 genres, et 851 espèces (incluant 74 espèces nouvelles et 21 variétés décrites par Franchet). Ensuite, notre étude approfondie des herbiers d'Asie Centrale conduit à identifier sept nouveaux signalement d’espèces d’angiospermes pour trois pays d’Asie Centrale: Phlomoides agraria (Bunge) Adylov, Kamelin & Makhm. (Lamiaceae) pour le Kyrgyzstan, Picris strigosa M.Bieb. (Asteraceae) et Gentianella umbellata (M.Bieb.) Holub (Gentianaceae) pour l’Ouzbékistan, ainsi que Oxytropis tatarica Hook.f. & Thomson ex Bunge, Onobrychis arnacantha Bunge (Fabaceae), Pedicularis pycnantha Boiss. (Orobanchaceae) et Matthiola flavida Boiss. (Brassicaceae) pour le Tajikistan. Enfin, nous avons élucidé toutes les localités originales de récoltes visitées par Capus, nous les avons géoréférencées, et avons compilé une carte de densité des récoltes et de la richesse spécifique rassemblées par Capus, créant ainsi un gazetter du voyage botanqiue de Capus, prélude d’un gazetter d’Asie Centrale.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomic revision of twelve species of the genus Cynorkis Thouars (Orchidaceae, Habenariinae) from Reunion Island, based on a morphological and ecological approach. Many species, described by Frappier in the genus Hemiperis, now a synonym of Cynorkis, pose a taxonomic problem because the type specimens are considered lost or they were described from living material only. Based on a population-level ecological study, we here conclude that 12 out of the 21 Hemiperis taxa proposed by Frappier should be reduced to two. C. brachycentra (Frapp.) Schltr., C. crispa (Frapp.) Schltr., C. globulosa (Frapp.) Schltr., C. ludens (Frapp.) Schltr. and C. simplex (Frapp.) Hermans & P.J.Cribb are proposed as synonyms of Cynorkis pleiadea (Frapp.) Schltr., whereas C. breviplectra (Frapp.) Schltr., C. clavata (Frapp.) Schltr., C. imbellis (Frapp.) Hermans & P.J.Cribb, C. nitida (Frapp.) Schltr., C. ringens (Frapp.) Schltr. are proposed as synonyms of Cynorkis constellata (Frapp.) Schltr.. A neotype is proposed for C. pleiadea (Frapp.) Schltr., and a lectotype for C. constellata (Frapp.) Schltr. These two remaining taxa can be differentiated on the basis of the presence or absence of glandular hairs and, to a lesser extent, on a difference in their ecological niche. Cynorkis pleiadea (Frapp.) Schltr. usually occurs at a lower altitude than C. constellata (Frapp.) Schltr., the former inhabiting cloud forest between 1000 and 2000 m, whereas the latter prefers highland ericoid vegetation between 1500 and 2500 m. Although the flowering period of both species overlaps, peak flowering in C. constellata (Frapp.) Schltr. occurs earlier (March) than in C. pleiadea (Frapp.) Schltr. (April).",
