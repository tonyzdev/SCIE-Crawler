    "abstract": "The development of nanocellulose has attracted significant interest in the last few decades due to its unique and potentially useful features. Novel nanocelluloses boost the strongly expanding field of sustainable materials and nanocomposites. Their potential areas of application include reinforcing agents in nanocomposites, paper, biodegradable films, barriers for packaging, stabilizing agents in dispersions for technical films and membranes, additives in food, texturing agents in cosmetics, and medical devices such as wound dressings and bioactive implants. This review organizes current knowledge on the isolation of microfibrillated and nanofibrillated cellulose from plant sources. Details of the extraction of fibrils from cellulose are reviewed. In addition, the terms cellulose “microfiber” and cellulose “nanofiber” are formally defined and distinguished.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of the waste cotton supply chain and different end-of-life options is essential to promote cotton recycling and reuse. This study analyzed global and US data to understand the quantity, current sources, and destinations of waste cotton. Globally, 11.6 million metric tons of waste cotton are generated per year during cotton garment production. This study also reviewed different options for recycling both pre-consumer and post-consumer cotton waste via chemical and mechanical processes. Different applications of waste cotton were compared to their virgin counterparts from technical, environmental, and economic perspectives. Unlike most previous studies, this research included applications that are not traditional textile products (e.g., biofuels and composites), shedding light on potential new markets for waste cotton that will not compete with virgin cotton.",

    "abstract": "The development of e-textiles for various sensing and health monitoring applications has remained difficult because the printed electronic inks must be highly stable on textile substrates, yet flexible enough to adapt to the human contour. Despite the adverse challenges, significant progress has been made over the last few years in the formulation and application of conductive inks for e-textiles. This mini systematic review, therefore, presents the recent advancements in the formulation and application of conductive inks for e-textiles in concert with the clarion call for sustainable textiles. The Scopus database was used to identify relevant publications within the field for effective analysis. After scrutinizing the bulk of publications, a total of 30 studies comprising articles and conference papers were selected and structured in 3 themes, namely, formulation of conductive inks for e-textiles, fabrication and printing methods, and challenges of fabricating conductive inks on textiles. Findings show that significant progress has been made toward formulating silver nanowire inks with exceptional conductivity and flexibility, stabilization of carbon nanotubes and graphene inks with consistent electrical properties, and high substantivity to different textile substrates without pretreatment. Subsequently, deposition techniques such as screen printing, ultrasonic spray coating, syringe-based deposition systems, and direct-write printing are being used for the full realization of printing conductive inks for e-textiles, and are highlighted in this paper. In general, technological advancements have increased the capabilities of e-textile devices made with conductive inks.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that textile waste is almost entirely recyclable, approximately 75% of it ends up in landfills worldwide. This has serious environmental and economic consequences. This review focuses on textile waste statistics, its contribution to pollution and recycling, as well as the benefits, barriers, types, and technologies of textile waste recycling. Textile production and textile waste generation have increased alarmingly as a result of fast fashion, which emphasizes low-cost production, frequent consumption, and short-term use of garments. This industry is distinguished by scarcity of resources, excessive consumption, and the generation of large amounts of waste. The frequency of consumer purchases is increasing, while the life span of clothing is drastically decreasing. Recycling does not occur as expected for a variety of reasons, so the environmental impact and economic losses from this waste grow over time. The textile industry currently contributes about 8% of the global carbon budget and 20% of industrial water pollution. Every year, $500 billion is lost to the system due to unused clothing and a lack of recycling. A paradigm shift is urgently required to implement an effective textile waste recycling system.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial textiles with improved functionality have a wide range of applications, including health and hygiene products, particularly garments worn next to the skin, and a number of medical applications, including infection control and barrier materials. Furthermore, these textiles are used in household materials, air filters, food packaging, athletic wear, storage, ventilation, and water purification systems. Cotton-based materials are hygienic and are commonly used in non-implantable hygiene medical textile products such as lint, gauze, bandages, wound dressing, and sanitary napkins. In terms of absorbency, comfort, and durability, non-implantable cotton fabric materials outperform standard clothing materials. Several studies show that depending on the type of components present in the plant extract, several plant extracts can be effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. As a result, research into eco-friendly antimicrobial agents and their application on various textile products is gaining worldwide attention. Plants such as neem, eucalyptus, aloe vera, and clove contain natural antimicrobial compounds. Extracts of neem, eucalyptus, aloe vera, and clove are used in textile finishing. These bioactive substances could be used to impart antimicrobial properties to textiles for the development of health care and hygiene products. This review focuses on research into various natural antimicrobial agents derived from plant extracts and their applications as textile finishing agents for healthcare and hygiene applications.",

    "abstract": "There has been much effort to provide eco-friendly and biodegradable materials for the next generation of composite products owing to global environmental concerns and increased awareness of renewable green resources. Increased use of natural materials in composites has led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon footprint of composites. In addition to the benefits obtained from green materials, there are some challenges in working with them, such as poor compatibility between the reinforcing natural fiber and matrix and the relatively high moisture absorption of natural fibers. Green composites can be a suitable alternative for petroleum-based materials. However, before this can be accomplished, a number of issues need to be addressed, including poor interfacial adhesion between the matrix and natural fibers, moisture absorption, poor fire resistance, low impact strength, and less durability. Several researchers have studied the properties of natural fiber composites. These investigations have resulted in developing several procedures for modifying natural fibers and resins. To address the increasing demand to use eco-friendly materials in different applications, an up-to-date review of natural fiber and resin types and sources, modification, and processing techniques, physical and mechanical behaviors, applications, life-cycle assessment, and other properties of green composites is required to provide a better understanding of the behavior of green composites.",

The introduction of MXene has been contributive to the design and development of various textile e-devices. Among these, textile-based supercapacitors (TSCs), which encompass fiber, yarn, and fabric supercapacitors, are developed and have been manifested to be useful in powering wearable electronics. The present article summarizes historical developments of energy storage devices, types of super-capacitors like double-layered capacitors, hybrid capacitors, and pseudo-capacitors, their relative merits and demerits. Various top-down and bottom-up approaches of MXene synthesis processes are discussed with their scopes and limitations. Different process of coating/loading of MXene onto textile substrates viz. dip coating, electro-spinning and wet spinning are described and morphological cum surface characteristics of the developed coated textiles are highlighted. Mechanical and electrical properties of MXene based textiles have been summarized and compared with various other electro-conductive textiles prepared from conductive polymers, CNTs, and rGO. The performance of MXene-based textiles for energy storage applications is critically reviewed and summarized.",

    "abstract": "In this study, recycling of solid textile wastes into activated carbon and the potential use of these activated carbons in color removal were investigated. Cotton and cotton/polyester-blended fabric wastes and textile wastewater treatment sludge were selected as solid textile wastes. A two-stage method, low temperature carbonization, and chemical activation with ZnCl 2 were applied to prepare large surface area and rich-pore structure activated carbon from fabric wastes and sludge in textile industry. The activated carbons were characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescent, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis. The reactive dye (Reactive Red 141) adsorption capacity of the activated carbons was investigated by the batch adsorption method. Activated carbon yields were found in the range of 28–34%. Cotton textile waste-based activated carbons were found to have the highest surface area (~1380 m 2 /g), followed by cotton/polyester and wastewater treatment sludge-based activated carbons. Wastewater treatment sludge-based activated carbons showed the highest dye adsorption capacity (161.29 mg/g), possibly due to its higher mesoporosity. The obtained results showed that the adsorption of the reactive dye onto textile waste-based activated carbons produced by two-step process is favorable. The developed activated carbons fit the circular economy approach well, offering a promising potential for solid textile waste management, as well as for water remediation.",

    "abstract": "The textile printing process’s use of artificial thickeners has a number of detrimental effects on the environment. Researchers use starch-based thickeners, which are the most popular natural thickeners for cotton printing due to their availability and low cost. However, the use of native starch-based thickenera is not recommended for reactive printing due to the presence of many accessible hydroxyl groups. Here, the main aim of this study has been the extraction of protein-based thickener derived from trimmed fleshing waste of animal hide for better colour fastness properties of reactive dye print on cotton. The physicochemical properties and the application of this thickener with sodium alginate in different proportions were studied. In addition, after printing was performed on the cotton fabric, the physical and mechanical properties of the printed fabric were evaluated. The results show that the properties of the printed fabric, namely, overall fastness and softness, are dependent on the percentage of gelatin thickener. Moreover, the analytical result showed that the colour strengths and colour fastness properties of printed cotton fabric were enhanced. Therefore, the developed protein-based gelatin is suitable to be applied as a sustainable, eco-friendly thickening agent for the application of reactive dye printing on textiles.",

    "abstract": "This research focuses on the importance of quick drying in active sportswear clothing, or athletic wear, and aims to scientifically investigate the sweat-drying performances of different types of knitted fabrics used in such clothing. The study evaluates various fabric parameters, including fiber type, moisture management properties, air permeability, surface texture, thickness, and weight, to understand their impact on drying performance. The research also considers the environmental effects on drying performance by studying different air flow and sweat volume exposure levels. The study evaluates the performance of commercially available fabrics commonly used in active sportswear, including natural, synthetic, and blended fabrics. The results indicate that synthetic fabrics generally have better drying performance compared to natural fabrics, and the drying performance improves with increased air flow and sweat volume. Fabrics with a higher percentage of synthetic fiber exhibit better moisture management capacity and air permeability. The research also develops a model to demonstrate the significant impact of fabric parameters such as surface texture, air permeability, sweat volume, air flow, moisture capacity, wetting time, and thickness on the drying performance of active sportswear fabrics. The findings of this research can assist both academic and industrial researchers in selecting appropriate fabric types and properties based on the wearer’s needs and environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Large volumes of plastic waste are currently being generated, posing a significant challenge for waste management. Refurbishing plastic waste into value-added textile products is one of the potent options for handling waste. There is a need to design fabrics from recycled materials without compromising the essential properties. This research article focuses on the impact of incorporating recycled polyester fibre with wool into woven fabric for suiting applications. This research explores the influences of yarn blend, linear density and twist multiplier on the thermophysiological comfort of mechanically recycled polyester and wool-blended woven fabrics. Fabric comfort was assessed based on instrumental parameters, such as air permeability, water vapour permeability, moisture management, thermal conductivity, thermal resistance, thermal absorptivity and surface roughness. It is observed that increasing the amount of recycled polyester fibre improved the thermal conductivity, air and moisture vapour transmission, fabric roughness and moisture management. Higher wool content improved the thermal insulation. Finer yarn samples demonstrated enhanced air and water vapour permeability. Coarser fabric samples showed higher surface roughness, better thermal resistance and moisture management. Increasing the yarn twist multiplier increased the fabric roughness and enhanced air, thermal and moisture vapour transmission, thermal absorptivity, and overall moisture management, but it also reduced thermal resistance in fabrics.",

    "abstract": "The effect weave parameters such as CFF (crossing over firmness factor), FYF (floating yarn factor), FFF (fabric firmness factor) and fabric geometrical properties, namely, areal density, thickness and porosity on air resistance, is examined. A series of woven fabrics differing only in weave structures and having the common count and fabric sett was produced from three types of doubled yarns, namely, compact/compact, conventional/conventional and compact/conventional. The hybrid combination was produced principally to reduce the cost of manufacturing doubled yarns. Essential data for the fabrics such as CFF, FYF, FFF, mass per unit area, thickness and porosity were determined. Air resistance was determined by performing the standard test KES-F8 API. Analysis of the results with respect to fabrics produced from the compact/compact, conventional/conventional and conventional/compact yarns shows a strong correlation between the air resistance, porosity, CFF, FYF, FFF, mass per unit area and thickness ( R = conventional/conventional 0.97, compact/compact 0.861, conventional/compact 0.974). Thus, in addition to the CFF, FYF and FFF, the thickness should also be taken into consideration for predicting the air resistance of fabrics. It is concluded that in order to predict air resistance, a number of parameters are needed and any conclusion which has been drawn using only CFF and FYF should be treated with caution.",

By using a twist rate of 900 t/m and winding turns at 12,000 t/m, a conductive core–shell structure with the CNT yarn as skin yarn and the PU yarn as core yarn was achieved. The CNT/PU yarn exhibited consistent elctrical resistance over a strain range of 30%. Furthermore, with a low trigger voltage of 3.5 V, the surface temperature of the wrapped yarn could reach 84.8°C, showing stable electrothermal performance and a slight temperature fluctuation in the stretching or bending states. The CNT/PU yarns have a wide range of applications in the field of human motion monitoring and electrical heating.",

    "abstract": "Nanotechnology has become the foremost promising and rising field of analysis as a result of its applications in numerous fields. Development of consistent and greener ways for the synthesis of nanoparticles could be a dynamic step in the field of nanotechnology. To avoid the emergence of dangerous by-products, many attempts have been made in recent years to develop environment friendly methods. “Green” synthesis is a consistent, sustainable, and environment friendly method for the synthesis of an enormous range of nanoparticles. Green synthesis is seen as an important tool to reduce the harmful effects of traditional nanoparticle synthesis methods commonly used in laboratories and industries. Nanoparticles exhibit unique chemical and physical properties that are useful in various fields. Among metallic nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles have become a research hotspot due to their wide range of applications. Silver nanoparticles are important because of their exceptional chemical, physical, and biological properties. Because of these unique characteristics, silver nanoparticles have numerous applications and are used as antifungal, antiviral, and antibacterial agents. They have an excellent catalytic effect on dye degradation, are very good antioxidants, and can be used to treat various diseases and exhibit wound-healing activities. The current review complies with the database of green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using plant extracts, bacteria, and fungi, which have potential applications in fields of science, health, textiles, food packaging, agriculture, and environment. The review also highlights the application of silver nanoparticles as antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents. The knowledge on silver nanoparticle production conditions, properties, molecular mechanisms, and applications will be of great help for researchers to explore more applications of nanoparticles in fields that are still untouched.",

Alkylphenol ethoxylates are non-ionic surfactants which may be involved in various textile printing and dyeing auxiliaries due to their excellent emulsification, wetting and decontamination abilities. This study aimed to determine the dermal exposure doses and health risks of alkylphenol ethoxylates in 10 unwashed textile samples for infants, toddlers and pregnant women. The concentrations of alkylphenol ethoxylates and alkylphenols (APs) were determined by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The total concentrations of alkylphenol ethoxylates (nonylphenol ethoxylates and octylphenol ethoxylates) in 10 textile samples were 113.21–1431.18 mg/kg, among which nonylphenol ethoxylates with ethoxy groups of 2–10 were the dominant chemicals. The highest dermal exposure dose was found in the toddler group, which was 1.27 and 4.14 times higher than those in the infant and pregnant women groups. When the maximum concentration was used for risk assessment based on tolerable daily intake, the hazard indices ( HI) for toddlers and infants were estimated to be 10.62 and 8.37, which may pose a higher risk to human health. Our assessment was specifically focused on new garments before washing. The garments containing alkylphenol ethoxylates can be washed to significantly reduce the exposure risk. The results of our study offer important information on human exposure to alkylphenol ethoxylates in textiles and clothing and provide a scientific basis for planning risk management measures for alkylphenol ethoxylates.",

This research seeks to recover cellulose acetate fibers from used cigarette filters and to evaluate the yarn-making capabilities of these fibers. The cigarette butts were gathered from various locations, and the fibers and coating were separated. The fibers were then treated with hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide to eliminate the burned color and odor. Acetone and distilled water were used to filter and distill the material properly. The color coordinates of the chemically altered fibers, including reflectance value and color strength, were measured afterward. To assess the chemical, thermal, physical, morphological, and mechanical characteristics of the modified cigarette butt filter fiber, atomic absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and tensile properties were examined. Significant and appealing findings were obtained for the mechanical parameters, particularly the tensile strength of 1.2 gm/den for a single fiber, the fiber density of 1.2 dtex, and the effective length of 25 mm, all of which indicate the fiber’s suitability for yarn production. In addition, FTIR, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the cigarette butt filter fiber possessed the same characteristics as commercial cellulose acetate fiber. The preliminary results obtained on the recovered cellulose acetate fiber are encouraging for the application of this recovery material from cigarette butts to create a high-demand and value-added product, such as yarn for garment production.",

    "abstract": "This study presents in-depth scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX) analyses of the surface contour of natural bamboo fibers from Phyllostachys rubromarginata species processed under various eco-friendly conditions. Both fresh and dry bamboo were used. Fresh bamboo provided easier and quicker processing. Two age groups, 6-months to 1-year-old and 2 to 4-year-old bamboo plants, were also studied for fiber output. Subjective visual observations suggested that the age of the bamboo affected fiber yield. The diameter of the bamboo fibers was 10-17 μm, which fits within standard spinning parameters. Analysis showed that the bamboo fibers were well-rounded along the longitudinal direction, unlike bamboo viscose typically found on the market. This article provides a detailed description of some successful processes for bamboo fiber production.",

    "abstract": "The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has created dramatic challenges for public health and textile export trade worldwide. Such abrupt changes are difficult to predict due to the inherently high complexity and nonlinearity, especially with limited data. This article proposes a novel modified discrete grey model with weakening buffer operators, called BODGM (1,1), for forecasting the impact of pandemic-induced uncertainty on the volatility of cotton exports in China under limited samples. First, the Mann–Kendall test examines how pandemic-induced uncertainty affects cotton exports, based on China’s monthly cotton export data from June 2014 to August 2022. Second, buffer operators are employed to weaken the nonlinear trends and correct the tentative predictions of the discrete grey model. Then, the BODGM (1,1) model was validated by comparison with four alternative models. The results indicate that the BODGM (1,1) model was particularly promising for identifying mutational fluctuations in cotton exports and outperformed the GM (1,1), DGM (1,1), ARIMA and linear regression models in fitting and prediction accuracy under volatility and limited data. The BODGM (1,1) model forecast results for China showed that cotton export volume was expected to show signs of recovery over the next 12 months. The findings of this study may provide a basis for formulating trade policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on export resources and build their resilience to future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Dyes play an important role in textile production, but their contribution to air pollution and harming human health have raised concerns and remain an international problem. The key to overcoming this challenge is to assess how much greenhouse gases are being generated and the hotspots which guide decision-making process toward more sustainable options. This article established a carbon footprint calculation method for disperse dyes. First, the system boundary description and the functional unit were discussed. Second, the carbon footprint inventory analysis was determined. What’s more, the calculation method, allocation method and emission factors were proposed. It was intended to be practical and effective based on three typical disperse dyes in China. The results showed that the carbon footprints of Disperse Blue 79, Disperse Red 167, and Disperse Orange 61 corresponded to 8.28 t CO 2 eq/t, 8.07 t CO 2 eq/t, and 7.48 t CO 2 eq/t, respectively. For the three disperse dyes, the carbon emissions of dispersing agent melamine-formaldehyde resin and liquid ammonia consumption were the dominant emission sources. The steam and electricity were the two major sources of carbon emissions caused by energy usage. The homogenization and the wastewater treatment process were the two largest emission emitters. The sensitivity analysis showed that the total product carbon footprint was mostly sensitive to dispersing agent melamine-formaldehyde resin changes, followed by steam, liquid ammonia, and electricity. The results show that disperse dye production have great potential for improvement. The reduction options for the emissions of the disperse dyes production can be concluded by the optimization of the production process and technology for dispersing agent melamine-formaldehyde resin, liquid ammonia, electricity, and steam. Through the calculation, the influencing factors for the carbon footprint can be analyzed and highlighted. The method provides a comprehensive understanding of environmental impacts with dyes, driving the adoption of sustainable dyeing practices.",

Driven by these questions, here we quantify the extent of physical fatigue experienced by medical staff wearing medical disposable protective clothings in isolation wards to identify a safe work duration. Eight healthy males were subjected to light (2.1 km/h) and moderate (4.3 km/h) treadmill exercises while wearing two different ensembles. Four physiological (tympanic temperature T core , mean skin temperature T sk , heart rate, and sweat loss) and two subjective indicators (thermal sensation and humidity sensation) were measured. We then introduced a discrete gray model(1,1) to determine safe working hours. The study indicated that even at lower temperatures, prolonged wearing of medical disposable protective clothing could significantly affect physiological indicators such as T core and T sk ( p &lt; 0.001), with T core being the predominant factor limiting safe working hours. Regarding medical disposable protective clothing-1-light, medical disposable protective clothing-1-moderate, medical disposable protective clothing-2-light, and medical disposable protective clothing-2-moderate intensity activities, the safe working hours were 6.33, 2.83, 2.83, and 2.25 h. This article presented a new approach to determining safe working hours for wearing medical disposable protective clothing from physiological thermal limits with small sample data. However, this is a preliminary study, and further validation of the prediction model through additional experiments is necessary.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the antibacterial activity of polyethylene nonwoven wipes treated with 13 types of commercially natural essential oils in Vietnam. The mechanical properties of 11 types of polyethylene nonwoven fabrics were examined to find a suitable material for antibacterial treatments. The findings of the inhibition zone on antibacterial treated samples against Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria by the disk diffusion method indicated that essential oils from rosemary, clove, lilium, champak, Cinnamomum, melaleuca, and basil could completely inhibit both E. coli and S. aureus. The naturally treated products presented the highest antibacterial activities at 1%, 5%, and 7% of Cinnamomum, basil and clove essential oils, respectively. The antibacterial effects of Cinnamomum, basil, and clove on nonwoven fabrics increased with the liquid content, and the padding pressure should be adjusted to lower than 1.8 bar. Also, the survey results for skin allergy and fragrant feeling demonstrated that wipes treated with basil showed the most positive evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Individuals often experience discomfort from their clothes sticking to them due to perspiration. The objective of this study was to elucidate the formation mechanism underlying this stickiness perception (SP). To this end, a series of wear trials were conducted involving various garments and activities within a controlled thermal environment. Measurements of contact area, subjective evaluations, and physiological responses were obtained. The results showed that the effects of fabric properties, contact area, and skin wettedness on SP were contingent upon the intensity of physical activity. The relationship between skin wettedness and SP was characterized by an exponential growth function. Skin wettedness served as a reliable predictor of SP in an unsaturated state. A significantly positive correlation was observed between contact area and SP under conditions of high skin wettedness. Additionally, the air permeability, surface roughness, water absorption capacity, and elongation of the fabric showed negative influences on stickiness perception during various activity phases, except for the rest phase. However, their association between fabric properties and stickiness perception may only be statistically significant. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a more systematic investigation into the roles of fabric properties on stickiness perception. These insights can inform the optimized design of fabric configurations for summer garments, aiming to mitigate clothing discomfort associated with stickiness.",

Three levels of wind speeds and two typical wearing methods were determined based on the winter meteorological data and a dress habits questionnaire, respectively. Thermal insulation values were measured using an instrumented manikin for three down jackets with the same amount of down content per square meter and different lengths. With wind blowing, a significantly decreased tendency of the total thermal insulations was observed ( p = 0.005). With an increase in wind speed, the total thermal insulation was more sensitive to the change of wind speed when the placket was opened. The longer the length of down jackets, the greater influence of wind speed upon thermal insulation values. A wind speed above 0.4 m·s −1 led to a reduced rate of total insulation ranging from 27% to 47%. Opening the placket resulted in a 10–26% decrease in the total thermal insulation. The thermal insulation values measured locally at different segments of the thermal manikin pointed to greater regional variations in the obtained insulation values, especially during exposures to greater wind speed.",

Five different types of polyurethane conductive composite reinforced 3D spacer fabrics were prepared. Compression tests were performed on the prepared conductive composites under different test conditions to explore the effect of compression and impact factors on the electrical properties of the composites reinforced with 3D spacer fabrics. It is shown that the structure, thickness, and diameter of the spacer wire of the 3D spacer conductive fabric affect the conductivity of the conductive composites. At different compressive strains, the resistance change rate of the conductive compound decreases with increasing compressive period. As the compression period increases, the resistance change rate of the conducting compound gradually decreases. The change in mechanical hysteresis is larger than the change in electrical hysteresis in the compression recovery test for different strains. As the compression rate increases, the sensitivity of the conductive composite decreases, and there is a multivariate linear fit regression between the compression rate and the change in resistance. Fitting equations for the compression rate and resistance variations have been established, providing a theoretical basis for the theoretical study and application of conductive composites.",

Besides, the nanofibers also exhibited anti-bacterial activity and were proved to be safe both in vitro and in vivo.

For practical application, a functional silane coupling agent (KH-560) was used to modify the fabric’s surface, thereby improving the binding force between the fabric and the functional powders. The study examined the morphology of the functional cotton fabric, NAIs release into the air, thermal stability, and moisture absorption capabilities. Experimental results demonstrated a significant enhancement in NAIs release performance, with a 15-fold increase compared to untreated cotton fabric when functional powders were added. Incorporating germanium powder led to a 2.3-fold augmentation in pearl NAI release, effectively addressing the low pearl NAI release issue. Additionally, the presence of pearl powder, when combined with germanium powder, synergistically enhanced moisture absorption and thermal stability performance, surpassing those of control samples. The developed functional cotton fabric exhibits significant potential for applications in household, healthcare, and clothing textiles, marking a promising advancement in textile functionalization for enhanced performance.",

Commercial insulating materials such as fiberglass, polystyrene, and polyurethane foams, although demonstrating long serviceability, are associated with several limitations including non-biodegradability. This study hence presents the development of biodegradable multilayer nonwoven fabrics based on natural fibers for thermal insulation as a sustainable alternative to synthetic non-biodegradable polymers. The nonwoven fabrics of kapok, jute, and banana with thicknesses ranging between 5 and 15 mm were produced by needle punching. The developed needle punched nonwoven fabrics were attached together in different fiber combinations to produce multilayered fabrics. The nonwoven fabrics were investigated for thickness, areal density, porosity, and thermal properties like heat flux, thermal resistance, and thermal conductivity. The relatively low thermal conductivity of kapok, jute, and banana fibers, and presence of air pockets in the needle punched nonwoven fabrics, all together governed the development of a sustainable fibrous assembly for thermal insulation of buildings. The results confirmed that kapok, jute, and banana fiber based nonwoven fabrics can be successfully used as an alternative to conventional non-biodegradable thermal insulating materials.",

In the current study, a new washing method with an up–down tapping action was introduced for delicate garments. The influence of tapping washing parameters used in the new washing method on the removal of five different types of IEC soiling from cotton fabrics was investigated. The cleaning performance of the tapping washing method mainly relies on the turbulent flow of the washing liquor and a gentle mechanical tapping action without a friction force being applied to fabrics during laundry. Tapping washing could maintain the good appearance of the fabrics without fibre damage and remove water-soluble soil but it had difficulty removing water-insoluble soil. However, the washing efficiency of water-insoluble soil could be improved by adjusting the levels of washing parameters. Further development and optimisation of the up–down tapping washing method could make a good balance between sufficient washing of soiled fabrics and the maintenance of fabric appearance without causing fibre damage.",

We performed washing experiments on nine unwashed textile samples. The results showed that the levels of NPEOs and OPEOs were significantly reduced after washing compared to the initial levels, and the release rates during washing ranged from 63% to 98%. However, it may not be possible to completely remove residual APEOs from clothing by washing. The total exposure dose to infants wearing unwashed textiles was approximately 2.7–50.1 times that of washed textiles, with oral exposure accounting for 35.7–53.5% of the total exposure dose. Furthermore, nine samples had a chemical footprint after washing of up to 114 PAF·m 3 ·day. Given these findings, meticulous attention should be directed toward auxiliary selection and the formulation of eco-friendly alternatives throughout the textile production lifecycle.",

In order to endow chitosan (CS) with good fluorescence for the preparation of anti-counterfeiting fibers, various amounts of fluorescent molecules—perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA)–were used to label CS to prepare a series of CS-perylene with different degrees of labeling (DL). Then, nanofiber membranes were produced by electrospinning using fluorescent CS/PVA blend spinning solutions. The effects of the DL on application performance of the CS-perylene were studied. It was found that labeling the appropriate amount of perylene unit onto CS was an effective way to endow the CS with good fluorescence properties. With the increase in the DL of the CS-perylene, its fluorescence intensity increased initially, reached a maximum when the DL was 0.1718 mol%, and then decreased. At a DL of 0.1718 mol%, the CS-perylene/PVA nanofiber membrane could emit bright green fluorescence. Meanwhile, the labeling of the perylene unit did not bring about adverse effects on the surface morphology of the electrospun CS-perylene/PVA nanofiber membrane. The fluorescent CS-perylene nanofibers overcome many shortcomings of the commonly used fluorescent fibers and show great potential for use in the anti-counterfeiting field.",

For this reason, herein, we aimed to improve the hydrophobicity of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) microporous membranes while maintaining their moisture permeability. We employed silane coupling agents to modify nanosilica particles, which were then coated on TPU microporous membranes to enhance their waterproof performance. The optimized parameters for the modification process of silica nanoparticles are γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (silane coupling agents) concentrations of 8% relative to the mass of silica, a modification time of 2 h, and a temperature of 70°C. The water contact angle of the particles modified under these conditions reached 138.58°. The modified SiO 2 particles were used to treat the TPU film, with an optimal mass fraction of the modified silica of 3% and a modification time of 4 h. The water vapor transmission of the modified TPU film was 5661.92 g/(m 2 ·24 h), with enhanced hydrophobicity, and its water absorption rate was 12.41%, which is 16.49% lower than before modification. Additionally, under simulated heavy rain conditions, the water absorption rate of the composite fabric with modified TPU film was lower by 14.7% than that of the composite fabric with unmodified film.",

Current research works aim to understand the difference between different household laundry practices and their impact on sheddability. The researcher through an online survey tried to extract consumer knowledge followed by contaminants analysis from the laundry effluent samples collected from 30 households. Three effluent laundry samples were collected and analyzed from each household for a 1-month laundry behavior analysis. Each household sample was properly coded from H1 to H30. The results stated that H26 has the highest sheddability index with 6.70% of the total emission followed by H17 (6.30%). SEM analysis conveyed the presence of nanofibers (≤1 µm), along with an abundance of microfibers (49.16%) of the total fibers released. An average of 5,849,943 MFs/L were released from the 30 households during all three wash trails. FTIR analysis also emphasized the presence of a wide range of fiber contents from cotton, polyester, elastane, and acrylic, to viscose. An attempt to study the optimized laundry variables such as reduced water temperature and wash cycle time showed no significant difference in the overall sheddability, whereas the same conditions were proven effective in reducing the microfiber shedding. The results show conclude that each household has different laundry needs and thus there is a need for a more critical understanding.",

    "abstract": "The concept of hybrid yarn is gaining popularity for its potential for several protective aspects, such as thermal protection, cut protection and so forth. Twelve distinct varieties of hybrid yarns with a core and two continuous filament sheaths were spun in this instance. These twelve yarns were primarily divided into two sub-divisions, one with glass fiber and the other with stainless steel (SS) in the core. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (HPPE) was regarded as the outer sheath, and polyester yarn was the inner sheath layer. Two distinct varieties of HPPE yarns were chosen for performance comparison: 200D and 400D HPPE and 300D hard particle-impregnated HPPE (HPI-HPPE). Different twist directions of the sheath layers were also kept under consideration. The linear densities of the core yarn and outer sheath yarn were varied to observe the final hybrid yarn tensile properties with a fixed twist density (400 twists per meter). ASTM D2256 was followed to evaluate the tensile performance on the Instron universal tensile strength tester. The breaking strength and tenacity for S-Z twisted hybrid yarns were higher than for S-S twisted yarns. SS core yarns were finer than glass core yarns, which showed higher tenacity, modulus, and load-bearing capacity. Conversely, the strain percentage at maximum load was higher for glass core yarns than for SS yarns because of multiple phase cracking of glass core yarn. The HPI-HPPE yarns showed much lower tensile values than HPPE yarns. The reason was revealed by the surface morphology and CV% of diameter as an extensive necking tendency due to hard particle impregnation in HPI-HPPE yarn.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this paper was to investigate the influence of three different fabric thread densities per weft (10, 17, and 25 cm −1 ) as well as three different linear densities of weft threads (20, 30, and 50 Tex) on the seam strength of cotton fabrics. When measuring seam strength, the values of the F – ε curve were monitored. In this, a uniform increase in force is observed in all samples up to a certain point. After that point, the force suddenly begins to decrease for a while. Then, the same force begins to increase again. That part of the curve at the point where the force begins to decrease is defined in this paper as seam yielding. Therefore, it is concluded that the seam at this point is significantly damaged in structure. The results obtained show that the values of seam strength, for all samples, increase with increasing: stitch density, weft thread density, and weft linear density. It is concluded that the average yield force in samples B decreases by 21.54% and by 32.94% in samples C, compared to the average yield force values of samples A. The average yield force in samples E decreases by 23.24% and that in samples F decreases by 37.92% compared to the average yield force values of samples D. The average yield force in samples H decreases by 19.87% and in samples I it decreases by 24.92% compared to the average yield force values of samples G. The results obtained show that weft yarns with a larger cross-section more intensively resist thread yielding in the seam. Defining these parameters represents a significant contribution for manufacturers of quality clothing because it is possible to project in advance the intensities of forces to which seams in clothing can be subjected to without impairing their quality.",

    "abstract": "To overcome the poor wear resistance and weaving difficulties of carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn, a new type of functional yarn was prepared by a wrapping-melting method. In this method, CNT yarn was wrapped by polypropylene (PP) yarn first, and then a 15 V voltage was applied on both ends of the yarn. The electrically heated CNT yarn melts the wrapped PP yarn and forms a uniformly compacted PP wrapped CNT (PWC) yarn. The study showed that the PWC-15V yarn can retain the good electrical properties of CNT yarn with an electrical conductivity of 4643.7 S/m. Besides, it can work as a multifunctional yarn with strain sensing and electrical heating. As a strain sensor, it has a highest gauge factor of 1.06 and good stability with 100 cyclic loading. As an electrical heater, the PWC yarn can be heated to about 50°C with over 9 V applied voltage. Moreover, the washable PWC yarn also demonstrates good flexibility and improved wear resistance, which indicates that it has great potential for wearable electronics.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the moisture management properties of knitted fabrics incorporating cotton and cattail fiber blends with intent to improve performance for sportswear applications. Nine different fabric samples were developed using different blend ratios of 90/10, 80/20, and 70/30 (cotton to cattail) along with three different knit structures: interlock, loop knit (fleece), and rib. The fabrics were assessed in terms of some important moisture management parameters, which are wetting time, absorption rate, maximum wetted radius, spreading speed, AOTI and OMMC. The results indicate that rib-knit fabrics always lead the pack across all spreading speed, accumulated one-way transport index (AOTI), and overall moisture management parameters; the 90:10 rib blend has the shortest wetting time (2.8 s top, 2.3 s bottom), the highest absorption rate (1.4 mm/s top, 2.3 mm/s bottom), superior spreading speed (2.0 mm/s top, 2.6 mm/s bottom) and the highest OMMC (0.90). Loop-knit fabrics have the longest wetting times (4.8 s top, 4.2 s bottom), a lower absorption rate (0.8 mm/s top, 1.5 mm/s bottom) and the lowest OMMC (0.70), which indicates that moisture transport efficiency is not optimal. The investigation reveals that an increase in cattail content leads to a reduction in the moisture absorption and transport properties. Therefore, the lowest OMMC is recorded for the 70:30 blend, that is 0.82 for rib and 0.70 for loop knit. The results have highlighted significant correlations between fabric structure, fiber composition, and moisture management efficiency, therefore showing that rib-knit fabrics with lower cattail content would be most suitable for high-performance sportswear in warm climates.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue monitoring during sports activities is crucial for optimizing athletic performance and preventing injuries. However, existing methodologies frequently lack real-time capability and accuracy in dynamic sports environments. This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks with deep recurrent neural networks for real-time fatigue state recognition during cycling activities. The framework processes synchronized electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) signals through physiological signal fusion techniques acquired from an intelligent garment system. The EMG signals were recorded from both the Erector Spinae and Anterior Deltoid muscles, while ECG signals were captured via strategically positioned electrodes. In a comprehensive investigation involving 15 subjects, we conducted comparative analyses between our hybrid neural network architecture and four baseline deep learning models: TCN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Transformer, and recurrent neural networks. The subjects performed a structured cycling protocol alternating between low-intensity (5 km/h) and high-intensity (30 km/h) phases, with fatigue levels assessed utilizing the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid model achieves superior performance with an average prediction accuracy of 89.20%, significantly outperforming traditional single-architecture approaches. The model’s efficacy was validated through multiple metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This study provides a viable approach to real-time fatigue monitoring in cycling sports, indicating potential value for future developments in sports science applications.",

    "abstract": "Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers have been widely used in various industrial fields due to their excellent chemical and physical performance. However, there is still a crucial problem of the massive precipitation of oligomers from the interior to the surface of product, which results in decreased production efficiency and harm to human health. A quantitative characterization method for surface oligomers of PET fibers based on Soxhlet extraction was developed, with lower-temperature extraction, high accuracy, excellent extraction effect and wider operability. The extraction temperature (Toe) decreased by 30°C compared to the conventional extractant of tetrachloroethylene (Te-Ex), benefiting from the trichloroethylene (Tr-Ex) extractant. The pre-wash process with trichloroethylene could ideally remove oil impurities of about 0.09% but retain the surface oligomers on the fibers, endowing the method of with promising accuracy. PET staple fibers with various contents of surface oligomers were extracted with Tr-Ex, and the achieved contents (i.e. 0.320%/0.527%/0.876%) were similar to those with Te-Ex (i.e. 0.307%/0.516%/0.828%), and the contents with Tr-Ex were all slightly higher than those with Te-Ex, indicating that the extraction efficiency of Tr-Ex improved by ∼4.10% compared with that of Te-Ex. It was confirmed that Tr-Ex method has excellent accuracy compared with as the Te-Ex method and better extraction effect than the Te-Ex method; maybe possibly dipole–dipole interaction between trichloroethylene and oligomer molecules was responsible for the better effect. This quantitative characterization method has potential application in industrial online measurement of surface oligomers on PET fibers, films and related materials.",

As a common asymmetric exercise, playing badminton may produce different breast motion and require different breast support from symmetric exercise such as running. This study aimed to characterize breast displacement during two typical badminton movements and determine breast support requirements for playing badminton. Three-dimensional displacement of left and right breasts for female participants (75B, Chinese bra sizing) was calculated. Breast displacement on the hitting side was significantly greater than that on the other side. Trunk rotation and breast displacement during forehand stroke were greater than that during side-hand stroke. Breast displacement was predominantly mediolateral during forehand strokes. Findings suggest that further research is required to focus on mediolateral breast displacement during badminton forehand strokes. The present findings will be useful for controlling breast motion during playing badminton and in turn avoiding exercised-induced breast pain.",

    "abstract": "Anthraquinone dyes are extensively used in the textile, cosmetic, and food industries because of their bright colors, stability toward chemicals, and resistance against fading. Yet their large-scale application has resulted in great environmental problems. Anthraquinone dyes are extremely recalcitrant, that is, resistant to natural degradation processes, and have toxic impacts on aquatic life and human health. Traditional dye removal methods like adsorption and chemical oxidation tend to be inefficient and expensive, which has necessitated novel approaches. Enzymatic bioremediation is a novel method that has gained popularity due to its sustainability and high catalytic efficiency. This research examines the potential of two enzymes from Flavobacterium sp. 9AF—Putative Multifunctional Dye Peroxidase DyP2 and Glycoside Hydrolase Family 5 Protein—to perform degradation through in silico approaches. Molecular docking showed that DyP2 has greater binding affinities for Solvent Green 3 (−12.1 kcal/mol), Vat Blue 6 (−11.4 kcal/mol), and Reactive Blue 19 (−11.3 kcal/mol) than Glycoside Hydrolase Family 5 Protein. Interaction analysis showed that DyP2 has stronger hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds with pollutants, indicating its better catalytic ability for dye degradation. These results present DyP2 as an attractive biocatalyst for remediation of anthraquinone dye, which has potential for enzyme-based applications in industrial wastewater treatment and conservation.",

This study investigates the enzymatic biodegradation of these pollutants using laccase, tyrosinase, and peroxidase MSP1 from Grifola frondosa . These enzymes, known for their broad substrate specificity, can catalyze the breakdown of complex aromatic structures, making them promising candidates for eco-friendly azo dye removal. Protein sequences were retrieved from NCBI, and physicochemical analysis confirmed structural stability (instability indices &lt;40). Molecular docking with 14 azo dyes identified Congo red as the best-binding substrate, with docking scores of −10.1 (laccase), −10.6 (MSP1), and −11.3 (tyrosinase). Interaction analysis revealed hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces (1.75–5.42 Å) supporting effective binding. Protein–protein interaction scores were high (0.82, 0.88, and 0.84), and STRING co-expression analysis indicated gene clusters involved in azo dye metabolism. These results suggest that combining these enzymes could synergistically enhance azo dye degradation. Future work should focus on enzyme engineering, experimental validation, and scale-up for industrial wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "Noise pollution is one of the most pressing issues in our society today. Controlling noise has become one of the most essential and prevalent factors in the development of acoustic materials. Traditionally, numerous expensive and synthetic sound-absorption materials, such as glass fibre, carbon fibre and polymer fibres were utilised to suppress noise, posing additional harm to living organisms and the environment. Natural fibres derived from renewable resources can be utilised as sound-absorption materials that are inexpensive, bio-degradable, recyclable and readily available. Natural fibre-reinforced composites are currently exclusively used for diverse applications in the automobile industry, construction, building sectors, furniture and other industries. The risk of physical harm and health issues has been greatly reduced by adopting these natural fibre materials. In this research, an attempt has been made to manufacture composites from four natural fibres: hemp, bagasse, Arenga pinnata and bamboo. These four natural fibres were mixed in a 50:50 proportion along with polypropylene and developed into a textile composite using the thermal bonding method. The developed natural composite materials were tested for sound-absorption co-efficient using the impedance tube method and various physical properties, such as flexural rigidity, thickness, tensile strength, elongation, areal density, air permeability and thermal conductivity, were analysed for the composites using the standard testing procedures. All the possible influential factors that determine the acoustic characteristics property of the fibres are taken into consideration for the enhancement of the acoustic absorption of the composites. The sound-absorption co-efficient percent of the Arenga pinnata/polypropylene composite sample is higher than other fibres.",

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a class of harmful chemicals that persist in the environment and our bodies. For indoor upholstery, these finishes are used to prevent staining. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance finishes on commercial indoor fabrics for liquid repellency and stain performance. Three fabrics, each with an unfinished control, a dip finish, and a foam finish, were tested with coffee and oil-based salad dressing stains, two dwell times, two stain application procedures, and three abrasion conditions. Oil stain severity was affected by fabric type, finish, dwell time, and application procedure, but not abrasion. For water-based coffee stains, only fabric type had an effect. Droplet contact angle tests were also performed, revealing water and oil repellency is quickly lost with abrasion. Of the six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance-finished fabrics tested, five showed small improvements in stain performance over unfinished fabrics; however, the performance differences between fabric types were much larger than the benefits from finishes. For oil stains, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance finishes help in ideal conditions when the finish is unabraded, stains are set gently on the fabric, and stains are cleaned quickly. Our results suggest that the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on indoor furniture can be considerably reduced through intentional material selection to achieve better stain performance in lieu of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance finishes.",

    "abstract": "In this research, an industrially adaptable method is designed for antibacterial clothing. The essential oils of oregano and lavender were extracted using water vapor distillation, then they were spray-dried to form microcapsules. Comprehensive morphological analysis revealed the round shape of the microcapsules with smooth surfaces. The mean size of the optimum oregano and lavender microcapsules were 5.2 µm and 2.2 µm. The essential oils were detected in the polymeric matrix as peaks of microcapsules’ infrared spectra resembled both oils and polymer. Thermal analyses showed that encapsulation delays the degradation of the essential oil. The microcapsules were applied to six different fabrics used in sports and leisurewear by exhaustion. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated the existence of capsules after 10 washes. The antibacterial properties of cotton fabrics were assessed against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in terms of the oil and washings. The developed products can serve as a long-lasting, natural antibacterial alternative to other products on the market.",

The embroidery parameters were verified by measuring and calculating surface resistance and signal-to-noise values for manufactured electrodes. Parameters explored in this study included different conductive threads, stitch patterns, stitch densities, and fabric grain-to-stitch orientations, using a Melco ® Amaya Bravo Single Head 16 Needle Embroidery Machine. The chosen embroidery parameters were guided by Goncu Berk’s work in “Design of a wearable pain management system with embroidered TENS electrodes.” An additional aim of the study was to measure the performance of developed e-broidery TENS electrode samples after laundering stresses, following AATCC Test Method 61. The surface resistivity and signal-to-noise values of e-broidered electrodes were measured pre- and post-laundering. The surface resistivity values were again measured and compared to the pre-laundering data. Findings support that core-spun conductive thread stitched parallel to the bias grain is recommended for longevity and reduced impact of laundering. This study of embroidered TENS electrode performance provided crucial insight into better understanding life span and viability as a future “smart” medical wearable device.",

While the release of microplastics during the laundering process and within wastewater treatment plants has been extensively studied, there is still a pressing need for a standardised sampling protocol to assess microplastic release across various matrices involved in different textile production processes. In this report, we propose a comprehensive sampling protocol targeting four types of samples derived from textile production processes: sludge, wastewater, dust, and air. We also provide a detail method for the extraction and analysis of microplastics from these samples, including the separation of microplastics from collected textile samples through cellulose dissolution, oxidation, and oleophilic extraction processes, as well as heat treatment for air samples. This is followed by automated methods for quantifying microplastic fibres. The proposed protocol provides an efficient, effective, straightforward, cost-effective, and safe approach for analysing and monitoring textile-related microplastics.",

Primary research questions include: (1) what are the material and chemical properties of post-consumer textile waste from a sustainable fashion take-back program; (2) which natural post-consumer textile waste is most suitable to support the growth of natural dye plants in a hydroponics system; and (3) can the use of post-consumer textile waste in a hydroponics system be scaled to support a circular fashion supply chain? This study focuses on wool, cotton, linen, silk, rayon, and Tencel ® lyocell as substrates to nurture the growth of purple basil, a natural dye plant. Vertical hydroponics is a farming method that uses nutrient water to grow plants in place of soil throughout the year. The system can be indoors, making resourceful use of limited space available and the water is recirculated. Standard hydroponic substrates, like peat moss and rockwool, have good porosity for oxygen transport and suitable moisture holding capacity for nutrient delivery. In this study, we compared the performance of the standard hydroponic substrates with various textiles. The impact on water quality, color release, moisture wicking, stability against degradation, and survival rate of the plants was used to evaluate suitability in the application. Wool, silk, and Tencel lyocell demonstrated good durability in the hydroponic system, like peat moss and rockwool, during the first growth cycle. During the second growth cycle, protein fibers—wool and silk—supported plant survival at a greater capacity than Tencel lyocell. Future research can confirm that wool and silk can support the growth of natural dye plants with a larger sample size. This research aligns with several circular economy objectives and provides a model for future research to support circular fashion supply chains.",

Yet, there is a gap in fabric selection techniques that consider multi-criteria decisions and account for the varying functional needs across different body regions. Here, we proposed a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach, merging the efficacy coefficient method, analytic hierarchy process, entropy weight, and technique of order preference by similarity to the ideal solution for developing ergonomic modular outdoor workwear. This method is tailored for anti-heat stress workwear, balancing competing functional demands. Initial research involved surveying workwear requirements in terms of human, clothing, and environmental factors, leading to the selection and testing of 15 fabrics for 6 partitioned designs. We established data standardization by the efficacy coefficient method and six evaluation index systems for human body requirements, with analytic hierarchy process and entropy methods determining subjective and objective criteria weights. The technique of order preference by similarity was used to produce the ideal solution then ranking of pre-screened fabrics, culminating in the optimal selection. For validation, three uniform prototypes were developed and tested through sweating manikin experiments and human wear trials to affirm the effectiveness of our approach. The partitioned design method proved more effective for anti-heat stress workwear for outdoor workers compared to existing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Mitigating health issues utilizing medicinal plants is an ancient practice that has surged in recent times due to the advent of sophisticated technology. Plant extracts incorporated in electrospun nanofibers having biocompatibility and germicidal activity are, therefore, become a competitive choice for biomedical applications. In this study, a novel co-axial electrospun nanofibrous mat with enhanced antimicrobial performance was successfully developed using poly (vinyl alcohol) in the core and collagen– Nigella sativa in the sheath. The structural analysis of the developed nanofibrous mat through a scanning electron microscope revealed the formation of nanofibers with diameters varying from 205 to 250 nm randomly oriented in the membrane. The FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed the existence of poly(vinyl alcohol), collagen, and nigella extract in the nanofibrous mat from their respective characteristic peaks. The bactericidal assay against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria through the agar diffusion method demonstrated an improved antibacterial performance with a higher zone of inhibition (17 and 37 mm) of the coaxial electrospun nanofibers with the increased amount of nigella extract. The moisture management profile indicated an adequate interaction between nanofibers and moisture/liquid, transferring the fluids through the membrane satisfactorily. The formation of such electrospun nanofibers will pave the way for selecting electrospinning techniques for appropriate designing and fabricating nanofibrous materials with enhanced functional properties for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the fabric performance of tight tops and the influence of clothing pressure on the relative slip between clothing and the human body, a simulation model based on finite element analysis is proposed. This model simulates the relative slip distance under dynamic conditions. Initially, a three-dimensional model for numerical simulation was established through reverse engineering. Subsequently, material properties and boundary conditions were defined. Finally, the model was analyzed using ANSYS Workbench, and the obtained results were compared with the stretch ratio of the skin on the human back. The results indicate that, under constant conditions, the Young’s modulus of the fabric has a greater influence on the slip and shows a significant positive correlation, with correlation coefficients ( R) all exceeding 0.99. The impact of clothing pressure on sliding is relatively small, and the sliding distance decreases with an increase in clothing pressure. In addition, it has been demonstrated that there is a significant correlation ( p &lt; 0.05) between the relative sliding distance of clothing and the stretch ratio of the skin. The study could provide a helpful guideline for the design of smart clothing, and it can provide valuable insights for various applications, such as sportswear and medical apparel.",

    "abstract": "Uniform, stable, one-step dyeing of textile fabrics made from a mixture of natural and synthetic fibers using traditional methods remains problematic to this day. As an alternative to traditional methods, a one-step method for dyeing mixed cotton and polyester fabrics with a new natural dye—a complex of collagen and [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] ions—was proposed for the first time. Dyeing of pre-prepared cotton, polyester, and cotton–polyester fabrics is carried out by dipping in an aqueous dye solution, squeezing, drying, and heat setting. The influence of the mass ratio of dye components, fixation temperature, and pH of the solution on the degree of dye fixation was determined. A degree of sorption of dyes (14–25%) from the solution onto the surface of fabrics was established, which after heat fixation decreases slightly (1–3%). During washing processes, the copper complex is almost completely washed out from polyester and blended fabrics and remains in small quantities (2.4–3.8%) on the surface of cotton fabrics. After water washing, the degree of fixation of the collagen–chrome complex in fabrics is as follows: in cotton—8–10%, in polyester—10–12%, and in cotton–polyester—8–9%. The color coordinates of cotton and cotton–polyester fabrics hardly change before and after washing, but for polyester fabric, the changes are significant. The mechanism of interaction of the complex dye with the fibers was studied using the Fourier transform infrared method, and the morphology and distribution of the dye on the surface of the samples using the SEM-EDS method. The dye binds to cellulose through ionic and coordination bonds, and to polyester through joint melting. Therefore, unlike pure polyester fabric, cotton and cotton–polyester fabrics demonstrated high color fastness to washing and light fastness. The use of production waste, the exclusion of synthetic dyes and harmful chemicals, and single-stage dyeing of the material reduce the environmental burden.",

Researchers partnered with Creditex S.A.A., a vertically integrated textile company from Peru, to perform the research in a realistic factory setting. Creditex printed a 16-color design for an order of 1000m cotton fabric with reactive dye occupying both rotary-screen printing and digital textile printing and collected environmental impact data throughout the production process, including consumption, usage, and wastage.

    "abstract": "Worldwide, there is growing concern over the toxicity of arsenic in drinking water. The US Environmental Protection Agency and Central Pollution Control Board (India) have set a safe limit of 50 parts per billion for arsenic in drinking water. Millions of people are at immediate risk due to high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water, particularly in developing nations where arsenic poisoning symptoms have been observed. One of the essential techniques described in this article is the absorption of arsenic from contaminated water by sustainable cellulosic materials like jute and wood sawdust after suitable modification. Jute and sawdust are cheap and abundantly available in South Asia. They are functionalized with polypyrrole coating by in situ chemical polymerization of pyrrole in aqueous medium in the presence of ferric chloride. Polypyrrole-coated jute fabric (with 11.28% polypyrrole add-on) and polypyrrole-coated sawdust (with 5.28% polypyrrole add-on) are found to be excellent adsorbers of arsenic ion (As 3+ ) from water. The effect of dosage of polypyrrole-coated adsorbents, treatment time and pyrrole concentration on the As removal efficiency have been investigated in this work. The arsenic concentration in water is determined using a microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometer with the highest level of accuracy. Maximum As removal efficiency by the polypyrrole-coated sawdust and polypyrrole-coated jute fabric is found to be 80.90% and 97.3%, respectively, from a 50 mL, 7.5 parts per million As solution with a dosage of 1 g at neutral pH. The polypyrrole-coated jute and sawdust are characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to understand the chemical interaction between cellulose and polypyrrole molecules. The scanning electron microscope studies reveal a uniform coating of polypyrrole around the surface of jute fibre and sawdust particles. Thermo-gravimetric analysis shows good thermal stability of jute and sawdust after polypyrrole coating.",

The proposed improved Faster R-CNN model with Region Proposal Network (RPN), Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), and Region of Interest (ROI) Align can achieve a detection accuracy of 98% and an mean of Average Precision (mAP) of 85%, which is more competitive than the state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection algorithms.",

This study aimed to manufacture knitted denim fabrics made from various blend ratios of cotton, polyester, and spandex fibers. Seven fabrics with a fiber blend ratio ranging from 95% cotton/5% spandex to 30% cotton/65% polyester/5% spandex were developed using a weft circular knitting machine. First, the twill effect of the knitted denim fabric was brought by following a cross terry knitting structure to produce each fabric sample of this study. After that, the fabric performance was analyzed by characterizations, such as areal density, pilling and abrasion resistance, dimensional stability, stretch, and recovery, tear strength, bursting strength, air permeability, vertical wicking, liquid absorbency capacity, and different colorfastness tests. The results showed that different cotton, polyester, and spandex fiber compositions did not significantly affect knitted denim fabrics’ weight per unit area, abrasion resistance, and different color fastness properties. However, the elongation and vertical wicking test data showed that the knitted denim fabrics with a higher cotton fiber ratio were better. However, the results from shrinkage, spirality, pilling, recovery, strength, air permeability, and liquid absorbency capacity tests revealed the benefits of having a higher polyester fiber ratio in the cotton/polyester/spandex blended knitted denim fabrics. One-way analysis of the variance test was also performed on the generated data of this study and reported in the respective section of the article.",

According to the findings, higher solution concentrations result in longer straight jet lengths, smaller envelope cones, and lower whipping frequencies. Scanning electron microscopy was used to ascertain the diameter and surface morphology of polystyrene fibers, revealing that fibers spun with higher solution concentrations had larger diameters. In contrast, low concentration solutions receive more electric field forces due to higher conductivity. The jet tends to break, and fibers with the beads-on-a-string morphology form. Furthermore, the influence of voltage on microbead shape has been further examined using the simulation software COMSOL.

    "abstract": "Novel coatings containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with strong bonding and controllable antibacterial activity on polyamide 6,6 fabric were produced by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma-assisted deposition at atmospheric pressure and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) layers. Silver ion release was tuned using a \"sandwich\" coating structure to prolong the antibacterial effect. The novel spray-assisted deposition increased deposition rates of AgNPs using atmospheric pressure DBD plasma treatment when an HMDSO layer was applied. An increase in AgNPs deposition in plasma treated samples and antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli ) for samples with an additional HMDSO layer was observed. These coatings allow the development of new and safe wound dressings able to switch the antimicrobial effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by washing the dressing at high temperature (75 °C) before application.",

Strain sensing is the measurement of fabric deformation by embedding a strain-sensitive material in it and subjecting it to stress. This paper presents an extensive classification of knitted textile strain sensors. Salient knitted strain sensor production parameters, such as conductive yarn choice, fabric structure, fabric structure deformation, and its relationship to strain signal extraction are discussed. The study concludes that producing yarn-based soft strain sensors for smart textile applications is viable. However, sensitive yarns with the right conductivity, count, and structural configuration are often unavailable. Work remains in the areas of efficient fabric deformation, signal extraction methods, development of sensor nodes, and robust experimental testing systems.",

An aqueous ethyl cellulose dispersion and a spirooxazine-based photochromic dye were used as a shell and core material, respectively. The effects of main encapsulation parameters, such as solvent type, inlet temperature, feed rate, solid content, and aspirator rate were investigated. The encapsulation results were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, particle size measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microcapsules obtained from a water-ethanol mixture exhibited photochromic properties. For microcapsule production, the optimum feed rate, total solid content, and aspirator rate were determined. Capsule formation improved with increased inlet air temperature. Spray drying to produce photochromic microcapsules could be a practical method for production of photochromic smart textiles.",

We started with the ShuffleNet V2 feature extractor, added five deconvolution layers as the decoder, and used a resize bilinear to produce the segmentation mask. To solve the sample imbalance problem, we used an improved loss function to guide network learning. We evaluated our model on the fabric defect data set.

    "abstract": "The popular use of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in commercial textile products that inhibit odor- and/or infection-causing bacteria has continuously raised concerns about their washing durability. The poor durability not only deteriorates the antibacterial performance, but also results in unwanted leaching of NPs into washing solutions. In this study, we showed how the incorporation location of Ag NPs—interior vs. exterior of cotton fiber—governs their durability against consecutive simulated home launderings. The superior washing durability of interior NPs was confirmed. The Ag losses after 50 laundering cycles for interior and exterior systems were 16% and 63% in water and 24% and 78% in detergent solution, respectively. The cotton fabric containing interior NPs predominantly released ionic Ag, whereas the fabric containing exterior NPs released particulate Ag.",

Passive and active ventilation openings were fabricated into structural turnout suits and tested with and without the SCBA to determine the effect on clothing ventilation. Turnout suits were evaluated under two test conditions on a sweating manikin to measure thermal and evaporative resistance. A predicted total heat loss (THL) value was calculated for each suit and compared to a control turnout without ventilation openings. A significant improvement in heat loss was measured when the SCBA harness, mask, and thermal hood were removed from the structural ensemble. Results showed the SCBA harness significantly decreased heat loss in firefighter turnouts.",

    "abstract": "Jute, a natural golden fibre, is renewable and widely available and mostly used for the packaging of agricultural crops and commodities in the form of sack bag. However, over a period of time it has secured its own market in the field of home textiles and other lifestyle products due to its ethnic colour, good strength and biodegradable properties. Recently, jute has also been used in apparel products, particularly meant for outer and winter garments. Bleaching of jute has thus become an essential operation for making a white glossy fabric, that is, the base material to be used for subsequent coloration. The conventional hot hydrogen peroxide bleaching process produces good white fibre with a high loss in tensile strength. The present peracetic acid bleaching of scoured jute produces a satisfactory whiteness index of 65.8–77.7 with minimum loss of bundle strength. The peracetic acid bleached jute fibre could retain 85% of its bundle strength, when the bleaching was carried out at 70°C with 20 g/l peracetic acid for 120 min. A satisfactory whiteness index of 77 (Hunter scale) can be achieved incurring a low weight loss of &lt;4.2 using the optimized recipe. The peracetic acid bleaching process may be considered as energy efficient and environment friendly, as the process is carried out at a near neutral pH of 7.5–8 and lower temperature of 50–70°C, in comparison to the 85–90°C and pH level of 11–11.5 (highly alkaline) normally used in hydrogen peroxide bleaching. The changes in physical, morphological and chemical properties after the peracetic acid bleaching of jute at optimized conditions were evaluated in detail.",

The cementitious matrix consisting of cement, fly ash, viscosity-modifying agent, and silica fume was prepared, and the matrix tailoring was performed to achieve improved mechanical performance. The prepared composites were evaluated by rheology, three-point bending, and tensile characterizations. It is found that with the given local ingredients and matrix modification, the toughness index value of 100 ( I 40 ) according to the American Society for Testing and Materials can be achieved. Besides, the tensile results showed the improvement of 45% and 60% for first-cracking strength and peak tensile strength values, respectively. The effects of matrix modification are also analyzed statistically using the analysis of variance for the mechanical properties of the cementitious composite. The post hoc statistical analysis using the Tukey–Kramer honestly significant difference illustrated the optimum cementitious mix from the experimental data. The presented results of cost-effective strain-hardening cementitious composite are expected to promote the practical applications of strain-hardening cementitious composite in China.",

    "abstract": "Lifestyle changes have altered the consumption behavior of people. As one of the most energy-intensive and energy-consuming activities in the apparel consumption process, laundry and clothes drying have a significant impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and water consumption. Undergraduates are a special category of people whose worldviews are in the developmental stage, and it is important to study and develop their beliefs and behaviors regarding environmental consumption. This study investigates and evaluates the relationship between undergraduates’ consumption behaviors and environmental impacts. The 125 undergraduates in Hangzhou, China are classified into three different washing modes: H-mode (hand-washing only), M-mode (machine-washing only), and HM-mode (hand- and machine-washing) on the basis of their washing behavior. The environmental impacts including water footprint and carbon footprint of undergraduates are calculated by the methods of direct consumptive carbon footprint ([Formula: see text]) and direct consumptive water footprint ([Formula: see text]). The results show that the factors leading to the environmental impacts of Hangzhou undergraduates’ apparel consumption behavior are: washing frequency, consumer knowledge, washing method, drying frequency and method and clothing purchase quantity. It also reveals that higher washing and drying frequencies can lead to more energy and water consumption, which ultimately result in more severe environmental impact. Besides, consumer knowledge, washing and drying method do have a significant influence on undergraduates’[Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Understanding the factors that influence undergraduates’ apparel consumption behavior can help cultivate their environmental awareness as well as provide guidance to the government and universities in identifying the environmental impact of undergraduates’ clothing consumption.",

The generation model and the discrimination model are trained using the concept of the cyclic confrontation game of Cycle GAN. In the training process, the loss function served to stimulate the background image and camouflage images mapping to each other. The generated image is captured into the recognition model for recognition, so as to provide feedback on the findings. Finally, the camouflage image with background image characteristics is output to realize the generation of an end-to-end camouflage image. The camouflage evaluation index is used to detect the quality of color, texture, and edge of the experimental output image.

However, challenges such as the lack of defective samples and issues with industrial deployment still persist. This paper presents a novel defect detection technique based on deep learning, which primarily comprises two frameworks. First, we design an improved generative adversarial network with an encoder–decoder architecture to address the paucity of requisite defective samples. We use defect-free samples as input to the generator, ensuring that the generated defect samples maintain a similar pattern. We mitigate the vanishing gradient problem using Wasserstein distance as the loss function. Second, we enhance the Single Shot MultiBox Detector network by introducing Inception modules and feature fusion to detect defects across different scales. The AdaBound optimizer is selected to update the model parameters. We compare the proposed approach with other methods on self-generated fabric data sets that are partially produced by our generative adversarial network model. An online defect detection system is proposed to capture fabric images and evaluation in a production environment. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach, achieving 97.5% accuracy in real time, making it well-suited for application in the industry.",

In order to distinguish and identify water bath dyeing products and non-aqueous medium dyeing products, a traceability technology method for non-aqueous medium dyeing products was established with rare earth elements. First, traceable materials for two typical fibers, polyester and cotton, were selected from five rare earth elements: La, Ce, Nd, Eu, and Sm. Rare earth elements were added to mark products during the non-aqueous dyeing process. Then the rare earth elements content of marked products was detected by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, which was used to identify non-aqueous media products. The influence of this traceability method on the basic properties of dyed fabrics was studied. Compared with traditional anti-counterfeiting technologies such as label anti-counterfeiting and query label anti-counterfeiting, the method of inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry has a low method detection limit in the range of 0.0204–0.036 mg/kg, and a good relative standard deviation values in the range of 0.69–2.43%. The content of rare earth elements in dyed fabrics was detected by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry at 6–7 mg/kg when 10 mg/kg of rare earth elements were employed during dyeing. Therefore, a detection and certification method for non-aqueous dyeing products has been established, which is of great significance to the anti-counterfeiting traceability of non-aqueous medium dyeing technology.",

Moreover, the rubbing fastness was improved by the electrostatic interaction between the cellulosic fiber and indigo after treating with fixing agent. Indigo dyeing of cotton fiber was possible in the silicone non-aqueous dyeing system.",

The reason for the hydrophilicity of the fiber after enzymatic treatment was thought to be functional groups produced after this process, but their peak intensities in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were low and shaded by other functional groups. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the enzymatic treatment did not cause any surface damage. A slight staining ( K/ S = 0.30) of the PET fabrics with the reactive dye occurred after enzymatic treatments. Moreover, the fastness to washing and rubbing of the reactive dye stained fabrics were good to excellent.",

Interest was expressed on the impact of blending and laboratory ginning methods on Uster High Volume Instrument (HVI), Fibronaire, and near infrared (NIR) micronaire measurements. Blending impacts were slight but discernable by NIR only. Very good lint yield agreement was observed between the ginning methods (42–45%). Laboratory ginning impacts on the measured micronaire results were small, with between measurement method and between gin method agreements established. Thus, the use of any of the evaluated gin methods would yield acceptable and comparable micronaire results.",

With this technology, the possibility of eliminating the soaping-off step from the reactive washing sequence was investigated. For the design of an environmentally friendly reactive washing process, the effects of increasing the process temperature of the soaping-off step as well as the use of oxygen-enriched NBs in all washing steps after reactive dyeing with three different dyes were investigated. The results were evaluated by comparing the color coordinates, strength, and fastness of dyed cotton towels washed according to the conventional and alternative processes as well as examining the absorbance and chemical oxygen demand values of the washing baths. Alternative washings did not cause significant differences in color coordinates, while the lowest color strength and highest fastness values were obtained after washing with nanobubbles. The absorbance graphs showed that the most colorful baths belonged to the first bath of the nanobubble washing regime. Chemical oxygen demand measurements revealed that the alternative washing systems were more environmentally friendly than the conventional ones. Based on the results of this study, we concluded that it was possible to implement more eco-friendly washing methods by eliminating the use of soap.",

However, it is still a huge challenge to construct a durable superhydrophobic coating for large-scale applications due to the complicated process and high cost. In this work, a facile two-step method was developed to construct superhydrophobic cotton fabric with fluorine-free treatment. The cotton fabrics were treated with modified nano SiO 2 to construct rough surfaces. Then, the silicone oil was introduced into the surface of the cotton fabric to form superhydrophobic cotton fabric. The results showed that the modified nano SiO 2 and silicone oil were stably fixed on the fiber surface. The static water contact angle test showed that contact angle of the modified cotton fabric was 158°, indicating excellent superhydrophobic properties. Furthermore, the self-cleaning and anti-pollution test results showed that the superhydrophobic cotton fabric possessed good self-cleaning and antifouling performance. This superhydrophobic fabric avoids the use of fluoropolymers and reduces the harm to humans and environment, showing a wide range of applications.",

As a result, the affect model is established with two pairs of opposite emotions, relaxed–excited and disappointed–enjoying, in the vertical and horizontal directions and other four emotions, namely joyful, accepted, boredom, and disgust, in the diagonal direction. Then, 89 bra design features are analyzed through subjective evaluations. Compared with emotions stimulated by the functionality and aesthetics of bras, emotions only visually induced by bra design features range on a smaller scale and are mostly located in the upper right of the emotion model without extremely negative emotions. Finally, we design a loving bra using bra design features which are highly related to the emotional experience of love. The prospect of this study is to explore the feasibility of bra emotional design and pave the way for emotion recognition in fashion consumption.",

By controlling pyrrole solution, oxidant FeCl 3 solution, dopant p-toluene sulfonic acid concentration and reaction time, the optimal process for the preparation of conductive spacer fabrics was obtained. This led to the best preparation process of polypyrrole-coated three-dimensional spacer conductive fabric (polypyrrole/three-dimensional spacer fabrics) being obtained. The results showed that the conductive properties of polypyrrole/three-dimensional spacer fabrics were the best when 0.10 mol/L pyrrole, 0.40 mol/L oxidant FeCl 3 solution, and 0.40 mol/L dopant p-toluene sulfonic acid were prepared within a 2-h reaction time. The properties of polypyrrole/three-dimensional spacer fabrics were analyzed using the results from surface resistance, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, mechanical properties, and stability tests. The results showed that polypyrrole was well attached to the three-dimensional spacer fabric surface, and the concentration of polypyrrole in the fabric exhibited an inverse correlation with changes in surface resistance. The mechanical properties of polypyrrole/three-dimensional spacer fabrics after treatment exhibit superior performance, with consistent changes in the meridional and zonal electrical properties during tensile testing and can maintain excellent long-term electrical stability in atmospheric environments.",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a growing concern in the paper and nonwoven industry, as current research provides alarming results regarding the abundance and persistence of these substances from food packaging producers. It was reported that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances have been detected in blood serum of thousands of individuals originating from food packaging that contains per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. In addition, 20–56% of all products tested had detectable levels that immensely contribute to dietary exposure. Paper mills are also a significant source of exposure due to environmental contamination surpassing emission regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency by over 100,000 parts per trillion. These studies exemplify the necessity for paper-based product producers to not only abide by regulations but also demonstrate the implementation of remediation efforts. With current research on novel remediation techniques and increased restrictions surrounding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance usage for water repellency, decreased contamination and exposure will be achieved throughout the world. This article serves as a brief review that focuses on the nonwoven manufacturing sector, which includes pulp, paper, and tissue related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance contamination in the environment and drinking water sources. This review addresses the statistical evaluation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance levels throughout the world from paper and nonwoven product manufacturing, along with remediation methods and legislation to reduce contamination and exposure. To the best of our ability, this important and sensitive subject area has been researched extensively. However, many data gaps are present within the field, and limited studies have been conducted contributing to this brief review, which highlights the importance of further studies surrounding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the paper and nonwoven sectors. This article encompasses all available information in the paper and nonwoven sector regarding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that can be used for reference by the general public and by manufacturers in the nonwoven production industry.",

Previous studies have indicated the potential influence of water-repellent finishing on heat release properties of clothing. Nevertheless, the impact of durable water repellent in a thermal liner on firefighter heat stress has never been studied. In this work, the impact of durable water-repellent finishing inside the thermal liner on heat stress has been evaluated systematically for the first time, using a sweat-guarded hotplate, a sweating manikin, and a physiological manikin. The results showed that there was no significant difference in heat loss capabilities on the fabric level or garment level between turnout clothing with or without durable water-repellent finishing in the thermal liner. In addition, no significant differences were identified in predicted physiological responses when tested in a mild environment. However, the turnout clothing with durable water-repellent finishing in the thermal liner demonstrated significantly less weight gain after the physiological manikin test. This initial investigation lays the groundwork for understanding how durable water-repellent finishing in thermal liners may impact firefighter comfort. It acts as a starting point for further research on the potential impact of durable water-repellent finishing on thermal protection and overall comfort under various ambient conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of the rib set-out repeat and single miss stitches on the structural properties and dimensional stability of double weft knitted fabrics compared with half Milano rib. Nine variations of double weft knitted fabrics were produced, each with a different number of inactive needles at the width repeat R b . The fabrics were tested after 10 days of dry relaxation and five washings. The fabric’s structural repeat at the height R h consisted of a combination of two courses, rib and plain (variant 1), and rib set-out and single with miss (float) stitch, with stitch repeats varying at the width R b (for variants 2–10). The miss stitch was made on the technical back of the knitted fabrics, and the number of inactive needles during the production of the single and double stitches ranged from 1 to 3. The fabrics were manufactured using a 10-gauge flat bed-knitting machine from blended wool/PAN (60% wool, 40% PAN) 25×2tex×2 yarn. The results demonstrated that the width repeat of miss knit stitches R b (different numbers of knit and miss loop stitches) plays a crucial role in determining the dimensional stability and structural properties of double knitted fabrics. The number of washing cycles did not significantly impact the structural properties (around ±5%). The research results demonstrated shrinkage in the length and width directions, specifically after the first two washing cycles. The rib set-out repeat and single miss stitches affect dimensional changes in both directions: an increase in the number of inactive needles increases shrinkage in the length and decreases shrinkage in the width direction. Overall, this study highlights the importance of the number and placement of miss stitches during the design process of double weft knitted fabrics, particularly when aiming to achieve specific structural and dimensional properties.",

Liquid ammonia, which has exceptional permeability, exerts a certain modification effect on the surface scales of wool in the finishing and processing of wool fabric, thereby enhancing its wear performance. However, limited research has been conducted on the impact of liquid ammonia on valuable wool fibers such as superfine wool and cashmere. In this article, superfine wool tops were treated with continuous liquid ammonia finishing equipment and the effects of liquid ammonia on the microstructure and surface morphology of superfine wool fiber were investigated. In addition, the changes in length, fineness, anti-felting, and dyeing properties of superfine wool fiber after liquid ammonia treatment were examined. The results demonstrated that the interstitial integrity of intercellular substance of superfine wool was compromised following treatment with liquid ammonia, which had a greater tendency to infiltrate cortical cells and induce alterations in wool structure and performance. Furthermore, the surface scales of superfine wool were damaged after treatment with liquid ammonia, leading to improved anti-felting and dyeing properties.",

However, only a few studies have evaluated and compared the environmental impact of different dyeing systems. This study calculated the carbon footprint of low-pressure anhydrous dyeing for polyester and compared with conventional water bath dyeing. The results showed that the carbon footprint of the anhydrous dyeing process was 1670 kgCO 2 eq/1000 kg polyester. Steam occupied the most significant proportion, accounting for 55.5%, followed by electricity at 35.5%. The waste has the lowest environmental impact, with 0.55%. Uncertainty analyses showed that the data and results in this article were reliable. The results of the sensitivity analyses indicated that more attention should be paid to the data quality of steam and electricity. Compared with the traditional water bath dyeing process, the low-pressure anhydrous dyeing system can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% and, more importantly, can avoid almost all the consumption of clean water. This anhydrous dyeing system can save water and reduce carbon emissions, which is of positive significance to the sustainable development of the textile and fashion industry. Further studies could use the water footprint as an indicator to evaluate this dyeing system in terms of water consumption and potential environmental impact.",

    "abstract": "Single jersey weft knit fabrics include a large portion of knitted products. These fabrics are made using different types of stitches. In this study, several single jersey weft knit fabric samples containing four courses and two wales in the repeating unit of the fabric structure were made by introducing and gradually increasing the number of tuck stitches in the structure, to find out the effect of this stitch on fabric properties. Results showed that tuck stitches could positively affect the areal density, width, and tensile properties of the fabric. For some comfort-related properties, tuck stitches were found to improve wicking and drying properties, reduce water vapor transmission rate, and affect fabric smoothness. The position of tuck stitches in the structure also had some effect, but was not as significant as when the number of tuck stitches was varied.",

However, the core limitation of natural fiber reinforced composites are poor consistency among supporting fibers and the matrix.

In this study, chemical treatments (i.e., alkali pretreatment, acid pretreatment, and scouring) were applied to jute fibers for improvement of composite properties. Thermal, thermo-mechanical, and flexural properties, and surface morphology, of untreated and treated jute fibers were studied on the treated fibers. Jute fiber/epoxy composite properties were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), flexural strength and modulus, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The chemical treatments had a significant impact on the properties of jute fiber composites.",

The results indicate that old women have a significantly longer and wider heel than young women as well as significantly larger ball and instep circumferences after normalization for foot length. Old women also exhibit larger deformity in the degree of hallux valgus and more pronated feet than young women do.

In this study, we adopted the chemical footprint method to assess the toxicity impact of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from China’s textile industry. The results indicate that the chemical footprint of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide in China’s textile industry showed a significant decreasing trend from 2001 to 2019, and the chemical footprint of nitrogen oxide was about 11 times higher than that of sulfur dioxide. Among the three sub-sectors of China’s textile industry, the textile manufacturing sector had the highest chemical footprint, accounting for 57.1–65.7% of the total chemical footprint. The remaining chemical footprint is allocated to the chemical fibers manufacturing sector, and the textile wearing apparel, footwear, and cap manufacturing sector. The chemical footprint intensity of China’s textile industry also showed a decreasing trend from 2006 to 2015, and the chemical footprint intensity of the three sub-sectors was in the order of the chemical fibers manufacturing sector, the textile manufacturing sector, and the textile wearing apparel, footwear, and cap manufacturing sector.",

The effect of stitch length and knit structure on comfort characteristics of moisture management finish knitted fabrics was significant. It was observed that single jersey fabrics showed quicker sinking times for the wetting test. In the wicking test, the wicking length increased continuously with stitch length for treated fabrics. In transverse wicking test for one drop of water and to reach saturation point, single jersey fabric shows a larger water spreading area. The time taken to reach saturation point is also shorter. In the moisture vapor transfer test for reduction in height and weight of water, single airtex fabrics show higher values. In the air permeability test, the single jersey structure exhibited higher air permeability values.

For example, melt spinning polyester fibre production, spinning, weaving, fabric dyeing and finishing are high-energy consumption processes. Down processing, fabric dyeing and finishing are typical water consumption and wastewater pollutant discharge processes. Carbon and water footprints are practical tools for evaluating the environmental impact of a product in its life cycle. This article quantified and evaluated the carbon and water footprints of the life cycle of 100 down jackets – from raw material production to recycling and disposal without transportation activities. The results showed that the carbon footprint of the 100 down jackets production was 2544.1 kgCO 2 e with recycling. As for the water footprint, it showed that fabric production had a great impact on water eutrophication and water scarcity. The water scarcity footprint of 100 down jackets production was 27.46 m 3 H 2 Ot, respectively. The water eutrophication footprint generated by producing 100 down jackets in new industry was 1.91 kgPO 4 3− eq. The comprehensive assessment of carbon footprint and water footprint with the life cycle assessment polygon method indicated that the raw material production phase of down jackets generated a more significant impact on the environment than the use phase. The impact on the environment during the use phase is primarily the environmental load on water resources.",

The extracted natural colorant was used to dye jute fabric and characterized by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. Extracts from gallnut and natural alum (fitkiri) were applied as mordants onto the bleached jute fabric by padding method followed by drying in air. The fabrics were treated with the mordants separately before dyeing, and then, both mordants were applied in sequence. Jute was premordanted first with gallnut followed by alum. Jute fibers were mordanted prior to dyeing with either gallnut or alum or both mordants (gallnut followed by alum treatment). Premordanted jute fabric was dyed with the natural dye extracted from marigold petals, and process conditions were standardized. The dual-mordanting process was found more effective to produce better color yield than the single mordanting process. Standardization of the process conditions was also examined statistically by the Box–Behnken design method after choosing the significant variables by the Plackett–Burman design method. The standardized dyeing process conditions were found to be dyeing temperature: 90°C; material to liquor ratio: 1:40; dyeing time: 60 min; dye concentration: 30% o.w.f.; and pH: 11.",

Reactive Black 5 dye wastewater. After chemical coagulation, treated wastewater was reused in the wash-off process. Using 400 ppm of MgCl 2 , a color removal efficacy of 97% was achieved at pH 12 for synthetic Reactive Black 5 dye wastewater. Coagulant FeSO 4 yielded 85% color removal efficiency under the same conditions. The fabric washed with coagulant-treated wastewater had a total color difference (Δ E cmc ) value of &lt;1.0, which is commercially acceptable. The colorfastness of the fabrics washed with coagulant-treated wastewater was comparable to those washed off with fresh water.",

The alcohols considered included 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, 1-decanol, isooctyl alcohol, and 2-octanol. The impact of alkyl alcohols on defoaming performance was examined and an acceptable dose of 1-octanol was determined. Results showed that defoaming ability, adhesion to fibers, and film behaviors depended on the alkyl group and dose of alcohols used. Straight alcohols were superior to the branched ones tested in defoaming ability and properties. Generally, 1-octanol was the best defoamer of the selected alcohols. Excessive increases in alkyl length and dose induced poor defoaming and damaged the adhesion and film behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Nylon fibers were the first synthetic fibers to be produced on an industrial scale, and they are one of the most consumed synthetic fibers due to their visual and usage properties. Reactive dyes have been commercially produced since the mid-20th century, and they are mostly preferred in dyeing cellulosic fibers. The most important property of reactive dyes is their ability to make covalent bonds within the fiber. Mordants are used mainly in the application of natural dyes to hold and retain the dye molecules in the fiber. In this paper, nylon fabrics were dyed with three reactive dyes having different reactive groups (monochlorotiazine, trifluoropyrimidine and monochlorotriazine/vinylsulfone) in the presence of three chemical mordants (iron (II) sulfate, potassium aluminum sulfate and tannic acid) to obtain better exhaustion and coloration properties. Pre-mordanting, meta-mordanting, and post-mordanting processes were used for dyeing. The dyeings were performed at two dyeing concentrations (0.5% and 2% owf), and at three pH levels (pH 2, 4, and 6). The percentage of dyebath exhaustion (%E), the percentage fixation of the dye which exhausted (%F) and the overall percentage fixation (%T) were calculated after pyridine extraction. Wash and light fastness tests were applied on the dyed samples. The results were discussed via % E, % T and CIELAB color differences (Δ E ab *). The results revealed that mordant usage improved the coloration properties of reactive dyes on nylon fabrics. The % E and % T results changed according to the independent variations of pH level, mordant chemical and mordanting method. The correct pH level and mordanting method gave the best dyeing and fastness results for the dyes under test.",

In addition, the textile treated with the modified berberine showed better color fastness and much better UV protection ability. This study shows that this novel modified berberine can be suitably applied to prepare multifunctional textiles for many fabrics.",

The N(1s) XPS spectrum of fixing agent A aftertreated fabric showed the concentration of uncharged and quaternary nitrogen species, while fixing agent B portrayed only uncharged nitrogen. Fixing agent A improved the washfastness of the dyed fabric to a greater extent than fixing agent B, owing to the presence of the quaternary nitrogen species. Improvement in the resistance to oxidation of the dye during domestic laundering was observed.",

The control afterclearing treatment was a conventional reductive clearing by thiourea dioxide and caustic soda.

From the spectrophotometric graphic analysis in CIELAB, a conclusion can be made on the lifespan of photochromic textile products.

In addition, equilibrium isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics of GO adsorption on the silk surface in a batch sorption process are examined to understand the adsorption mechanism. The Freundlich isotherm best describes the adsorption of GO onto the silk. A pseudo-second order kinetic model best describes the kinetics of GO adsorption. Thermodynamic studies reveal that GO adsorption is spontaneous and exothermic.",

This study adopts the somatosensory interactive hat as a carrier to explore an interactive clothing design method that reflects human emotions. The emotional semantic evaluation method is used to guide the design process of the prototype. Brain wave detection sensors and LEDs are embedded in the prototype. The results show that this dynamic interactive hat can enhance the visual attraction of the fashion accessories, and the humanistic emotional value of the smart clothing, improving the match between product attributes and users’ emotional response.",

However, real-world fabric defect images generally contain several types of defects in one image. Accurately recognizing and classifying multi-class fabric defect images is still an unsolved issue due to the complexity of intersected defects, as well as difficulty in distinguishing small-size defects. To address these challenges, this study develops a methodology based on the deep learning feature pyramid networks (FPN) approach to detect multi-class fabric defects. To evaluate the proposed detection model, we built a unique multi-class fabric defects database (DHU-MO1000), where multi-class defect images are generated by industrial monitors from a textile factory. We used the dataset as the benchmark for multi-class defects detection training and testing the FPN. Furthermore, we conducted extensive experimental validations for various design choices. The experimental results show that the model outperformed existing multi-class object detection methods.",

Four kinds of gradient pressure socks were randomly ordered into 24 groups. Each subject needed to complete six experiments of all. The experiment was divided into two parts including a fatigue induced experiment and an intermittent fatigue induced experiment. The vertical jump height, blood oxygen saturation, local hemoglobin, blood flow, and Visual Analogue Score (VAS) were tested in each experiment. It was found that high pressure level has a significant effect on the vertical height after intermittent induced fatigue; however, the analysis showed no difference among sock pressure levels on blood oxygen saturation, local hemoglobin, blood flow, or VAS subjective feeling evaluation. The effect of compression socks was better than that of non-pressure socks. If the exercise intensity is strong, high-pressure socks can make contributions on recovery. If the exercise intensity is low, low-pressure socks contribute to greater comfort. This study concluded that different exercise intensities required different sock pressures to promote the muscle recovery after sports.",

Seven cases of contaminant identification were studied; in each case, examination with a FTIR spectrometer and a reflection accessory provided inconclusive determinations. Spectra of contaminants were easily obtained with the FTIR microscope. While small deviations were observed, comparison to reference spectra allowed easy contaminant identification. This proof-of-concept study indicates that the FTIR-FPA microscope was particularly useful for identifying minute contaminants.

    "abstract": "Stretch woven fabrics continue to grow in popularity, offering superior elastic properties and comfort. However, there are a number of factors (e.g., elongation, recovery, growth, tensile strength, tearing strength, and shrinkage) that can affect the attributes and performance of stretch woven fabric. These were investigated in the present study in relation to different elastane content and thread density. Blended cotton woven fabrics containing an increased elastane content gave enhanced elongation and recovery, despite a decrease in thread density. The tensile strength, tearing strength, shrinkage, and fabric growth decreased when the elastane ratio increased, regardless of the decline in warp thread density.",

The optimum pH for chlorination of the treated cotton fabrics was investigated. Chlorination at pH 11 achieved a small color difference and greater than 0.2% of active chlorine loading. When challenged, the chlorinated fabrics inactivated all inoculated Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) within 5 min. The treated cotton fabric had greater breaking strength than those treated with the traditional process, as well as good washing stability.",

An extended shower duration of 60 minutes or 120 minutes is recommended, with additional calculations to objectively quantify surface wetting. This increased test period demonstrated differences in performance between repellent finishes with a 1.37 g mass difference between fluorinated and non-fluorinated chemistries after 120 minutes.

However, photochromic dye application onto textile materials by conventional finishing techniques has difficulties due to their low water solubility and low affinity to the textile materials. Encapsulation technology could be used to overcome these problems in the production of photochromic textile materials. This article, which is the third in a three-part series, deals with the application of photochromic dye microcapsules produced by a spray drying method onto cotton fabrics. The photochromic dye microcapsules were applied onto cotton fabrics by a pad–dry–cure process. Color build up and ultraviolet transmittance of the resultant photochromic fabrics were evaluated after the application and consecutive washing. Moreover, the fatigue resistance of the photochromic fabrics was studied and the effects of the incorporation of hindered amine light stabilizers into microcapsules were investigated. Ultraviolet protection factor values of the samples were found to be 50+ even after 20 washing cycles. It was shown that the photochromic fabrics have a loss of 10% in ultraviolet protection factor values and 20% in color values after 20 ultraviolet irradiation cycles and the fatigue resistance of the photochromic dye capsules improved with the use of hindered amine light stabilizer compounds during microcapsule production.",

However, information on the composition and dynamic analysis of tobacco smoke and hot pot odors on fabrics during desorption is limited. This study used gas chromatography–mass spectrometry to analyze the desorption components of cotton, wool, and polyester fabrics exposed to these two odors, respectively. Then, a dynamic diffusion fabric structure model demonstrated the effect of airflow velocity and fabric porosity on nicotine desorption. Furthermore, we proposed mass diffusion coefficients with different molecular weights. The results showed that cotton fabrics with tobacco smoke released many low molecular weight compounds, while with wool fabrics significantly fewer compounds were detected than for the other two fabrics. Notably, 3-ethenylpyridine, a marker of tobacco smoke, was not detected in wool fabrics. For hot pot odor, cotton fabrics released more hexanal, nonanal, and anethole than wool and polyester, while wool fabrics released many β-pinenes. The numerical results of the dynamic model showed that the air inlet velocity significantly affects the nicotine concentration in the fabric. Meanwhile, the concentration of nicotine in fabrics with lower porosity decreased faster. A lower mass diffusion coefficient will cause odors to remain in the fabric. This study aimed at the composition and the dynamics of odor in fabrics and offers essential information and simple models for reducing unnecessary washing of textiles and odor resistance textile design.",

However, PVA released from textile effluent treatment affects water organisms. Protein-based sizes required higher percent add-on to provide strength similar to PVA, but had excellent desizing, even at room temperature using low liquor ratios. Similarly, protein-based sizes degraded easily in activated sludge with COD and BOD 5 values well within the prescribed limits.

    "abstract": "Professional dancers incur expense when their pointe shoes are damaged by rapid abrasion and tear degradation. The mechanical properties of a typical pointe shoe fabrication were compared with potential alternatives. Individual test results varied in tensile strength, abrasion resistance, tear strength, seam strength, and seam efficiency. Eco-friendly stretch (A), stretch satin (E), gabardine (L), and plain-weave linen (M) fabrications had lower breaking loads and less abrasion resistance than the control. Elmendorf tear strength showed Fabrics E, silk chiffon (G), L, and ripstop (N) gave better results than the control. Seam strength calculation of force perpendicular to a seam showed that poplin (B), E, L, and N fabrications performed better than the control fabric. Overall results indicated that Fabrics E, L, and N were highly recommended for use in pointe shoes.",

    "abstract": "A mixture of minerals consisting of calcite, dolomite, talc and quartz, known to have infrared (IR) reflecting properties, was mechanically treated and dispersed in aqueous medium and incorporated in viscose solution to be physically entrapped into the fibre structure. The process of incorporation of the mineral mixture in viscose dope involved steps of slurry making by suspending and grinding the particles in aqueous medium followed by mixing the slurry with the viscose dope, ready for spinning. The slurry preparation and grinding were carried out under different mechanical conditions, such as ball milling and ultrasonication. The evaluation of particle size of slurry was carried out under two pH conditions, first at the inherent pH (neutral pH 7) and at high pH (alkaline pH 13) equivalent to the pH of viscose dope. Furthermore, for stable slurry making, different surfactants were used. The phosphate ether-based anionic surfactant was found to effectively stabilize the dispersion better under the pH conditions used. The effect of stable slurry on good spinning was validated through an inline pressure gauge during viscose fibre spinning. To assess the IR reflecting property of viscose fibre, a direct visual evaluation was done through an IR camera, which indicated a significant increase of ~2°C surface temperature of the IR-Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) in comparison with control VSF.",

    "abstract": "Existing click-through rate prediction models employ both a shallow model and a deep neural model for better feature interaction. The former shallow model aims to extract explainable explicit features and the latter deep neural model aims to learn efficient implicit features. Deep neural network is a commonly used deep neural model, which can yield better performance with more neural layers. However, increasing the number of neural layers would lead to problems such as gradient vanishing, gradient explosion, and excessive parameters. In addition, the performance of a deep neural network will also decrease rapidly when it becomes too deep. In this article, we propose a novel click-through rate prediction model by improving the deep neural model part to alleviate the above problems of deep neural network-based models. This article proposes to utilize a dense deep neural network model to strengthen feature propagation, which takes the outputs of all previous layers as the input of the current layer, instead of only one previous layer being used in the deep neural network. In addition, we also utilize an advanced shallow model FmFM for better explicit features in this article, and explicit and implicit features are interacted in our model. Experiments on two data sets (Criteo and Avazu) show that the proposed click-through rate prediction model significantly outperforms existing classical models such as DeepFM, xDeepFM, and DeepLight models.",

StylishGAN learns proportional transformation and texture information through a proposed body-shaping attentional module.

To implement our method, we prepare a new fashion dataset, namely, StylishU, that consists of 3578 paired photo–sketch images.

However, while facing lots of information, how to help users make better decisions on their next travel goals through their historical interest spots is a direction that needs further research in big data recommendation systems. In this thesis, we proposed the deep convolution and multi-head self-attention position network model. First, it extracts the user’s historical interest point feature information by convolutional neural network method, and then performs horizontal and vertical filtering. Next, it interacts the obtained information with the candidate attraction information, and extracts the location information of the historical interest sequence by the multi-head self-attention mechanism. Finally, the model does the attention mechanism of the candidate attraction by fusing the feature information of the location information. The final model achieves a deep fusion of user sequence interest and location feature information. We conducted detailed comparison experiments with the very popular models in the industry on different public datasets, and the results showed that our deep convolution and multi-head self-attention position network model has good performance.",

    "abstract": "The low scouring efficiency of mercerized cotton yarns scoured with alkaline and acid pectinases, reported in previously published articles, raised the hypothesis of the lack of pectinase adsorption onto mercerized cotton. In an attempt to identify whether low pectinase adsorption occurs, the adsorption of alkaline and acid pectinases on raw and mercerized cotton yarns is measured using the Lowry protein assay, while laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy is used to visually show the presence/absence of the enzymes on the surface of the cotton yarns. In addition, the surface zeta potential of the raw and mercerized cotton yarns is measured to identify the influence of the surface charge on the adsorption ability of the used enzymes. Data suggest that although used substrates have adsorbed more alkaline than acid pectinase, the adsorption of both enzymes is more intensive onto the mercerized cotton relative to raw cotton. The similar surface zeta potential of the raw and mercerized yarns indicates that higher enzyme adsorption on mercerized cotton is not influenced by the surface charge. Laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy micrographs depict an evident increase of fluorescing signal with scouring time to raw and mercerized cotton yarn. The more intensive signals after 60 min of enzymatic scouring with both enzymes suggest enzyme presence on the yarn surface after a long treatment time. The obtained results confirm the enzyme retention on the yarn surface, thus excluding the hypothesis that the absence of enzyme adsorption is a factor for the low scouring efficiency of mercerized cotton yarns.",

The molecular structures of PT and CPT contained two reactive groups of vinyl sulfone and nicotinic acid, which increased the reaction with cotton fabrics compared with other antibacterial agents. The dyeing process of reactive dye was selected as the finishing method due to the similar structures of antibacterial agents to bifunctional group reactive dyes. The treated cotton fabrics were chlorinated with sodium hypochlorite to obtain antibacterial functionality. The chlorinated fabrics achieved outstanding antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus with short contact time. Moreover, the stability measurement exhibited that the chlorine on the samples could be repaired by the diluted sodium hypochlorite solution after washing and long-time storage. In addition, the mild low-temperature process reduced fabric damage, and only about 10% and 15% of the original tensile strength was missing after finishing and chlorination in both the warp and weft directions. Compared to the traditional pad–dry–cure technique, the process developed of antimicrobial cotton had some advantages such as low salt, energy savings, and maintaining tensile strength.",

    "abstract": "The raw material acquisition stage of wool involves raising sheep and a large amount of input and output, resulting in substantial greenhouse gas emissions. To date, the research literature on wool carbon footprint is limited, and there is a lack of research on Victoria. These studies did not consider the influence of changes in weight and productive lifespan. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by calculating the wool carbon footprint in Victoria and improving the calculation method. In this article, 20,000 sheep in Victoria were investigated. The average weights of the sheep were obtained by curve fitting and calculating. Two scenarios with 5-year and 6-year productive lifespans were used to calculate the carbon footprint of merino wool by the mass allocation method, economic allocation method, and protein mass allocation method. Results revealed that the carbon footprint of wool for the 5-year and 6-year productive lifespans were 14.158–49.040 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -e)/kg wool and 16.743–52.882 kg CO 2 -e/kg wool. Rumination and excretion accounted for the largest proportion, followed by phosphate fertilizer, electricity, and potash fertilizer. The longer the productive lifespan and the heavier the sheep, the greater the greenhouse gas emissions from rumination and excretion, leading to a larger carbon footprint for wool. For the same productive lifespan, the economic allocation method produced the highest carbon footprint for wool compared to the mass allocation method, which produced the lowest carbon footprint. This study provides a reference for the subsequent carbon footprint accounting of wool from cradle to farm-gate and helps the wool industry save energy and reduce emissions.",

In this study, a four-layer neural network with a backpropagation algorithm (a Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm) is used.

The effects of TiO 2 content on waterproofness, moisture permeability, and thermal stability of the composite membranes were studied. The experimental results show that with the increase of TiO 2 content, the thermal stability of the composite membranes increased; waterproofness and moisture permeability performance also improved.",

To handle the first challenge, we built a recognition model to parallelly and independently output a set of labels, each for a pre-defined single attribute notion. To handle the second challenge, we embedded the fashion clothing image into a feature vector, where different subspaces capture different notions of similarities. These two sub-tasks were then connected to be trained jointly in a multi-task learning framework. Their losses were also well aligned, combined, and optimized collectively.",

Characterizations of three distinct treatments are presented: non-durable treatments of N , N -diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), an active ingredient in commercially available insect repellents, a phosphazine-based fire retardant, and fabric treated with deuterated water. All chemical treatments examined in this study exhibited distinct vibrational bands that could be used as markers of the fabric treatments.

A primary cause of this waste is surgical layered disposable masks that are constructed by melt-blown nonwovens usually made of non-biodegradable thermoplastic polymers like polypropylene. To increase widespread sustainable options to the public, commercialized or do-it-yourself-based fabric masks serve as a solution, but their resistance to harmful molecules is less than that of the medical-grade masks due to the fabric structure that leaves space for penetration. This project examines a water-soluble dispersion composed of cellulose nanofiber and polyvinyl alcohol, as a spray agent capable of treating the mask fabric surface to promote protection and sustainability against harmful aerosol particles. Cellulose nanofiber spray is also low-cost and biocompatible and could allow multi-use through home laundering. Polyvinyl alcohol was chosen as the water-soluble bonding system and polymer matrix to effectively adhere cellulose nanofiber onto the mask surface. This project follows the biomimic concept of dragonfly wings having uneven nanopillar surfaces to trap and rip bacterial membranes, as the spray decreases the water droplet contact angle on fabric surface, resulting in an increase in adhesion for incident bacteria and/or viruses.",

    "abstract": "Humans produce different rates of sweating depending on the intensity level of a given activity. The clothing worn during the activity has a significant effect on the latent heat loss that can occur before, during, and after the activity. The water adsorption and spreading properties of a material yield differences in the amount of heat exchange that can occur between the person and the environment. Current test methods evaluate this using a value known as evaporative resistance, which is used to determine the heat exchange potential of a material. However, this value is only taken once the material has reached “steady state” and does not consider the sweating period before steady state is reached, or the drying period after steady state is reached. Therefore, an area under the curve (AUC) value was derived during these periods to compare the heat exchange properties of different materials. A sweating guarded hot plate was used to simulate different sweat rates, and therefore activity levels, to compare materials constructed of cotton, viscose, polyester, and wool. The overall latent heat loss of the hydrophobic wool was much less compared to the other samples with a gentler slope and lower AUC values than the other samples. It was found that the segment of time analyzed has a significant impact on the conclusion drawn about the latent heat loss of a material, p &lt; 0.0001. Sweat rate also has a significant impact on the heat loss value, p &lt; 0.0001, but is perhaps less useful when comparing samples to each other. It was found that comparing the different periods of the test could yield different conclusions when comparing materials for latent heat loss. Several current test methods do not consider phases outside of the steady state period and therefore miss valuable information pertinent to user comfort during these phases, especially in the post-exercise phase.",

However, existing thermal risk evaluation models primarily focus on heat strain, neglecting potential risk after large temperature down-steps. This study employs a comprehensive multi-indicator approach to assess both heat strain and cardiovascular strain. Method: Six physiological and psychological parameters were selected for evaluation indexes, and four levels of thermal risk were established. Then trigonometric membership functions were proposed to determine the membership degrees related to the evaluation grades. Combined with the entropy weight method, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model was developed to assess thermal health risk levels. Results: Results indicated that core temperature, heart rate, and mean skin temperature are important physiological factors for assessing heat strain, while thermal sensation and perceived exertion also contribute significantly. The variation in blood pressure is relevant to cardiovascular strain. The developed model can distinguish the effects of temperature step magnitude and clothing thermal resistance on heat strain. A temperature difference of 40°C (from 40°C to 0°C) leads to a moderate level of cardiovascular strain and a 24% probability of high cardiovascular strain risk. Conclusions: These findings underscore the significance of transitional spaces and appropriate clothing choices in mitigating thermal risks and promoting human health and comfort in environments with substantial temperature variations.",

There is widespread commercial acceptance of compression garments as tools for reducing injury, promoting recovery, and improving performance in athletic activity. While studies have been conducted to assess the exercise physiology benefits of compression garments, there remains a gap in the scientific literature regarding the clothing comfort and resultant thermoregulation effects of compression girdles for performance athletes. This study aimed to assess the effects of tighter fitting, multi-layer compression systems when worn by American football athletes. A negative impact on thermoregulation may negate or outweigh any realized local benefit such as increased skin blood flow or reduced muscle oscillatory properties. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to determine the predicted hypothalamus temperature, skin blood flow, skin temperature, sweat rate, temperature sensation, and comfort perceptions of the male human body when wearing a compression girdle. A sweating thermal manikin was utilized to predict the physiological responses of a 50th percentile male when wearing football girdles in both practice and play settings. The results indicate significant differences in skin blood flow, skin temperature, core temperature, sweat rate, and comfort and sensation perceptions when wearing compression girdles compared to boxer briefs in replicated practice and play settings. Findings also demonstrate the use of real-time manikin simulation modeling for predicting physiological response outcomes of wearing compression garments to a realized extent.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, modified SiO 2 nanoparticles were selected to improve the surface roughness and decrease the surface energy to improve the hydrophobic performance of cotton fabric. Tetraethoxysilane and octadecyltriethoxysilane were used as raw materials to synthesize octadecyltriethoxysilane-modified SiO 2 nanoparticles (siloxane-SiO 2 ), and combined with cotton fabric. The chemical composition and surface morphology of the fabric were measured. The contact angles of the modified cotton fabrics prepared under different reaction conditions were approaching or above 150°. In addition, dynamic evolutions of water droplets on the modified cotton fabric surface were discussed. The adhesive force and the energy conversion of droplet during the collision were investigated. The water droplet bounced due to the superhydrophobic properties of the cotton fabric surface producing enough residual energy. Finally, through the acid–base chemical resistance treatments, the rubbing and washing durability, and anti-fouling experiment, the modified fabric indicated excellent hydrophobic durability and self-cleaning performance.",

    "abstract": "With environmental and health issues being raised, researchers have shifted their study from fluorinated to fluorine-free waterproof agents. However, most of the reported fluorine-free water repellents exhibit a significant drawback in their poor stability and durability of water repellency. In addition, the use of higher concentrations in these repellents results in the fabric becoming stiff, which negatively impacts the hand of the treated fabrics. To address these issues, dendrimer-like waterborne polyurethane prepolymers were initially synthesized using isophorone diisocyanate, polytetrahydrofuran, N-methyldiethanolamine, and trimethylolpropane as the primary materials. In this synthesis, sorbitan tristearate served as the dendrimer-like blocking agent, while single-ended bis-hydroxypropyl silicone oil was employed as functional monomers to enhance the hand and water repellency of the prepolymers. Then, dendrimer-like waterborne polyurethane was finished on the cotton fabric using a pad–dry–cure procedure. The test results showed that the water contact angle of dendrimer-like waterborne polyurethane film increased from 104.28° to 107.00° with the content of single-ended bis-hydroxypropyl silicone oil increasing, and the water contact angle of dendrimer-like waterborne polyurethane-finished fabrics reached 148.6° alone with a standard spray test rating of 90–95. In addition, the water contact angle of dendrimer-like waterborne polyurethane-finished fabrics was still greater than 140° even after five standard washes. The single-ended bis-hydroxypropyl silicone oil addition facilitated similar hand to the original fabric in dendrimer-like waterborne polyurethane-finished fabrics with high concentrations, surpassing market water repellents. This work is of great significance for improving the stability and durability of water repellency, and the hand of waterborne polyurethane fluorine-free water repellents in the textile industry.",

This study was important because implementation of drop-on-demand 3D printing used for forming flexible conductive lines on fabric depends on understanding the droplet deposition mechanism. The interaction of droplets and the fabric substrate, as well as the penetration process, were simulated. The distribution of pressure and velocity, and the influence of surface tension and viscosity, in the droplet deposition process were also studied. The simulation and confirmatory experimental results show that the internal pressure gradient in the liquid was the main reason for the droplet spreading, penetration, and bubble formation. These research results lay a theoretical foundation for droplet spray printing of conductive lines on fabric surfaces.",

A high amount of water is consumed in these processes. In this study, an alternative washing process was developed instead of the conventional reactive washing process. The baths, which were decided to be used according to the transmittance values of the washing baths after dyeing in light, medium, and dark shades, were used again as the first two baths of the next washings. Alternative washing did not have a negative effect on the quality parameters, namely washing and rubbing fastnesses. As a result, it was observed that the last two baths of the washing cycle could be used as the first two baths of the next washing cycle. In this case, it was predicted that approximately 40%−50% water savings could be achieved.",

The mechanical properties of the finished composites were determined. The influence of the fabric thickness, the surface structure of the fabric, and whether the woven fabric is laminated or not on the mechanical properties of the three-dimensional polyurethane composites were determined. The results show that the fabric thickness is positively related to the tensile and compressive properties and inversely related to the bending properties of the three-dimensional knitted/woven hybrid polyurethane matrix composites, provided that the surface structure is the same. The tensile and compressive strengths of the composites were higher when the glass fiber woven fabric was laminated with the spacer fabric than when the three-dimensional knitted/woven hybrid polyurethane matrix composites were not taken.

While most fabrics maintained or improved their FE after 40 decontamination cycles, the AP of many fabrics decreased due to detergent buildup, fiber breakage, and fabric shrinkage. Tightly woven cotton fabrics had unacceptably low AP and FE performance. Knit and nonwoven structures had the best balance of properties, and although they are not recommended for use in single-layer masks, they have potential use in multilayer masks.",

    "abstract": "Oil sorption capacity is one of the essential parameters to evaluate the practical performances of oil sorbent products. This study aims to compare the dynamic oil sorption capacity of industrial nonwoven sorbents, which were fabricated through the carding process, spun-bond technology, and composite processes. The oil sorbents were produced by polypropylene fibers or cotton fibers with different surface wettability. The study showed that raw cotton layers exhibited a higher oil sorption capacity than the other three samples: eight-layer thermal-bonded melt-blown polypropylene fiber nonwoven, polypropylene fibers on top and bottom with raw cotton layers in the middle, and polypropylene fiber melt-blown nonwovens. Comparatively, eight-layer thermal-bonded melt-blown polypropylene fiber nonwoven had the lowest oil sorption capacity. Moreover, the hydrophilic property can significantly enhance the water pick-up capacity of sorbents on both dynamic and static systems but reduce the maximum oil sorption ability. Overall, the major factors determining a nonwoven fabric’s oil absorption performance are its fiber type, surface wettability, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. Specifically, raw cotton, polypropylene fibers, or polypropylene fiber/cotton composite oil sorbents with low hydrophobicity and high hydrophobicity will contribute to high oil absorption ability. The advantage of raw cotton over polypropylene fibers is 3–7 times higher in oil absorption capability, environmentally friendliness, and sustainability, attributed to their hydrophobic ingredients, including pectin and waxes. From a structure angle, products with a loose structure and good mechanical properties ensure a balance between service life and oil absorption performance.",

In this article, we aim to improve the DCNet from the following two aspects. First, we design an adaptive attention module, which is equipped in the front of the dense relation distillation module, and can be trained together with the remainder parts of the DCNet. After training, the adaptive attention module helps to enhance foreground features and to suppress the background features. Second, we introduce a large-margin Softmax into the dense relation distillation module. The large-margin Softmax with a hyperparameter can normalize features without reducing the discriminability between different classes. We conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL visual object classes and the Microsoft common objects in context data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can work under the few-shot scenario and achieves the mean average precision of 50.8% on the PASCAL visual object classes data set and 13.1% on the Microsoft common objects in context data set, which both outperform the existing baselines. Moreover, ablation studies and visualizations validate the usefulness of the adaptive attention module and the large-margin Softmax. The proposed method can be applied to recognize rare patterns in fabric images or detect clothes with new styles in natural scene images.",

    "abstract": "In the previous work by the same authors, optimisation of sequential application of acid protease and transglutaminase was carried out to achieve Woolmark specification AW-1 for the machine washable care claim, that is, less than 3% total shrinkage. As a result of optimisation, the total warp shrinkage reduced to 2.64% with only 2.82% loss in warp tensile strength. In this work, simultaneous application of acid protease and transglutaminase was explored and optimised using Box–Behnken design of experiment. The optimisation was carried out using two criteria. In the first criterion, the model was used to predict treatment parameters for minimum total warp shrinkage with minimum loss in warp tensile strength. Taking these predicted treatment parameters, wool was treated with acid protease (1%, owf) and transglutaminase (2.8%, owf) at pH ∼5.3 and 50°C for 60 min. After treatment, the total warp shrinkage reduced to only 4.32% with 4.65% loss in warp tensile strength. This was not only higher than the optimised sequential application of both the enzymes but also failed to meet the Woolmark specification for machine washable care claim. So, the second criterion was used in which the prediction was taken for treatment parameters to achieve the minimum total warp shrinkage without any constraints on loss in warp strength. Again, taking these predicted treatment parameters, wool was treated with acid protease (1.3%, owf), transglutaminase (1.6%, owf), pH ∼4.7 at 55°C for 85 min. Under these treatment conditions, the total warp shrinkage reduced to 2.89% with 10.1% loss in warp strength. Furthermore, interaction between the enzymes also plays a role in the outcomes of the treatment. It was evident that there was a loss in transglutaminase activity as a result of acid protease digestion. However, there was no loss in the activity of acid protease, indicating that transglutaminase did not have any negative influence on the activity of acid protease.",

To improve the stability and efficiency, we also modify the architecture of the context encoder by introducing 1*1 convolution, as well as other improvements. In addition, a multi-scale discriminator combining with GAN is presented. During training, the reconstruction and adversarial losses are used for the global image. To generate more details, we further add a local texture loss for the missing part. Qualitative experiments show that our model performs favorably against classical methods in generating visually plausible inpainting results.

    "abstract": "Thermal shrinkage of flame resistant fabrics can greatly affect the thermal protection of firefighters’ clothing. In this study, four boundary conditions were designed to simulate garment aperture structures. Thermal shrinkage was measured with and without an air gap under three heat-flux levels. The shrinkage ratio was measured and calculated using digital image technology. Results showed that an air gap between the fabric and sensors was the main factor in thermal shrinkage. The presence of an air gap aggravates thermal shrinkage at the garment apertures, especially under the open boundary condition with incomplete fixation. The ease required for human movement and thermal shrinkage should be taken into consideration when designing thermal protective clothing. This study provides a quantitative method for determining the thermal shrinkage of fabrics.",

This information guides the generator for the final image generation.

To test the performance of MiniGAN on the uninformative images, a new data set consisting of 10,000 fashion hand drawings is proposed.

    "abstract": "Automatic image aesthetic evaluation is an attractive and challenging visual task. Recently, methods based on convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable performance. However, semantic information, an intuitive prerequisite for evaluating image aesthetics, has not received enough attention regarding its importance in previous methods. How to efficiently extract semantic information and make better use of it to assist the aesthetic evaluation task remains unsolved. In this article, we propose to utilize the self-supervised model Auto-Encoder to extract semantic information in the form of multi-task learning. Then, a fusing module is prepended at the bottleneck layer to explicitly combine semantic information with aesthetic information in a pre-activated manner. Specifically, we implement a customized pooling operation to pool the semantic features extracted by Auto-Encoder and apply a weak constraint between the pooled semantic features and aesthetic information to realize the combination. The following regressor can complete aesthetic evaluation based on the semantic–aesthetic combined features. In addition, to enable our model to adapt to arbitrary aspect ratios of images, another pooling strategy called spatial pyramid pooling is adopted to obtain the image features of a fixed length. Our method achieves competitive performance on the public image aesthetic evaluation benchmark. Especially on the most commonly used metric Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient, the proposed model achieved the best performance compared with some state-of-the-art methods. Extensive ablation studies and visualization experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

The worsted wool fabric was pretreated by a continuous liquid ammonia finishing machine and then treated by protease, followed by polyurethane nano-emulsion coating. The results showed that, after liquid ammonia and protease treatment, the surface scales of wool were seriously damaged, even partly peeling off, and the disulfide bond content of the wool decreased while the active group content of the wool increased. Furthermore, after polyurethane finishing, the surface scale and the gap between the scales were covered with a thin film, and the area shrinkage reached 3.1% when the concentration of polyurethane was 20 g/L, showing an effective improvement in the shrink resistance of the worsted fabric.

The technical proposal that effectively controls the distribution of polymer on cashmere textiles, based on foaming micro-coating technology, is studied and compared to prevent the superabundant polymer being fixed in the gaps between yarns/fibers and to ensure the graphene is semi-embedded in the membrane of “Table coating.” A couple of flexible hydrophilic anionic polyurethanes are used in micro-coating processing of cashmere purposefully. The effects of different coating technique on pilling, static, anti-ultraviolet, and washing resistance of coated cashmere textiles are studied. The results show that the semi-embedded graphene in the table coating membrane is meaningful to the static resistance. The pilling resistance of cashmere textile covered by polymer membranes is enhanced from grade 1–2 to grade 4–5 when the weight gain rate of “Bottom coating” polyurethane reaches 1.5% (o.w.f.), and its static voltage half-life decreases from 170 s to less than 2 s. In addition, the ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) value of coated cashmere is doubled, and anti-pilling and anti-static effects can withstand five washings.",

    "abstract": "The core and skin temperature of an infant are essential physiological indicators of the baby’s health and an important reference in the selection of baby clothing. The main idea for this is that parents often wrap their infants in covers and clothing based on their own subjective experience, and infants do not have the ability to express themselves verbally, which is likely to result in over- or under-wrapping, leading to babies feeling too hot or too cold and even causing illness. Accurately predicting and determining infants’ skin and core temperatures at different ambient temperatures is a critical concern in infant clothing research. While the overall skin temperature of infants cannot be understood using traditional body temperature robotic measurements, this article develops a three-dimensional infant thermoregulation model with a geometrical appearance similar to an accurate infant model based on finite element method. Through geometric model construction, cell meshing, boundary condition loading, and user-defined functions program debugging, infants’ body surface and core temperature distribution under different ambient temperatures are calculated. The results were compared with published clinical temperature tests and validated, which were in good agreement with the actual test results and proved the validity of the model calculation. Providing a new method for infant temperature prediction, the findings of this study put forward a scientific reference for infant dressing selection and research on intelligent clothing.",

The optimization of the process parameters (finish liquor concentration, temperature and curing time) for these on-loom integrated softening finished fabrics were investigated. The softened linen fabric was studied for their physical properties like softness, drapeability, wickability, water vapour permeability, air permeability, total crease recovery angle, tensile and tear strength against untreated fabric and also compared with similar finished market sample. Furthermore, chemical interaction of the softener with linen fabric and their morphology were studied by the Fourier transform infrared and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The results showed that as the concentration of the finish liquor increased, the softening effect increased, while wickability decreased after the particular optimum point. It was observed that drapeability, total crease recovery angle, tensile and tear strength were increased till the optimum point with the increase in process parameters. However, water vapour permeability and air permeability were decreased. The Fourier transform infrared and scanning electron microscopy studies clearly proved the presence of softener chemical and a coating of a thin layer on the fabric. The optimum process parameters of concentration of the finish liquor, curing temperature and curing time were found to be 10 g/L, 60°C and 5 min, respectively, for softening of linen fabric using this integrated finishing method.",

    "abstract": "In delayed-curing and non-iron finishing, the sensitized fabric after low-temperature drying should have good surface planeness before curing at high temperatures, which implies that the finishing agent has not reacted with the cellulose fibers during storage; therefore, a suitable non-iron finishing agent is essential for achieving the above objectives. Meanwhile, there are currently no mature and efficient evaluation methods for the storage stability of sensitized fabrics. In this article, the content of characteristic groups of the sensitized fabrics with different storage conditions was measured. The storage time can be shortened from 30 to 6 days with high-temperature storage (40–60°C). The reaction kinetics equation was established under high-temperature storage; then using this equation to predict the cross-linking degree of sensitized fabrics during long-term storage at low temperature, the storage stability of sensitized fabrics can also be evaluated. The relative error of 2.5% between the predicted value and the measured value of the reaction degree showed the accuracy and effectiveness of the established method. This article provided a basis for the stability evaluation of the sensitized fabric and the selection of the finishing agent, finishing process, and storage conditions for the delayed-curing and non-ironing finishing process.",

Some healthcare facilities took the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations to shift from disposable personal protective equipment to reusable, as an option for extending the life of their personal protective equipment during the pandemic. This research investigated Level 2 isolation gowns to determine whether they met or exceeded the protection specifications of ANSI/AAMI PB70:2012 and the American Society for Testing and Materials: ASTM F3352-19 Standard Specification for Isolation Gowns Intended for Use in Healthcare Facilities. The overall findings show that commercially available reusable gowns initially met the ANSI/AAMI PB70:2012 and ASTM F3352 standards. Out of the six sample groups, gowns in one group failed the ANSI/AAMI PB70:2012 specifications before the end of their intended lifecycle. All gowns met the specifications for durability in ASTM F3352-19, but further research showed tear strength after laundering weakened substantially. The current standard for Level 2 isolation gowns is protecting the lives of healthcare workers. However, the specifications could be improved by ANSI/AAMI by evaluating the performance after laundering instead of as new. Durability specifications would be improved by increasing the requirements for reusable gowns.",

It was established that an increase in the intensity of intermolecular interactions of polyurethane occurred regardless of the concentration of silver in the silver nanoparticles due to a change in the packing of macromolecules. It was shown that in the process of aging of composites, the effective size of crystallites of polymer matrix decreases and varies in the range of 1.35–1.50 nm. The most pronounced effect of aging is manifested on the melting temperatures of the crystalline phase of polyurethane and the degree of crystallinity. It was found that polyurethane–silver nanoparticle composites exhibit a very high inhibitory capacity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. It is shown that aging processes do not affect the antimicrobial characteristics of the studied materials, which indicates their stability. Due to their unique characteristics, synthesized nanocomposite films can be promising for use as antimicrobial coatings in various applications.",

    "abstract": "Bags of nonwoven fabrics with good air or water permeability are widely used in fruit agriculture due to their porosity. However, vegetables or fruit in bags often rot, a problem caused by the water permeability of the bags in high-moisture environments. Therefore, to improve the water repellency of polypropylene (PP) nonwoven fabric bags for fruit, a water-repellent treatment was applied by the surface deposition of a film composed of a water-repellent agent and a crosslinking agent. The effect of the waterproof bags made of PP spun-bonded nonwoven fabric on the grape growth microenvironment was investigated. This study provided technical inspiration for the development of related plant protection products using nonwoven engineered after-treatments.",

    "abstract": "The concept of leveraging the optical properties of cerium oxide into viscose fibers was demonstrated in this study. The process of dispersing cerium oxide particles uniformly into viscose dope prior to viscose fiber spinning was studied in detail. Cerium oxide powder was dispersed in the chosen media using mechanical treatments such as ball milling and ultrasonication. These experiments were carried out at two extreme pH values to replicate the viscose spinning bath (acidic pH 5) and viscose dope (alkaline pH 13). The dispersion was characterized for particle size and surface charge properties. A combination of the mechanical treatments synergistically reduced the cerium oxide particle size in acidic and alkaline pH from 1300 to 290 nm and from 1040 to 280 nm, respectively. Three surfactants of different ionic natures were evaluated for stabilizing the cerium oxide dispersions. The effects on the particle size of cerium oxide in two dispersion environments, that is, aqueous and polymeric media, were studied through conventional as well as novel visual characterization techniques. The phosphate ether-based anionic surfactant was found to significantly reduce the dispersed particle size and effectively stabilize the dispersion better, which was validated through a pressure buildup monitoring system during viscose fiber spinning. The surfactant-stabilized cerium oxide dispersion was used to get functional infrared reflecting viscose fibers. To characterize this effect, a direct visual evaluation was done through an infrared camera which indicated a significant improvement of infrared reflectivity and a 2.5–3°C surface temperature buildup of the cerium-oxide viscose fibers in comparison to regular viscose fibers. The infrared reflective property of cerium oxide imparts a thermal insulation effect which was found to increase to a thermal insulating value of 90 in the case of cerium oxide viscose fibers compared with a thermal insulating value of 79 in regular viscose fibers, as measured by the KESF Thermolabo II instrument. This study can very well be extended to many fiber-making processes where an understanding of interfacial interactions of additives with cellulose is critical to impart functionality to viscose fibers.",

Dyeing and fastness properties of the dyed fabrics were evaluated by their corresponding lightness (L*), chroma (C*), color strength (K/S), and color difference (ΔE ab *) results. The perlite-containing fabrics showed similar dyeing and fastness characteristics when compared with the regular fabrics. The perlite-added fabrics were dyed in darker color but had lower chroma values than the regular ones. The perlite-added fabrics also had better fastness results than the regular fabrics when the evaluation was performed in the group itself.

    "abstract": "The source for reactive dye transfer of cotton fabric varies in different studies, and there is limited information on the washing factors. This study explored the source of Reactive Red 195 colored cotton fabric dye transfer and reported the effects of three key washing factors and their interactions with two types of dye transfer inhibitors. First, the high-performance liquid chromatography results show that the peak of completely hydrolyzed Reactive Red 195 matches the peak of the washing residue of the fabric colored by Reactive Red 195. The dye transfer process is positively related to the hydrolyzed dyes. Based on this, response surface method models for the three factors, water consumption, water hardness, and dye transfer inhibitors concentration for polyvinylpyrrolidone and lauryl betaine were built. Both response surface method models show that due to the presence of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ , the increase in water hardness reduces the zeta potential on the fabric surface, and causes a decrease of electrostatic repulsion between the dye and the fabric. The dye transfer inhibiting effect is reduced. The increase in dye transfer inhibitor concentration strengthened the effect of inhibiting the transfer of hydrolyzed Reactive Red 195. In addition, there is a cross effect between water hardness and dye transfer inhibitor concentration. There is optimal water hardness and dye transfer inhibitor concentration to maximize the inhibition of hydrolyzed Reactive Red 195 dye transfer. The water consumption shows a limited effect because the washing time is long enough to reach a balance in the fabric and washing fluids. Polyvinylpyrrolidone with many hydrophilic groups is easy to combine with hydrolyzed dyes. While lauryl betaine is a small molecule surfactant, the structural differences make the response surface method model show that polyvinylpyrrolidone has a better effect than lauryl betaine. The discoveries can be used to guide dye transfer inhibitor development. Further investigations, including dye transfer inhibitor synthesis and modification, are needed.",

Cotton, having superior qualities, is considered one of the best raw materials for tent manufacture. The study has undertaken the application of different water repellent and flame retardant chemicals on 100% cotton canvas fabric to be used as bivouac tents. The purpose was to find suitable water repellent and flame retardant chemicals that can be applied in a single bath or in a two-step process to give the desired repellency and retardancy effect. Initially, two screening sets were carried out, which aided in the identification of best-performed chemicals to be used in the combined application of water repellent and flame retardant. In the combined application, the fabric was finished using two approaches. In the first approach, both repellent and retardant chemicals were prepared in a single bath, and in the second approach, the fabric was first finished with flame retardant chemicals and then finished with water repellent chemicals. In both the approaches, the finished fabric was evaluated by a cone test, a hydrostatic pressure head test and a flammability test against locally set requirements. It is concluded that the procedure of single bath water repellent and flame retardant finishes (SBWRFR1b) showed reduced pickup percentage (60%) and resulted in better water repellency and flame retardancy properties, in comparison to other procedures and series of recipes.",

The two-step factorial analysis of screening and reduced factor design shows that the flexural rigidity of samples after fusing is influenced by three factors: fabric areal weight, interlining areal weight and interlining finish. Furthermore, the flexural rigidity of samples was reduced considerably after washing and was influenced by three factors: interlining areal weight, interlining finish and fusing time. The polynomial equation explaining the relation has been derived. The findings help understand the variables to consider while selecting interlinings for formal shirts.",

For the very first time, pressure distribution underneath different parts/components of the fabric cuffs was analysed in detail using an advanced interface pressure sensing system. The pressure distribution at the interface of the selected cuffs and an arm simulator were measured experimentally while simulating blood pressure measurement. Fabrics are the main cuff constructing material and a relationship was found between cuff fabric properties and pressure at the interface of the cuff and the arm simulator. It was also found that the pressure distribution under different parts of the same cuff varied due to the uneven contact of the cuff fabric with the arm simulator. Components attached to cuff fabric which facilitate blood pressure measurement either confine or drive fabric according to their size and placement; they may cause non-uniform interface pressure distribution on the human arm too. It was also examined whether the selected cuffs were applying higher or lower average pressure over the surface of the simulator and the range varied from 8 mmHg to 25 mmHg. This indicates that the subsequent pressure distribution inside the arm tissues and over an artery would also vary further due to the cuffs being of different designs. This study found that cuffs would be unable to transfer the required pressure over the artery to block blood flow as and when needed.",

Governing fluid flow and energy equations were solved along with the low Re k–ε turbulence model. Real-scale measurements were carried out to determine the accuracy of the developed numerical model. Good agreement was found between the simulation results and the experimental data. The results showed that, at room temperature of 21 o C, the convective heat transfer coefficient was 64.2% greater than the radiative heat transfer coefficient, which demonstrated that the convective heat transfer was the main approach for heat exchange between the infant and its surrounding environment. Moreover, the largest convective heat transfer coefficients were observed at the forearm and calf, indicating the importance of the additional thermal protection at these regions.

Results indicate that the metal levels of newly-opened cotton were not appreciably different from those of aged cotton bolls and that the fiber metal levels after scouring and bleaching had little correlation with dye uptake. Additionally, some metal levels exceeded those previously reported and the environment appeared to have a stronger influence on fiber Ca and Mg levels than did cultivar differences.",

In this paper, we propose to effectively improve the detecting speed, accuracy, and robustness of the model. We propose a new method of cascading Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Sparse Representation Classification (SRC). This method transforms the defect detection problem into a pattern classification problem. First, we preprocess the input button images via eliminating reflection, edges extraction, and dimensionality reduction. ELM has a faster learning speed and better detecting accuracy than the single layer perceptron and support layer machine. ELM was utilized to estimate the probability of the defective buttons, with parameters obtained from the five-fold cross-validation method. SRC was used to reclassify those button images with high noise. Our method improved the detection accuracy, as well as guaranteed the detecting speed. We showed state-of-the-art performance in comparison to other approaches.",

However, most manufacturers classify their products based on a number of anthropometric statistical parameters of Caucasian body sizes. This work focuses on the diversities in the real curved shapes, and their detailed anatomy characteristics, for Chinese people. Differences in the 3D-scanned human calves’ shapes and circumference profiles between Chinese male and female subjects were identified through primary component analysis, extracted, and compared. Results show that calves of males were longer in length, straighter, and had a larger circumference within the belly of gastrocnemius, while females were found to have shorter overall length, more bent, and had a smaller gastrocnemius. Females had a larger averaged circumference. The focus of this study was on the size design of compression stockings.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was introduced to study pattern characterization in textiles. Accelerators are a promising platform to accelerate large-scale FFT computation. However, current accelerating FFT only uses the accelerator to compute, but uses a CPU as a mere task controller. Additionally, a specified interface for FFT is built into the China accelerator (CA), which severely restricts FFT parallelization and performance. Hence, we transform four multiplications and six additions into six Fused Multiply Add (FMA) operations, then reduce total float operations by 40%, assisted by FMAs equipped with a Vector Processing Unit (VPE). Moreover, we propose an Interface Adapter (IA) to cater to a specified interface and a Fused Algorithm for Interface Adapter (FAIA) to fully use both the CA and CPU to compute large-scale FFT with coordination. Experimental results validated successful performance.",

However, the research on recognition of garment illustration and pattern image is mostly based on category classification, but very little on the identification of parts and details. The Inception module in the GoogleNet Inception and its improvement development models enhance parameter utilization, accelerate computation, and have no special requirements for hardware. The Mask R-CNN, a convolutional neural network, is a modified model from based on Faster R-CNN for instance splitting tasks.

CCA projects two sets of data into a low-dimensional space in which the correlations between them are maximized. However, CCA is sensitive to noise or outliers in the collected data of real-world applications, which will degrade its performance. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose symmetrical robust canonical correlation analysis (SRCCA) for image classification. By using low-rank learning, the noise is removed, and CCA is used to encode correlations between images and their symmetry samples. To verify effectiveness, four public image databases were tested. The result was that SRCCA was more robust than CCA and had good performance for image classification.",

The yarn cross section image was obtained at x400 magnification. Drawing software was used to manually isolate single fiber images for training the back propagation (BP) neural network model in Matlab language image processing software. The GrabCut algorithm was used to de-noise the image and separate the target from the background. Finally, single fiber images and fiber distributions were obtained through the program. The result showed that the BP neural network model with the GrabCut algorithm can identify fiber type in a complex background more easily and more accurately than traditional algorithms.",

CycleGAN is widely used because it does not require paired image data to train, which greatly reduces the cost of collecting data. In 2018, based on CycleGAN, a new model structure, InstaGAN, was proposed and then applied in the style transfer algorithm in the special part of an image we called instance. From then on, style transfer can transform the instance in the image. Based on CycleGAN and InstaGAN, we transformed the pictures in different domains combined with shape context and thin plate splines (TPS) in the present study. Based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), we designed a fusion network to optimize the results. We combined style transfer with TPS in fashion and got convincing performance by experiments and a fusion net with good performance.",

Initially, the as-prepared PP fibrous mats are treated by plasma at different oxygen (O 2 ) and argon (Ar) ratios. Then, the PP fibrous mats are modified by grafting dopamine onto polar groups for in situ polymerizations, resulting in a polydopamine (PDA) coating on the substrate's surface. Time-sensitive wettability is thereby converted into permanent wettability in PP fibers. The morphology, chemical performance, and relative wettability of the modified PP fibers are then characterized. The experimental results show, using an O 2 /Ar ratio of 3:7 during plasma treatment, that the water contact angle was decreased from 114.2° to 0°, and the maximum grafting degree was 0.79%.",

Unlike previous methods such as Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE), in which local neighborhood information is preserved during the dimensionality reduction procedure, JLE aims to preserve the sparse reconstructive relationship of the original data by taking the merits of jointly sparse learning based on L 2,1 -norm. In the framework of JLE, the sparse weight matrix can reflect the intrinsic geometric structures of the original data and inherit the ability of discriminant analysis. By solving the L 2,1 -norm regularized objective function, the optimal projections, which are invariant to rotations and robust to outliers, can be obtained by JLE. Extensive experiments on visual recognition and fabric defect classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed L 2,1 -norm regularized learning method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

Micro-morphology shows that graphene is embedded and modified between silk nanofibers to form a stable structure. Infrared analysis showed that graphene compounds do not alter silk formation, especially in the stable silk structure. Resistance tests show that the process is most effective when the ratio of SNFs to graphene is 1:3. This study offers a new approach to fabricating bioelectric devices.",

In this work, we present three approaches to transfer strided data for different scenarios: Redundant copy (RC), selective copy (SC), and transfer after transformed (TaT). We propose a space and time efficient method named TaT, in which strided data are transformed on the CPU first and then transferred into the accelerator. We simulated regions-of-interest (ROI) coding and validate proposed techniques. TaT was superior to RC on space efficiency and close to SC on saving space, but better than SC on time waste respectively.",
