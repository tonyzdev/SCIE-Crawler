    "abstract": "In recent years, nanotechnology has been increasingly applied to the area of drug development. Nanoparticle-based therapeutics can confer the ability to overcome biological barriers, effectively deliver hydrophobic drugs and biologics, and preferentially target sites of disease. However, despite these potential advantages, only a relatively small number of nanoparticle-based medicines have been approved for clinical use, with numerous challenges and hurdles at different stages of development. The complexity of nanoparticles as multi-component three dimensional constructs requires careful design and engineering, detailed orthogonal analysis methods, and reproducible scale-up and manufacturing process to achieve a consistent product with the intended physicochemical characteristics, biological behaviors, and pharmacological profiles. The safety and efficacy of nanomedicines can be influenced by minor variations in multiple parameters and need to be carefully examined in preclinical and clinical studies, particularly in context of the biodistribution, targeting to intended sites, and potential immune toxicities. Overall, nanomedicines may present additional development and regulatory considerations compared with conventional medicines, and while there is generally a lack of regulatory standards in the examination of nanoparticle-based medicines as a unique category of therapeutic agents, efforts are being made in this direction. This review summarizes challenges likely to be encountered during the development and approval of nanoparticle-based therapeutics, and discusses potential strategies for drug developers and regulatory agencies to accelerate the growth of this important field.",

    "abstract": "Adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT) provides a means for brain delivery of medicines across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is readily equipped for the AMT process: it provides both the potential for binding and uptake of cationic molecules to the luminal surface of endothelial cells, and then for exocytosis at the abluminal surface. The transcytotic pathways present at the BBB and its morphological and enzymatic properties provide the means for movement of the molecules through the endothelial cytoplasm. AMT-based drug delivery to the brain was performed using cationic proteins and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). Protein cationization using either synthetic or natural polyamines is discussed and some examples of diamine/polyamine modified proteins that cross BBB are described. Two main families of CPPs belonging to the Tat-derived peptides and Syn-B vectors have been extensively used in CPP vector-mediated strategies allowing delivery of a large variety of small molecules as well as proteins across cell membranes in vitro and the BBB in vivo. CPP strategy suffers from several limitations such as toxicity and immunogenicity--like the cationization strategy--as well as the instability of peptide vectors in biological media. The review concludes by stressing the need to improve the understanding of AMT mechanisms at BBB and the effectiveness of cationized proteins and CPP-vectorized proteins as neurotherapeutics.",

Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known antiviral drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in patients with confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches to diagnostics and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on the conventional therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under extensive research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The developments of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have been also discussed for COVID-19.

    "abstract": "Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug with a broad spectrum of activity, high efficacy as well as a wide margin of safety. Since 1987, this compound has a widespread use in veterinary medicine and it use has been extended in humans. Here we present a brief review of the information availabile regarding the pharmacokinetics and interactions of ivermectin in humans. Awareness of these characteristics could improve the clinical efficacy of Ivermectin. All Authors declare that they do not have any Conflict of interest and that the work is original.

There is much confusion among pharmaceutical scientists in generic drug industry about the appropriate element and terminology of quality by design. This paper discusses quality by design for generic drugs and presents a summary of the key terminology. The elements of quality by design are examined and a consistent nomenclature for quality by design, critical quality attribute, critical process parameter, critical material attribute, and control strategy is proposed. Agreement on these key concepts will allow discussion of the application of these concepts to abbreviated new drug applications to progress.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a compound is of significant importance during the early stages of drug development, and therefore several in vitro systems are routinely employed for this purpose. However, the need for more physiologically realistic in vitro models has recently fueled the emerging field of tissue-engineered 3D cultures, also referred to as organs-on-chips, or microphysiological systems (MPSs). We have developed a novel fluidic platform that interconnects multiple MPSs, allowing PK studies in multi-organ in vitro systems along with the collection of high-content quantitative data. This platform was employed here to integrate a gut and a liver MPS together in continuous communication, and investigate simultaneously different PK processes taking place after oral drug administration in humans (e.g., intestinal permeability, hepatic metabolism). Measurement of tissue-specific phenotypic metrics indicated that gut and liver MPSs can be fluidically coupled with circulating common medium without compromising their functionality. The PK of diclofenac and hydrocortisone was investigated under different experimental perturbations, and results illustrate the robustness of this integrated system for quantitative PK studies. Mechanistic model-based analysis of the obtained data allowed the derivation of the intrinsic parameters (e.g., permeability, metabolic clearance) associated with the PK processes taking place in each MPS. Although these processes were not substantially affected by the gut-liver interaction, our results indicate that inter-MPS communication can have a modulating effect (hepatic metabolism upregulation). We envision that our integrative approach, which combines multi-cellular tissue models, multi-MPS platforms, and quantitative mechanistic modeling, will have broad applicability in pre-clinical drug development.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) comprise a heterogeneous group of small membrane vesicles, including exosomes, which play a critical role in intracellular communication and regulation of numerous physiological processes in health and disease. Naturally released from virtually all cells, these vesicles contain an array of nucleic acids, lipids and proteins which they transfer to target cells within their local milieu and systemically. They have been proposed as a means of \"cell-free, cell therapy\" for cancer, immune disorders, and more recently cardiovascular disease. In addition, their unique properties of stability, biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity have prompted research into their potential as therapeutic delivery agents for drugs and small molecules. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of extracellular vesicle biology as well as engineering strategies in play to improve their therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bile salts are biosurfactants released into the intestinal lumen which play an important role in the solubilisation of fats and certain drugs. Their concentrations vary along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This is significant for implementation in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to mechanistically capture drug absorption. The aims of this meta-analysis were to collate all appropriate data on intestinal bile salt concentrations in healthy adults across all GIT segments in fasted and fed states for the purpose of PBPK modelling. Terms relating to bile composition were searched in PubMed and Google Scholar from inception to May 2024. Selected studies included aspirated intestinal fluid collected via gastric tubes or colonoscopy. Results showed high variability across studies and a time-dependency for the fed state. Data were rich for the duodenum, which showed a two-fold increase for the fed state versus the fasted state within multiple studies. Peaks and troughs in bile salt concentrations along the GIT were observed for both fasted and fed states, likely due to segmental water absorption differences. The highest between subject variability was observed for the duodenum in the fasted and fed state and the fed proximal jejunum, distal ileum, and colon. The findings from this meta-analysis can be used for the purpose of PBPK modelling to capture segmental drug solubilisation and absorption in fasted and fed states. However, data are lacking under different fed conditions, especially following low-fat meals, so the impact of different fat content associated with different meals on bile salt concentrations cannot be discerned. Graphical Abstract Gastrointestinal bile salt concentrations in healthy subjects A meta-analysis has been conducted to collate fasted and fed gastrointestinal bile salt concentrations in healthy subjects for the purpose of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling within the Simcyp and other PBPK simulators. Values are presented as weighted means with coefficient of variability for each segment. These data will help improve mechanistic models of oral drug absorption.",

    "abstract": "SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 are sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (SMCTs), the former being a high-affinity type and the latter a low-affinity type. Both transport a variety of monocarboxylates in a Na+-coupled manner. They are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, thyroid, brain, and retina. SLC5A8 is localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and proximal tubule. In the brain and retina, its expression is restricted to neurons and the retinal pigment epithelium. The physiologic functions of SLC5A8 include absorption of short-chain fatty acids in the colon and small intestine, reabsorption of lactate and pyruvate in the kidney, and cellular uptake of lactate and ketone bodies in neurons. It also transports the B-complex vitamin nicotinate. SLC5A12 is also localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and proximal tubule. In the brain and retina, its expression is restricted to astrocytes and Müller cells. SLC5A8 also functions as a tumor suppressor; its expression is silenced in tumors of colon, thyroid, stomach, kidney, and brain. The tumor-suppressive function is related to its ability to mediate concentrative uptake of butyrate, propionate, and pyruvate, all of which are inhibitors of histone deacetylases. SLC5A8 can also transport a variety of pharmacologically relevant monocarboxylates, including salicylates, benzoate, and γ-hydroxybutyrate. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and fenoprofen, also interact with SLC5A8. These drugs are not transportable substrates for SLC5A8, but instead function as blockers of the transporter. Relatively less is known on the role of SLC5A12 in drug transport.",

    "abstract": "In ocular tissue, arachidonic acid is metabolized by cyclooxygenase to prostaglandins which are the most important lipid derived mediators of inflammation. Presently nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are being used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. NSAIDs used in ophthalmology, topically, are salicylic-, indole acetic-, aryl acetic-, aryl propionic- and enolic acid derivatives. NSAIDs are weak acids with pKa mostly between 3.5 and 4.5, and are poorly soluble in water. Aqueous ophthalmic solutions of NSAIDs have been made using sodium, potassium, tromethamine and lysine salts or complexing with cyclodextrins/solubilizer. Ocular penetration of NSAID demands an acidic ophthalmic solution where cyclodextrin could prevent precipitation of drug and minimize its ocular irritation potential. The incompatibility of NSAID with benzalkonium chloride is avoided by using polysorbate 80, cyclodextrins or tromethamine. Lysine salts and α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate disrupt corneal integrity, and their use requires caution. Thus a nonirritating ophthalmic solution of NSAID could be formulated by dissolving an appropriate water-soluble salt, in the presence of cyclodextrin or tromethamine (if needed) in mildly acidified purified water (if stability permits) with or without benzalkonium chloride and polyvinyl alcohol. Amide prodrugs met with mixed success due to incomplete intraocular hydrolysis. Suspension and ocular inserts appear irritating to the inflamed eye. Oil drop may be a suitable option for insoluble drugs and ointment may be used for sustained effect. Recent studies showed that the use of colloidal nanoparticle formulations and the potent COX 2 inhibitor bromfenac may enhance NSAID efficacy in eye preparations.",

    "abstract": "The transport of monocarboxylates, such as lactate and pyruvate, is mediated by the SLC16A family of proton-linked membrane transport proteins known as monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Fourteen MCT-related genes have been identified in mammals and of these seven MCTs have been functionally characterized. Despite their sequence homology, only MCT1–4 have been demonstrated to be proton-dependent transporters of monocarboxylic acids. MCT6, MCT8 and MCT10 have been demonstrated to transport diuretics, thyroid hormones and aromatic amino acids, respectively. MCT1–4 vary in their regulation, tissue distribution and substrate/inhibitor specificity with MCT1 being the most extensively characterized isoform. Emerging evidence suggests that in addition to endogenous substrates, MCTs are involved in the transport of pharmaceutical agents, including γ-hydroxybuytrate (GHB), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), salicylic acid, and bumetanide. MCTs are expressed in a wide range of tissues including the liver, intestine, kidney and brain, and as such they have the potential to impact a number of processes contributing to the disposition of xenobiotic substrates. GHB has been extensively studied as a pharmaceutical substrate of MCTs; the renal clearance of GHB is dose-dependent with saturation of MCT-mediated reabsorption at high doses. Concomitant administration of GHB and l-lactate to rats results in an approximately two-fold increase in GHB renal clearance suggesting that inhibition of MCT1-mediated reabsorption of GHB may be an effective strategy for increasing renal and total GHB elimination in overdose situations. Further studies are required to more clearly define the role of MCTs on drug disposition and the potential for MCT-mediated detoxification strategies in GHB overdose.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that today's practice of polypharmacy inevitably increases the incidence of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Serious DDI is a major liability for any new chemical entity (NCE) entering the pharmaceutical market. As such, pharmaceutical companies employ various strategies to avoid problematic compounds for clinical development. A key cause for DDIs is the inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) that are responsible for metabolic clearance of many drugs. Screening for inhibition potency of CYPs by NCEs has therefore become a routine practice during the drug discovery stage. However, in order to make proper use of DDI data, an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the various experimental systems in current use is required. An illustrated review of experimental practices is presented with discussion of likely future developments. The combination of high quality in vitro data generation and the application of in vivo CYP inhibition modelling approaches should allow more informed decisions to be made in the search for drug molecules with acceptable DDI characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a complex functional barrier composed of endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytic endfeets and neuronal cells. This highly organized complex express a selective permeability for molecules that bear, amongst other parameters, adequate molecular weight and sufficient liposolubility. Unfortunately, very few therapeutic agents currently available do cross the BBB and enters the CNS. As the BBB limitation is more and more acknowledged, many innovative surgical and pharmacological strategies have been developed to circumvent it. This review focuses particularly on the osmotic opening of the BBB, a well-documented approach intended to breach the BBB. Since its inception by Rapoport in 1972, pre-clinical studies have provided important information on the extent of BBB permeation. Thanks to Neuwelt and colleagues, the osmotic opening of the BBB made its way to the clinic. However, many questions remain as to the detailed physiology of the procedure, and its best application to the clinic. Using different tools, amongst which MRI as a real-time in vivo characterization of the BBB permeability and CNS delivery, we attempt to better define the osmotic BBB permeabilization physiology. These ongoing studies are described, and data related to spatial and temporal distribution of a molecule after osmotic BBB breaching, as well as the window of BBB permeabilization, are discussed. We also summarize recent clinical series highlighting promising results in the application of this procedure to maximize delivery of chemotherapy in the treatment of brain tumor patients.",

Some of these particulates can be highly transparent, fragile, and unstable. In addition, for much of the size range of concern, no practical measurement method with adequate sensitivity and repeatability has been available. A complication in measuring protein particulates in many formulations is the simultaneous presence of other particle types such as silicone micro-droplets, air bubbles, and extrinsic contaminants. The need has therefore been identified for new analytical methods which can accurately measure and characterize sub-visible particulates in formulations. Micro-flow imaging has been shown to provide high sensitivity in detecting and imaging transparent protein particles and a unique capability to independently analyze such populations even when other particle types are present.",

    "abstract": "A popular approach for improving transdermal drug delivery involves the use of penetration enhancers (sorption promoters or accelerants) which penetrate into skin to reversibly reduce the barrier resistance. The potential mechanisms of action of penetration enhancers include disruption of intercellular lipid and/or keratin domains and tight junctions. This results in enhanced drug partitioning into tissue, altered thermodynamic activity/solubility of drug etc. Synthetic chemicals (solvents, azones, pyrrolidones, surfactants etc.) generally used for this purpose are rapidly losing their value in transdermal patches due to reports of their absorption into the systemic circulation and subsequent possible toxic effect upon long term application. Terpenes are included in the list of Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substances and have low irritancy potential. Their mechanism of percutaneous permeation enhancement involves increasing the solubility of drugs in skin lipids, disruption of lipid/protein organization and/or extraction of skin micro constituents that are responsible for maintenance of barrier status. Hence, they appear to offer great promise for use in transdermal formulations. This article is aimed at reviewing the mechanisms responsible for percutaneous permeation enhancement activity of terpenes, which shall foster their rational use in transdermal formulations.",

    "abstract": "Food can impact the pharmacokinetics of a drug product through several mechanisms, including but not limited to, enhancement in drug solubility, changes in GI physiology, or direct interaction with the drug. Significant food effects complicate development of new drugs, especially when clinical plans require control and/or monitoring of food intake in relation to dosing. The prediction of whether a drug or drug product will show a human food effect is challenging. In vitro models which consider physical-chemical properties can classify the potential for a compound to demonstrate a positive, negative or no food effect, and may be appropriate for screening compounds at early stages of drug discovery. When comparing various formulations, dissolution tests in biorelevant media can serve as a predictor of human drug performance under fasted and fed conditions. Few in vivo models exist which predict the magnitude of change in pharmacokinetic parameters in humans when dosing in the presence of food, with the dog appearing to be the most studied species for this purpose. Control of gastric pH, as well as the amount and composition of the fed state in dogs are critical parameters to improving the predictability of the dog overall as a food effect model. No single universal model is applicable for all drugs at all stages of drug development. One or more models may be required depending whether the goal is to assess potential for a food effect, determine the magnitude of change in pharmacokinetic parameters in the fed/fasted state, or whether formulation efforts have the ability to mitigate an observed food effect.",

    "abstract": "Biologic products encounter various types of interfacial stress during development, manufacturing, and clinical administration. When proteins come in contact with vapor-liquid, solid-liquid, and liquid-liquid surfaces, these interfaces can significantly impact the protein drug product quality attributes, including formation of visible particles, subvisible particles, or soluble aggregates, or changes in target protein concentration due to adsorption of the molecule to various interfaces. Protein aggregation at interfaces is often accompanied by changes in conformation, as proteins modify their higher order structure in response to interfacial stresses such as hydrophobicity, charge, and mechanical stress. Formation of aggregates may elicit immunogenicity concerns; therefore, it is important to minimize opportunities for aggregation by performing a systematic evaluation of interfacial stress throughout the product development cycle and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies. The purpose of this white paper is to provide an understanding of protein interfacial stability, explore methods to understand interfacial behavior of proteins, then describe current industry approaches to address interfacial stability concerns. Specifically, we will discuss interfacial stresses to which proteins are exposed from drug substance manufacture through clinical administration, as well as the analytical techniques used to evaluate the resulting impact on the stability of the protein. A high-level mechanistic understanding of the relationship between interfacial stress and aggregation will be introduced, as well as some novel techniques for measuring and better understanding the interfacial behavior of proteins. Finally, some best practices in the evaluation and minimization of interfacial stress will be recommended.",

    "abstract": "Induction of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as the cytochromes P450 (CYP) is known to cause drug-drug interactions due to increased elimination of co-administered drugs. This increased elimination may lead to significant reduction or complete loss of efficacy of the co-administered drug. Due to the significance of such drug interactions, many pharmaceutical companies employ screening and characterization models which predict CYP enzyme induction to avoid or attenuate the potential for drug interactions with new drug candidates. The most common mechanism of CYP induction is transcriptional gene activation. Activation is mediated by nuclear receptors, such as AhR, CAR, and PXR that function as transcription factors. Early high throughput screening models utilize these nuclear hormone receptors in ligand binding or cell-based transactivation/reporter assays. In addition, immortalized hepatocyte cell lines can be used to assess enzyme induction of specific drug metabolizing enzymes. Cultured primary human hepatocytes, the best established in vitro model for predicting enzyme induction and most accepted by regulatory agencies, is the predominant assay used to evaluate induction of a wide variety of drug metabolizing enzymes. These in vitro models are able to appropriately predict enzyme induction in patients when compared to clinical drug-drug interactions. Finally, transgenic animal models and the cynomolgus monkey have also been shown to recapitulate human enzyme induction and may be appropriate in vivo animal models for predicting human drug interactions.",

    "abstract": "Much of the inter-individual variability in drug efficacy and risk of adverse reactions is due to polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics or immunological responses. Pharmacogenetic research has identified a multitude of gene-drug response associations, which have resulted in genetically guided treatment and dosing decisions to yield a higher success rate of pharmacological treatment. The rapid technological developments for genetic analyses reveal that the number of genetic variants with importance for drug action is much higher than previously thought and that a true personalized prediction of drug response requires attention to millions of rare mutations. Here, we review the evolutionary background of genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, provide some important examples of current use of pharmacogenomic biomarkers, and give an update of germline and somatic genome biomarkers that are in use in drug development and clinical practice. We also discuss the current technology development with emphasis on complex genetic loci, review current initiatives for validation of pharmacogenomic biomarkers, and present scenarios for the future taking rare genetic variants into account for a true personalized genetically guided drug prescription. We conclude that pharmacogenomic information for patient stratification is of value to tailor optimized treatment regimens particularly in oncology. However, the routine use of pharmacogenomic biomarkers in clinical practice in other therapeutic areas is currently sparse and the prospects of its future implementation are being scrutinized by different international consortia.",

    "abstract": "Today, we are experiencing unprecedented growth and innovation within the pharmaceutical industry. Established protein therapeutic modalities, such as recombinant human proteins, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and fusion proteins, are being used to treat previously unmet medical needs. Novel therapies such as bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), chimeric antigen T cell receptors (CARTs), siRNA, and gene therapies are paving the path towards increasingly personalized medicine. This advancement of new indications and therapeutic modalities is paralleled by development of new analytical technologies and methods that provide enhanced information content in a more efficient manner. Recently, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) multi-attribute method (MAM) has been developed and designed for improved simultaneous detection, identification, quantitation, and quality control (monitoring) of molecular attributes (Rogers et al. MAbs 7(5):881–90, 2015). Based on peptide mapping principles, this powerful tool represents a true advancement in testing methodology that can be utilized not only during product characterization, formulation development, stability testing, and development of the manufacturing process, but also as a platform quality control method in dispositioning clinical materials for both innovative biotherapeutics and biosimilars.",

    "abstract": "Proximal tubules in the kidney play a crucial role in reabsorbing and eliminating substrates from the body into the urine, leading to high local concentrations of xenobiotics. This makes the proximal tubule a major target for drug toxicity that needs to be evaluated during the drug development process. Here, we describe an advanced in vitro model consisting of fully polarized renal proximal tubular epithelial cells cultured in a microfluidic system. Up to 40 leak-tight tubules were cultured on this platform that provides access to the basolateral as well as the apical side of the epithelial cells. Exposure to the nephrotoxicant cisplatin caused a dose-dependent disruption of the epithelial barrier, a decrease in viability, an increase in effluent LDH activity, and changes in expression of tight-junction marker zona-occludence 1, actin, and DNA-damage marker H2A.X, as detected by immunostaining. Activity and inhibition of the efflux pumps P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) were demonstrated using fluorescence-based transporter assays. In addition, the transepithelial transport function from the basolateral to the apical side of the proximal tubule was studied. The apparent permeability of the fluorescent P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 was decreased by 35% by co-incubation with cyclosporin A. Furthermore, the activity of the glucose transporter SGLT2 was demonstrated using the fluorescent glucose analog 6-NBDG which was sensitive to inhibition by phlorizin. Our results demonstrate that we developed a functional 3D perfused proximal tubule model with advanced renal epithelial characteristics that can be used for drug screening studies.",

Currently, remdesivir is being investigated in ten randomized controlled trials against COVID-19. The dose regimen of remdesivir is an IV loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by daily IV maintenance doses of 100 mg for 5–9 days. Based on our data analysis, however, remdesivir with IV administration alone is unlikely to achieve excellent clinical efficacy. This analysis is based on the following observations: plasma exposures of remdesivir and its active metabolite are unlikely to be correlated with its clinical efficacy; remdesivir and its active metabolites are unlikely to be adequate in the lung to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Even if remdesivir demonstrates benefits in the current randomized controlled trials, its efficacy may be limited. We suggest that a combination of an IV and pulmonary delivery dose regimen should be studied immediately to realize a potentially more effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced nephrotoxicity still hampers drug development, because current translation from in vitro or animal studies to human lacks high predictivity. Often, renal adverse effects are recognized only during clinical stages of drug development. The current study aimed to establish a robust and a more complete human cell model suitable for screening of drug-related interactions and nephrotoxicity. In addition to endogenously expressed renal organic cation transporters and efflux transporters, conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells (ciPTEC) were completed by transduction of cells with the organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or OAT3. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting upon exposure to the OAT substrate fluorescein successfully enriched transduced cells. A panel of organic anions was screened for drug-interactions in ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3. The cytotoxic response to the drug-interactions with antivirals was further examined by cell viability assays. Upon subcloning, concentration-dependent fluorescein uptake was found with a higher affinity for ciPTEC-OAT1 (Km = 0.8 ± 0.1 μM) than ciPTEC-OAT3 (Km = 3.7 ± 0.5 μM). Co-exposure to known OAT1 and/or OAT3 substrates (viz. para-aminohippurate, estrone sulfate, probenecid, furosemide, diclofenac, and cimetidine) in cultures spanning 29 passage numbers revealed relevant inhibitory potencies, confirming the robustness of our model for drug-drug interactions studies. Functional OAT1 was directly responsible for cytotoxicity of adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir, while a drug interaction with zidovudine was not associated with decreased cell viability. Our data demonstrate that human-derived ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 are promising platforms for highly predictive drug screening during early phases of drug development.",

This review focuses on the historical development of microdialysis as a method to quantify the pharmacologically very important unbound tissue concentrations and of recent findings relating to modeling microdialysis data to extrapolate from rodents to humans, understanding distribution of drugs in different tissues and disease conditions. Quantitative microdialysis developed very rapidly during the early 1990s. Method development was in focus in the early years including development of quantitative microdialysis, to be able to estimate true extracellular concentrations. Microdialysis has significantly contributed to the understanding of active transport at the blood-brain barrier and in other organs. Examples are presented where microdialysis together with modeling has increased the knowledge on tissue distribution between species, in overweight patients and in tumors, and in metabolite contribution to drug effects. More integrated metabolomic studies are still sparse within the microdialysis field, although a great potential for tissue and disease-specific measurements is evident.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brain drug delivery may be restricted by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and enhancement by liposome-based drug delivery strategies has been investigated. As access to the human brain is limited, many studies have been performed in experimental animals. Whereas providing interesting data, such studies have room for improvement to provide mechanistic insight into the rate and extent of specifically BBB transport and intrabrain distribution processes that all together govern CNS target delivery of the free drug. This review shortly summarizes BBB transport and current liposome-based strategies to overcome BBB transport restrictions, with the emphasis on how to determine the individual mechanisms that all together determine the time course of free drug brain concentrations, following their administration as such, and in liposomes. Animal studies using microdialysis providing time course information on unbound drug in plasma and brain are highlighted, as these provide the mechanistic information needed to understand BBB drug transport of the drug, and the impact of a liposomal formulations of that drug on BBB transport. Overall, these studies show that brain distribution of a drug administered as liposomal formulation depends on both drug properties and liposomal formulation characteristics. In general, evidence suggests that active transporters at the BBB, either being influx or efflux transporters, are circumvented by liposomes. It is concluded that liposomal formulations may provide interesting changes in BBB transport. More mechanistic studies are needed to understand relevant mechanisms in liposomal drug delivery to the brain, providing an improved basis for its prediction in human using animal data.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript represents the perspective of the Dissolution Working Group of the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) and of two focus groups of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS): Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and In Vitro Release and Dissolution Testing (IVRDT). The intent of this manuscript is to show recent progress in the field of in vitro predictive dissolution modeling and to provide recommended general approaches to developing in vitro predictive dissolution models for both early- and late-stage formulation/process development and batch release. Different modeling approaches should be used at different stages of drug development based on product and process understanding available at those stages. Two industry case studies of current approaches used for modeling tablet dissolution are presented. These include examples of predictive model use for product development within the space explored during formulation and process optimization, as well as of dissolution models as surrogate tests in a regulatory filing. A review of an industry example of developing a dissolution model for real-time release testing (RTRt) and of academic case studies of enabling dissolution RTRt by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is also provided. These demonstrate multiple approaches for developing data-rich empirical models in the context of science- and risk-based process development to predict in vitro dissolution. Recommendations of modeling best practices are made, focused primarily on immediate-release (IR) oral delivery products for new drug applications. A general roadmap is presented for implementation of dissolution modeling for enhanced product understanding, robust control strategy, batch release testing, and flexibility toward post-approval changes.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the potential added value of intranasal drug administration, preclinical studies to date have typically used the area under the curve (AUC) in brain tissue or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to plasma following intranasal and intravenous administration to calculate measures of extent like drug targeting efficiencies (%DTE) and nose-to-brain transport percentages (%DTP). However, CSF does not necessarily provide direct information on the target site concentrations, while total brain concentrations are not specific to that end either as non-specific binding is not explicitly considered. Moreover, to predict nose-to-brain transport in humans, the use of descriptive analysis of preclinical data does not suffice. Therefore, nose-to-brain research should be performed translationally and focus on preclinical studies to obtain specific information on absorption from the nose, and distinguish between the different transport routes to the brain (absorption directly from the nose to the brain, absorption from the nose into the systemic circulation, and distribution between the systemic circulation and the brain), in terms of extent as well as rate. This can be accomplished by the use of unbound concentrations obtained from plasma and brain, with subsequent advanced mathematical modeling. To that end, brain extracellular fluid (ECF) is a preferred sampling site as it represents most closely the site of action for many targets. Furthermore, differences in nose characteristics between preclinical species and humans should be considered. Finally, pharmacodynamic measurements that can be obtained in both animals and humans should be included to further improve the prediction of the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship of intranasally administered CNS drugs in humans.",

    "abstract": "Early prediction of human clearance is often challenging, in particular for the growing number of low-clearance compounds. Long-term in vitro models have been developed which enable sophisticated hepatic drug disposition studies and improved clearance predictions. Here, the cell line HepG2, iPSC-derived hepatocytes (iCell®), the hepatic stem cell line HepaRG™, and human hepatocyte co-cultures (HμREL™ and HepatoPac®) were compared to primary hepatocyte suspension cultures with respect to their key metabolic activities. Similar metabolic activities were found for the long-term models HepaRG™, HμREL™, and HepatoPac® and the short-term suspension cultures when averaged across all 11 enzyme markers, although differences were seen in the activities of CYP2D6 and non-CYP enzymes. For iCell® and HepG2, the metabolic activity was more than tenfold lower. The micropatterned HepatoPac® model was further evaluated with respect to clearance prediction. To assess the in vitro parameters, pharmacokinetic modeling was applied. The determination of intrinsic clearance by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling in a long-term model significantly increased the confidence in the parameter estimation and extended the sensitive range towards 3% of liver blood flow, i.e., >10-fold lower as compared to suspension cultures. For in vitro to in vivo extrapolation, the well-stirred model was used. The micropatterned model gave rise to clearance prediction in man within a twofold error for the majority of low-clearance compounds. Further research is needed to understand whether transporter activity and drug metabolism by non-CYP enzymes, such as UGTs, SULTs, AO, and FMO, is comparable to the in vivo situation in these long-term culture models.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of the biopharmaceutics drug classification system (Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)), in 1995, provided a simple way to describe the biopharmaceutics behavior of a drug. Solubility and permeability are among the major parameters, which determine the fraction dose absorbed of a drug substance and consequently its chances to be bioavailable. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evolution of the media used for determining solubility and dissolution and how this can be used in modern drug development. Over the years, physiologically adapted media and buffers were introduced with the intention to better predict the in vivo solubility and dissolution of drug substances. Water, buffer solutions, compendial media, micellar solubilization media, and biorelevant media are reviewed. At this time point, there is no universal medium available which can be used to predict every drug substance's solubility or a drug product's in vivo dissolution behavior. However, there have been many improvements and additions made to media to optimize their in vivo predictability; for example, the current phosphate concentrations in buffers seem to be too high to correlate with the carbonate buffer concentrations in vivo. Biorelevant media were updated to correlate them better with the composition of human intestinal fluids. The BCS was introduced into regulatory sciences as a scientific risk management tool to waive bioequivalence studies under certain conditions. Today's different guidance documents define the dose-solubility ratio differently. As shown for amoxicillin, this can cause more confusion than certainty for globally operating companies. Harmonization of BCS guidelines is highly desirable.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict subcutaneous (SC) absorption rate and tissue distribution of therapeutic proteins (TPs) using a bottom-up approach is highly desirable early in the drug development process prior to clinical data being available. A whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, requiring only a few drug parameters, to predict plasma and interstitial fluid concentrations of TPs in humans after intravenous and subcutaneous dosing has been developed. Movement of TPs between vascular and interstitial spaces was described by considering both convection and diffusion processes using a 2-pore framework. The model was optimised using a variety of literature sources, such as tissue lymph/plasma concentration ratios in humans and animals, information on the percentage of dose absorbed following SC dosing via lymph in animals and data showing loss of radiolabelled IgG from the SC dosing site in humans. The resultant model was used to predict t max and plasma concentration profiles for 12 TPs (molecular weight 8–150 kDa) following SC dosing. The predicted plasma concentration profiles were generally comparable to observed data. t max was predicted within 3-fold of reported values, with one third of the predictions within 0.8–1.25-fold. There was no systematic bias in simulated C max values, although a general trend for underprediction of t max was observed. No clear trend between prediction accuracy of t max and TP isoelectric point or molecular size was apparent. The mechanistic whole-body PBPK model described here can be applied to predict absorption rate of TPs into blood and movement into target tissues following SC dosing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effect of food on pharmacokinetic properties of drugs is a commonly observed occurrence affecting about 40% of orally administered drugs. Within the pharmaceutical industry, significant resources are invested to predict and characterize a clinically relevant food effect. Here, the predictive performance of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) food effect models was assessed via de novo mechanistic absorption models for 30 compounds using controlled, pre-defined in vitro , and modeling methodology. Compounds for which absorption was known to be limited by intestinal transporters were excluded in this analysis. A decision tree for model verification and optimization was followed, leading to high, moderate, or low food effect prediction confidence. High (within 0.8- to 1.25-fold) to moderate confidence (within 0.5- to 2-fold) was achieved for most of the compounds (15 and 8, respectively). While for 7 compounds, prediction confidence was found to be low (&gt; 2-fold). There was no clear difference in prediction success for positive or negative food effects and no clear relationship to the BCS category of tested drug molecules. However, an association could be demonstrated when the food effect was mainly related to changes in the gastrointestinal luminal fluids or physiology, including fluid volume, motility, pH, micellar entrapment, and bile salts. Considering these findings, it is recommended that appropriately verified mechanistic PBPK modeling can be leveraged with high to moderate confidence as a key approach to predicting potential food effect, especially related to mechanisms highlighted here.",

    "abstract": "Analytical methods are utilized throughout the biopharmaceutical and vaccines industries to conduct research and development, and to help control manufacturing inputs and outputs. These analytical methods should continuously provide quality data to support decisions while managing the remaining of risk and uncertainty. Analytical quality by design (AQbD) can provide a systematic framework to achieve a continuously validated, robust assay as well as life cycle management. AQbD is rooted in ICH guidelines Q8 and Q9 that were translated to the analytical space through several white papers as well as upcoming USP 1220 and ICH Q14. In this white paper, we expand on the previously published concepts of AQbD by providing additional context for implementation in relation to ICH Q14. Using illustrative examples, we describe the AQbD workflow, its relation to traditional approaches, and potential pathways for ongoing, real-time verification. We will also discuss challenges with respect to implementation and regulatory strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Industry 4.0 has started to transform the manufacturing industries by embracing digitalization, automation, and big data, aiming for interconnected systems, autonomous decisions, and smart factories. Machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), have emerged as potent tools to address the related computational tasks. These advancements have also reached the pharmaceutical industry, where the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative has already paved the way for the real-time analysis of the processes and the science- and risk-based flexible production. This paper aims to assess the potential of ANNs within the PAT concept to aid the modernization of pharmaceutical manufacturing. The current state of ANNs is systematically reviewed for the most common manufacturing steps of solid pharmaceutical products, and possible research gaps and future directions are identified. In this way, this review could aid the further development of machine learning techniques for pharmaceutical production and eventually contribute to the implementation of intelligent manufacturing lines with automated quality assurance.

    "abstract": "The Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification system (BDDCS) is a four-class approach based on water solubility and extent of metabolism/permeability rate. Based on the BDDCS class to which a drug is assigned, it is possible to predict the role of metabolic enzymes and transporters on the drug disposition of a new molecular entity (NME) prior to its administration to animals or humans. Here, we report a total of 1475 drugs and active metabolites to which the BDDCS is applied. Of these, 379 are new entries, and 1096 are revisions of former classification studies with the addition of references for the approved maximum dose strength, extent of the systemically available drug excreted unchanged in the urine, and lowest solubility over the pH range 1.0–6.8 when such information is available in the literature. We detail revised class assignments of previously misclassified drugs and the literature analyses to classify new drugs. We review the process of solubility assessment for NMEs prior to drug dosing in humans and approved dose classification, as well as the comparison of Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) versus BDDCS assignment. We detail the uses of BDDCS in predicting, prior to dosing animals or humans, disposition characteristics, potential brain penetration, food effect, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) potential. This work provides an update on the current status of the BDDCS and its uses in the drug development process. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",

Both qPCR and dPCR are extensively used to answer bioanalytical questions for novel modalities such as cell and gene therapies. Following cross-industry conversations on the lack of information and guidelines for these assays, an American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists working group was formed to address these gaps by bringing together 37 industry experts from 24 organizations to discuss best practices to gain a better understanding in the industry and facilitate filings to health authorities. Herein, this team provides considerations on assay design, development, and validation testing for PCR assays that are used in cell and gene therapies including (1) biodistribution; (2) transgene expression; (3) viral shedding; (4) and persistence or cellular kinetics of cell therapies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ritlecitinib, an orally available Janus kinase 3 and tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of alopecia areata (AA), is highly soluble across the physiological pH range at the therapeutic dose. As such, it is expected to dissolve rapidly in any in vitro dissolution conditions. However, in vitro dissolution data showed slower dissolution for 100-mg capsules, used for the clinical bioequivalence (BE) study, compared with proposed commercial 50-mg capsules. Hence, a biowaiver for the lower 50-mg strength using comparable multimedia dissolution based on the f2 similarity factor was not possible. The in vivo relevance of this observed in vitro dissolution profile was evaluated with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. This report describes the development, verification, and application of the ritlecitinib PBPK model to translate observed in vitro dissolution data to an in vivo PK profile for ritlecitinib capsule formulations. Virtual BE (VBE) trials were conducted using the Simcyp VBE module, including the model-predicted within-subject variability or intra-subject coefficient of variation (ICV). The results showed the predicted ICV was predicted to be smaller than observed clinical ICV, resulting in a more optimistic BE risk assessment. Additional VBE assessment was conducted by incorporating clinically observed ICV. The VBE trial results including clinically observed ICV demonstrated that proposed commercial 50-mg capsules vs clinical 100-mg capsules were bioequivalent, with &gt; 90% probability of success. This study demonstrates a PBPK model–based biowaiver for a clinical BE study while introducing a novel method to integrate clinically observed ICV into VBE trials with PBPK models.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, synthetic cathinones (SCs) is the second more representative subclass of New Psychoactive Substances, accounting for 104 analogues in the illegal market. Since its first report in 2011, α-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (α-PVP) gained popularity among drug users, provoking an increased number of intoxications. Nonetheless, pharmacokinetics data is still limited in the literature. An observational non-controlled naturalistic study on 8 healthy volunteers was conducted to assess the α-PVP and β-OH-α-PVP concentrations in OF and urine, after snorting 10 mg or 20 mg of α-PVP. A multi-analytical approach based on GC-EI-MS/MS and LC-HESI-HRMS/MS was developed and fully validated for the analytes quantification, while four untargeted LC-HESI-HRMS/MS methods in full-MS and ddMS 2 were set up for unknown metabolites characterization in urine samples assisted by a dedicated data mining software. In OF, α-PVP reached a mean C max of 762 ± 323 ng/mL at 1 h after 10 mg administration, while a C max of 2,900 ± 1,373 ng/mL at 47 min after 20 mg dose. In urine, a total α-PVP mean amount of 179.2 ± 94.9 µg was accumulated after 10 mg dose, (27.2 ± 9.8 µg between 0-2 h and 152.0 ± 98.2 µg between 2-5 h), while a total amount of 122.9 ± 44.0 µg, of (36.2 ± 16.5 and 86.7 ± 28.3 µg between 0–2 and 2-5 h, respectively) was detected after 20 mg dose. Among the 10 identified metabolites, β-OH-α-PVP was a minor metabolite (total amount: 56.4 ± 27.1 and 69.1 ± 38.1 µg after 10 mg and 20 mg). The N-butanoic acid metabolite was the most abundant, detected also as glucuronide. In conclusion, α-PVP showed a later time peak than non-pyrrolidine SCs, with comparable C max. The pyrrolidine ring oxidative opening produced the most abundant urinary metabolite, independently from the dose.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quality by Design (QbD) is a transformative and systematic approach to developing top-tier pharmaceutical products, ushering in a departure from traditional trial-and-error methods toward a more science-based, risk-oriented, and holistic strategy. Central to QbD implementation is the meticulous development of formulations and manufacturing processes, consistently fulfilling predefined quality objectives. The core objective of QbD remains unwavering — to guarantee the steadfast alignment of the final pharmaceutical product with predetermined quality attributes, thereby mitigating batch-to-batch variations and potential recalls. This article succinctly explores the multifaceted application of QbD methodology within the pharmaceutical industry. Emphasizing its pivotal role in research and development, manufacturing, quality control, and quality assurance, the discussion navigates through the strategic deployment of QbD elements and tools. Amidst the evident advantages of QbD, challenges persist in its widespread adoption within the pharmaceutical sector and regulatory frameworks. This article sheds light on the regulatory landscape that currently governs the implementation of QbD in these crucial stages of pharmaceutical processes. For that reason, this review article aims to provide researchers, scientists, and industry professionals with a thorough introduction to QbD so they may adopt this methodical approach to developing and producing high-quality pharmaceutical products, always in compliance with the underlying regulations.

    "abstract": "Quality by design (QbD) has recently been introduced in pharmaceutical product development in a regulatory context and the process of implementing such concepts in the drug approval process is presently on-going. This has the potential to allow for a more flexible regulatory approach based on understanding and optimisation of how design of a product and its manufacturing process may affect product quality. Thus, adding restrictions to manufacturing beyond what can be motivated by clinical quality brings no benefits but only additional costs. This leads to a challenge for biopharmaceutical scientists to link clinical product performance to critical manufacturing attributes. In vitro dissolution testing is clearly a key tool for this purpose and the present bioequivalence guidelines and biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) provides a platform for regulatory applications of in vitro dissolution as a marker for consistency in clinical outcomes. However, the application of these concepts might need to be further developed in the context of QbD to take advantage of the higher level of understanding that is implied and displayed in regulatory documentation utilising QbD concepts. Aspects that should be considered include identification of rate limiting steps in the absorption process that can be linked to pharmacokinetic variables and used for prediction of bioavailability variables, in vivo relevance of in vitro dissolution test conditions and performance/interpretation of specific bioavailability studies on critical formulation/process variables. This article will give some examples and suggestions how clinical relevance of dissolution testing can be achieved in the context of QbD derived from a specific case study for a BCS II compound.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in the development of central nervous system (CNS)-targeted drugs is predicting CNS exposure in human from preclinical data. In this study, we present a methodology to investigate brain disposition in rats using a physiologically based modeling approach aiming at improving the prediction of human brain exposure. We specifically focused on quantifying regional diffusion and fluid flow processes within the brain. Acetaminophen was used as a test compound as it is not subjected to active transport processes. Microdialysis probes were implanted in striatum, for sampling brain extracellular fluid (ECF) concentrations, and in lateral ventricle (LV) and cisterna magna (CM), for sampling cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. Serial blood samples were taken in parallel. These data, in addition to physiological parameters from literature, were used to develop a physiologically based model to describe the regional brain pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen. The concentration-time profiles of brain ECF, CSF(LV), and CSF(CM) indicate a rapid equilibrium with plasma. However, brain ECF concentrations are on average fourfold higher than CSF concentrations, with average brain-to-plasma AUC(0-240) ratios of 121%, 28%, and 35% for brain ECF, CSF(LV), and CSF(CM), respectively. It is concluded that for acetaminophen, a model compound for passive transport into, within, and out of the brain, differences exist between the brain ECF and the CSF pharmacokinetics. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling approach is important, as it allowed the prediction of human brain ECF exposure on the basis of human CSF concentrations.",

Some of the focus areas identified apply equally to the production of generic drugs. However, there are scientific challenges unique to the development of generic drugs as well. In May 2007, FDA released a document \"Critical Path Opportunities for Generic Drugs\" that identified some of the specific challenges in the development of generic drugs. The key steps in generic product development are usually characterization of the reference product, design of a pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent product, design of a consistent manufacturing process and conduct of the pivotal bioequivalence study. There are several areas of opportunity where scientific progress could accelerate the development and approval of generic products and expand the range of products for which generic versions are available, while maintaining high standards for quality, safety, and efficacy. These areas include the use of quality by design to develop bioequivalent products, more efficient bioequivalence methods for systemically acting drugs (expansion of BCS waivers, highly variable drugs), and development of new bioequivalence methods for locally acting drugs.",

    "abstract": "Recent publications have emphasized the lack of characterization methods available for protein particles in a size range comprised between 0.1 and 10 μm and the potential risk of immunogenicity associated with such particles. In the present paper, we have investigated the performance of light obscuration, flow microscopy, and Coulter counter instruments for particle counting and sizing in protein formulations. We focused on particles 2-10 μm in diameter and studied the effect of silicon oil droplets originating from the barrel of pre-filled syringes, as well as the effect of high protein concentrations (up to 150 mg/ml) on the accuracy of particle characterization. Silicon oil was demonstrated to contribute significantly to the particle counts observed in pre-filled syringes. Inconsistent results were observed between different protein concentrations in the range 7.5-150 mg/ml for particles <10 μm studied by optical techniques (light obscuration and flow microscopy). However, the Coulter counter measurements were consistent across the same studied concentration range but required sufficient solution conductivity from the formulation buffer or excipients. Our results show that currently available technologies, while allowing comparisons between samples of a given protein at a fixed concentration, may be unable to measure particle numbers accurately in a variety of protein formulations, e.g., at high concentration in sugar-based formulations.",

This article provides a summary of the literature pertaining to canine breed differences in physiology, drug response, drug pharmacokinetics, and metabolic idiosyncrasies. The existing knowledge of pedigrees and the known phenotypes and genotypes of dogs provides important information for determining mode of inheritance, penetration, and other major characteristics of heritable traits. Understanding these breed differences will improve canine population predictions (for canine drug products) and may be of value when extrapolating toxicology data from dogs to humans.",

    "abstract": "The term \"patient centered,\" \"patient centric,\" or \"patient centricity\" is increasingly used in the scientific literature in a wide variety of contexts. Generally, patient centric medicines are recognized as an essential contributor to healthy aging and the overall patient's quality of life and life expectancy. Besides the selection of the appropriate type of drug substance and strength for a particular indication in a particular patient, due attention must be paid that the pharmaceutical drug product design is also adequately addressing the particular patient's needs, i.e., assuring adequate patient adherence and the anticipate drug safety and effectiveness. Relevant pharmaceutical design aspects may e.g., involve the selection of the route of administration, the tablet size and shape, the ease of opening the package, the ability to read the user instruction, or the ability to follow the recommended (in-use) storage conditions. Currently, a harmonized definition on patient centric drug development/design has not yet been established. To stimulate scientific research and discussions and the consistent interpretation of test results, it is essential that such a definition is established. We have developed a first draft definition through various rounds of discussions within an interdisciplinary AAPS focus group of experts. This publication summarizes the outcomes and is intended to stimulate further discussions with all stakeholders towards a common definition of patient centric pharmaceutical drug product design that is useable across all disciplines involved.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles, microparticles, and other biomaterials are advantageous in vaccination because these materials provide opportunities to modulate specific characteristics of immune responses. This idea of \"tuning\" immune responses has recently been used to combat infectious diseases and cancer, and to induce tolerance during organ transplants or autoimmune disease. Lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen play crucial roles in determining if and how these responses develop following vaccination or immunotherapy. Thus, by manipulating the local microenvironments within these immunological command centers, the nature of systemic immune response can be controlled. This review provides recent examples that harness the interactions between biomaterials and lymph nodes or other secondary lymphoid organs to generate immunity or promote tolerance. These strategies draw on mechanical properties, surface chemistry, stability, and targeting to alter the interactions of cells, signals, and vaccine components in lymph nodes. While there are still many unanswered questions surrounding how best to design biomaterial-based vaccines to promote specific structures or functions in lymph nodes, features such as controlled release and targeting will help pave the way for the next generation of vaccines and immunotherapies that generate immune responses tuned for specific applications.",

    "abstract": "The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), based on aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability, has enjoyed wide use since 1995 as a mechanism for waiving in vivo bioavailability and bioequivalence studies. In 2000, the US-FDA was the first regulatory agency to publish guidance for industry describing how to meet criteria for requesting a waiver of in vivo bioavailability and bioequivalence studies for highly soluble, highly permeable (BCS Class I) drugs. Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) published guidelines recommending how to obtain BCS biowaivers for BCS Class III drugs (high solubility, low permeability), in addition to Class I drugs. In 2015, the US-FDA became better harmonized with the EMA and WHO following publication of two guidances for industry outlining criteria for obtaining BCS biowaivers for both Class I and Class III drugs. A detailed review and comparison of the BCS Class I and Class III criteria currently recommended by the US-FDA, EMA, and WHO revealed good convergence of the three agencies with respect to BCS biowaiver criteria. The comparison also suggested that, by applying the most conservative of the three jurisdictional approaches, it should be possible for a sponsor to design the same set of BCS biowaiver studies in preparing a submission for worldwide filing to satisfy US, European, and emerging market regulators. It is hoped that the availability of BCS Class I and Class III biowaivers in multiple jurisdictions will encourage more sponsors to request waivers of in vivo bioavailability/bioequivalence testing using the BCS approach.",

    "abstract": "Drug-transporter interactions could impact renal drug clearance and should ideally be detected in early stages of drug development to avoid toxicity-related withdrawals in later stages. This requires reliable and robust assays for which current high-throughput screenings have, however, poor predictability. Kidney-on-a-chip platforms have the potential to improve predictability, but often lack compatibility with high-content detection platforms. Here, we combined conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells overexpressing organic anion transporter 1 (ciPTEC-OAT1) with the microfluidic titer plate OrganoPlate to develop a screenings assay for renal drug-transporter interactions. In this platform, apical localization of F-actin and intracellular tight-junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) indicated appropriate cell polarization. Gene expression levels of the drug transporters organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1; SLC22A6), organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2; SLC22A2), P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1), and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and 4 (MRP2/4; ABCC2/4) were similar levels to 2D static cultures. Functionality of the efflux transporters P-gp and MRP2/4 was studied as proof-of-concept for 3D assays using calcein-AM and 5-chloromethylfluorescein-diacetate (CMFDA), respectively. Confocal imaging demonstrated a 4.4 ± 0.2-fold increase in calcein accumulation upon P-gp inhibition using PSC833. For MRP2/4, a 3.0 ± 0.2-fold increased accumulation of glutathione-methylfluorescein (GS-MF) was observed upon inhibition with a combination of PSC833, MK571, and KO143. Semi-quantitative image processing methods for P-gp and MRP2/4 was demonstrated with corresponding Z′-factors of 0.1 ± 0.3 and 0.4 ± 0.1, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate a 3D microfluidic PTEC model valuable for screening of drug-transporter interactions that further allows multiplexing of endpoint read-outs for drug-transporter interactions and toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Sensitive and specific methodology is required for the detection and characterization of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). High-quality ADA data enables the evaluation of potential impact of ADAs on the drug pharmacokinetic profile, patient safety, and efficacious response to the drug. Immunogenicity assessments are typically initiated at early stages in preclinical studies and continue throughout the drug development program. One of the potential bioanalytical challenges encountered with ADA testing is the need to identify and mitigate the interference mediated by the presence of soluble drug target. A drug target, when present at sufficiently high circulating concentrations, can potentially interfere with the performance of ADA and neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays, leading to either false-positive or, in some cases, false-negative ADA and NAb assay results. This publication describes various mechanisms of assay interference by soluble drug target, as well as strategies to recognize and mitigate such target interference. Pertinent examples are presented to illustrate the impact of target interference on ADA and NAb assays as well as several mitigation strategies, including the use of anti-target antibodies, soluble versions of the receptors, target-binding proteins, lectins, and solid-phase removal of targets. Furthermore, recommendations for detection and mitigation of such interference in different formats of ADA and NAb assays are provided.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the increased interest in pediatric research has enforced the role of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models in pediatric drug development. However, an existing lack of published examples contributes to some uncertainties about the reliability of their predictions of oral drug exposure. Developing and validating pediatric PBPK models for oral drug application shall enrich our knowledge about their limitations and lead to a better use of the generated data. This study was conducted to investigate how whole-body PBPK models describe the oral pharmacokinetics of sotalol over the entire pediatric age. Two leading software tools for whole-body PBPK modeling: Simcyp® (Simcyp Ltd, Sheffield, UK) and PK-SIM® (Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany), were used. Each PBPK model was first validated in adults before scaling to children. Model input parameters were collected from the literature and clinical data for 80 children were used to compare predicted and observed values. The results obtained by both models were comparable and gave an adequate description of sotalol pharmacokinetics in adults and in almost all pediatric age groups. Only in neonates, the mean ratio(Obs/Pred) for any PK parameter exceeded a twofold error range, 2.56 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.10-3.49) and 2.15 (95% CI, 1.77-2.99) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the first to the last concentration point and maximal concentration (Cmax) using SIMCYP® and 2.37 (95% CI, 1.76-3.25) for time to reach Cmax using PK-SIM®. The two PBPK models evaluated in this study reflected properly the age-related pharmacokinetic changes and predicted adequately the oral sotalol exposure in children of different ages, except in neonates.",

    "abstract": "CD3 bispecific antibody constructs recruit cytolytic T cells to kill tumor cells, offering a potent approach to treat cancer. T cell activation is driven by the formation of a trimolecular complex (trimer) between drugs, T cells, and tumor cells, mimicking an immune synapse. A translational quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model is proposed for CD3 bispecific molecules capable of predicting trimer concentration and linking it to tumor cell killing. The model was used to quantify the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of a CD3 bispecific targeting P-cadherin (PF-06671008). It describes the disposition of PF-06671008 in the central compartment and tumor in mouse xenograft models, including binding to target and T cells in the tumor to form the trimer. The model incorporates T cell distribution to the tumor, proliferation, and contraction. PK/PD parameters were estimated for PF-06671008 and a tumor stasis concentration (TSC) was calculated as an estimate of minimum efficacious trimer concentration. TSC values ranged from 0.0092 to 0.064 pM across mouse tumor models. The model was translated to the clinic and used to predict the disposition of PF-06671008 in patients, including the impact of binding to soluble P-cadherin. The predicted terminal half-life of PF-06671008 in the clinic was approximately 1 day, and P-cadherin expression and number of T cells in the tumor were shown to be sensitive parameters impacting clinical efficacy. A translational QSP model is presented for CD3 bispecific molecules, which integrates in silico, in vitro and in vivo data in a mechanistic framework, to quantify and predict efficacy across species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A private testing laboratory reported in a Citizen Petition (CP) to FDA that 16 of 38 metformin drug products they tested had N -nitrosodimethyl amine (NDMA) amounts above the allowable intake (AI) of 96 ng/day. Because the FDA had been monitoring drugs for nitrosamines, orthogonal analytical procedures had been developed, validated and applied to detect the following nitrosamines in metformin drug products (if present): (i) NDMA (with a dedicated method) or (ii) NDMA (with a second confirmatory method), N -nitroso-diethylamine (NDEA), N -ethyl- N -nitroso-2-propanamine (NEIPA), N -nitroso-diisopropylamine (NDIPA), N -nitroso-di-n-propylamine (NDPA), N -nitroso-methylphenylamine (NMPA), N -nitroso-di-n-butylamine (NDBA) and N -nitroso- N -methyl-4-aminobutyric acid (NMBA). In contrast to the private laboratory results, FDA testing on the same set of 38 samples with orthogonal procedures observed amounts over the AI in only 8 of the 38 products and generally observed lower values than reported by the private testing laboratory. As described here, the investigation into the cause of the discrepancy revealed that N,N -dimethylformamide (DMF) can interfere with NDMA measurements. The data showed that the use of sufficient mass accuracy in the data acquisition and appropriate mass tolerance setting in the data processing to assure the selectivity of mass spectrometry measurements of NDMA in the presence of co-eluting DMF was necessary to prevent overestimation of the level of NDMA in metformin drug products. Overall, care should be taken to assure the necessary specificity in analytical procedures for adequate assessment of the nitrosamine level in drug products that also contain DMF or other potential interfering substances.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blocking antibodies such as anti-PD-1 are approved and significantly improve the survival of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but there has been little success in identifying biomarkers capable of separating the responders from non-responders before the onset of the therapy. In this study, we developed a quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) model to represent the anti-tumor immune response in human NSCLC that integrated our knowledge of tumor growth, antigen processing and presentation, T cell activation and distribution, antibody pharmacokinetics, and immune checkpoint dynamics. The model was calibrated with the available data and was used to identify potential biomarkers as well as patient-specific response based on the patient parameters. The model predicted that in addition to tumor mutational burden (TMB), a known biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC, the number of effector T cells and regulatory T cells in the tumor and blood is a predictor of the responders. Furthermore, the model simulated a set of 12 patients with known TMB and MHC/antigen-binding affinity from a recent clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02259621) on neoadjuvant nivolumab therapy in resectable lung cancer and predicted an augmented durable response in patients with adjuvant nivolumab treatment in addition to the clinical trial protocol of neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment followed by resection. Overall, the model provides a valuable framework to model tumor immunity and response to immune checkpoint blockers to enhance biomarker discovery and performing virtual clinical trials to aid in design and interpretation of the current trials with fewer patients.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rate and extent of drug dissolution in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are highly dependent upon drug physicochemical properties and GI fluid properties. Biorelevant dissolution media (BDM), which aim to facilitate in vitro prediction of in vivo dissolution performance, have evolved with our understanding of GI physiology. However, BDM with a variety of properties and compositions are available, making the choice of dissolution medium challenging. In this tutorial, we describe a simple and quantitative methodology for selecting practical, yet physiologically relevant BDM representative of fasted humans for evaluating dissolution of immediate release formulations. Specifically, this methodology describes selection of pH, buffer species, and concentration and evaluates the importance of including bile salts and phospholipids in the BDM based upon drug substance log D , p K a , and intrinsic solubility. The methodology is based upon a mechanistic understanding of how three main factors affect dissolution, including (1) drug ionization at gastrointestinal pH, (2) alteration of surface pH by charged drug species, and (3) drug solubilization in mixed lipidic aggregates comprising bile salts and phospholipids. Assessment of this methodology through testing and comparison with literature reports showed that the recommendations correctly identified when a biorelevant buffer capacity or the addition of bile salts and phospholipids to the medium would appreciably change the drug dissolution profile. This methodology can enable informed decisions about when a time, complexity, and/or cost-saving buffer is expected to lead to physiologically meaningful in vitro dissolution testing, versus when a more complex buffer would be required.",

Integration of advanced analytics into the practice of Translational Medicine is now a fundamental enabler to fully exploit information contained in diverse sources of big data sets such as \"omics\" data, as illustrated by deep characterizations of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, and exposome. In this commentary, we provide an overview of ML applications in drug discovery and development, aligned with the three strategic pillars of Translational Medicine (target, patient, dose) and offer perspectives on their potential to transform the science and practice of the discipline. Opportunities for integrating ML approaches into the discipline of Pharmacometrics are discussed and will revolutionize the practice of model-informed drug discovery and development. Finally, we posit that joint efforts of Clinical Pharmacology, Bioinformatics, and Biomarker Technology experts are vital in cross-functional team settings to realize the promise of AI/ML-enabled Translational and Precision Medicine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern diagnostic technologies rely on both in vitro and in vivo modalities to provide a complete understanding of the clinical state of a patient. Nanoparticle-antibody conjugates have emerged as promising systems to confer increased sensitivity and accuracy for in vitro diagnostics (e.g., immunoassays). Meanwhile, in vivo applications have benefited from the targeting ability of nanoparticle-antibody conjugates, as well as payload flexibility and tailored biodistribution. This review provides an encompassing overview of nanoparticle-antibody conjugates, from chemistry to applications in medical immunoassays and tumor imaging, highlighting the underlying principles and unique features of relevant preclinical applications employing commonly used imaging modalities (e.g., optical/photoacoustics, positron-emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray computed tomography).",

    "abstract": "Evolving immunogenicity assay performance expectations and a lack of harmonized anti-drug antibody validation testing and reporting tools have resulted in significant time spent by health authorities and sponsors on resolving filing queries. Following debate at the American Association of Pharmaceutical Sciences National Biotechnology Conference, a group was formed to address these gaps. Over the last 3 years, 44 members from 29 organizations (including 5 members from Europe and 10 members from FDA) discussed gaps in understanding immunogenicity assay requirements and have developed harmonization tools for use by industry scientists to facilitate filings to health authorities. Herein, this team provides testing and reporting strategies and tools for the following assessments: (1) pre-study validation cut point; (2) in-study cut points, including procedures for applying cut points to mixed populations; (3) system suitability control criteria for in-study plate acceptance; (4) assay sensitivity, including the selection of an appropriate low positive control; (5) specificity, including drug and target tolerance; (6) sample stability that reflects sample storage and handling conditions; (7) assay selectivity to matrix components, including hemolytic, lipemic, and disease state matrices; (8) domain specificity for multi-domain therapeutics; (9) and minimum required dilution and extraction-based sample processing for titer reporting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (EliSpot) assay and its fluorescence-based version, FluoroSpot, are sensitive immunoassays commonly used to quantify antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes and other immune cells in peripheral blood or homogenized tissues. Due to their high sensitivity, these assays are popular in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy and vaccines, which involve a high level of scrutiny to ensure valid study results. Besides industry consensus white papers and other research publications, there is no formal guidance for the industry on how to validate EliSpot and FluoroSpot assays to ensure their accurate performance for immune monitoring in clinical trials. Herein, we describe a comprehensive in vitro study using healthy human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and model antigens to validate a double-color FluoroSpot assay for monitoring antigen-specific lymphocytes by detecting and quantifying IFN-γ and IL-2-producing lymphocytes. Validation parameters, acceptance criteria set-up, and assay limits—limit of detection (LOD), minimum positive control response, lower and upper limits of quantification (LLOQ and ULOQ)—were determined, and assay performance was demonstrated by assessing precision, specificity, linearity, and robustness. In addition, an inter-laboratory comparison demonstrated concordance between assay results from two laboratories. In summary, this study outlines a robust approach to EliSpot and FluoroSpot validation and demonstrates that the IFN-γ/IL-2 FluoroSpot assay is suitable for the reliable detection of antigen-specific immune responses from PBMC samples across laboratories and meets the current regulatory requirements for bioanalytical method validation.

    "abstract": "Metabolism-related liabilities continue to be a major cause of attrition for drug candidates in clinical development. Such problems may arise from the bioactivation of the parent compound to a reactive metabolite capable of modifying biological materials covalently or engaging in redox-cycling reactions leading to the formation of other toxicants. Alternatively, they may result from the formation of a major metabolite with systemic exposure and adverse pharmacological activity. To avert such problems, biotransformation studies are becoming increasingly important in guiding the refinement of a lead series during drug discovery and in characterizing lead candidates prior to clinical evaluation. This article provides an overview of the methods that are used to uncover metabolism-related liabilities in a pre-clinical setting and offers suggestions for reducing such liabilities via the modification of structural features that are used commonly in drug-like molecules.",

    "abstract": "Nasal administration of influenza vaccine has the potential to facilitate influenza control and prevention. However, when administered intranasally (i.n.), commercially available inactivated vaccines only generate systemic and mucosal immune responses if strong adjuvants are used, which are often associated with safety problems. We describe the successful use of a safe adjuvant Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles derived from the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis for i.n. vaccination with subunit influenza vaccine in mice. It is shown that simple admixing of the vaccine with the GEM particles results in a strongly enhanced immune response. Already after one booster, the i.n. delivered GEM subunit vaccine resulted in hemagglutination inhibition titers in serum at a level equal to the conventional intramuscular (i.m.) route. Moreover, i.n. immunization with GEM subunit vaccine elicited superior mucosal and Th1 skewed immune responses compared to those induced by i.m. and i.n. administered subunit vaccine alone. In conclusion, GEM particles act as a potent adjuvant for i.n. influenza immunization.",

    "abstract": "Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension. We investigated the effect of cyclosporine (Cs) and rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan and its metabolites ACT-132577 and ACT-373898 in healthy male subjects. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to investigate interactions between macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 with human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs). The clinical study (AC-055-111) was conducted as a two-part, one-sequence, crossover study. Ten subjects in each part received multiple-dose macitentan followed by multiple-dose co-administration of Cs (part A) or rifampin (part B). In the presence of Cs, steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time profiles during a dose interval (AUC(τ)) for macitentan and ACT-373898 increased 10% and 7%, respectively, and decreased 3% for ACT-132577. Steady-state AUC(τ) of macitentan and ACT-373898 in the presence of rifampin decreased 79% and 64%, respectively. For ACT-132577, no relevant difference in AUC(τ) between the two treatments was observed. Macitentan co-administered with Cs or rifampin was well tolerated. The complementary in vitro studies demonstrated no marked differences in uptake rates of macitentan and ACT-132577 between the wild-type and OATP over-expressing cells over the concentration range tested. Concomitant treatment with Cs did not have any clinically relevant effect on the exposure to macitentan or its metabolites, at steady-state. Concomitant treatment with rifampin reduced significantly the exposure to macitentan and its metabolite ACT-373898 at steady-state but did not affect the exposure to the active metabolite ACT-132577 to a clinically relevant extent.",

    "abstract": "Trumenba (bivalent rLP2086) is a vaccine licensed for the prevention of meningococcal meningitis disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (NmB) in individuals 10–25 years of age in the USA. The vaccine is composed of two factor H binding protein (fHbp) variants that were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli as native lipoproteins: rLP2086-A05 and rLP2086-B01. The vaccine was shown to induce potent bactericidal antibodies against a broad range of NmB isolates expressing fHbp that were different in sequence from the fHbp vaccine antigens. Here, we describe the characterization of the vaccine antigens including the elucidation of their structure which is characterized by two distinct motifs, the polypeptide domain and the N-terminal lipid moiety. In the vaccine formulation, the lipoproteins self-associate to form micelles driven by the hydrophobicity of the lipids and limited by the size of the folded polypeptides. The micelles help to increase the structural stability of the lipoproteins in the absence of bacterial cell walls. Analysis of the lipoproteins in Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation assays revealed their TLR2 agonist activity. This activity was lost with removal of the O-linked fatty acids, similar to removal of all lipids, demonstrating that this moiety plays an adjuvant role in immune activation. The thorough understanding of the structure and function of each moiety of the lipoproteins, as well as their relationship, lays the foundation for identifying critical parameters to guide vaccine development and manufacture.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript represents the perspective of the Dissolution Analytical Working Group of the IQ Consortium. The intent of this manuscript is to highlight the challenges of, and to provide a recommendation on, the development of clinically relevant dissolution specifications (CRS) for immediate release (IR) solid oral dosage forms. A roadmap toward the development of CRS for IR products containing active ingredients with a non-narrow therapeutic window is discussed, within the context of mechanistic dissolution understanding, supported by in-human pharmacokinetic (PK) data. Two case studies present potential outcomes of following the CRS roadmap and setting dissolution specifications. These cases reveal some benefits and challenges of pursuing CRS with additional PK data, in light of current regulatory positions, including that of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who generally favor this approach, but with the understanding that both industry and regulatory agency perspectives are still evolving in this relatively new field. The CRS roadmap discussed in this manuscript also describes a way to develop clinically relevant dissolution specifications based primarily on dissolution data for batches used in pivotal clinical studies, acknowledging that not all IR product development efforts need to be supported by additional PK studies, albeit with the associated risk of potentially unnecessarily tight manufacturing controls. Recommendations are provided on what stages during the life cycle investment into in vivo studies may be valuable. Finally, the opportunities for CRS within the context of post-approval changes, Modeling and Simulation (M&S), and the application of biowaivers, are briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all bodily processes exhibit circadian rhythmicity. As a consequence, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a drug may also vary with time of day. The objective of this study was to investigate diurnal variation in processes that regulate drug concentrations in the brain, focusing on P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This efflux transporter limits the distribution of many drugs in the brain. To this end, the exposure to the P-gp substrate quinidine was determined in the plasma and brain tissue after intravenous administration in rats at six different time points over the 24-h period. Our results indicate that time of administration significantly affects the exposure to quinidine in the brain. Upon inhibition of P-gp, exposure to quinidine in brain tissue is constant over the 24-h period. To gain more insight into processes regulating brain concentrations, we used intracerebral microdialysis to determine the concentration of quinidine in brain extracellular fluid (ECF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after intravenous administration at two different time points. The data were analyzed by physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling using NONMEM. The model shows that the variation is due to higher activity of P-gp-mediated transport from the deep brain compartment to the plasma compartment during the active period. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that CSF flux is higher in the resting period compared to the active period. In conclusion, we show that the exposure to a P-gp substrate in the brain depends on time of administration, thereby providing a new strategy for drug targeting to the brain.",

    "abstract": "The similarity factor, f2, measures the sameness of dissolution profiles. The following commentary is an overview of discussions and presentations from a group of industry and US regulatory experts that have integrated the science and regulatory research and practice for assessing product performance, particularly for modified-release (MR) dosage forms, using f2. For a drug development sponsor or applicant with an orally complex dosage formulation, it is critical to understand dissolution methods and the similarity factor and how and/or when to apply it in their NDA, ANDA, or PMA submission. As part of any regulatory submission, it is critical to justify that the product performance has not been impacted by any change in the manufacturing process and/or the delayed and/or prolonged drug release characteristics compared to a similar conventional or another orally complex dosage form. The purposes of this document are (1) to provide a description of appropriate dissolution methods, how is the f2 calculated and how it can be used to justify product performance similarity, or not; (2) to provide an overview of alternative methods available for dissolution profile comparisons, and (3) to illustrate how applying these concepts in a focused way supports approval of submissions and regulatory dossiers and aligns them with on-going science and regulatory initiatives. A case study will be used as an example to demonstrate how dissolution testing and the f2 calculation results can impact regulatory outcomes from an NDA (505(b)(1)), NDA (505(b)(2)), ANDA (505(j)), supplemental NDAs/ANDAs, or PMA perspective.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling has become increasingly important in pharmaceutical research and development, and is a powerful tool to gain mechanistic insights into the complex dynamics of biological systems in response to drug treatment. However, even once a suitable mathematical framework to describe the pathophysiology and mechanisms of interest is established, final model calibration and the exploration of variability can be challenging and time consuming. QSP models are often formulated as multi-scale, multi-compartment nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. Commonly accepted modeling strategies, workflows, and tools have promise to greatly improve the efficiency of QSP methods and improve productivity. In this paper, we present the QSP Toolbox, a set of functions, structure array conventions, and class definitions that computationally implement critical elements of QSP workflows including data integration, model calibration, and variability exploration. We present the application of the toolbox to an ordinary differential equations-based model for antibody drug conjugates. As opposed to a single stepwise reference model calibration, the toolbox also facilitates simultaneous parameter optimization and variation across multiple in vitro, in vivo, and clinical assays to more comprehensively generate alternate mechanistic hypotheses that are in quantitative agreement with available data. The toolbox also includes scripts for developing and applying virtual populations to mechanistic exploration of biomarkers and efficacy. We anticipate that the QSP Toolbox will be a useful resource that will facilitate implementation, evaluation, and sharing of new methodologies in a common framework that will greatly benefit the community.",

    "abstract": "To guide developers of innovative and generic drug products that contain nanomaterials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the draft guidance for industry titled: \"Drug Products, Including Biological Products, that Contain Nanomaterials\" in December 2017. During the AAPS Guidance Forum on September 11, 2018, participants from industry, academia, and regulatory bodies discussed this draft guidance in an open setting. Two questions raised by the AAPS membership were discussed in more detail: what is the appropriate regulatory pathway for approval of drug products containing nanomaterials, and how to determine critical quality attributes (CQAs) for nanomaterials? During the meeting, clarification was provided on how the new FDA center-led guidance relates to older, specific nanomaterial class, or specific product-related guidances. The lively discussions concluded with some clear observations and recommendations: (I) Important lessons can be learned from how CQAs were determined for, e.g., biologics. (II) Publication of ongoing scientific discussions on strategies and studies determining CQAs of drug products containing nanomaterials will significantly strengthen the science base on this topic. Furthermore, (III) alignment on a global level on how to address new questions regarding nanomedicine development protocols will add to efficient development and approval of these much needed candidate nanomedicines (innovative and generic). Public meetings such as the AAPS Guidance Forum may serve as the place to have these discussions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in our understanding of the intestinal stem cell niche and the role of key signaling pathways on cell growth and maintenance have allowed the development of fully differentiated epithelial cells in 3D organoids. Stem cell-derived organoids carry significant levels of proteins that are natively expressed in the gut and have important roles in drug transport and metabolism. They are, therefore, particularly relevant to study the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of oral medications. In addition, organoids have the potential to serve as a robust preclinical model for demonstrating the effectiveness of new drugs more rapidly, with more certainty, and at lower costs compared with live animal studies. Importantly, because they are derived from individuals with different genotypes, environmental risk factors and drug sensitivity profiles, organoids are a highly relevant screening system for personalized therapy in both human and veterinary medicine. Lastly, and in the context of patient-specific congenital diseases, orthotopic transplantation of engineered organoids could repair and/or replace damaged epithelial tissues reported in various GI diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, and tuft enteropathy. Ongoing translational research on organoids derived from dogs with naturally occurring digestive disorders has the potential to improve the predictability of preclinical models used for optimizing the therapeutic management of severe chronic enteropathies in human patients.",

However, regulatory guidelines and examples of late-stage clinical trial applications in the literature are lacking. This paper communicates Merck's strategy for the implementation of DBS exemplified by experience on a late-stage program (MK-8931). In this program, DBS was proposed as the sole matrix for phase 3 studies to decrease logistical burden in an aging target patient population (Alzheimer's disease). In vitro and bioanalytical tests demonstrated initial method feasibility and suitability for further evaluations in the clinic. An in vivo dataset was developed initially in healthy subjects (phase 1 study) and then in patients (phase 2/3 study) to establish a quantitative relationship between the blood and plasma concentrations (bridging dataset) using descriptive and population PK analyses. This allowed for PK conclusions to be seamlessly drawn across the clinical program without impact from the choice of matrix. This integrated information package (in vitro, bioanalytical and clinical) was presented to major regulatory agencies (FDA and EMA) for regulatory input. Based on this package, regulatory concurrence was gained on accepting DBS as the sole matrix in late-stage clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "For sugars to act as successful stabilizers of proteins during lyophilization and subsequent storage, they need to have several characteristics. One of them is that they need to be able to form interactions with the protein and for that miscibility is essential. To evaluate the influence of protein-sugar miscibility on protein storage stability, model protein IgG was lyophilized in the presence of various sugars of different molecular weight. By comparing solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy relaxation times of both protein and sugar on two different timescales, i.e., 1H T1 and 1H T1ρ, miscibility of the two components was established on a 2–5- and a 20–50-nm length scale, respectively, and related to protein storage stability. Smaller sugars showed better miscibility with IgG, and the tendency of IgG to aggregate during storage was lower for smaller sugars. The largest sugar performed worst and was phase separated on both length scales. Additionally, shorter protein 1H T1 relaxation times correlated with higher aggregation rates during storage. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay showed overlapping effects of aggregation and chemical degradation and did not correspond as well with the miscibility. Because of the small scale at which miscibility was determined (2–5 nm) and the size of the protein domains (∼2.5 × 2.5 × 5 nm), the miscibility data give an indirect measure of interaction between protein and sugar. This reduced interaction could be the result of steric hindrance, providing a possible explanation as to why smaller sugars show better miscibility and storage stability with the protein.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Three global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods (Morris, Sobol and extended Sobol) are applied to a minimal physiologically based PK (mPBPK) model using three model drugs given orally, namely quinidine, alprazolam, and midazolam. We investigated how correlations among input parameters affect the determination of the key parameters influencing pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of general interest, i.e., the maximal plasma concentration ( C max ) time at which C max is reached ( T max ), and area under plasma concentration (AUC). The influential parameters determined by the Morris and Sobol methods (suitable for independent model parameters) were compared to those determined by the extended Sobol method (which considers model parameter correlations). For the three drugs investigated, the Morris method was as informative as the Sobol method. The extended Sobol method identified different sets of influential parameters to Morris and Sobol. These methods overestimated the influence of volume of distribution at steady state ( V ss ) on AUC24h for quinidine and alprazolam. They also underestimated the effect of volume of liver ( V liver ) for all three drugs, the impact of enzyme intrinsic clearance of CYP2C9 and CYP2E1 for quinidine, and that of UGT1A4 abundance for midazolam. Our investigation showed that the interpretation of GSA results is not straightforward. Dismissing existing model parameter correlations, GSA methods such as Morris and Sobol can lead to biased determination of the key parameters for the selected outputs of interest. Decisions regarding parameters’ influence (or otherwise) should be made in light of available knowledge including the model assumptions, GSA method limitations, and inter-correlations between model parameters, particularly in complex models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this review article is to summarize literature data pertinent to potential excipient effects on intestinal drug permeability and transit. Despite the use of excipients in drug products for decades, considerable research efforts have been directed towards evaluating their potential effects on drug bioavailability. Potential excipient concerns stem from drug formulation changes (e.g., scale-up and post-approval changes, development of a new generic product). Regulatory agencies have established in vivo bioequivalence standards and, as a result, may waive the in vivo requirement, known as a biowaiver, for some oral products. Biowaiver acceptance criteria are based on the in vitro characterization of the drug substance and drug product using the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). Various regulatory guidance documents have been issued regarding BCS-based biowaivers, such that the current FDA guidance is more restrictive than prior guidance, specifically about excipient risk. In particular, sugar alcohols have been identified as potential absorption-modifying excipients. These biowaivers and excipient risks are discussed here.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This manuscript represents the view of the Dissolution Working Group of the IQ Consortium on the challenges of and recommendations on solubility measurements and development of dissolution methods for immediate release (IR) solid oral dosage forms formulated with amorphous solid dispersions. Nowadays, numerous compounds populate the industrial pipeline as promising drug candidates yet suffer from low aqueous solubility. In the oral drug product development process, solubility along with permeability is a key determinant to assure sufficient drug absorption along the intestinal tract. Formulating the drug candidate as an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) is one potential option to address this issue. These formulations demonstrate the rapid onset of drug dissolution and can achieve supersaturated concentrations, which poses significant challenges to appropriately characterize solubility and develop quality control dissolution methods. This review strives to categorize the different dissolution and solubility challenges for ASD associated with 3 different topics: (i) definition of solubility and sink conditions for ASD dissolution, (ii) applications and development of non-sink dissolution (according to conventional definition) for ASD formulation screening and QC method development, and (iii) the advantages and disadvantages of using dissolution in detecting crystallinity in ASD formulations. Related to these challenges, successful examples of dissolution experiments in the context of control strategies are shared and may lead as an example for scientific consensus concerning dissolution testing of ASD.",

    "abstract": "While the concept of 'Virtual Bioequivalence' (VBE) using a combination of modelling, in vitro tests and integration of pre-existing data on systems and drugs is growing from its infancy, building confidence on VBE outcomes requires demonstration of its ability not only in predicting formulation-dependent systemic exposure but also the expected degree of population variability. The concept of variation influencing the outcome of BE, despite being hidden with the cross-over nature of common BE studies, becomes evident when dealing with the acceptance criteria that consider the 90% confidence interval (CI) around the relative bioavailability. Hence, clinical studies comparing a reference product against itself may fail due to within-subject variations associated with the two occasions that the individual receives the same formulation. In this proof-of-concept study, we offer strategies to capture the most realistic predictions of CI around the pharmacokinetic parameters by propagating physiological variations through physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling. The exercise indicates feasibility of the approach based on comparisons made between the simulated and observed WSV of pharmacokinetic parameters tested for a clinical bioequivalence case study. However, it also indicates that capturing WSV of a large array of physiological parameters using backward translation modelling from repeated BE studies of reference products would require a diverse set of drugs and formulations. The current case study of delayed-release formulation of posaconazole was able to declare certain combinations of WSV of physiological parameters as 'not plausible'. The eliminated sets of WSV values would be applicable to PBPK models of other drugs and formulations. Graphical Abstract.",

The recent approvals of Luxturna® and Zolgensma® prove that recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-based gene therapy is a transformative modality that enables curative treatment for genetic disorders. Over the last decade, Takeda has accumulated significant experience with rAAV-based gene therapies, especially in the early stage of development. In this review, based on the learnings from Takeda and publicly available information, we aim to provide a guiding perspective on Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK) substantial role in advancing therapeutic gene therapy modalities from nonclinical research to clinical development, in particular the characterization of gene therapy product biodistribution, elimination (shedding), immunogenicity assessment, multiple platform bioanalytical assays, and first-in-human (FIH) dose projection strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A crucial step in lead selection during drug development is accurate estimation and optimization of hepatic clearance using in vitro methods. However, current methods are limited by factors such as lack of physiological relevance, short culture/incubation times that are not consistent with drug exposure patterns in patients, use of drug absorbing materials, and evaporation during long-term incubation. To address these technological needs, we developed a novel milli-fluidic human liver tissue chip (LTC) that was designed with continuous media recirculation and optimized for hepatic cultures using human primary hepatocytes. Here, we characterized the LTC using a series of physiologically relevant metrics and test compounds to demonstrate that we could accurately predict the PK of both low- and high-clearance compounds. The non-biological characterization indicated that the cyclic olefin copolymer (COC)–based LTC exhibited negligible evaporation and minimal non-specific binding of drugs of varying ionic states and lipophilicity. Biologically, the LTC exhibited functional and polarized hepatic culture with sustained metabolic CYP activity for at least 15 days. This long-term culture was then used for drug clearance studies for low- and high-clearance compounds for at least 12 days, and clearance was estimated for a range of compounds with high in vitro - in vivo correlation (IVIVC). We also demonstrated that LTC can be induced by rifampicin, and the culture age had insignificant effect on depletion kinetic and predicted clearance value. Thus, we used advances in bioengineering to develop a novel purpose-built platform with high reproducibility and minimal variability to address unmet needs for PK applications. Graphical Abstract",

The workshop was organized into lectures and breakout sessions. Three common topics that were re-visited by various lecturers were amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), dissolution/permeation interplay, and in vitro methods to predict in vivo biopharmaceutics performance and risk. Topics that repeatedly surfaced across breakout sessions were the following: (1) meaning and assessment of \"dissolved drug,\" particularly of poorly water soluble drug in colloidal environments (e.g., fed conditions, ASDs); (2) potential limitations of a test that employs sink conditions for a poorly water soluble drug; (3) non-compendial methods (e.g., two-stage or multi-stage method, dissolution/permeation methods); (4) non-compendial conditions (e.g., apex vessels, non-sink conditions); and (5) potential benefit of having both a quality control method for batch release and a biopredictive/biorelevant method for biowaiver or bridging scenarios. An identified obstacle to non-compendial methods is the uncertainty of global regulatory acceptance of such methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract mRNA vaccines can be translated into protein antigens, in vivo , to effectively induce humoral and cellular immunity against these proteins. While current mRNA vaccines have generated potent immune responses, the need for ultracold storage conditions (− 80 °C) and healthcare professionals to administer the vaccine through the parenteral route has somewhat limited their distribution in rural areas and developing countries. Overcoming these challenges stands to transform future deployment of mRNA vaccines. In this study, we developed an mRNA vaccine that can trigger a systemic immune response through administration via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is stable at 4 °C. A library of cationic branched poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE) polymers was synthesized and characterized, from which a polymer with high intracellular mRNA delivery efficiency and immune stimulation capacity was down-selected. mRNA vaccines made with the lead polymer-elicited cellular and humoral immunity in mice. Furthermore, lyophilization conditions of the formulation were optimized to enable storage under refrigeration. Our results suggest that PBAE nanoparticles are potent mRNA delivery platforms that can elicit B cell and T cell activation, including antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses. This system can serve as an easily administrable, potent oral mRNA vaccine. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Protein aggregates and particles in biopharmaceuticals can induce adverse immune responses in patients. Thus, suppression of the formation of protein aggregates and particles is important for the successful development of therapeutic proteins. Mechanical stresses, including agitation, are widely recognized as stress factors that generate protein aggregates and particles. However, although refrigerators and storage chambers generate weak vibration, there have been no studies of the impact of such weak vibration on aggregate and particle formation during storage. In this study, monomer loss and aggregate formation of a CTLA4-Ig were evaluated during storage in a refrigerator (having a vibration acceleration less than 0.006 G) with or without three vibration isolators. The vibration isolators reduced the vibration acceleration, thereby decreasing the rate of monomer loss and nanometer-sized aggregate formation. The increase in the aggregation rate due to the weak vibration was not mitigated by adding poloxamer 188 or eliminating the air–liquid interface, which are processes known to be effective in preventing protein aggregation due to mechanical stresses. Thus, reducing vibration should be an effective way to mitigate the risk of aggregate formation. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Friedreich’s ataxia is a rare, progressive, genetic disorder, the root cause of which is a significant deficiency in the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Frataxin is ubiquitously expressed, but its deficiency results in a variety of debilitating symptoms, with disease severity, rate of progression and age of onset inversely correlating with tissue frataxin levels. Nomlabofusp is a novel cell penetrant peptide based recombinant fusion protein designed to enter cells and deliver human FXN into the mitochondria. Using immunofluorescence staining and western blot we show that frataxin delivered by nomlabofusp is detected in the mitochondria of H9c2 and SH-SY5Y cells. Also in these cells, and in C2C12 and HEK293 cells, we demonstrate the presence of mature frataxin after nomlabofusp exposure. Finally, using buccal swab tissue samples taken from study subjects in a Phase 1 clinical trial who received nomlabofusp, we show increases in mature frataxin levels along with marked changes in gene expression post-administration suggesting intracellular pharmacodynamic activity. Together, these results demonstrate that nomlabofusp enters the cell and localizes to the mitochondria, releasing mature frataxin that appears to be biologically active and support the use of nomlabofusp as a potential treatment for patients with Friedreich’s ataxia.

    "abstract": "Stockpiling of pre-pandemic influenza vaccines guarantees immediate vaccine availability to counteract an emerging pandemic. Generally, influenza vaccines need to be stored and handled refrigerated to prevent thermal degradation of the antigenic component. Requirement of a cold-chain, however, complicates stockpiling and the logistics of vaccine distribution. We, therefore, investigated the effect of elevated storage temperatures on the immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic influenza A H5N1 whole inactivated virus vaccine. Either suspended in liquid or kept as a freeze-dried powder, vaccines could be stored for 1 year at ambient temperature (20°C) with minimal loss of immunogenicity in mice. Elevation of the storage temperature to 40°C, however, resulted in a significant loss of immunogenic potency within 3 months if vaccines were stored in liquid suspension. In sharp contrast, freeze-dried powder formulations were stable at 40°C for at least 3 months. The presence of inulin or trehalose sugar excipients during freeze-drying of the vaccine proved to be critical to maintain its immunogenic potency during storage, and to preserve the characteristic Th1-type response to whole inactivated virus vaccine. These results indicate that whole inactivated virus vaccines may be stored and handled at room temperature in moderate climate zones for over a year with minimal decline and, if converted to dry-powder, even in hot climate zones for at least 3 months. The increased stability of dry-powder vaccine at 40°C may also point to an extended shelf-life when stored at 4°C. Use of the more stable dry-powder formulation could simplify stockpiling and thereby facilitating successful pandemic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Advanced prostate cancer has significant long-term morbidity, and there is a growing interest in alternative and complimentary forms of therapy that will improve the outcomes of patients. Azadirachta indica (common name: neem) contains multiple active compounds that have potent anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. The present study investigates the novel targets of the anticancer activity of ethanol extract of neem leaves (EENL) in vitro and evaluates the in vivo efficacy in the prostate cancer models. Analysis of the components in the EENL by mass spectrometry suggests the presence of 2',3'-dehydrosalannol, 6-desacetyl nimbinene, and nimolinone. Treatment of C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer cells with EENL inhibited the cell proliferation. Genome-wide expression profiling, using oligonucleotide microarrays, revealed genes differentially expressed with EENL treatment in prostate cancer cells. Functional analysis unveiled that most of the up-regulated genes were associated with cell death, and drug metabolism, and the down-regulated genes were associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination, and repair functions. Quantitative PCR confirmed significant up-regulation of 40 genes and immunoblotting revealed increase in the protein expression levels of HMOX1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1B10. EENL treatment inhibited the growth of C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. The suppression of tumor growth is associated with the formation of hyalinized fibrous tumor tissue and the induction of cell death by apoptosis. These results suggest that EENL-containing natural bioactive compounds could have potent anticancer property and the regulation of multiple cellular pathways could exert pleiotrophic effects in prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant human PH20 hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is used to facilitate dispersion of subcutaneously delivered fluids and drugs. This report summarizes rHuPH20 immunogenicity findings from clinical trials where rHuPH20 was co-administered with SC human immunoglobulin, trastuzumab, rituximab, or insulin. Plasma samples were obtained from evaluable subjects participating in ten different clinical trials as well as from healthy plasma donors. A bridging immunoassay and a modified hyaluronidase activity assay were used to determine rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers and neutralizing antibodies, respectively. rHuPH20-binding antibody populations from selected subjects with positive titers were affinity-purified and subjected to further characterization such as cross-reactivity with endogenous PH20. Among individual trials, the prevalence of pre-existing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies varied between 3 and 12%, excepting the primary immunodeficiency (PID) studies. Incidence of treatment-induced rHuPH20 antibodies was 2 to 18%, with the highest titers (81,920) observed in PID. No neutralizing antibodies were observed. Within most trials, the kinetics of antibody responses were comparable between pre-existing and treatment-induced antibody responses, although responses classified as persistent were more common in subjects with pre-existing titers. There was no association between antibody positivity and either local or systemic adverse events. Pre-existing and treatment-induced antibody populations were of similar immunoglobulin isotypes and cross-reacted to endogenous PH20 to similar extents. No cross-reactivity to PH20 paralogs was detected. rHuPH20 induces only modest immunogenicity which has no association with adverse events. In addition, antibodies purified from baseline-positive individuals are qualitatively similar to those purified from individuals developing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies following exposure to the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Altered pharmacokinetics of antibody drugs has been reported in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). We aim to evaluate bevacizumab pharmacokinetics in AGC from the Phase III trial (AVAGAST), and explore the influence of patient variables. Bevacizumab concentrations (Cp) were measured in plasma samples taken following disease progression from 162 patients (7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Predicted Cp [median and 90% prediction interval] was simulated using the population pharmacokinetic model established for other cancers (PPK model) and compared to observed Cp. Bevacizumab clearance was estimated using NONMEM and compared between subgroups. Patient characteristics of AGC are similar to other cancers except for lower body weight despite higher percentage of males. Eighty-five percent of observed Cp was below the median predicted Cp and 38% below the lower boundary of the 90% prediction interval. Median bevacizumab clearance in AGC was 4.5 versus 3 mL/day/kg in other cancers. Bevacizumab clearance was significantly faster (p < 0.05) in patients without gastrectomy (n = 42) or lower albumin. Clearance appeared to be faster in patients with lower total protein, higher ECOG scores, more metastatic sites, and poorer response. No significant difference in bevacizumab concentrations and clearance was observed between Asian and Non-Asian patients. AGC patients exhibited significantly lower bevacizumab exposure due to an approximate 50% increase in clearance versus other cancers. Bevacizumab is cleared faster in patients without prior gastrectomy. No significant difference in bevacizumab pharmacokinetics was observed between Asian and Non-Asian patients. The underlying mechanism for faster bevacizumab clearance in AGC is unknown and warrants further research.",

    "abstract": "The programme for the 2015 AAPS Annual Meeting and Exhibition (Orlando, FL; 25–29 October 2015) included a sunrise session presenting an overview of the state-of-the-art tools for in vitro–in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) and mechanistic prediction of renal drug disposition. These concepts are based on approaches developed for prediction of hepatic clearance, with consideration of scaling factors physiologically relevant to kidney and the unique and complex structural organisation of this organ. Physiologically relevant kidney models require a number of parameters for mechanistic description of processes, supported by quantitative information on renal physiology (system parameters) and in vitro/in silico drug-related data. This review expands upon the themes raised during the session and highlights the importance of high quality in vitro drug data generated in appropriate experimental setup and robust system-related information for successful IVIVE of renal drug disposition. The different in vitro systems available for studying renal drug metabolism and transport are summarised and recent developments involving state-of-the-art technologies highlighted. Current gaps and uncertainties associated with system parameters related to human kidney for the development of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and quantitative prediction of renal drug disposition, excretion, and/or metabolism are identified.",

    "abstract": "Despite the enormous research efforts that have been put into the development of central nervous system (CNS) drugs, the success rate in this area is still disappointing. To increase the successful rate in the clinical trials, first the problem of predicting human CNS drug distribution should be solved. As it is the unbound drug that equilibrates over membranes and is able to interact with targets, especially knowledge on unbound extracellular drug concentration-time profiles in different CNS compartments is important. The only technique able to provide such information in vivo is microdialysis. Also, obtaining CNS drug distribution data from human subjects is highly limited, and therefore, we have to rely on preclinical approaches combined with physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, taking unbound drug CNS concentrations into account. The next step is then to link local CNS pharmacokinetics to target interaction kinetics and CNS drug effects. In this review, system properties and small-molecule drug properties that together govern CNS drug distribution are summarized. Furthermore, the currently available approaches on prediction of CNS pharmacokinetics are discussed, including in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, and in silico approaches, with special focus on the powerful combination of in vivo microdialysis and PBPK modeling. Also, sources of variability on drug kinetics in the CNS are discussed. Finally, remaining gaps and challenges are highlighted and future directions are suggested.",

    "abstract": "The prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is of extraordinary significance to modern drug discovery in terms of suggesting new drug candidates and repositioning old drugs. Despite technological advances, large-scale experimental determination of DTIs is still expensive and laborious. Effective and low-cost computational alternatives remain in strong need. Meanwhile, open-access resources have been rapidly growing with massive amount of bioactivity data becoming available, creating unprecedented opportunities for the development of novel in silico models for large-scale DTI prediction. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art computational approaches for identifying DTIs from a data-centric perspective: what the underlying data are and how they are utilized in each study. We also summarize popular public data resources and online tools for DTI prediction. It is found that various types of data were employed including properties of chemical structures, drug therapeutic effects and side effects, drug-target binding, drug-drug interactions, bioactivity data of drug molecules across multiple biological targets, and drug-induced gene expressions. More often, the heterogeneous data were integrated to offer better performance. However, challenges remain such as handling data imbalance, incorporating negative samples and quantitative bioactivity data, as well as maintaining cross-links among different data sources, which are essential for large-scale and automated information integration.",

    "abstract": "Leading regulatory agencies recommend biosimilar assessment to proceed in a stepwise fashion, starting with a detailed analytical comparison of the structural and functional properties of the proposed biosimilar and reference product. The degree of analytical similarity determines the degree of residual uncertainty that must be addressed through downstream in vivo studies. Substantive evidence of similarity from comprehensive analytical testing may justify a targeted clinical development plan, and thus enable a shorter path to licensing. The importance of a careful design of the analytical similarity study program therefore should not be underestimated. Designing a state-of-the-art analytical similarity study meeting current regulatory requirements in regions such as the USA and EU requires a methodical approach, consisting of specific steps that far precede the work on the actual analytical study protocol. This white paper discusses scientific and methodological considerations on the process of attribute and test method selection, criticality assessment, and subsequent assignment of analytical measures to US FDA's three tiers of analytical similarity assessment. Case examples of selection of critical quality attributes and analytical methods for similarity exercises are provided to illustrate the practical implementation of the principles discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has recently drawn remarkable attention as promising results in the clinic have shown its ability to improve the overall survival, and T cells are considered to be one of the primary effectors for cancer immunotherapy. Enhanced and restored T cell tumoricidal activity has shown great potential for killing cancer cells. Bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs) are a growing class of molecules that are designed to bind two different antigens on the surface of T cells and cancer cells to bring them in close proximity and selectively activate effector T cells to kill target cancer cells. New T cell engagers are being investigated for the treatment of solid tumors. The activity of newly developed T cell engagers showed a strong correlation with tumor target antigen expression. However, the correlation between tumor-associated antigen expression and overall response of cancer patients is poorly understood. In this study, we used a well-calibrated quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model extended to bispecific T cell engagers to explore their efficacy and identify potential biomarkers. In principle, patient-specific response can be predicted through this model according to each patient’s individual characteristics. This extended QSP model has been calibrated with available experimental data and provides predictions of patients’ response to TCE treatment.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication and play a crucial role in cellular physiology. The role of exosomes in cancer has been widely explored. Tumor cells have evolved and adapted to evade the immune response. The study of the immune system's modulations in favor of rogue tumor cells led to the development of a novel immunotherapeutic strategy targeting the immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). In clinical settings, the response to ICP therapy has been inconsistent and is difficult to predict. Quantitating the targeted ICPs through immunohistochemistry is one approach, but is not pragmatic in a clinical setting and is often not sensitive. Examining the molecules present in bodily fluids to determine ICP treatment response, \"liquid biopsy\" is a convenient alternative. The term \"liquid biopsy\" refers to circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), non-coding (nc) RNA, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating free DNA (cfDNA), etc. EVs includes exosomes, microvesicles, and oncosomes. Herein, we focus on exosomes isolated from bodily fluids and their use in liquid biopsy. Due to their unique ability to transfer bioactive molecules and perturb the physiology of recipient cells, exosomes have garnered attention for their immune modulation role and as a resource to identify molecules associated with liquid biopsy-based diagnostic methods. In this review, we examine the putative role of exosomes and their cargo in influencing the immune system. We discuss the immune and tumor cells present in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the exosomes derived from these cells to understand how they participate in creating the immune-suppressive TME. Additionally, use of exosomes in liquid biopsy-based methods to measure the treatment response elicited by immunotherapy is discussed. Finally, we describe how exosomes have been used to develop immune therapies, especially cell-free vaccines, for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drug development for the central nervous system (CNS) is a complex endeavour with low success rates, as the structural complexity of the brain and specifically the blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses tremendous challenges. Several in vitro brain systems have been evaluated, but the ultimate use of these data in terms of translation to human brain concentration profiles remains to be fully developed. Thus, linking up in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) strategies to physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models of brain is a useful effort that allows better prediction of drug concentrations in CNS components. Such models may overcome some known aspects of inter-species differences in CNS drug disposition. Required physiological (i.e. systems) parameters in the model are derived from quantitative values in each organ. However, due to the inability to directly measure brain concentrations in humans, compound-specific (drug) parameters are often obtained from in silico or in vitro studies. Such data are translated through IVIVE which could be also applied to preclinical in vivo observations. In such exercises, the limitations of the assays and inter-species differences should be adequately understood in order to verify these predictions with the observed concentration data. This report summarizes the state of IVIVE-PBPK-linked models and discusses shortcomings and areas of further research for better prediction of CNS drug disposition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The recent detection of potent carcinogenic nitrosamine impurities in several human medicines has triggered product recalls and interrupted the supply of critical medications for hundreds of millions of patients, illuminating the need for increased testing of nitrosamines in pharmaceutical products. However, the development of analytical methods for nitrosamine detection is challenging due to high sensitivity requirements, complex matrices, and the large number and variety of samples requiring testing. Herein, we report an analytical method for the analysis of a common nitrosamine, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), in pharmaceutical products using full evaporation static headspace gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorous detection (FE-SHSGC-NPD). This method is sensitive, specific, accurate, and precise and has the potential to serve as a universal method for testing all semi-volatile nitrosamines across different drug products. Through elimination of the detrimental headspace-liquid partition, a quantitation limit of 0.25 ppb is achieved for NDMA, a significant improvement upon traditional LC-MS methods. The extraction of nitrosamines directly from solid sample not only simplifies the sample preparation procedure but also enables the method to be used for different products as is or with minor modifications, as demonstrated by the analysis of NDMA in 10+ pharmaceutical products. The in situ nitrosation that is commonly observed in GC methods for nitrosamine analysis was completely inhibited by the addition of a small volume solvent containing pyrogallol, phosphoric acid, and isopropanol. Employing simple procedures and low-cost instrumentation, this method can be implemented in any analytical laboratory for routine nitrosamine analysis, ensuring patient safety and uninterrupted supply of critical medications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recalls of some batches of metformin have occurred due to the detection of N -nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in amounts above the acceptable intake (AI) of 96 ng per day. Prior to the recalls, an international regulatory laboratory network had been monitoring drugs for nitrosamine impurities with each laboratory independently developing and validating multiple analytical procedures to detect and measure nitrosamines in metformin drugs used in their jurisdictions. Here, we provide an overview of the analysis of metformin active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and drug products with 1090 samples (875 finished dosage forms (FDFs) and 215 API samples) tested beginning in November of 2019 through July of 2020. Samples were obtained internationally by a variety of approaches, including purchased, received from firms via information requests or selected by regional regulatory authorities (either at wholesalers or during GMP inspections). Only one nitrosamine (NDMA) was detected and was only present in some batches of metformin products. For API samples, 213 out of 215 lots tested had no measurable level of NDMA. For FDF samples tested, the number of batches with NDMA above the AI amount for patient safety was 17.8% (156/875). Based on these data, although the presence of NDMA was of concern, 82.2% of the samples of metformin drug products tested met quality and safety standards for patients. Regulatory agencies continue to collaborate extensively and work with marketing authorization holders to understand root causes of nitrosamine formation and agree on corrective actions to mitigate the presence of NDMA in future metformin batches.

    "abstract": "Abstract During biotherapeutic drug development, immunogenicity is evaluated by measuring anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The presence and magnitude of ADA responses is assessed using a multi-tier workflow where samples are screened, confirmed, and titered. Recent reports suggest that the assay signal to noise ratio ( S / N ) obtained during the screening tier correlates well with titer. To determine whether S / N could more broadly replace titer, anonymized ADA data from a consortium of sponsors was collected and analyzed. Datasets from clinical programs with therapeutics of varying immunogenicity risk levels (low to high), common ADA assay platforms (ELISA and MSD) and formats (bridging, direct, solid-phase extraction with acid dissociation), and titration approaches (endpoint and interpolated) were included in the analysis. A statistically significant correlation between S / N and titer was observed in all datasets, with a strong correlation (Spearman’s r &gt; 0.8) in 11 out of 15 assays (73%). For assays with available data, conclusions regarding ADA impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were similar using S / N or titer. Subject ADA kinetic profiles were also comparable using the two measurements. Determination of antibody boosting in patients with pre-existing responses could be accomplished using similar approaches for titer and S / N . Investigation of factors that impacted the accuracy of ADA magnitude measurements revealed advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. In general, S / N had superior precision and ability to detect potentially low affinity/avidity responses compared to titer. This analysis indicates that S / N could serve as an equivalent and in some cases preferable alternative to titer for assessing ADA magnitude and evaluation of impact on clinical responses.

Ritonavir is coadministered as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. However, ritonavir may cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due to its interactions with various drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein transporters. To better understand the extent of DDIs (or lack thereof) of nirmatrelvir; ritonavir in a clinical setting, this study used real-world evidence (RWE) from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database to identify the top 100 drugs most commonly prescribed to US patients at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 disease. The top 100 drugs were identified based on total counts associated with drugs prescribed to high-risk patients (i.e., ≥ 1 medical condition associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19) who were continuously enrolled in the database throughout 2019 and had ≥ 1 prescription claim. Each of the 100 drugs was then assessed for DDI risk based on their metabolism, excretion, and transport pathways identified from available US prescribing and medical literature sources. Seventy drugs identified were not expected to have DDIs with nirmatrelvir; ritonavir, including many cardiovascular agents, anti-infectives, antidiabetic agents, and antidepressants. Conversely, 30 drugs, including corticosteroids, narcotic analgesics, anticoagulants, statins, and sedatives/hypnotics, were expected to cause DDIs with nirmatrelvir; ritonavir. This RWE analysis is complementary to the prescribing information and other DDI management tools for guiding healthcare providers in managing DDIs.",

Despite recent improvements to purification processes, biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, enzyme replacement therapies, and vaccines that are manufactured in a range of cell lines and purified using diverse processes may contain HCP impurities, making it necessary for developers to identify and quantify impurities during process development for each drug product. HCPs that contain sequences that are less conserved with human homologs may be more immunogenic than those that are more conserved. We have developed a computational tool, ISPRI-HCP, that estimates the immunogenic potential of HCP sequences by evaluating and quantifying T cell epitope density and relative conservation with similar T cell epitopes in the human proteome. Here we describe several case studies that support the use of this method for classifying candidate HCP impurities according to their immunogenicity risk. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is generally believed that bioavailability ( F ) calculated based on systemic concentration area under the curve (AUC) measurements cannot exceed 1.0, yet some published studies report this inconsistency. We teach and believe, based on differential equation derivations, that rate of absorption has no influence on measured systemic clearance following an oral dose, i.e., determined as available dose divided by AUC. Previously, it was thought that any difference in calculating F from urine data versus that from systemic concentration AUC data was due to the inability to accurately measure urine data. A PubMed literature search for drugs exhibiting F &gt; 1.0 and studies for which F was measured using both AUC and urinary excretion dose-corrected analyses yielded data for 35 drugs. We show and explain, using Kirchhoff’s Laws, that these universally held concepts concerning bioavailability may not be valid in all situations. Bioavailability, determined using systemic concentration measurements, for many drugs may be overestimated since AUC reflects not only systemic elimination but also absorption rate characteristics, which is most easily seen for renal clearance measures. Clearance of drug from the absorption site must be significantly greater than clearance following an iv bolus dose for F(AUC) to correctly correspond with F(urine). The primary purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that studies resulting in F &gt; 1.0 and/or greater systemic vs urine bioavailability predictions may be accurate. Importantly, these explications have no significant impact on current regulatory guidance for bioequivalence testing, nor on the use of exposure (AUC) measures in making drug dosing decisions.

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to develop a model to predict individual subject disease trajectories including parameter uncertainty and accounting for missing data in rare neurological diseases, showcased by the ultra-rare disease Autosomal-Recessive Spastic Ataxia Charlevoix Saguenay (ARSACS). We modelled the change in SARA (Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) score versus Time Since Onset of symptoms using non-linear mixed effect models for a population of 173 patients with ARSACS included in the prospective real-world multicenter Autosomal Recessive Cerebellar Ataxia (ARCA) registry. We used the Multivariate Imputation Chained Equation (MICE) algorithm to impute missing covariates, and a covariate selection procedure with a pooled p-value to account for the multiply imputed data sets. We then investigated the impact of covariates and population parameter uncertainty on the prediction of the individual trajectories up to 5 years after their last visit. A four-parameter logistic function was selected. Men were estimated to have a 25% lower SARA score at disease onset and a moderately higher maximum SARA score, and time to progression (T50) was estimated to be 35% lower in patients with age of onset over 15 years. The population disease progression rate started slowly at 0.1 points per year peaking to a maximum of 0.8 points per year (at 36.8 years since onset of symptoms). The prediction intervals for SARA scores 5 years after the last visit were large (median 7.4 points, Q1-Q3: 6.4–8.5); their size was mostly driven by individual parameter uncertainty and individual disease progression rate at that time.

    "abstract": "Indolealkylamine (IAA) drugs are 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) analogs that mainly act on the serotonin system. Some IAAs are clinically utilized for antimigraine therapy, whereas other substances are notable as drugs of abuse. In the clinical evaluation of antimigraine triptan drugs, studies on their biotransformations and pharmacokinetics would facilitate the understanding and prevention of unwanted drug-drug interactions (DDIs). A stable, principal metabolite of an IAA drug of abuse could serve as a useful biomarker in assessing intoxication of the IAA substance. Studies on the metabolism of IAA drugs of abuse including lysergic acid amides, tryptamine derivatives and beta-carbolines are therefore emerging. An important role for polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) in the metabolism of IAA drugs of abuse has been revealed by recent studies, suggesting that variations in IAA metabolism, pharmaco- or toxicokinetics and dynamics can arise from distinct CYP2D6 status, and CYP2D6 polymorphism may represent an additional risk factor in the use of these IAA drugs. Furthermore, DDIs with IAA agents could occur additively at the pharmaco/toxicokinetic and dynamic levels, leading to severe or even fatal serotonin toxicity. In this review, the metabolism and potential DDIs of these therapeutic and abused IAA drugs are described.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this mini review is to discuss the use of physiologically-based drug absorption modeling to guide the formulation development. Following an introduction to drug absorption modeling, this article focuses on the preclinical formulation development. Case studies are presented, where the emphasis is not only the prediction of absolute exposure values, but also their change with altered input values. Sensitivity analysis of technologically relevant parameters, like the drug's particle size, dose and solubility, is presented as the basis to define the clinical formulation strategy. Taking the concept even one step further, the article shows how the entire design space for drug absorption can be constructed. This most accurate prediction level is mainly foreseen once clinical data is available and an example is provided using mefenamic acid as a model drug. Physiologically-based modeling is expected to be more often used by formulators in the future. It has the potential to become an indispensable tool to guide the formulation development of challenging drugs, which will help minimize both risks and costs of formulation development.",

    "abstract": "We developed a novel process, \"controlled crystallization during freeze-drying\" to produce drug nanocrystals of poorly water-soluble drugs. This process involves freeze-drying at a relatively high temperature of a drug and a matrix material from a mixture of tertiary butyl alcohol and water, resulting in drug nanocrystals incorporated in a matrix. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms that determine the size of the drug crystals. Fenofibrate was used as a model lipophilic drug. To monitor the crystallization during freeze-drying, a Raman probe was placed just above the sample in the freeze-dryer. These in-line Raman spectroscopy measurements clearly revealed when the different components crystallized during freeze-drying. The solvents crystallized only during the freezing step, while the solutes only crystallized after the temperature was increased, but before drying started. Although the solutes crystallized only after the freezing step, both the freezing rate and the shelf temperature were critical parameters that determined the final crystal size. At a higher freezing rate, smaller interstitial spaces containing the freeze-concentrated fraction were formed, resulting in smaller drug crystals (based on dissolution data). On the other hand, when the solutes crystallized at a lower shelf temperature, the degree of supersaturation is higher, resulting in a higher nucleation rate and consequently more and therefore smaller crystals. In conclusion, for the model drug fenofibrate, a high freezing rate and a relatively low crystallization temperature resulted in the smallest crystals and therefore the highest dissolution rate.",

    "abstract": "Metrics are discussed which are used for the evaluation of bioequivalence of modified-release formulations. In order to ensure the therapeutic equivalence of the compared drug products, it would be important to contrast measures which are additional to area under the curve (AUC) and C max. For delayed-release products, the assessment of lag times is informative. For extended-release dosage forms, comparisons of the half-value duration and the midpoint duration time are useful. For some modified-release formulations with complicated, multiphasic concentration profiles, the comparison of partial AUCs is important. In determinations of the bioequivalence of extended-release dosage forms, investigations performed under steady-state conditions rather than after single dosing can yield enhanced probability of therapeutic equivalence, especially with substantial accumulation of the drug products. In steady-state investigations of bioequivalence, evaluation of the trough concentration and of the peak trough fluctuation is informative.",

    "abstract": "BAY 1093884 is a fully human monoclonal antibody against the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in development as prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia with or without inhibitors. In vitro, BAY 1093884 binds to human, mouse, and monkey TFPI. The objective of this study was to find a pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker after administration of BAY 1093884 to normal monkeys. In monkey plasma, BAY 1093884 exhibited an IC50 (concentration that inhibits 50%) of 4.65 and 6.19 nM for free TFPI and diluted prothrombin time (dPT), respectively. The BAY 1093884 pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and its PD effects on dPT and free TFPI levels were assessed after intravenous and subcutaneous administration of BAY 1093884 (5 and 20 mg/kg) to female cynomolgus monkeys. Free TFPI concentrations in plasma decreased rapidly and increased to baseline in a dose-dependent manner. dPT clotting time was shortened and correlated with free TFPI levels and drug concentration in plasma, demonstrating the relationship between PD activities (dPT clotting time and free TFPI levels) and drug concentration. BAY 1093884 exhibited nonlinear PK, and a target-mediated drug disposition model was used to characterize the BAY 1093884 versus TFPI concentration–response relationship. We concluded that a mechanism-based PK/PD binding model could be useful for predicting human response to BAY 1093884. For the first-in-human study, measurement of free TFPI will be included as part of the dose-escalation design.",

    "abstract": "In vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVCs) play an important role in formulation development and drug approval. At the heart of IVIVC is deconvolution, the method of deriving an in vivo \"dissolution profile\" for comparison with in vitro dissolution data. IVIVCs are generally believed to be possible for highly permeable and highly soluble compounds with release/dissolution as the rate-limiting step. In this manuscript, we apply the traditional deconvolution methods, Wagner-Nelson and numerical deconvolution, to profiles simulated using a simplified small intestine absorption and transit model. Small intestinal transit, dissolution, and absorption rate constants are varied across a range of values approximately covering those observed in the literature. IVIVC plots and their corresponding correlation coefficients are analyzed for each combination of parameters to determine the applicability of the deconvolution methods under a range of rate-limiting conditions. For highly absorbed formulations, the correlation coefficients obtained during IVIVC are comparable for both methods and steadily decline with decreasing dissolution rate and increasing transit rate. The applicability of numerical deconvolution to IVIVC is not greatly affected by absorption rate, whereas the applicability of Wagner-Nelson falls when dissolution rate overcomes absorption rate and absorption becomes the rate-limiting step. The discrepancy between the expected and deconvolved input arises from the violation of a key assumption of deconvolution that the unknown input and unit impulse enter the system in the same location.",

    "abstract": "Inclusion of stochastic differential equations in mixed effects models provides means to quantify and distinguish three sources of variability in data. In addition to the two commonly encountered sources, measurement error and interindividual variability, we also consider uncertainty in the dynamical model itself. To this end, we extend the ordinary differential equation setting used in nonlinear mixed effects models to include stochastic differential equations. The approximate population likelihood is derived using the first-order conditional estimation with interaction method and extended Kalman filtering. To illustrate the application of the stochastic differential mixed effects model, two pharmacokinetic models are considered. First, we use a stochastic one-compartmental model with first-order input and nonlinear elimination to generate synthetic data in a simulated study. We show that by using the proposed method, the three sources of variability can be successfully separated. If the stochastic part is neglected, the parameter estimates become biased, and the measurement error variance is significantly overestimated. Second, we consider an extension to a stochastic pharmacokinetic model in a preclinical study of nicotinic acid kinetics in obese Zucker rats. The parameter estimates are compared between a deterministic and a stochastic NiAc disposition model, respectively. Discrepancies between model predictions and observations, previously described as measurement noise only, are now separated into a comparatively lower level of measurement noise and a significant uncertainty in model dynamics. These examples demonstrate that stochastic differential mixed effects models are useful tools for identifying incomplete or inaccurate model dynamics and for reducing potential bias in parameter estimates due to such model deficiencies.",

The microdialysis (MD) technique, introduced during the 1990s, presents the treating physician with a robust monitoring tool for brain chemistry in addition to conventional intracranial pressure monitoring. Nevertheless, some limitations remain, such as limited spatial resolution. Moreover, while there have been several attempts to develop new potential pharmacological therapies in TBI, there are currently no available drugs which have shown clinical efficacy that targets the underlying pathophysiology, despite various trials investigating a plethora of pharmaceuticals. Specifically in the brain, MD is able to demonstrate penetration of the drug through the blood-brain barrier into the brain extracellular space at potential site of action. In addition, the downstream effects of drug action can be monitored directly. In the future, clinical MD, together with other monitoring modalities, can identify specific pathological substrates which require tailored treatment strategies for patients suffering from TBI.",

    "abstract": "Meclonazepam is a benzodiazepine patented in 1977 to treat parasitic worms, which recently appeared as a designer benzodiazepine and drug of abuse. The aim of this study was to identify metabolites suitable as biomarkers of drug intake in urine using high-resolution mass spectrometry, authentic urine samples, and different model systems including human liver microsomes, cryopreserved hepatocytes, and a mice model. The main metabolites of meclonazepam found in human urine were amino-meclonazepam and acetamido-meclonazepam; also, minor peaks for meclonazepam were observed in three of four urine samples. These observations are consistent with meclonazepam having a metabolism similar to that of other nitro containing benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, flunitrazepam, and nitrazepam. Both metabolites were produced by the hepatocytes and in the mice model, but the human liver microsomes were only capable of producing minor amounts of the amino metabolite. However, under nitrogen, the amount of amino-meclonazepam produced increased 140 times. This study comprehensively elucidated meclonazepam metabolism and also illustrates that careful selection of in vitro model systems for drug metabolism is needed, always taking into account the expected metabolism of the tested drug.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the in vitro biorelevant gastrointestinal transfer (BioGIT) system in assessing the impact of dose and formulation on early exposure by comparing in vitro data with previously collected human plasma data of low solubility active pharmaceutical ingredients. Eight model active pharmaceutical ingredients were tested; Lu 35-138C (salt of weak base in a HP-beta-CD solution, three doses), fenofibrate (solid dispersion, tablet, two doses), AZD2207 EQ (salt of weak base, capsule, three doses), posaconazole (Noxafil® suspension, two doses), SB705498 (weak base, tablets vs. capsules), cyclosporine A (Sandimmun® vs. Sandimmun® Neoral), nifedipine (Adalat® capsule vs. Macorel® tablet), and itraconazole (Sporanox® capsule vs. Sporanox® solution). AUC0–0.75h values were calculated from the apparent concentration versus time data in the duodenal compartment of the BioGIT system. Differences in AUC0–0.75h values were evaluated versus differences in AUC0–1h and in AUC0–2h values calculated from previously collected plasma data in healthy adults. Ratios of mean AUC0–0.75h, mean AUC0–1h, and mean AUC0–2h values were estimated using the lowest dose or the formulation with the lower AUC0–0.75h value as denominator. The BioGIT system qualitatively identified the impact of dose and of formulation on early exposure in all cases. Log-transformed mean BioGIT AUC0–0.75h ratios correlated significantly with log-transformed mean plasma AUC0–1h ratios. Based on this correlation, BioGIT AUC0–0.75h ratios between 0.3 and 10 directly reflect corresponding plasma AUC0–1h ratios. BioGIT system is a valuable tool for the assessment of the impact of dose and formulation on early exposure to low solubility drugs.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced kidney injury is often observed in the clinics and can lead to long-term organ failure. In this work, we evaluated a novel in vitro system that aims at detecting whether compounds can cause renal proximal tubule damage in man. For this, we implemented organotypic cultures of human conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells overexpressing the organic anion transporter 1 (ciPTEC-OAT1) in a three-channel OrganoPlate under microfluidic conditions. Cells were exposed to four known nephrotoxicants (cisplatin, tenofovir, cyclosporine A, and tobramycin). The effect on cell viability and NAG release into the medium was determined. A novel panel of four miRNAs (mir-21, mir-29a, mir-34a, and mir-192) was selected as potential biomarkers of proximal tubule damage. After nephrotoxicant treatment, miRNA levels in culture medium were earlier indicators than cell viability (WST-8 assay) and outperformed NAG for proximal tubule damage. In particular, mir-29a, mir-34a, and mir-192 were highly reproducible between experiments and across compounds, whereas mir-21 showed more variability. Moreover, similar data were obtained in two different laboratories, underlining the reproducibility and technical transferability of the results, a key requirement for the implementation of novel biomarkers. In conclusion, the selected miRNAs behaved like sensitive biomarkers of damage to tubular epithelial cells caused by several nephrotoxicity mechanisms. This biomarker panel, in combination with the 3D cultures of ciPTEC-OAT1 in the OrganoPlate, represents a novel tool for in vitro nephrotoxicity detection. These results pave the way for the application of miRNAs in longitudinal, time-course in vitro toxicity studies.",

    "abstract": "High levels of hepcidin, the main regulator of systemic iron metabolism, lead to various diseases. Targeting hepcidin and lowering its concentration is a possible form of intervention in order to treat these diseases. High turnover rate of hepcidin is a major drawback of therapies directly targeting this peptide. We developed two monoclonal antibodies ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 which inhibit hemojuvelin/repulsive guidance molecule C (RGMc) and downregulate hepcidin. We conducted single-application and dose response studies to understand the antibodies' mechanism and subchronic toxicology studies to exclude safety-related concerns. Investigation was carried out at different biological levels through qPCR, Affymetrix, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), histopathology, serum iron, unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), and drug concentration measurements. After a single application of these antibodies, hepcidin expression in liver and its serum protein levels were reduced. Serum iron increased for several weeks. The RGMc antibodies show a pronounced dose response relationship in rats with h5F9-AM8 having an IC50 (UIBC) of approximately 80-fold higher than ABT-207. When hepcidin levels were downregulated, iron deposition in the liver was visible histologically 1 week post application. These antibody-mediated iron depositions were not associated with any adverse toxicologically relevant effect at the doses and time points evaluated. Iron depositions seen after 14 weekly treatments with ABT-207 were reversible in rats and in cynomolgus monkeys. Due to their long-lasting effects and excellent safety profile, both RGMc-blocking antibodies ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 are favorable clinical candidates for diseases characterized by high serum hepcidin levels like anemia of chronic disease.",

    "abstract": "It is envisaged that application of mechanistic models will improve prediction of changes in renal disposition due to drug-drug interactions, genetic polymorphism in enzymes and transporters and/or renal impairment. However, developing and validating mechanistic kidney models is challenging due to the number of processes that may occur (filtration, secretion, reabsorption and metabolism) in this complex organ. Prediction of human renal drug disposition from preclinical species may be hampered by species differences in the expression and activity of drug metabolising enzymes and transporters. A proposed solution is bottom-up prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters based on in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), mediated by recent advances in in vitro experimental techniques and application of relevant scaling factors. This review is a follow-up to the Part I of the report from the 2015 AAPS Annual Meeting and Exhibition (Orlando, FL; 25th-29th October 2015) which focuses on IVIVE and mechanistic prediction of renal drug disposition. It describes the various mechanistic kidney models that may be used to investigate renal drug disposition. Particular attention is given to efforts that have attempted to incorporate elements of IVIVE. In addition, the use of mechanistic models in prediction of renal drug-drug interactions and potential for application in determining suitable adjustment of dose in kidney disease are discussed. The need for suitable clinical pharmacokinetics data for the purposes of delineating mechanistic aspects of kidney models in various scenarios is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we report the development of the first item response theory (IRT) model within a pharmacometrics framework to characterize the disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS), as measured by Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Data were collected quarterly from a 96-week phase III clinical study by a blinder rater, involving 104,206 item-level observations from 1319 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), treated with placebo or cladribine. Observed scores for each EDSS item were modeled describing the probability of a given score as a function of patients' (unobserved) disability using a logistic model. Longitudinal data from placebo arms were used to describe the disease progression over time, and the model was then extended to cladribine arms to characterize the drug effect. Sensitivity with respect to patient disability was calculated as Fisher information for each EDSS item, which were ranked according to the amount of information they contained. The IRT model was able to describe baseline and longitudinal EDSS data on item and total level. The final model suggested that cladribine treatment significantly slows disease-progression rate, with a 20% decrease in disease-progression rate compared to placebo, irrespective of exposure, and effects an additional exposure-dependent reduction in disability progression. Four out of eight items contained 80% of information for the given range of disabilities. This study has illustrated that IRT modeling is specifically suitable for accurate quantification of disease status and description and prediction of disease progression in phase 3 studies on RRMS, by integrating EDSS item-level data in a meaningful manner.",

The data were obtained from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database and included 163,070 observations up to 48 months from 430 subjects belonging to De Novo PD cohort. The probability of obtaining a score, reported for each of the items in the questionnaire, was modeled as a function of the subject's disability. Initially, a single latent variable model was explored to characterize the disease progression over time. However, based on the understanding of the questionnaire set-up and the results of a residuals-based diagnostic tool, a three latent variable model with a mixture implementation was able to adequately describe longitudinal changes not only at the total score level but also at each individual item level. The linear progression rates obtained for the patient-reported items and the non-sided items were similar, each of which roughly take about 50 months for a typical subject to progress linearly from the baseline by one standard deviation. However for the sided items, it was found that the better side deteriorates quicker than the disabled side. This study presents a framework for analyzing MDS–UPDRS data, which can be adapted to more traditional UPDRS data collected in PD clinical trials and result in more efficient designs and analyses of such studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Upadacitinib is a selective Janus Kinase 1 inhibitor which is being developed for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. Upadacitinib was evaluated in Phase 3 studies as an oral extended-release (ER) formulation administered once daily. The purpose of this study was to develop a level A in vitro – in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for upadacitinib ER formulation. The pharmacokinetics of four upadacitinib extended-release formulations with different in vitro release characteristics and an immediate-release capsule formulation of upadacitinib were evaluated in 20 healthy subjects in a single-dose, randomized, crossover study. In vivo pharmacokinetic data and in vitro dissolution data (USP Dissolution Apparatus 1; pH 6.8; 100 rpm) were used to establish a level A IVIVC. Three formulations were used to establish the IVIVC, and the fourth formulation was used for external validation. A non-linear IVIVC best described the relationship between upadacitinib in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption profiles. The absolute percent prediction errors (%PE) for upadacitinib C max and AUC were less than 10% for all three formulations used to establish the IVIVC, as well as for the %PE for the external validation formulation and the overall mean internal validation. Model was cross-validated using the leave-one-out approach; all evaluated cross-validation runs met the regulatory acceptance criteria. A level A IVIVC was successfully developed and validated for upadacitinib ER formulation, which meets the FDA and EMA regulatory validation criteria and can be used as surrogate for in vivo bioequivalence.",

However, to date, there are no reports of validated prediction models to determine the brain-to-plasma unbound concentration ratio (Kp,uu,brain) as well as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-to-plasma unbound concentration ratio (Kp,uu,CSF) between humans and other species. Here, we developed a translational CNS steady-state drug disposition model to predict Kp,uu,brain and Kp,uu,CSF across rats, monkeys, and humans by estimating the relative activity factors (RAF) for MDR1 and BCRP in addition to scaling factors (γ and σ) using the molecular weight, logD, CSF bulk flow, and in vitro transport activities of these transporters. In this study, 68, 26, and 28 compounds were tested in the rat, monkey, and human models, respectively. Both the predicted Kp,uu,brain and Kp,uu,CSF values were within the 3-fold range of the observed values (71, 73, and 79%; 79, 88, and 78% of the compounds, respectively), indicating successful prediction of Kp,uu,brain and Kp,uu,CSF in the three species. The overall predictivity of the RAF approach is consistent with that of the relative expression factor (REF) approach. As the established model can predict Kp,uu,brain and Kp,uu,CSF using only in vitro and physicochemical data, this model would help avoid ethical issues related to animal use and improve CNS drug discovery workflow.",

We used chemical reaction engineering models to demonstrate the limitations of presently employed clearance measurements based upon systemic blood concentration in reflecting organ clearance. The belief for the last 49 years that in vivo clearance is independent of the mechanistic model for organ clearance is incorrect. There is only one valid definition of clearance. Defining organ clearance solely on the basis of systemic blood concentrations can lead to drug dosing errors when drug effect sites reside either in an eliminating organ exhibiting incremental clearance or in a non-eliminating organ where intraorgan concentration is governed by transporter actions. Attempts to predict clearance are presently hampered by the lack of recognition that what we are trying to predict is a well-stirred model clearance.",

The subsequent hypothetical case study applies these principles to a specific example HC-12, based loosely on anti-TNFα and anti-IL-17A bispecific molecules previously in development, structured as an example immunogenicity risk assessment for submission to health authorities. The risk of higher incidence and safety impact of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) due to large protein complexes is explored in the context of multi-specificity and multi-valency of the therapeutic in combination with the oligomeric forms of the targets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With significant advancement and development of extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies, there is a growing need to understand how their storage affects their physical and functional characteristics. EVs were isolated from the conditioned medium of a corneal stromal stem cell line (imCSSC) using Total Exosome isolation kit (TEI) and ultracentrifugation (UC) combined protocol. Purified EVs were stored at 4°C, − 80°C, room temperature (RT) after lyophilization with or without trehalose for 4 weeks. EVs stored at − 80°C and RT (lyophilization with trehalose) demonstrated a comparable morphology, while the freeze-dried samples without trehalose showed aggregation and degradation under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Lyophilized samples without trehalose demonstrated a decreased particle concentration, recovery rate and protein concentration, which was remediated by the addition of trehalose. EVs stored at − 80℃ showed no change in the protein expression of CD9, CD63, and CD81. Regardless of the storage condition, all EV samples investigated reduced inflammation, as well as inhibited expression of fibrotic markers in vitro . Lyophilization of EVs with trehalose was a feasible storage method that retained the physical property and in vitro biological activities of EVs after 4 weeks of storage, while − 80°C offered the best retention of imCSSC-derived EV physical properties. For the first time, this data demonstrated a practical and translatable method for the storage of CSSC-derived EVs for clinical use. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "In chemistry, rate processes are defined in terms of rate constants, with units of time−1, and are derived by differential equations from amounts. In contrast, when considering drug concentrations in biological systems, particularly in humans, rate processes must be defined in terms of clearance, with units of volume/time, since biological volumes, which are highly dependent on drug partition into biological tissues, cannot be easily determined. In pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and in making drug dosing decisions, drug clearance and changes in drug clearance are paramount. Clearance is defined as the amount of drug eliminated or moved divided by the exposure driving that elimination or movement. Historically, all clearance derivations in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics have been based on the use of differential equations in terms of rate constants and amounts, which are then converted into clearance equations when multiplied/divided by a hypothesized volume of distribution. Here, we show that except for iv bolus dosing, multiple volumes may be relevant. We have recently shown that clearance relationships, as well as rate constant relationships, may be derived independent of differential equations using Kirchhoff's Laws from physics. Kirchhoff's Laws may be simply translated to recognize that when two or more rate-defining processes operate in parallel, the total value of the overall reaction parameter is equal to the sum of those rate-defining processes. In contrast, when two or more rate-defining processes operate in series, the inverse of the total reaction parameter is equal to the sum of the inverse of those rate-defining steps.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The statistical assessments needed to establish anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay cut points (CPs) can be challenging for bioanalytical scientists. Poorly established CPs that are too high could potentially miss treatment emergent ADA or, when set too low, result in detection of responses that may have no clinical relevance. We evaluated 16 validation CP datasets generated with ADA assays at Regeneron’s bioanalytical laboratory and compared results obtained from different CP calculation tools. We systematically evaluated the impact of various factors on CP determination including biological and analytical variability, number of samples for capturing biological variability, outlier removal methods, and the use of parametric vs. non-parametric CP determination. In every study, biological factors were the major component of assay response variability, far outweighing the contribution from analytical variability. Non-parametric CP estimations resulted in screening positivity in drug-naïve samples closer to the targeted rate (5%) and were less impacted by skewness. Outlier removal using the boxplot method with an interquartile range (IQR) factor of 3.0 resulted in screening positivity close to the 5% targeted rate when applied to entire drug-naïve dataset. In silico analysis of CPs calculated using different sample sizes showed that using larger numbers of individuals resulted in CP estimates closer to the CP of the entire population, indicating a larger sample size (~ 150) for CP determination better represents the diversity of the study population. Finally, simpler CP calculations, such as the boxplot method performed in Excel, resulted in CPs similar to those determined using complex methods, such as random-effects ANOVA. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Valganciclovir, a prodrug of ganciclovir (GCV), is used to prevent cytomegalovirus infection after transplantation, with doses adjusted based on creatinine clearance (CrCL) to target GCV AUC0-24 h of 40–60 mg*h/L. This sometimes leads to overexposure or underexposure. This study aimed to train, test and validate machine learning (ML) algorithms for accurate GCV AUC0-24 h estimation in solid organ transplantation. Methods We simulated patients for different dosing regimen (900 mg/24 h, 450 mg/24 h, 450 mg/48 h, 450 mg/72 h) using two literature population pharmacokinetic models, allocating 75% for training and 25% for testing. Simulations from two other literature models and real patients provided validation datasets. Three independent sets of ML algorithms were created for each regimen, incorporating CrCL and 2 or 3 concentrations. We evaluated their performance on testing and validation datasets and compared them with MAP-BE. Results XGBoost using 3 concentrations generated the most accurate predictions. In testing dataset, they exhibited a relative bias of -0.02 to 1.5% and a relative RMSE of 2.6 to 8.5%. In the validation dataset, a relative bias of 1.5 to 5.8% and 8.9 to 16.5%, and a relative RMSE of 8.5 to 9.6% and 10.7% to 19.7% were observed depending on the model used. XGBoost algorithms outperformed or matched MAP-BE, showing enhanced generalization and robustness in their estimates. When applied to real patients’ data, algorithms using 2 concentrations showed relative bias of 1.26% and relative RMSE of 12.68%. Conclusions XGBoost ML models accurately estimated GCV AUC0-24 h from limited samples and CrCL, providing a strategy for optimized therapeutic drug monitoring. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Effective management of COVID-19 requires clinical tools to treat the disease in addition to preventive vaccines. Several recombinant mAbs and their cocktails have been developed to treat COVID-19 but these have limitations. Here, we evaluate small ankyrin repeat proteins called Ankyrons that were generated to bind with high affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Ankyrons are ankyrin repeat proteins comprised of repetitions a structural module. Each module consists of a β-turn followed by two antiparallel α-helices. The Ankyrons™ are directly selected in vitro from a highly diverse library of around a trillion clones in ribosome display and like antibodies can bind with high affinity to almost any target. We assessed Ankyrons that were generated against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.1) variants in a binding assay. We determined that all Ankyrons were specific in that they did not bind to MERS. While all Ankyrons bound with high affinity to the variant they were generated against, some also showed cross-reactivity to all three SARS-CoV-2 variants. Binding assays are useful for screening analytes but do not provide information about clinical effectiveness. Therefore, we used a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay to show that five of the Ankyrons evaluated neutralized all three strains of SARS-CoV-2. We have provided a workflow for the evaluation of novel Ankyrons against a viral target. This suggests that Ankyrons could be useful for rapidly developing new research tools for studying other emerging infectious diseases rapidly with the optional further potential for developing Ankyrons into diagnostic and even therapeutic applications.

    "abstract": "Abstract The analysis of Non-Liquid Matrices (NLMs) can provide key information on many aspects in drug discovery and development. These include but are not limited to drug uptake and distribution, engagement and modulation, and target exposure. A thorough understanding of these aspects is fundamental to the progression of drug development. In many cases, such an understanding can only be achieved through quantitative analysis of NLMs. Such dependence can lead to bottlenecks in the drug development process—as the practices and regulations that govern bioanalysis of conventional liquid matrices typically cannot be directly applied to NLMs. This paper strives to fill this crucial gap. To this end, subject matter experts from across the industry, through the auspices of the AAPS Bioanalytical Community, have combined their collective best practices for NLM bioanalysis in this paper. Certainly, this endeavor came with challenges, the most prominent of which also serves as the impetus for this project, the lack of literature on NLM bioanalysis dealing with different types of NLM, analysis rigor, and best practices to draw from. This paper aims to serve as a comprehensive set of best practices drawn from the experiences of leading scientists across the industry—for NLM bioanalysis in drug development. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The drug titration paradox arises when higher drug concentrations are paradoxically associated with poorer efficacy outcomes, due to the titration of an individual’s drug dose to achieve a desired effect. In cases with substantial intraindividual variability of the disease state, the drug titration paradox can also occur on the individual level (resulting in a higher dose when the individual has a worse disease state) and it has been suggested that it may not be possible to estimate the true exposure–response (ER) relationship in such situations. We simulated a titration study with strong intra-individual variability of disease state (causing the drug titration paradox at the individual level) and investigated the performance of four PKPD modelling methods in obtaining an unbiased estimate of the ER relationship. Strong bias in the estimated ER relationship was observed with two commonly used modelling methods: the model which only estimated inter-individual variability (IIV) and the model that included IIV and inter-occasion variability (IOV) on disease severity. In contrast, inclusion of stochastic differential equations (SDE) or accounting for the autocorrelation of the residual error between observations did yield successful estimation of the ER relationship without bias. The success of these methods can be understood from the principles of causal inference: confounding is avoided by controlling for the previous observations which drive the drug titration. Our results underline the importance of adequately characterizing intra-individual variability to avoid bias in PKPD modelling, especially for clinical areas where titration designs are common, such as analgesia.

    "abstract": "Abstract Protein aggregates and insoluble particles in biopharmaceutical products are impurities that can elicit immunogenicity. The protein aggregates and insoluble particles form during manufacturing and storage, and should be characterized to optimize the manufacturing process and establish a control strategy. Several issues regarding the evaluation and control of these particles have been concerned, and collaborative studies have been conducted in the Japan Biopharmaceutical Consortium to address them. However, there is still no consensus for utilizing analytical techniques in parallel to establish a control strategy for such protein aggregates and insoluble particles, which range in size from a few nanometers to several hundred micrometers. Therefore, in this study, we surveyed Japanese biopharmaceutical companies through a questionnaire including questions regarding analytical techniques used to establish control strategies for protein aggregates and insoluble particles at various development phases. To summary the survey results, we found that size exclusion chromatography, light obscuration, and visual inspection are consistently used from early development and formulation optimization stage to commercial manufacturing. Apart from the light obscuration method, flow imaging (FI) was the most commonly used technique for subvisible particle characterization; thus, the use of FI to establish a control strategy was documented. The recommendation for establishing a control strategy for protein aggregates and insoluble particles based on life-cycle of drug development are summarized.",

    "abstract": "Administration of human therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to animals during preclinical drug development often leads to the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). ADA may reduce the systemic exposure of the mAb by enhancing its immune-complex mediated clearance. Thus, ADA may hinder the preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicology assessments of mAbs. To mitigate this effect, we explored the ability of short-term administration of immunosuppressants to induce prolonged immune tolerance towards a human mAb, erenumab, in rats. In two studies, we investigated dosing regimens using the immunosuppressants methotrexate and tacrolimus/sirolimus combination, and compared them to non-immunosuppressed control groups. Each study comprised three phases: induction (weeks 1-4), washout (weeks 5-8), and rechallenge (weeks 9-12). Animals received mAb during the induction and rechallenge phase, while immunosuppression was limited to the induction and washout phase. Blood samples were collected at predefined time-points for erenumab and ADA quantification. The tacrolimus/sirolimus regimen, but not the tested methotrexate regimens, completely prevented ADA formation in all treated animals relative to the control groups. The tacrolimus/sirolimus treated animals not only remained ADA-negative with initial immunosuppression during the induction phase but remained ADA-negative even after erenumab rechallenge suggesting the induction of immune-tolerance beyond the immunosuppressive treatment period. Correspondingly, erenumab systemic exposures were maintained throughout the study period in all animals in the tacrolimus/sirolimus group and were similar to the erenumab exposures in ADA-negative animals of the control group.

    "abstract": "Abstract Doxil®, a PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) hydrochloride suspension, was the first liposome drug product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although off-patent, limited generic products have been approved due to challenges in achieving bioequivalence compounded by manufacturing complexity. Regulatory agencies require generic drug products to be bioequivalent to the reference listed drug. In this regard, we developed various analytical methods to analyze Doxil® and its generic drug products for multiple attributes, including liposome size distribution, zeta potential, DOX content, lipid content, purity, non-encapsulated doxorubicin, morphology, nanostructure similarity, and quantified in vitro release. Batch-to-batch variation exists across attributes for different formulations. Minor differences in particle size and zeta potential were observed. Cryo-TEM imaging reveals the distinct coffee bean shape and morphology of the Doxil® liposome. SAXS similarity analysis shows a distinct difference in nanostructure for Dr. Reddy’s formulation compared to the innovator formulation. Still, it is revealed to be a consequence of liposome uniformity and homogeneity as depicted in cryo-TEM images. Several methods developed in this work can be complementary to provide a more thorough physicochemical analysis for generic evaluation. Size, morphology, and nanostructure evaluated by DLS, cryo-TEM, and SAXS should be readily employed to assess physicochemical similarity. Content, impurity identification, and amount of free non-encapsulated DOX are used to evaluate formulation sameness. The methods developed in this work provide a physicochemical framework for analytical comparison of complex liposomal generics and may support subsequent development efforts to improve generic drug availability for patient populations in need.

    "abstract": "Abstract The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a common method to assess submaximal exercise capacity in children and adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and other chronic diseases. There is no guideline specifically for 6MWT in children. In this observational pilot study, we evaluated the impact of procedural variations on the outcome of the 6MWT in the real-world clinical setting at pediatric PAH programs. We collected 6MWT data from 33 children with PAH participating in a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study. Data range/quantiles and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe distribution of the six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and data variability. Levene’s test was used to test for heterogeneity of variance with the two sites of similar altitude and their age/height/weight-matched Panama Function Class II participants. We analyzed all 33 eligible participants and their qualified first walks at five centers (A-E) with 6MWD ranges of 420–570, 357–683, 418–481, 400–700, 377–549 m, respectively. Site D performed the 6MWT in a busy hallway and allowed parental/caregiver’s cheering, while Site E performed the 6MWT in a secluded area with no parental/caregiver involvement. Mean 6MWD and SD for Sites D and E were 547 (125) and 432 (67.5) meters, respectively (p = 0.03). In conclusion, procedural variations seem to associate with 6MWD data variability. Although interpretation of our results is limited by the small sample size, our findings suggest that standardizing pediatric 6MWT procedures are needed. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Direct compression (DC) remains a popular manufacturing technology for producing solid dosage forms. However, the formulation optimisation is a laborious process, costly and time-consuming. The aim of this study was to determine whether machine learning (ML) can be used to accelerate developments by predicting the drug release profiles under dynamic conditions given the composition of formulations. A total of 377 formulations were produced in-house and their release profile under dynamic dissolution conditions was measured from 0 to 480 min across 11 time points. A subsequent ML analysis involved predicting the entire release profile. Six different ML techniques were explored, where random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were found to achieve a fivefold cross-validation R2 of 0.635 ± 0.047 and 0.601 ± 0.091, respectively. A second ML strategy was developed, where the ML techniques predict the kinetic parameters of the Weibull and a modified first-order kinetic release model and subsequently use the predicted parameters to fit the release profiles. The R2 results using RF were comparable to the first strategy. These findings demonstrate that ML can be used to predict entire drug release profiles during dynamic dissolution studies, whilst simultaneously providing insight into kinetic parameters, thus making the modelling process more informative for pharmaceutical researchers. Future work will seek to investigate more 'kinetic-informed' ML models.",

    "abstract": "Crizotinib exhibits a complex drug-drug interaction as it is a CYP3A4 substrate and acts as both a time-dependent inhibitor and inducer of the enzyme. Absorption of crizotinib is also complex as it exhibits a prolonged absorption phase. The primary objective of this research was to develop a comprehensive physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to mechanistically describe both metabolism and absorption of crizotinib. The established crizotinib adult PBPK model was extrapolated to pediatric population using the modified CYP3A4 ontogeny profile to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile after a single dose administration of crizotinib under the fasted condition in pediatric population age between 1 to 6 years old. The model was further applied to conduct virtual bioequivalence (BE) trials including clinically observed intra-subject coefficient of variation (ICV%) in both adult and pediatric populations. In adult subjects, the estimated geometric mean ratio for AUCinf and Cmax for oral solution (OS) vs granules formulation was 98.33 and 89.94, respectively with probability of demonstrating BE in adults of 100% for AUCinf and 90.3% for Cmax. In pediatric subjects, the probability of demonstrating BE success was 99.7% for both AUCinf and Cmax. The high probability of BE was replicated with the assumed higher ICV of 29% in pediatrics for both AUCinf and Cmax. The granules (commercial formulation) can be considered BE to OS (Phase 3 clinical formulation) in adults, as well as pediatric subjects aged between 1 to 6 years old.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing potential of bacteriophage therapy as an alternative treatment for pulmonary infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria has been increasingly recognized. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term stability of spray-dried phage powder formulations for pulmonary delivery, focusing on both biological activity and physicochemical properties. Three phages, PEV1, PEV20, and PEV61, were selected for formulation based on their host range against clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Eight spray-dried formulations, developed with varying proportions of lactose as a stabilizer and leucine as a moisture protectant and powder dispersion enhancer, were stored under controlled conditions at 4°C/15% relative humidity (RH) and 20°C/15% RH for four years. Over this period, phage titers declined with reduction ranging from 0.97 log 10 in the most stable formulation to 2.49 log 10 in the least stable one. Formulations with higher lactose concentrations (70–80%) demonstrated better preservation of biological activity. While the overall particle morphology remained unchanged, some thread-like elongated features protruding from the particle surfaces were observed, particularly in powders stored at 20°C/15% RH. However, there was a decline in the fine particle fraction (FPF) 50 – 60% to 27—44%. These findings showed the potential of spray-dried phage powders as a viable option for long-term storage to retain bioactivity, but the aerosol performance can be compromised. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "The leveraged use of biomarkers presents an opportunity in understanding target engagement and disease impact while accelerating drug development. For effective integration in drug development, it is essential for biomarkers to aid in the elucidation of mechanisms of action and disease progression. The recent years have witnessed significant progress in biomarker selection, validation, and qualification, while enabling surrogate and clinical endpoint qualification and application. Biomarkers play a central role in target validation for novel mechanisms. They also play a central role in the learning/confirming paradigm, particularly when utilized in concert with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling. Clearly, these attributes make biomarker integration attractive for scientific and regulatory applications to new drug development. In this review, applications of proximal, or target engagement, and distal, or disease-related, biomarkers are highlighted using the example of the recent development of sitagliptin for type 2 diabetes, wherein elucidation of target engagement and disease-related biomarkers significantly accelerated sitagliptin drug development. Importantly, use of biomarkers as tools facilitated design of clinical efficacy trials while streamlining dose focus and optimization, the net impact of which reduced overall cycle time to filing as compared to the industry average.",

    "abstract": "HAE1, a high-affinity anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, is discussed here as a case study in the use of quantitative pharmacology in the development of a second-generation molecule. In vitro, preclinical, and clinical data from the first-generation molecule, omalizumab, were heavily leveraged in the HAE1 program. A preliminary mechanism-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for HAE1 was developed using an existing model for omalizumab, together with in vitro binding data for HAE1 and omalizumab. When phase I data were available, the model was refined by simultaneously modeling PK/PD data from omalizumab studies with the available HAE1 phase I data. The HAE1 clinical program was based on knowledge of the quantitative relationship between a pharmacodynamic biomarker, suppression of free IgE, and clinical response (e.g., lower exacerbation rates) obtained in pivotal studies with omalizumab. A clinical trial simulation platform was developed to predict free IgE levels and clinical responses following attainment of a target free IgE level (</=10 IU/ml). The simulation platform enabled selection of four doses for the phase II dose-ranging trial by two independent methods: dose-response non-linear fitting and linear mixed modeling. Agreement between the two methods provided confidence in the doses selected. Modeling and simulation played a large role in supporting acceleration of the HAE1 program by enabling data-driven decision-making, often based on confirmation of projections and/or learning from incoming new data.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic proteins (TPs) are increasingly combined with small molecules and/or with other TPs. However preclinical tools and in vitro test systems for assessing drug interaction potential of TPs such as monoclonal antibodies, cytokines and cytokine modulators are limited. Published data suggests that clinically relevant TP-drug interactions (TP-DI) are likely from overlap in mechanisms of action, alteration in target and/or drug-disease interaction. Clinical drug interaction studies are not routinely conducted for TPs because of the logistical constraints in study design to address pharmacokinetic (PK)- and pharmacodynamic (PD)-based interactions. Different pharmaceutical companies have developed their respective question- and/or risk-based approaches for TP-DI based on the TP mechanism of action as well as patient population. During the workshop both company strategies and regulatory perspectives were discussed in depth using case studies; knowledge gaps and best practices were subsequently identified and discussed. Understanding the functional role of target, target expression and their downstream consequences were identified as important for assessing the potential for a TP-DI. Therefore, a question-and/or risk-based approach based upon the mechanism of action and patient population was proposed as a reasonable TP-DI strategy. This field continues to evolve as companies generate additional preclinical and clinical data to improve their understanding of possible mechanisms for drug interactions. Regulatory agencies are in the process of updating their recommendations to sponsors regarding the conduct of in vitro and in vivo interaction studies for new drug applications (NDAs) and biologics license applications (BLAs).",

    "abstract": "In the current study, the effect of metal ions in combination with buffers (citrate, acetate, pH 4.5) on the stability of aqueous solutions of oxytocin was investigated. Both monovalent metal ions (Na+ and K+) and divalent metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) were tested all as chloride salts. The effect of combinations of buffers and metal ions on the stability of aqueous oxytocin solutions was determined by RP-HPLC and HP-SEC after 4 weeks of storage at either 4°C or 55°C. Addition of sodium or potassium ions to acetate- or citrate-buffered solutions did not increase stability, nor did the addition of divalent metal ions to acetate buffer. However, the stability of aqueous oxytocin in aqueous formulations was improved in the presence of 5 and 10 mM citrate buffer in combination with at least 2 mM CaCl2, MgCl2, or ZnCl2 and depended on the divalent metal ion concentration. Isothermal titration calorimetric measurements were predictive for the stabilization effects observed during the stability study. Formulations in citrate buffer that had an improved stability displayed a strong interaction between oxytocin and Ca2+, Mg2+, or Zn2+, while formulations in acetate buffer did not. In conclusion, our study shows that divalent metal ions in combination with citrate buffer strongly improved the stability of oxytocin in aqueous solutions.",

    "abstract": "ADB-CHMINACA (MAB-CHMINACA) is a new synthetic cannabinoid with high potency and many reported adverse events and fatalities. The drug is currently scheduled in several countries in Europe and the USA. Analytical methods need to be developed to confirm ADB-CHMINACA intake for clinical and forensic programs. For many synthetic cannabinoids, parent compound is not detectable in biological samples after intake, making the detection of metabolites the only way to prove consumption. Therefore, detection of ADB-CHMINACA metabolites in biological specimens is critical. Since there are currently no published data on ADB-CHMINACA metabolism, we aimed to identify its major metabolites. Cryopreserved human hepatocytes were incubated with 10 μmol/L ADB-CHMINACA for 3 h. Incubations were analyzed with liquid chromatography on a biphenyl column, high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (orbitrap), and metabolite identification software. A reference standard of six commercially available potential metabolites was simultaneously analyzed under the same conditions to allow correct assignment of isomers. We detected ten major metabolites. Biotransformations mainly occurred at the cyclohexylmethyl tail of the compound, as also observed with structural analogs' metabolism. Minor reactions also occurred at the tert-butyl chain. Only two analytical standards of potential metabolites matched an actual metabolite detected in hepatocyte incubations. We recommend A9 (ADB-CHMINACA hydroxycyclohexylmethyl), A4 (ADB-CHMINACA 4″-hydroxycyclohexyl), and A6 (ADB-CHMINACA hydroxycyclohexylmethyl) as metabolite targets to document ADB-CHMINACA intake in clinical and forensic cases. Additionally, these results will guide analytical standard manufacturers to better provide suitable references for further studies on ADB-CHMINACA metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was an important medical milestone. MAbs have been demonstrated as safe and efficacious treatments of IBD. However, a large percentage of patients either fail to respond initially or lose response to therapy after a period of treatment. Although there are factors associated with poor treatment outcomes in IBD, one cause for treatment failure may be low mAb exposure. Consequently, gastroenterologists have begun using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to guide dose adjustment. However, while beneficial, TDM does not provide sufficient information to effectively adjust doses. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of mAbs are complex, with numerous factors impacting on mAb PK and PD. The concept of dashboard-guided dosing based on Bayesian PK models allows physicians to combine TDM with factors influencing mAb PK to individualize therapy more effectively. One issue with TDM has been the slow turnaround of assay results, either necessitating an additional clinic visit for a sample or reacting to TDM results at a subsequent, rather than the current, dose. New point-of-care (POC) assays for mAbs are being developed that would potentially allow physicians to determine drug concentration quickly. However, work remains to understand how to determine what target exposure is needed for an individual patient, and whether the combination of POC assays and dashboards presents a safe approach with substantial outcome benefit over the current standard of care.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes to brain homeostasis by protecting the brain from harmful compounds. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the major efflux transporters at the BBB. In the present study, we assessed whether (1) P-gp function in the brain is constant or fluctuates across the day and (2) if it is affected by sleep deprivation. Four groups of rats were PET scanned with a radiolabeled P-gp substrate [18F]MC225, each at a different moment of the 12-h light-dark cycle to study diurnal variations: early sleep phase (ZT3), late sleep phase (ZT9), early active phase (ZT15), and late active phase (ZT21). In two additional groups, controls were allowed to sleep normally while experimental animals were sleep-deprived for 10 h in a slowly rotating drum during the sleep phase. Kinetic modeling with a one-tissue compartment model fit resulted for all brain regions in 1.2–1.8-fold higher distribution volumes (V T ) at ZT15 than at other time points. V T -values at ZT3, ZT9, and ZT21 were not significantly different from each other. Regional tracer distribution volumes in controls and sleep-deprived animals were also not significantly different. Our results indicate that P-gp function in rats displays a daily rhythm with reduced function at the beginning of the active phase. This rhythm is not dependent on sleep since acute sleep deprivation had no effect. Knowing the diurnal variation of P-gp function could be important for the design of PET studies and for choosing the correct administration time for P-gp-dependent drugs.",

Here, the analytical similarity of adalimumab biosimilar HLX03 to Humira® was successfully established following a QbD quality study. Quality target product profile (QTPP) of HLX03 was first generated according to the public available information and initial characterization of 3 batches of Humira®. The critical quality attributes (CQAs) were then identified through risk assessment according to impact of each quality attribute on efficacy and safety. The anticipated range for each CQA was derived from similarity acceptance range and/or the corresponding regulatory guidelines. Finally, a panel of advanced and orthogonal physicochemical and functional tests and comparison of 6 batches of HLX03 and 10 batches of the reference standard demonstrated high similarity of HLX03 to Humira®, except for slightly lower percentage of high mannosylated glycans (%HM) in HLX03 which had no effect on FcγRIII binding and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). All above demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of QbD-based similarity assessment of a biosimilar monoclonal antibody (mAb).",

    "abstract": "The co-administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin is proposed in COVID-19 therapy. We hypothesize a new mechanism supporting the synergistic interaction between these drugs. Azithromycin is a substrate of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) which is localized in endosomes and lysosomes with a polarized substrate transport from the cell cytosol into the vesicle interior. SARS-CoV-2 and drugs meet in these acidic organelles and both basic drugs, which are potent lysosomotropic compounds, will become protonated and trapped within these vesicles. Consequently, their intra-vesicular concentrations can attain low micromolar effective cytotoxic concentrations on SARS-CoV-2 while concomitantly increase the intra-vesicular pH up to around neutrality. This last effect inhibits lysosomal enzyme activities responsible in virus entry and replication cycle. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that ABCB1 could be a possible enhancer by confining azithromycin more extensively than expected when the trapping is solely dependent on the passive diffusion. This additional mechanism may therefore explain the synergistic effect when azithromycin is added to hydroxychloroquine, leading to apparently more rapid virus clearance and better clinical benefit, when compared to monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine alone.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The presence of different excipient types/brands in solid oral dosage forms may affect product performance and drug bioavailability. Understanding the biopharmaceutical implications of superdisintegrant variability (changes in material properties), variation (changes in excipient amount) and interchangeability (use of different excipient types with the same intended functionality) in oral drug performance would be beneficial for the development of robust final dosage forms. The current study investigated the impact of superdisintegrants (sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone) on the apparent solubility of drugs with different physicochemical properties (drug ionisation, drug lipophilicity, drug aqueous solubility). Compendial and biorelevant media were used to assess the impact of gastrointestinal conditions on the effects of excipient on drug apparent solubility. For the majority of compounds, changes in drug apparent solubility were not observed in superdisintegrant presence, apart from the cases of highly ionised compounds (significant decrease in drug solubility) and/or compounds that aggregate/precipitate in solution (significant increase in drug solubility). Excipient variability did not greatly affect the impact of excipients on drug apparent solubility. The use of multivariate data analysis identified the biopharmaceutical factors affecting excipient performance. The construction of roadmaps revealed that superdisintegrants may be of low risk for the impact of excipients on oral drug performance based on drug solubility alone; superdisintegrants activity could still be a risk for oral bioavailability due to their effects on tablet disintegration.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to develop a robust and standardized in vitro dissolution methodology for orally inhaled drug products (OIDPs). An aerosol dose collection (ADC) system was designed to uniformly deposit the whole impactor stage mass (ISM) over a large filter area for dissolution testing. All dissolution tests were performed under sink conditions in a sodium phosphate buffered saline solution containing 0.2%w/w sodium dodecyl sulphate. An adapted USP Apparatus V, Paddle over Disk (POD), was used throughout the study. The dissolution characteristics of the ISM dose of a commercial metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and a range of dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations containing inhaled corticosteroids were tested. The uniform distribution of the validated ISM dose considerably reduced drug loading effects on the dissolution profiles for both MDI and DPI formulations. The improvement in the robustness and discriminatory capability of the technique enabled characterization of dissolution rate differences between inhaler platforms and between different DPI product strengths containing fluticasone propionate. A good correlation between in vivo mean absorption time and in vitro dissolution half-life was found for a range of the inhaled corticosteroids. The ADC system and the reproducible in vitro POD dissolution measurements provided a quantitative-based approach for measuring the relationship between the influence of device and the dispersion characteristics on the aerosol dissolution of low solubility compounds. The in vitro dissolution method could potentially be applied as a dissolution methodology for compendial, quality control release testing, and during development of both branded orally inhaled drug products and their generic counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Excipients are major components of oral solid dosage forms, and changes in their critical material attributes (excipient variability) and/or amount (excipient variation) in pharmaceutical formulations may present a challenge for product performance. Understanding the biopharmaceutical factors affecting excipient performance is recommended for the successful implementation of excipient variability on Quality by Design (QbD) approaches. The current study investigated the impact of magnesium stearate (MgSt) variability on the apparent solubility of drugs with a wide range of physicochemical properties (drug ionization, drug lipophilicity, drug aqueous solubility). Compendial and biorelevant media were used to assess the role of gastrointestinal (GI) conditions on the excipient effects on drug apparent solubility. The lipophilic nature of MgSt decreased the apparent solubility of most compounds. The reduction in drug apparent solubility was more pronounced for highly soluble and/or highly ionized drugs and in presence of more highly crystalline or smaller particle size MgSt. The use of multivariate data analysis revealed the critical physicochemical and biopharmaceutical factors and the complex nature of excipient variability on the reduction in drug apparent solubility. The construction of a roadmap combining drug, excipient and medium characteristics allowed the identification of the cases where the presence of excipient or excipient variability may present risks for oral drug performance.",

To date, the standardized assay to characterize CAR-T cell distribution, expansion, contraction, and persistence profiles is not readily available. To overcome this limitation and increase comparability among studies, we have established a universal protocol for analysis. We established a duplexing ddPCR protocol for the CAR-T transgene and reference gene to normalize the genomic DNA input prepared from mouse blood and tissues. The high-throughput gDNA extraction method enabled highly reproducible gDNA extraction while eliminating labor-intensive steps. The investigational CAR-T cells were intravenously injected into immunodeficient mice bearing human colorectal cancer xenografts. The blood and tissue samples were collected to measure the cellular kinetics by ddPCR and flow cytometry. The standard curves were linear throughout the calibration range with acceptable intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy. The gDNA recovery study performed by spiking in the exo-gene plasmid DNA or CAR-T cells revealed that the recovery ranged from 60 to 100% in blood and tissue homogenates. The use of both units of copy/μg gDNA and copy/μL blood met the current regulatory requirement and allowed for a systematic understanding of CAR-T cell expansion and a direct comparison with the flow cytometry data. A standardized ddPCR assay, including automated gDNA extraction procedures, has been established for evaluating cellular kinetics and biodistribution in CAR-T cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract New drugs may in some cases need to be tested in paediatric and pregnant patients. However, it is difficult to recruit such patients and there are many ethical issues around their inclusion in clinical trials. Modelling and simulation can help to plan well-designed clinical trials with a reduced number of participants and to bridge gaps where recruitment is difficult. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for small molecule drugs have been used to aid study design and dose adjustments in paediatrics and pregnancy, with several publications in the literature. However, published PBPK models for monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in these populations are scarce. Here, the current status of mAb PBPK models in paediatrics and pregnancy is discussed. Seven mAb PBPK models published for paediatrics were found, which report good prediction accuracy across a wide age range. No mAb PBPK models for pregnant women have been published to date. Current challenges to the development of such PBPK models are discussed, including gaps in our knowledge of relevant physiological processes and availability of clinical data to verify models. As the availability of such data increases, it will help to improve our confidence in the PBPK model predictive ability. Advantages for using PBPK models to predict mAb PK in paediatrics and pregnancy are discussed. For example, the ability to incorporate ontogeny and gestational changes in physiology, prediction of maternal, placental and foetal exposure and the ability to make predictions from in vitro and preclinical data prior to clinical data being available.",

    "abstract": "Describing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) maturation across the heterogeneous population of preterm and term neonates and infants is important to predict the clearance of renally cleared drugs. This study aims to describe the GFR maturation in (pre)term neonates and young infants (PNA < 90 days) using individual inulin clearance data (CLinulin). To this end, published GFR maturation models were evaluated by comparing their predicted GFR with CLinulin retrieved from literature. The best model was subsequently optimized in NONMEM V7.4.3 to better fit the CLinulin values. Our study evaluated seven models and collected 381 individual CLinulin values from 333 subjects with median (range) birthweight (BWb) 1880 g (580-4950), gestational age (GA) 34 weeks (25-43), current weight (CW) 1890 g (480-6200), postnatal age (PNA) 3 days (0-75), and CLinulin 2.20 ml/min (0.43-17.90). The De Cock 2014 model (covariates: BWb and PNA) performed the best in predicting CLinulin, followed by the Rhodin 2009 model (covariates: CW and postmenstrual age). The final optimized model shows that GFR at birth is determined by BWb, thereafter the maturation rate of GFR is dependent on PNA and GA, with a higher GA showing an overall faster maturation. To conclude, using individual CLinulin data, we found that a model for neonatal GFR requires a distinction between prenatal maturation quantified by BWb and postnatal maturation. To capture postnatal GFR maturation in (pre)term neonates and young infants, we developed an optimized model in which PNA-related maturation was dependent on GA.",

Dissolution profiles of CBZ IR tablets (100 mg) were generated in 50-900 mL biorelevant adult fasted state simulated gastric and intestinal fluid (Ad-FaSSGF and Ad-FaSSIF), also in three alternative compositions of biorelevant pediatric FaSSGF and FaSSIF medias at 200 mL. This study found that CBZ dissolution was poorly sensitive to changes in the composition of the biorelevant media, where dissimilar dissolution (F2 = 46.2) was only observed when the BS concentration was changed from 3000 to 89 μM (Ad-FaSSIF vs Ped-FaSSIF 50% 14 BS). PBPK modeling demonstrated the most predictive dissolution volume and media composition to forecast the PK was 500 mL of Ad-FaSSGF/Ad-FaSSIF media for adults and 200 mL Ped-FaSSGF/FaSSIF media for pediatrics. A virtual bioequivalence simulation was conducted by using Ad-FaSSGF and/or Ad-FaSSIF 500 mL or Ped-FaSSGF and/or Ped-FaSSIF 200 mL dissolution data for CBZ 100 mg (reference and generic test) IR product. The CBZ PBPK models showed bioequivalence of the product. This study demonstrates that the integration of biorelevant dissolution data can predict the PK profile of a poorly soluble drug in both populations. Further work using more pediatric drug products is needed to verify biorelevant dissolution data to predict the in vivo performance in pediatrics.",

More advanced in vitro and in vivo characterization can improve our understanding of the injection space and aid in describing the long-acting injectable (LAI) drug’s behavior at the injection site more mechanistically. These innovations may enable unlocking the potential of employing a model-based framework in the LAI preclinical and clinical space. This review provides a brief overview of the LAI development process before delving deeper into the current status of modeling and simulation approaches in characterizing the preclinical and clinical LAI pharmacokinetics, focused on aqueous crystalline suspensions. A closer look is provided on in vitro release methods, available biopharmaceutical models and reported in vitro/in vivo correlations (IVIVCs) that may advance LAI drug development. The overview allows identifying the opportunities for use of model-informed drug development approaches and potential gaps where further research may be most warranted. Continued investment in improving our understanding of LAI PK across species through translational approaches may facilitate the future development of LAI drug products. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "An overview is provided of the methodologies used in determining the time to steady state for Phase 1 multiple dose studies. These methods include NOSTASOT (no-statistical-significance-of-trend), Helmert contrasts, spline (quadratic) regression, effective half life for accumulation, nonlinear mixed effects modeling, and Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. For each methodology we describe its advantages and disadvantages. The first two methods do not require any distributional assumptions for the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and are limited to average assessment of steady state. Also spline regression which provides both average and individual assessment of time to steady state does not require any distributional assumptions for the PK parameters. On the other hand, nonlinear mixed effects modeling and Bayesian hierarchical modeling which allow for the estimation of both population and subject-specific estimates of time to steady state do require distributional assumptions on PK parameters. The current investigation presents eight case studies for which the time to steady state was assessed using the above mentioned methodologies. The time to steady state estimates obtained from nonlinear mixed effects modeling, Bayesian hierarchal approach, effective half life, and spline regression were generally similar.",

The full safety profile of an approved product is established during years of clinical use. For nearly 40 years, the FDA has relied on the voluntary reporting of adverse events by healthcare practitioners and patients to help establish the safety of marketed products. Epidemiologic studies, including case series, secular trends, case-control and cohort studies, are used to supplement the investigation of a safety signal. Ideally, active surveillance systems would supplement the identification and exploration of safety signals. The FDA has implemented a number of initiatives to help identify safety problems with drugs and continues to evaluate their efforts.",

This review presents our perspective on the use of scanning probe microscopy techniques with special emphasis to multidimensional atomic force microscopy (m-AFM) to explore this new field with a particular emphasis to define targets, design therapeutics, and track outcomes of molecular-scale pharmacological interactions. The approach will be to first discuss operating principles of m-AFM and provide representative examples of studies to understand human health and disease at the molecular level and then to address different strategies in defining target macromolecules, screening potential drug candidates, developing and characterizing of drug delivery systems, and monitoring target-drug interactions. Finally, we will discuss some future directions including AFM tip-based parallel sensors integrated with other high-throughput technologies which could be a powerful platform for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Phosporothioate oligonucleotides represent an important class of therapeutic oligonucleotides, in which none-bridging oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups are replaced by sulfur. These oligonucleotides are designed to treat disease by modulating gene expression of an affected individual. As the development and application of these therapeutical oligonucleotides require analytical support, the development, validation, and application of an assay for the quantitative analysis of a phosporothioate oligonucleotide in rat plasma is described. The method employs ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography on a monolithic capillary column with acetonitrile gradients in cyclohexyldimethylammonium acetate for separation and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry for detection of nucleic acids. Chromatographic parameters (i.e. column temperature, mobile phase composition) as well as mass spectrometric parameters (i.e. spray voltage, gas flow, and capillary position, scan mode) have been optimized for sensitive oligonucleotide quantification. Furthermore, a solid-phase extraction method was developed which enabled processing of 10 μl of plasma. The five-point calibration curve showed linearity over the range of concentrations from 100 to 1,000 nM of the oligonucleotide. The limit of detection was 50 nM. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracies were always better than 10.2 %. Using this assay, we performed a pharmacokinetic study of the phosporothioate oligonucleotide in rat treated with a single intravenous dose of 0.39 μmol/kg. The assay sensitivity was sufficient to study the early phase elimination of the oligonucleotide. Small amounts of the oligonucleotide were detectable up to 3 h after dosing.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can lead to undesired drug exposure, resulting in insufficient efficacy or aggravated toxicity. Accurate quantification of DDIs is therefore crucial but may be difficult when full concentration-time profiles are problematic to obtain. We have compared non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and model-based predictions of DDIs for long half-life drugs by conducting simulation studies and reviewing published trials, using antituberculosis drug bedaquiline (BDQ) as a model compound. Furthermore, different DDI study designs were evaluated. A sequential design mimicking conducted trials and a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of BDQ and the M2 metabolite were utilized in the simulations where five interaction scenarios from strong inhibition (clearance fivefold decreased) to strong induction (clearance fivefold increased) were evaluated. In trial simulations, NCA systematically under-predicted the DDIs’ impact. The bias in average exposure was 29–96% for BDQ and 20–677% for M2. The model-based analysis generated unbiased predictions, and simultaneous fitting of metabolite data increased precision in DDI predictions. The discrepancy between the methods was also apparent for conducted trials, e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir was predicted to increased BDQ exposure 22% by NCA and 188% by model-based methods. In the design evaluation, studies with parallel designs were considered and shown to generally be inferior to sequential/cross-over designs. However, in the case of low inter-individual variability and no informative metabolite data, a prolonged parallel design could be favored. Model-based analysis for DDI assessments is preferable over NCA for victim drugs with a long half-life and should always be used when incomplete concentration-time profiles are part of the analysis.",

A total of 859 baseline profiles of testosterone from hypogonadal men were included in this analysis. The circadian rhythm of the testosterone was described by a stretched cosine function. Model parameters were estimated using NONMEM(®) 7.3. The effect of different covariates on the testosterone levels was investigated. Model evaluation was performed using non-parametric bootstrap and predictive checks. A stretched cosine function deeply improved the data goodness of fit compared to the standard trigonometric function (p < 0.001; ΔOFV = -204). The effect of the age and the semester, defined as winter and spring versus summer and fall, were significantly associated with the baseline levels of testosterone (p < 0.001, ΔOFV = -15.6, and p < 0.001, ΔOFV = -47.0). Model evaluation procedures such as diagnostic plots, visual predictive check, and non-parametric bootstrap evidenced that the proposed stretched cosine function was able to model the time course of the diurnal testosterone levels in hypogonadal males with accuracy and precision. The circadian rhythm of the testosterone levels was better predicted by the proposed stretched cosine function than a standard cosine function. Testosterone levels decreased by 5.74 ng/dL (2.4%) every 10 years and were 19.3 ng/dL (8.1%) higher during winter and spring compared to summer and fall.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this pharmacokinetics (PK) study was to investigate whether different release kinetics from bupropion hydrochloride (HCl) immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (ER) formulations alter its metabolism and to test the hypothesis that the unsuccessful bioequivalence (BE) study of the higher strength (300 mg) of bupropion HCl ER tablets based on the successful BE study of the lower strength (150 mg) was due to metabolic saturation in the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen. A randomized six-way crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers. During each period, subjects took a single dose of IR (75/100 mg), SR (100/150 mg), or ER (150/300 mg) formulations of bupropion HCl; plasma samples for PK analysis were collected from 0–96 h for all formulations. In addition, each subject's whole blood was collected for the genotyping of various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of bupropion's major metabolic enzymes. The data indicates that the relative bioavailability of the ER formulations was 72.3–78.8% compared with IR 75 mg. No differences were observed for ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) of metabolite to AUC of parent for the three major metabolites. The pharmacogenomics analysis suggested no statistically significant correlation between polymorphisms and PK parameters of the various formulations. Altogether, these data suggested that the different release kinetics of the formulations did not change metabolites-to-parent ratio. Therefore, the differing BE result between the 150 and 300 mg bupropion HCl ER tablets was unlikely due to the metabolic saturation in the GI lumen caused by different release patterns.",

    "abstract": "A quantitative systems toxicology (QST) model for citalopram was established to simulate, in silico, a 'virtual twin' of a real patient to predict the occurrence of cardiotoxic events previously reported in patients under various clinical conditions. The QST model considers the effects of citalopram and its most notable electrophysiologically active primary (desmethylcitalopram) and secondary (didesmethylcitalopram) metabolites, on cardiac electrophysiology. The in vitro cardiac ion channel current inhibition data was coupled with the biophysically detailed model of human cardiac electrophysiology to investigate the impact of (i) the inhibition of multiple ion currents (IKr, IKs, ICaL); (ii) the inclusion of metabolites in the QST model; and (iii) unbound or total plasma as the operating drug concentration, in predicting clinically observed QT prolongation. The inclusion of multiple ion channel current inhibition and metabolites in the simulation with unbound plasma citalopram concentration provided the lowest prediction error. The predictive performance of the model was verified with three additional therapeutic and supra-therapeutic drug exposure clinical cases. The results indicate that considering only the hERG ion channel inhibition of only the parent drug is potentially misleading, and the inclusion of active metabolite data and the influence of other ion channel currents should be considered to improve the prediction of potential cardiac toxicity. Mechanistic modelling can help bridge the gaps existing in the quantitative translation from preclinical cardiac safety assessment to clinical toxicology. Moreover, this study shows that the QST models, in combination with appropriate drug and systems parameters, can pave the way towards personalised safety assessment.",

Herein, this model was extended and applied for the prediction of oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin and its enantiomers to provide a mechanistic explanation of the higher relative bioavailability observed for oxybutynin's modified-release OROS® formulation compared to its immediate-release (IR) counterpart. The expansion of the model involved the incorporation of mechanistic equations for the prediction of release, transit, dissolution, permeation and first-pass metabolism. The predicted pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin enantiomers after oral administration for both the IR and OROS® formulations were in close agreement with the observed data. The predicted absolute bioavailability for the IR formulation was within 5% of the observed value, and the model adequately predicted the higher relative bioavailability observed for the OROS® formulation vs. the IR counterpart. From the model predictions, it can be noticed that the higher bioavailability observed for the OROS® formulation was mainly attributable to differences in the intestinal availability (F G ) rather than due to a higher colonic f abs , thus confirming previous hypotheses. The predicted f abs was almost 70% lower for the OROS® formulation compared to the IR formulation, whereas the F G was almost eightfold higher than in the IR formulation. These results provide further support to the hypothesis of an increased F G as the main factor responsible for the higher bioavailability of oxybutynin's OROS® formulation vs. the IR.",

    "abstract": "Rating and composite scales are commonly used to assess treatment efficacy. The two main strategies for modelling such endpoints are to treat them as a continuous or an ordered categorical variable (CV or OC). Both strategies have disadvantages, including making assumptions that violate the integer nature of the data (CV) and requiring many parameters for scales with many response categories (OC). We present a method, called the bounded integer (BI) model, which utilises the probit function with fixed cut-offs to estimate the probability of a certain score through a latent variable. This method was successfully implemented to describe six data sets from four different therapeutic areas: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain. Five scales were investigated, ranging from 11 to 181 categories. The fit (likelihood) was better for the BI model than for corresponding OC or CV models (ΔAIC range 11-1555) in all cases but one (∆AIC - 63), while the number of parameters was the same or lower. Markovian elements were successfully implemented within the method. The performance in external validation, assessed through cross-validation, was also in favour of the new model (ΔOFV range 22-1694) except in one case (∆OFV - 70). A residual for diagnostic purposes is discussed. This study shows that the BI model respects the integer nature of data and is parsimonious in terms of number of estimated parameters.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is an activator of the AMPK and Nrf2 pathways which are important in the pathology of several complex pulmonary diseases with unmet medical needs. Organic solution advanced spray drying in the absence of water in closed-mode was used to design and develop respirable dry powders. Following comprehensive characterization, the influence of physicochemical properties was correlated with performance as aerosols using inertial impaction and three different human dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices varying in device properties. In vitro cell assays were conducted to test safety in 2D human pulmonary cell lines and in 3D small airway epithelia comprising primary cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI). In addition, in vitro transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was carried out. Metformin remained crystalline following advanced spray drying under these conditions. All SD powders consisted of nanoparticles/microparticles in the solid state. In vitro aerosol dispersion performance showed high aerosolization for all SD metformin powders with all DPI devices tested. High emitted dose for all powders with all three DPI devices was measured. Differences in other aerosol performance parameters and the interplay between the properties of different formulations produced at specific pump rates and the three different DPI devices were correlated with spray drying pump rate and device properties. Safety over a wide metformin dose range was also demonstrated in vitro. Aerosol delivery of metformin nanoparticles/microparticles has the potential to be a new \"first-in-class\" therapeutic for the treatment of a number of pulmonary diseases including pulmonary vascular diseases such as pulmonary hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this study was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model predicting the pharmacokinetics (PK) of different compounds in pregnant subjects. This model considers the differences in tissue sizes, blood flow rates, enzyme expression levels, glomerular filtration rates, plasma protein binding, and other factors affected during pregnancy in both the maternal and fetal models. The PBPKPlus™ module in GastroPlus ® was used to model the PK of cefuroxime and cefazolin. For both compounds, the model was first validated against PK data in healthy non-pregnant volunteers and then applied to predict pregnant groups PK. The model accurately described the PK in both non-pregnant and pregnant groups and explained well differences in the plasma concentration due to pregnancy. The fetal plasma and amniotic fluid concentrations were also predicted reasonably well at different stages of pregnancy. This work describes the use of a PBPK approach for drug development and demonstrates the ability to predict differences in PK in pregnant subjects and fetal exposure for compounds excreted renally. The prediction for pregnant groups is also improved when the model is calibrated with postpartum or non-pregnant female group if such data are available.",

    "abstract": "Decades of discussion and publication have gone into the guidance from the scientific community and the regulatory agencies on the use and validation of pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic assays by chromatographic and ligand binding assays for the measurement of drugs and metabolites. These assay validations are well described in the FDA Guidance on Bioanalytical Methods Validation (BMV, 2018). While the BMV included biomarker assay validation, the focus was on understanding the challenges posed in validating biomarker assays and the importance of having reliable biomarker assays when used for regulatory submissions, rather than definition of the appropriate experiments to be performed. Different from PK bioanalysis, analysis of biomarkers can be challenging due to the presence of target analyte(s) in the control matrices used for calibrator and quality control sample preparation, and greater difficulty in procuring appropriate reference standards representative of the endogenous molecule. Several papers have been published offering recommendations for biomarker assay validation. The situational nature of biomarker applications necessitates fit-for-purpose (FFP) assay validation. A unifying theme for FFP analysis is that method validation requirements be consistent with the proposed context of use (COU) for any given biomarker. This communication provides specific recommendations for biomarker assay validation (BAV) by LC-MS, for both small and large molecule biomarkers. The consensus recommendations include creation of a validation plan that contains definition of the COU of the assay, use of the PK assay validation elements that support the COU, and definition of assay validation elements adapted to fit biomarker assays and the acceptance criteria for both.",

Human serum albumin was lyophilized with sucrose or trehalose in histidine, phosphate, or citrate buffer. 1 H T 1 relaxation times were measured by solid-state NMR spectroscopy and were used to assess the homogeneity and mobility of the samples after zero, six, and twelve months at different temperatures. The mobility of the samples decreased after 6 and 12 months storage at elevated temperatures, consistent with structural relaxation of the amorphous disaccharide matrix. Formulations with sucrose had lower mobility and greater stability than formulations with trehalose.",

    "abstract": "The paper highlights the necessity for a robust regulatory framework for assessing nanomedicines and their off-patent counterparts, termed as nanosimilar, which could be considered as 'similar' to the prototype nanomedicine,based on essential criteria describing the 'similarity'. The term 'similarity' should be focused on criteria that describe nanocarriers, encompassing their physicochemical, thermodynamic, morphological, and biological properties, including surface interactions and pharmacokinetics. Nanocarriers can be regarded as advanced self-assembled excipients (ASAEs) due to their complexity and chaotic behavior and should be evaluated by using essential criteria in order for off-patent nanomedicines be termed as nanosimilars, from a regulatory perspective. Collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory bodies, and artificial intelligence (AI) startups is pivotal for the precise characterization and approval processes for nanomedicines and nanosimilars and embracing innovative tools and terminology facilitates the development of a sustainable regulatory framework, ensuring safety and efficacy. This crucial shift toward precision R&D practices addresses the complexity inherent in nanocarriers, paving the way for therapeutic advancements with economic benefits.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the use of quinidine microdialysis to study potential changes in brain P-glycoprotein functionality after induction of status epilepticus (SE) by kainate. Rats were infused with 10 or 20 mg/kg quinidine over 30 min or 4 h. Plasma, brain extracellular fluid (brain ECF), and end-of-experiment total brain concentrations of quinidine were determined during 7 h after the start of the infusion. Effect of pretreatment with tariquidar (15 mg/kg, administered 30 min before the start of the quinidine infusion) on the brain distribution of quinidine was assessed. This approach was repeated in kainate-treated rats. Quinidine kinetics were analyzed with population modeling (NONMEM). The quinidine microdialysis assay clearly revealed differences in brain distribution upon changes in P-glycoprotein functionality by pre-administration of tariquidar, which resulted in a 7.2-fold increase in brain ECF and a 40-fold increase in total brain quinidine concentration. After kainate treatment alone, however, no difference in quinidine transport across the blood-brain barrier was found, but kainate-treated rats tended to have a lower total brain concentration but a higher brain ECF concentration of quinidine than saline-treated rats. This study did not provide evidence for the hypothesis that P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier is altered at 1 week after SE induction, but rather suggests that P-glycoprotein function might be altered at the brain parenchymal level.",

    "abstract": "As biomarkers continue to become an integral part of drug development and decision-making, there are increased expectations for reliable and quantitative assays. Protein biomarker assay results are directly influenced by the calibrator material. The selection of calibrator material presents many challenges that impact the relative accuracy and performance of the assay. There is an industry-wide challenge finding reliable and well-characterized calibrator material with good documentation. Several case studies are presented that demonstrate some of the challenges involved in selecting appropriate calibrators along with the resolutions that were ultimately applied. From these experiences, we present here a set of recommendations for selecting and characterizing calibrator material based on the intended purpose of the assay. Finally, we introduce a commutability approach, based on common clinical chemistry practices, which can be used to demonstrate inter-changeability with calibrator materials across multiple lots and technology platforms for all types of protein biomarker assays.",

    "abstract": "Combination therapies are widely accepted as a cornerstone for treatment of different cancer types. A tumor growth inhibition (TGI) model is developed for combinations of cetuximab and cisplatin obtained from xenograft mice. Unlike traditional TGI models, both natural cell growth and cell death are considered explicitly. The growth rate was estimated to 0.006 h−1 and the natural cell death to 0.0039 h−1 resulting in a tumor doubling time of 14 days. The tumor static concentrations (TSC) are predicted for each individual compound. When the compounds are given as single-agents, the required concentrations were computed to be 506 μg · mL−1 and 56 ng · mL−1 for cetuximab and cisplatin, respectively. A TSC curve is constructed for different combinations of the two drugs, which separates concentration combinations into regions of tumor shrinkage and tumor growth. The more concave the TSC curve is, the lower is the total exposure to test compounds necessary to achieve tumor regression. The TSC curve for cetuximab and cisplatin showed weak concavity.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we derive explicit expressions for the concentrations of ligand L, target R and ligand-target complex RL at steady state for the classical model describing target-mediated drug disposition, in the presence of a constant-rate infusion of ligand. We demonstrate that graphing the steady-state values of ligand, target and ligand-target complex, we obtain striking and often singular patterns, which yield a great deal of insight and understanding about the underlying processes. Deriving explicit expressions for the dependence of L, R and RL on the infusion rate, and displaying graphs of the relations between L, R and RL, we give qualitative and quantitive information for the experimentalist about the processes involved. Understanding target turnover is pivotal for optimising these processes when target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) prevails. By a combination of mathematical analysis and simulations, we also show that the evolution of the three concentration profiles towards their respective steady-states can be quite complex, especially for lower infusion rates. We also show how parameter estimates obtained from iv bolus studies can be used to derive steady-state concentrations of ligand, target and complex. The latter may serve as a template for future experimental designs.",

    "abstract": "Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models can over-predict maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) following intravenous administration. A proposed explanation is that invariably PBPK models report the concentration in the central venous compartment, rather than the site where the samples are drawn. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate potential corrective models based on anatomy and physiology governing the blood supply at the site of sampling and incorporate them into a PBPK platform. Four models were developed and scrutinised for their corrective potential. All assumed the peripheral sampling site concentration could be described by contributions from surrounding tissues and utilised tissue-specific concentration-time profiles reported from the full-PBPK model within the Simcyp Simulator. Predicted concentrations for the peripheral site were compared to the observed C(max). The models results were compared to clinical data for 15 studies over seven compounds (alprazolam, imipramine, metoprolol, midazolam, omeprazole, rosiglitazone and theophylline). The final model utilised tissue concentrations from adipose, skin, muscle and a contribution from artery. Predicted C(max) values considering the central venous compartment can over-predict the observed values up to 10-fold whereas the new sampling site predictions were within 2-fold of observed values. The model was particularly relevant for studies where traditional PBPK models over-predict early time point concentrations. A successful corrective model for C(max) prediction has been developed, subject to further validation. These models can be enrolled as built-up modules into PBPK platforms and potentially account for factors that may affect the initial mixing of the blood at the site of sampling.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of emerging genomics technologies and their application for assessing safety and efficacy of FDA-regulated products require a high standard of reliability and robustness supporting regulatory decision-making in the FDA. To facilitate the regulatory application, the FDA implemented a novel data submission program, Voluntary Genomics Data Submission (VGDS), and also to engage the stakeholders. As part of the endeavor, for the past 10 years, the FDA has led an international consortium of regulatory agencies, academia, pharmaceutical companies, and genomics platform providers, which was named MicroArray Quality Control Consortium (MAQC), to address issues such as reproducibility, precision, specificity/sensitivity, and data interpretation. Three projects have been completed so far assessing these genomics technologies: gene expression microarrays, whole genome genotyping arrays, and whole transcriptome sequencing (i.e., RNA-seq). The resultant studies provide the basic parameters for fit-for-purpose application of these new data streams in regulatory environments, and the solutions have been made available to the public through peer-reviewed publications. The latest MAQC project is also called the SEquencing Quality Control (SEQC) project focused on next-generation sequencing. Using reference samples with built-in controls, SEQC studies have demonstrated that relative gene expression can be measured accurately and reliably across laboratories and RNA-seq platforms. Besides prediction performance comparable to microarrays in clinical settings and safety assessments, RNA-seq is shown to have better sensitivity for low expression and reveal novel transcriptomic features. Future effort of MAQC will be focused on quality control of whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing.",

This Draft Guidance succeeds in acknowledging the complexity of these products, as well as the challenges associated with approving safe and therapeutically equivalent complex generic versions. However, the challenge posed by the manufacturing process for drugs containing nanomaterials is insufficiently addressed. The critical quality attributes of such products cannot be properly defined, and therefore it is not possible to design informative comparative physicochemical assessments for equivalence. As a consequence, the 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway, currently advised as the standard from the FDA, is not suitable for the approval of complex generic products. Drawing from the successful story of biologics, we propose instead a stepwise totality-of-evidence approach, demonstrating similarity and including clinical studies when deemed necessary, as an appropriate alternative to the 505(j) ANDA pathway.",

    "abstract": "Previous research showed that scaling drug clearance from adults to children based on body weight alone is not accurate for all hepatically cleared drugs in very young children. This study systematically assesses the accuracy of scaling methods that, in addition to body weight, also take age-based variables into account for drugs undergoing hepatic metabolism in children younger than five years, namely scaling with (1) a body weight-based function using an age-dependent exponent (ADE) and (2) a body weight-based function with fixed exponent of 0.75 (AS0.75) combined with isoenzyme maturation functions (MFPBPK) similar to those implemented in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models (AS0.75 + MFPBPK). A PBPK-based simulation workflow was used, including hypothetical drugs with a wide range of properties and metabolized by different isoenzymes. Adult clearance values were scaled to seven typical children between one day and four years. Prediction errors of ± 50% were considered reasonably accurate. Isoenzyme maturation was found to be an important driver of changes in hepatic metabolic clearance in children younger than five years, which prevents the systematic accuracy of ADE scaling. AS0.75 + MFPBPK, when accounting for maturation of isoenzymes and microsomal protein per gram of liver (MPPGL), can reasonably accurately scale hepatic metabolic clearance for all low and intermediate extraction ratio drugs except for drugs binding to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in neonates. As differences in the impact of changes in system-specific parameters on drugs with different properties yield differences in clearance ontogeny, it is unlikely that for the remaining drugs, scaling methods that do not take drug properties into account will be systematically accurate.",

We analyzed individual target lesions (iTLs) of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) to determine differences in TS dynamics by using the ClassIfication Clustering of Individual Lesions (CICIL) methodology. Results from subgroup analyses comparing genetic mutations and TS metrics were assessed and applied to survival analyses. Data from four mCRC clinical studies were analyzed (1781 patients, 6369 iTLs). CICIL was used to assess differences in lesion TS dynamics within a tissue (intra-class) or across different tissues (inter-class). First, lesions were automatically classified based on their location. Cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) determined if each pair of lesions followed similar or opposite dynamics. Finally, CCs were grouped by using the K-means clustering method. Heterogeneity in tumor dynamics was lower in the intra-class analysis than in the inter-class analysis for patients receiving cetuximab. More tumor heterogeneity was found in KRAS mutated patients compared to KRAS wild-type (KRASwt) patients and when using sum of longest diameters versus sum of products of diameters. Tumor heterogeneity quantified as the median patient’s CC was found to be a predictor of overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.08–1.92), especially in KRASwt patients. Intra- and inter-tumor tissue heterogeneities were assessed with CICIL. Derived metrics of heterogeneity were found to be a predictor of OS time. Considering differences between lesions’ TS dynamics could improve oncology models in favor of a better prediction of OS.",

This study aims to investigate the potential use of IPL data to predict rat in vivo lung absorption. Absorption parameters determined from IPL data ( ex vivo input parameters) in combination with intravenously determined pharmacokinetic data were used in a biopharmaceutics model to predict experimental rat in vivo plasma concentration-time profiles and lung amount after inhalation of five different inhalation compounds. The performance of simulations using ex vivo input parameters was compared with simulations using in vitro input parameters, to determine whether and to what extent predictability could be improved by using input parameters determined from the more complex ex vivo model. Simulations using ex vivo input parameters were within twofold average difference (AAFE &lt; 2) from experimental in vivo data for all compounds except one. Furthermore, simulations using ex vivo input parameters performed significantly better than simulations using in vitro input parameters in predicting in vivo lung absorption. It could therefore be advantageous to base predictions of drug performance on IPL data rather than on in vitro data during drug development to increase mechanistic understanding of pulmonary drug absorption and to better understand how different substance properties and formulations might affect in vivo behavior of inhalation compounds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tissue decellularization yields complex scaffolds with retained composition and structure, and plants offer an inexhaustible natural source of numerous shapes. Plant tissue could be a solution for regenerative organ replacement strategies and advanced in vitro modeling, as biofunctionalization of decellularized tissue allows adhesion of various kinds of human cells that can grow into functional tissue. Here, we investigated the potential of spinach leaf vasculature and chive stems for kidney tubule engineering to apply in tubular transport studies. We successfully decellularized both plant tissues and confirmed general scaffold suitability for topical recellularization with renal cells. However, due to anatomical restrictions, we believe that spinach and chive vasculature themselves cannot be recellularized by current methods. Moreover, gradual tissue disintegration and deficient diffusion capacity make decellularized plant scaffolds unsuitable for kidney tubule engineering, which relies on transepithelial solute exchange between two compartments. We conclude that plant-derived structures and biomaterials need to be carefully considered and possibly integrated with other tissue engineering technologies for enhanced capabilities.",

The current study investigated the impact of Hypromellose (HPMC) presence and varying viscosity type, when used as a binder in immediate release formulations, on the apparent solubility of drugs with wide range of physicochemical properties (drug ionization, drug lipophilicity, drug aqueous solubility). The role of physiological conditions on the impact of excipients on drug apparent solubility was assessed with the use of pharmacopoeia (compendial) and biorelevant media. Presence of HPMC affected drug solubility according to the physicochemical properties of studied compounds. The possible combined effects of polymer adsorption (drug shielding effect) or the formation of a polymeric viscous layer around drug particles may have retarded drug dissolution leading to reduced apparent solubility of highly soluble and/or highly ionized compounds and were pronounced mainly at early time points. Increase in the apparent solubility of poorly soluble low ionized drugs containing a neutral amine group was observed which may relate to enhanced drug solubilization or reduced drug precipitation. The use of multivariate data analysis confirmed the importance of drug physicochemical properties on the impact of excipients on drug apparent solubility and revealed that changes in HPMC material properties or amount may not be critical for oral drug performance when HPMC is used as a binder. The construction of a roadmap combining drug, excipient, and medium characteristics allowed the identification of the cases where HPMC presence may present risks in oral drug performance and bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glomerular filtration (GF) and active tubular secretion (ATS) contribute to renal drug elimination, with the latter remaining understudied across the pediatric age range. Therefore, we systematically analyzed the influence of transporter ontogeny on the relative contribution of GF and ATS to renal clearance CL R for drugs with different properties in children. A physiology-based model for CL R in adults was extrapolated to the pediatric population by including maturation functions for the system-specific parameters. This model was used to predict GF and ATS for hypothetical drugs with a range of drug-specific properties, including transporter-mediated intrinsic clearance (CL int,T ) values, that are substrates for renal secretion transporters with different ontogeny patterns. To assess the impact of transporter ontogeny on ATS and total CL R , a percentage prediction difference (%PD) was calculated between the predicted CL R in the presence and absence of transporter ontogeny. The contribution of ATS to CL R ranges between 41 and 90% in children depending on fraction unbound and CL int,T values. If ontogeny of renal transporters is &lt; 0.2 of adult values, CL R predictions are unacceptable (%PD &gt; 50%) for the majority of drugs regardless of the pediatric age. Ignoring ontogeny patterns of secretion transporters increasing with age in children younger than 2 years results in CL R predictions that are not systematically acceptable for all hypothetical drugs (%PD &gt; 50% for some drugs). This analysis identified for what drug-specific properties and at what ages the contribution of ATS on total pediatric CL R cannot be ignored. Drugs with these properties may be sensitive in vivo probes to investigate transporter ontogeny.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent changes in the pharmaceutical industry have led to significant paradigm shifts in the pharmaceutical quality environment. Globalization of the pharmaceutical industry, increasingly rapid development of novel therapies, and adoption of new manufacturing techniques have presented numerous challenges for the established regulatory framework and quality environment and are impacting the approaches utilized to ensure the quality of pharmaceutical products. Regulators, industry, and standards-setting organizations have begun to recognize the need to rely more on integrated risk-based approaches and to create more nimble and flexible standards to complement these efforts. They also increasingly have recognized that quality needs to be built into systems and processes throughout the lifecycle of the product. Moreover, the recent COVID-19 crisis has emphasized the need to adopt practices that better promote global supply chain resilience. In this paper, the USP Quality Advisory Group explores the various paradigm shifts currently impacting pharmaceutical quality and the approaches that are being taken to adapt to this new environment. Broad adoption of the Analytical Procedure Lifecycle approach, improved data management, and utilization of digital technologies are identified as potential solutions that can help meet the challenges of these quality paradigm shifts. Further discussion and collaboration among stakeholders are needed to pursue these and other solutions that can ensure a continued focus on quality while facilitating pharmaceutical innovation and development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ritlecitinib is a selective, covalent, irreversible inhibitor of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) family kinases. Pharmacokinetics and safety of ritlecitinib in participants with hepatic (Study 1) or renal (Study 2) impairment were to be characterized from two phase I studies. Due to a study pause caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study 2 healthy participant (HP) cohort was not recruited; however, the demography of the severe renal impairment cohort closely matched the study 1 HP cohort. We present results from each study and two innovative approaches to utilizing available HP data as reference data for study 2: a statistical approach using analysis of variance and an in silico simulation of an HP cohort created using a population pharmacokinetics (POPPK) model derived from several ritlecitinib studies. For study 1, the observed area under the curve for 24-h dosing interval and maximum plasma concentration for HPs and their observed geometric mean ratios (participants with moderate hepatic impairment vs HPs) were within 90% prediction intervals from the POPPK simulation-based approach, thereby validating the latter approach. When applied to study 2, both the statistical and POPPK simulation approaches demonstrated that patients with renal impairment would not require ritlecitinib dose modification. In both phase I studies, ritlecitinib was generally safe and well tolerated. These analyses represent a new methodology for generating reference HP cohorts in special population studies for drugs in development with well-characterized pharmacokinetics in HPs and adequate POPPK models.

    "abstract": "Abstract Stepwise covariate modeling (SCM) has a high computational burden and can select the wrong covariates. Machine learning (ML) has been proposed as a screening tool to improve the efficiency of covariate selection, but little is known about how to apply ML on actual clinical data. First, we simulated datasets based on clinical data to compare the performance of various ML and traditional pharmacometrics (PMX) techniques with and without accounting for highly-correlated covariates. This simulation step identified the ML algorithm and the number of top covariates to select when using the actual clinical data. A previously developed desipramine population-pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate virtual subjects. Fifteen covariates were considered with four having an effect included. Based on the F1 score (an accuracy measure), ridge regression was the most accurate ML technique on 200 simulated datasets (F1 score = 0.475 ± 0.231), a performance which almost doubled when highly-correlated covariates were accounted for (F1 score = 0.860 ± 0.158). These performances were better than forwards selection with SCM (F1 score = 0.251 ± 0.274 and 0.499 ± 0.381 without/with correlations respectively). In terms of computational cost, ridge regression (0.42 ± 0.07 seconds/simulated dataset, 1 thread) was ~20,000 times faster than SCM (2.30 ± 2.29 hours, 15 threads). On the clinical dataset, prescreening with the selected ML algorithm reduced SCM runtime by 42.86% (from 1.75 to 1.00 days) and produced the same final model as SCM only. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that accounting for highly-correlated covariates improves ML prescreening accuracy. The choice of ML method and the proportion of important covariates (unknown a priori ) can be guided by simulations. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Synthetic cathinones represent one of the largest and most abused new psychoactive substance classes, and have been involved in numerous intoxications and fatalities worldwide. Methcathinone analogues like 3-methylmethcathinone (3-MMC), 3-chloromethcathinone (3-CMC), and 4-CMC currently constitute most of synthetic cathinone seizures in Europe. Documenting their consumption in clinical/forensic casework is therefore essential to tackle this trend. Targeting metabolite markers is a go-to to document consumption in analytical toxicology, and metabolite profiling is crucial to support investigations. We sought to identify 3-CMC, 4-CMC, and 4-bromomethcathinone (4-BMC) human metabolites. The substances were incubated with human hepatocytes; incubates were screened by liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry and data were mined with Compound Discoverer (Themo Scientific). 3-CMC-positive blood, urine, and oral fluid and 4-CMC-positive urine and saliva from clinical/forensic casework were analyzed. Analyses were supported by metabolite predictions with GLORYx freeware. Twelve, ten, and ten metabolites were identified for 3-CMC, 4-CMC, and 4-BMC, respectively, with similar transformations occurring for the three cathinones. Major reactions included ketoreduction and N -demethylation. Surprisingly, predominant metabolites were produced by combination of N -demethylation and ω-carboxylation (main metabolite in 3-CMC-positive urine), and combination of β-ketoreduction, oxidative deamination, and O -glucuronidation (main metabolite in 4-CMC-positive urine). These latter metabolites were detected in negative-ionization mode only and their non-conjugated form was not detected after glucuronide hydrolysis; this metabolic pathway was never reported for any methcathinone analogue susceptible to undergo the same transformations. These results support the need for comprehensive screening strategies in metabolite identification studies, to avoid overlooking significant metabolites and major markers of consumption.

    "abstract": "Diverse neuropeptides participate in cell-cell communication to coordinate neuronal and endocrine regulation of physiological processes in health and disease. Neuropeptides are short peptides ranging in length from ~3 to 40 amino acid residues that are involved in biological functions of pain, stress, obesity, hypertension, mental disorders, cancer, and numerous health conditions. The unique neuropeptide sequences define their specific biological actions. Significantly, this review article discusses how the neuropeptide field is at the crest of expanding knowledge gained from mass-spectrometry-based neuropeptidomic studies, combined with proteomic analyses for understanding the biosynthesis of neuropeptidomes. The ongoing expansion in neuropeptide diversity lies in the unbiased and global mass-spectrometry-based approaches for identification and quantitation of peptides. Current mass spectrometry technology allows definition of neuropeptide amino acid sequence structures, profiling of multiple neuropeptides in normal and disease conditions, and quantitative peptide measures in biomarker applications to monitor therapeutic drug efficacies. Complementary proteomic studies of neuropeptide secretory vesicles provide valuable insight into the protein processes utilized for neuropeptide production, storage, and secretion. Furthermore, ongoing research in developing new computational tools will facilitate advancements in mass-spectrometry-based identification of small peptides. Knowledge of the entire repertoire of neuropeptides that regulate physiological systems will provide novel insight into regulatory mechanisms in health, disease, and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "In this work, an alternative model to discrete-time Markov model (DTMM) or standard continuous-time Markov model (CTMM) for analyzing ordered categorical data with Markov properties is presented: the minimal CTMM (mCTMM). Through a CTMM reparameterization and under the assumption that the transition rate between two consecutive states is independent on the state, the Markov property is expressed through a single parameter, the mean equilibration time, and the steady-state probabilities are described by a proportional odds (PO) model. The mCTMM performance was evaluated and compared to the PO model (ignoring Markov features) and to published Markov models using three real data examples: the four-state fatigue and hand-foot syndrome data in cancer patients initially described by DTMM and the 11-state Likert pain score data in diabetic patients previously analyzed with a count model including Markovian transition probability inflation. The mCTMM better described the data than the PO model, and adequately predicted the average number of transitions per patient and the maximum achieved scores in all examples. As expected, mCTMM could not describe the data as well as more flexible DTMM but required fewer estimated parameters. The mCTMM better fitted Likert data than the count model. The mCTMM enables to explore the effect of potential predictive factors such as drug exposure and covariates, on ordered categorical data, while accounting for Markov features, in cases where DTMM and/or standard CTMM is not applicable or conveniently implemented, e.g., non-uniform time intervals between observations or large number of categories.",

    "abstract": "Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (FN) are serious side effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy which may be alleviated with the administration of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) derivatives, such as pegfilgrastim (PG) which increases absolute neutrophil count (ANC). In this work, a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model was developed based on data obtained from healthy volunteers receiving multiple administrations of PG. The developed model was a bidirectional PKPD model, where PG stimulated the proliferation, maturation, and margination of neutrophils and where circulating neutrophils in turn increased the elimination of PG. Simulations from the developed model show disproportionate changes in response with changes in dose. A dose increase of 10% from the 6 mg therapeutic dose taken as a reference leads to area under the curve (AUC) increases of ~50 and ~5% for PK and PD, respectively. A full random effects covariate model showed that little of the parameter variability could be explained by sex, age, body size, and race. As a consequence, little of the secondary parameter variability (Cmax and AUC of PG and ANC) could be explained by these covariates.",

    "abstract": "Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated RNAi interference (RNAi) is a powerful post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism which can be used to study the function of genes in vitro (cell cultures) and in vivo (animal models). However, there is a translational gap between these models. Hence, there is a need for novel experimental models that combine the advantages of in vitro and in vivo models (e.g., simplicity, flexibility, throughput, and representability) to study the effects of siRNA. This need may be addressed by precision-cut tissue slices (PCTS), which represent an ex vivo model that mimics the structural and functional characteristics of a whole organ. The goal of this study was to investigate whether self-deliverable siRNA (Accell siRNA) can be used in precision-cut lung slices (PCLuS) and precision-cut kidney slices (PCKS) to achieve RNAi ex vivo. PCLuS and PCKS were prepared from mouse tissue, and they were subsequently incubated up to 48 h with no siRNA (untransfected), non-targeting Accell siRNA, or Gapdh-targeting Accell siRNA. Significant Gapdh mRNA silencing was achieved (PCLuS ~ 55%; PCKS ~ 40%) without compromising the viability and morphology of slices. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that Accell siRNA diffused into PCLuS and PCKS. Spontaneous inflammation upon incubation was observed in PCLuS and PCKS as shown by a higher mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines Il1b, Il6, and Tnfa, although Accell siRNA appeared to diminish this response in PCLuS after 24 h. In conclusion, this ex vivo transfection model can be used to evaluate the effects of siRNA in relevant biological environments.",

    "abstract": "Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) pose a potential risk to patient safety and efficacy and are routinely monitored during clinical trials. Pre-existing drug-reactive antibodies are present in patients without prior drug exposure and are defined by their ability to bind to a component of the drug. These pre-existing drug-reactive antibodies are frequently observed and could represent an adaptive immune response of an individual who has been previously exposed to antigens with structural similarities to the biotherapeutic. Clinical consequences of these antibodies can vary from no impact to adverse effects on patient safety, exposure, and efficacy, and are highly dependent on biotherapeutic modality, disease indications, and patient demographics. This paper describes how the immunogenicity risk assessment of a biotherapeutic integrates the existence of pre-existing drug-reactive antibodies, and provides recommendations for risk-based strategies to evaluate treatment-emergent ADA responses.",

    "abstract": "We previously performed a comparative assessment of tissue-level vascular physiological parameters in mice and rats, two of the most commonly utilized species in translational drug development. The present work extends this effort to non-human primates by measuring tissue- and organ-level vascular volumes (Vv), interstitial volumes (Vi), and blood flow rates (Q) in cynomolgus monkeys. These measurements were accomplished by red blood cell labeling, extracellular marker infusion, and rubidium chloride bolus distribution, respectively, the same methods used in previous rodent measurements. In addition, whole-body blood volumes (BV) were determined across species. The results demonstrate that Vv, Vi, and Q, measured using our methods scale approximately by body weight across mouse, rat, and monkey in the tissues considered here, where allometric analysis allowed extrapolation to human parameters. Significant differences were observed between the values determined in this study and those reported in the literature, including Vv in muscle, brain, and skin and Q in muscle, adipose, heart, thymus, and spleen. The impact of these differences for selected tissues was evaluated via sensitivity analysis using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. The blood-brain barrier in monkeys was shown to be more impervious to an infused radioactive tracer, indium-111-pentetate, than in mice or rats. The body weight-normalized total BV measured in monkey agreed well with previously measured value in rats but was lower than that in mice. These findings have important implications for the common practice of scaling physiological parameters from rodents to primates in translational pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with both immediate- and extended-release (ER) formulations that are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Long-term exposure from the ER formulation is achieved through slow peptide release from a degradable microsphere formulation. The goal of this analysis was to develop a pharmacokinetic model for the ER formulation following single and once-weekly multiple-dose administration. Pharmacokinetic data were collected from two clinical trials—one that evaluated single-dose administration of 2.5, 5, 7, and 10 mg of ER exenatide and a second that included weekly administration of 0.8 and 2 mg for 15 weeks. A population pharmacokinetic model, describing 1586 exenatide concentrations from 64 patients, was developed in the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software program NONMEM. Pharmacokinetics of the ER formulation was described by a two-compartment model with linear and nonlinear elimination. The complex absorption profile was quantified using three simultaneous processes: a first-order process characterizing a rapid initial release and two series of transit compartments to describe the second (∼3 weeks postinjection) and third phases of drug release (∼7 weeks postinjection). Estimation of the combined single- and multiple-dose data adequately described the rise to steady-state (∼8–10 weeks) and decline to undetectable concentrations that occurred about 10 weeks after treatment cessation. Thus, a population-based pharmacokinetic model was developed that provides a platform for future pharmacodynamic analyses with the ER formulation of exenatide.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Peptides are used to control the pharmacokinetic profiles of nanoparticles due to their ability to influence tissue accumulation and cellular interactions. However, beyond the study of specific peptides, there is a lack of understanding of how peptide physicochemical properties affect nanoparticle pharmacokinetics, particularly in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We engineered nanoparticle surfaces with peptides that possess a range of physicochemical properties and evaluated their distribution after two routes of administration: direct injection into a healthy mouse brain and systemic delivery in a mouse model of TBI. In both administration routes, we found that peptide-modified nanoparticle pharmacokinetics were influenced by the charge characteristics of the peptide. When peptide-modified nanoparticles are delivered directly into the brain, nanoparticles modified with positively charged peptides displayed restricted distribution from the injection site compared to nanoparticles modified with neutral, zwitterionic, or negatively charged peptides. After intravenous administration in a TBI mouse model, positively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles accumulated more in off-target organs, including the heart, lung, and kidneys, than zwitterionic, neutral, or negatively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles. The increase in off-target organ accumulation of positively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles was concomitant with a relative decrease in accumulation in the injured brain compared to zwitterionic, neutral, or negatively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles. Understanding how nanoparticle pharmacokinetics are influenced by the physicochemical properties of peptides presented on the nanoparticle surface is relevant to the development of nanoparticle-based TBI therapeutics and broadly applicable to nanotherapeutic design, including synthetic nanoparticles and viruses.

    "abstract": "Abstract Anthracyclines are a class of chemotherapy drugs that are highly effective for the treatment of human cancers, but their clinical use is limited by associated dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. The precise mechanisms by which individual anthracycline induces cardiotoxicity are not fully understood. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are emerging as a physiologically relevant model to assess drugs cardiotoxicity. Here, we describe an assay platform by coupling hiPSC-CMs and impedance measurement, which allows real-time monitoring of cardiomyocyte cellular index, beating amplitude, and beating rate. Using this approach, we have performed comparative studies on a panel of four anthracycline drugs (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and daunorubicin) which share a high degree of structural similarity but are associated with distinct cardiotoxicity profiles and maximum cumulative dose limits. Notably, results from our hiPSC-CMs impedance model (dose-dependent responses and EC 50 values) agree well with the recommended clinical dose limits for these drugs. Using time-lapse imaging and RNAseq, we found that the differences in anthracycline cardiotoxicity are closely linked to extent of cardiomyocyte uptake and magnitude of activation/inhibition of several cellular pathways such as death receptor signaling, ROS production, and dysregulation of calcium signaling. The results provide molecular insights into anthracycline cardiac interactions and offer a novel assay system to more robustly assess potential cardiotoxicity during drug development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. However, immunogenic responses to these new therapies—such as the development of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)—may represent a significant challenge to both efficacy and safety in some patients. Dostarlimab (TSR-042) is an approved, humanized, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that has shown efficacy in multiple solid tumor types. Here, we report the results of an immunogenicity analysis of dostarlimab monotherapy in patients enrolled in the GARNET trial, a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase 1 study. Overall, 477 of 478 patients (99.8%) were included in the analysis of dostarlimab antibody prevalence, and 349 out of 478 enrolled patients (73.0%) were evaluable for treatment-emergent antibodies to dostarlimab. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was 2.5% at the recommended therapeutic dose (500 mg Q3W for the first 4 doses, 1000 mg Q6W until discontinuation), which is comparable to other anti-PD-(L)1 drugs. NAbs were detected in only 1.3% of patients. In the small percentage of patients who developed ADAs, there was no evidence of altered efficacy or safety of dostarlimab at the recommended dosing regimen. These findings demonstrated that treatment with dostarlimab was associated with a low risk of eliciting clinically meaningful ADAs over the course of this study, and dostarlimab is already approved by health authorities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanoparticles can encapsulate a range of therapeutics, from small molecule drugs to sensitive biologics, to significantly improve their biodistribution and biostability. Whilst the regulatory approval of several of these nanoformulations has proven their translatability, there remain several hurdles to the translation of future nanoformulations, leading to a high rate of candidate nanoformulations failing during the drug development process. One barrier is that the difficulty in tightly controlling nanoscale particle synthesis leads to particle-to-particle heterogeneity, which hinders manufacturing and quality control, and regulatory quality checks. To understand and mitigate this heterogeneity requires advancements in nanoformulation characterisation beyond traditional bulk methods to more precise, single particle techniques. In this review, we compare commercially available single particle techniques, with a particular focus on single particle Raman spectroscopy, to provide a guide to adoption of these methods into development workflows, to ultimately reduce barriers to the translation of future nanoformulations.

    "abstract": "E7820 is an orally active inhibitor of α(2)-integrin mRNA expression, currently tested in phases I and II. We aimed to evaluate what levels of inhibition of integrin expression are needed to achieve tumor stasis in mice, and to compare this to the level of inhibition achieved in humans. Tumor growth inhibition was measured in mice bearing a pancreatic KP-1 tumor, dosed at 12.5-200 mg/kg over 21 days. In the phase I study, E7820 was administered daily for 28 days over a range of 0-200 mg, followed by a 7-day washout period. PK-PD models were developed in NONMEM. α(2)-Integrin expression measured on platelets, corresponding to tumor stasis at t = 21 in 50% and 90% of the mice (I(int,50), I(int,90)) were calculated. It was evaluated if these levels of inhibition could be achieved in patients at tolerable doses. One hundred nineteen α(2)-Integrin measurements and 210 tumor size measurements were available from mice. The relationship between PK and α(2)-integrin expression was modeled using an indirect-effect model, subsequently linked to an exponential tumor growth model. I(inh,50) and I(inh,90) were 14.7% (RSE 7%) and 17.9% (RSE 8%). Four hundred sixty two α(2)-integrin measurements were available from 29 patients. Using the schedule of 100 mg qd (MTD), α(2)-integrin expression was inhibited more strongly than the I(int,50) and I(int,90) in greater than 95% and greater than 50% of patients, respectively. Moderate inhibition of α(2)-integrin expression corresponded to tumor stasis in mice, and similar levels could be reached in patients with the dose level of 100 mg qd.",

    "abstract": "Selectivity is an important attribute of effective and safe drugs, and prediction of in vivo target and tissue selectivity would likely improve drug development success rates. However, a lack of understanding of the underlying (pharmacological) mechanisms and availability of directly applicable predictive methods complicates the prediction of selectivity. We explore the value of combining physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling with quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to predict the influence of the target dissociation constant (KD) and the target dissociation rate constant on target and tissue selectivity. The KD values of CB1 ligands in the ChEMBL database are predicted by QSAR random forest (RF) modeling for the CB1 receptor and known off-targets (TRPV1, mGlu5, 5-HT1a). Of these CB1 ligands, rimonabant, CP-55940, and Δ8-tetrahydrocanabinol, one of the active ingredients of cannabis, were selected for simulations of target occupancy for CB1, TRPV1, mGlu5, and 5-HT1a in three brain regions, to illustrate the principles of the combined PBPK-QSAR modeling. Our combined PBPK and target binding modeling demonstrated that the optimal values of the KD and koff for target and tissue selectivity were dependent on target concentration and tissue distribution kinetics. Interestingly, if the target concentration is high and the perfusion of the target site is low, the optimal KD value is often not the lowest KD value, suggesting that optimization towards high drug-target affinity can decrease the benefit-risk ratio. The presented integrative structure-pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling provides an improved understanding of tissue and target selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Despite the improvements in drug screening, high levels of drug attrition persist. Although high-throughput screening platforms permit the testing of compound libraries, poor compound efficacy or unexpected organ toxicity are major causes of attrition. Part of the reason for drug failure resides in the models employed, most of which are not representative of normal organ biology. This same problem affects all the major organs during drug development. Hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity are two interesting examples of organ disease and can present in the late stages of drug development, resulting in major cost and increased risk to the patient. Currently, cell-based systems used within industry rely on immortalized or primary cell lines from donated tissue. These models possess significant advantages and disadvantages, but in general display limited relevance to the organ of interest. Recently, stem cell technology has shown promise in drug development and has been proposed as an alternative to current industrial systems. These offerings will provide the field with exciting new models to study human organ biology at scale and in detail. We believe that the recent advances in production of stem cell-derived hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes combined with cutting-edge engineering technologies make them an attractive alternative to current screening models for drug discovery. This will lead to fast failing of poor drugs earlier in the process, delivering safer and more efficacious medicines for the patient.",

    "abstract": "Analytical ultracentrifugation–sedimentation velocity (AUC-SV) is often used to quantify high molar mass species (HMMS) present in biopharmaceuticals. Although these species are often present in trace quantities, they have received significant attention due to their potential immunogenicity. Commonly, AUC-SV data is analyzed as a diffusion-corrected, sedimentation coefficient distribution, or c(s), using SEDFIT to numerically solve Lamm-type equations. SEDFIT also utilizes maximum entropy or Tikhonov-Phillips regularization to further allow the user to determine relevant sample information, including the number of species present, their sedimentation coefficients, and their relative abundance. However, this methodology has several, often unstated, limitations, which may impact the final analysis of protein therapeutics. These include regularization-specific effects, artificial \"ripple peaks,\" and spurious shifts in the sedimentation coefficients. In this investigation, we experimentally verified that an explicit Bayesian approach, as implemented in SEDFIT, can largely correct for these effects. Clear guidelines on how to implement this technique and interpret the resulting data, especially for samples containing micro-heterogeneity (e.g., differential glycosylation), are also provided. In addition, we demonstrated how the Bayesian approach can be combined with F statistics to draw more accurate conclusions and rigorously exclude artifactual peaks. Numerous examples with an antibody and an antibody-drug conjugate were used to illustrate the strengths and drawbacks of each technique.",

    "abstract": "Design of phase 1 combination therapy trials is complex compared to single therapy trials. In this work, model-based adaptive optimal design (MBAOD) was exemplified and evaluated for a combination of paclitaxel and a hypothetical new compound in a phase 1 study to determine the best dosing regimen for a phase 2 trial. Neutropenia was assumed as the main toxicity and the dose optimization process targeted a 33% probability of grade 4 neutropenia and maximal efficacy (based on preclinical studies) by changing the dose amount of both drugs and the dosing schedule for the new drug. Different starting conditions (e.g., initial dose), search paths (e.g., maximal change in dose intensity per step), and stopping criteria (e.g., \"3 + 3 rule\") were explored. The MBAOD approach was successfully implemented allowing the possibility of flexible designs with the modification of doses and dosing schedule throughout the trial. The 3 + 3 rule was shown to be highly conservative (selection of a dosing regimen with at least 90% of the possible maximal efficacy in less than 21% of the cases) but also safer (selection of a toxic design in less than 2% of the cases). Without the 3 + 3 rule, better performance was observed (>67% of selected designs were associated with at least 90% of possible maximal efficacy) while the proportion of DLTs per trial was similar. Overall, MBAOD is a promising tool in the context of dose finding studies of combination treatments and was showed to be flexible enough to be associated with requirements imposed by clinical protocols.",

The aims of this review were (i) to describe the current recommended strategies for co-administration of paediatric medicines with food and drinks (vehicles); (ii) to compare current administration recommendations from different countries; and (iii) to obtain a global perspective on the rationale behind the choice of recommended vehicle, in the context of the physicochemical properties of the drug and formulation. This study used a defined search strategy on the practices of paediatric medicine co-administration with vehicles, recommended in a commonly used paediatric and neonatal handbook, in addition to the information previously gathered from UK formularies. Logistic regression analysis was performed to further understand the biopharmaceutical basis of the choice of recommended vehicle for medicine co-administration. Differences were identified in the type of vehicles globally recommended for medicine co-administration. Ultimately, a statistical model was developed which provided an understanding on which vehicle is recommended for use with drugs/formulations, with basis on their biopharmaceutical properties. Overall, this review highlights the areas where further information is needed to support standardised procedures and guide the recommendation of age-appropriate and acceptable vehicles for use in the co-administration of paediatric medicines. Unified requirements are needed for harmonisation of the practice of medicine co-administration with vehicles. In vitro and/or in silico tools should be developed to evaluate the potential clinical outcomes of this practice during paediatric drug development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vedolizumab immunogenicity has been assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a ~ 0.5 μg/mL drug interference, which may underestimate on-drug immunogenicity. We aimed to compare immunogenicity results between ELISA and the new drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay (and the two versions of neutralizing assays, drug-sensitive versus drug-tolerant). The ECL assay drug tolerance is ~ 100 times higher than that of the ELISA (≥ 50 μg/mL vs. 0.5 μg/mL with a 500 ng/mL positive control), and assay sensitivity is &lt; 5 ng/mL for both assays. Vedolizumab immunogenicity was assessed in 2000 GEMINI 1 and 2 patients originally tested by ELISA and retested by ECL assay. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) impact on infusion-related reactions and pharmacokinetics (PK) was examined using descriptive statistics and population PK analyses. By ECL assay, 6% (86/1427) of patients treated with vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy tested ADA-positive. Of these, 20 patients were persistently positive and 56 had neutralizing antibodies. By ELISA, 4% (56/1434) of these patients were ADA-positive, 9 were persistently positive, and 33 had neutralizing antibodies. Among 61 patients with infusion-related reactions, 6 (10%) were ADA-positive (2 persistently positive) by ECL assay. By ELISA, 3 (5%) patients were both ADA-positive and persistently positive. Most results (96%) were similar with both assays. In the updated population PK model, ADA-positive status was estimated to increase vedolizumab linear clearance by a factor of 1.10 (95% credible interval 1.03–1.17), which is consistent with previous reports. The impact of ADA on safety and PK modeling remained generally consistent using either ELISA or ECL assay. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00783718 and NCT00783692",

    "abstract": "Abstract Characterization of clinical anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses to biotherapeutics can be important to understanding the consequences of immunogenicity. ADA are expected to be polyclonal, with composition and affinities that evolve over time. Measuring ADA binding affinity can be complicated by the polyclonal nature of response, residual drug in sample, and low ADA levels. We developed a novel workflow to determine the apparent ADA affinity ( K D ) against a monoclonal antibody biotherapeutic, PF-06480605. An affinity capture elution pre-treatment step was used to isolate ADA and remove residual drug interference from samples. Solution-phase equilibrium incubation was performed using drug and sample ADA as variable and fixed binding interactants, respectively. Unbound ADA concentration was measured using a Singulex Erenna ligand-binding assay (LBA) method. Apparent ADA K D values were calculated using a custom R Shiny algorithm. K D values determined for ADA positive samples showed good correlation with other immunogenicity parameters, including titers and neutralizing antibody (NAb) activity with a general increase in affinity over time, indicative of a maturing immune response. Time of onset of high affinity responses ( K D &lt; 100 pM) varied between patients, ranging from 16 to 24 weeks. Antibody responses appeared monophasic at earlier time points, trending towards a biphasic response with a variable transition time and general increase in proportion of high affinity ADA over time. Herein, we provide a novel, sensitive bioanalytical method to determine the K D of ADA in clinical samples. The observed decrease in ADA K D is consistent with evidence of a maturing immune response.

    "abstract": "Assessing in vivo performance to inform formulation selection and development decisions is an important aspect of drug development. Biopredictive dissolution methodologies for oral dosage forms have been developed to understand in vivo performance, assist in formulation development/optimization, and forecast the outcome of bioequivalence studies by combining them with simulation tools to predict plasma profiles in humans. However, unlike compendial dissolution methodologies, the various biopredictive methodologies have not yet been harmonized or standardized. This manuscript presents the initial phases of an effort to develop best practices and move toward standardization of the biopredictive methodologies through the Product Quality Research Institute (PQRI, https://pqri.org ) entitled \"The standardization of in vitro predictive dissolution methodologies and in silico bioequivalence study Working Group.\" This Working Group (WG) is comprised of participants from 10 pharmaceutical companies and academic institutes. The project will be accomplished in a total of five phases including assessing the performance of dissolution protocols designed by the individual WG members, and then building \"best practice\" protocols based on the initial dissolution profiles. After refining the \"best practice\" protocols to produce equivalent dissolution profiles, those will be combined with physiologically based biopharmaceutics models (PBBM) to predict plasma profiles. In this manuscript, the first two of the five phases are reported, namely generating biopredictive dissolution profiles for ibuprofen and dipyridamole and using those dissolution profiles with PBBM to match the clinical plasma profiles. Key experimental parameters are identified, and this knowledge will be applied to build the \"best practice\" protocol in the next phase.",

    "abstract": "Model-informed drug development involves developing and applying exposure-based, biological, and statistical models derived from preclinical and clinical data sources to inform drug development and decision-making. Discrete models are generated from individual experiments resulting in a single model expression that is utilized to inform a single stage-gate decision. Other model types provide a more holistic view of disease biology and potentially disease progression depending on the appropriateness of the underlying data sources for that purpose. Despite this awareness, most data integration and model development approaches are still reliant on internal (within company) data stores and traditional structural model types. An AI/ML-based MIDD approach relies on more diverse data and is informed by past successes and failures including data outside a host company (external data sources) that may enhance predictive value and enhance data generated by the sponsor to reflect more informed and timely experimentation. The AI/ML methodology also provides a complementary approach to more traditional modeling efforts that support MIDD and thus yields greater fidelity in decision-making. Early pilot studies support this assessment but will require broader adoption and regulatory support for more evidence and refinement of this paradigm. An AI/ML-based approach to MIDD has the potential to transform regulatory science and the current drug development paradigm, optimize information value, and increase candidate and eventually product confidence with respect to safety and efficacy. We highlight early experiences with this approach using the AI compute platforms as representative examples of how MIDD can be facilitated with an AI/ML approach.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) approaches have been applied to predicting drug pharmacokinetic properties. Previously, we predicted rat unbound brain-to-plasma ratio (Kpuu,brain) by ML models. In this study, we aimed to predict human Kpuu,brain through animal ML models. First, we re-evaluated ML models for rat Kpuu,brain prediction by using trendy open-source packages. We then developed ML models for monkey Kpuu,brain prediction. Leave-one-out cross validation was utilized to rationally build models using a relatively small dataset. After establishing the monkey and rat ML models, human Kpuu,brain prediction was achieved by implementing the animal models considering appropriate scaling methods. Mechanistic NeuroPK models for the identical monkey and human dataset were treated as the criteria for comparison. Results showed that rat Kpuu,brain predictivity was successfully replicated. The optimal ML model for monkey Kpuu,brain prediction was superior to the NeuroPK model, where accuracy within 2-fold error was 78% (R2 = 0.76). For human Kpuu,brain prediction, rat model using relative expression factor (REF), scaled transporter efflux ratios (ERs), and monkey model using in vitro ERs can provide comparable predictivity to the NeuroPK model, where accuracy within 2-fold error was 71% and 64% (R2 = 0.30 and 0.52), respectively. We demonstrated that ML models can deliver promising Kpuu,brain prediction with several advantages: (1) predict reasonable animal Kpuu,brain; (2) prospectively predict human Kpuu,brain from animal models; and (3) can skip expensive monkey studies for human prediction by using the rat model. As a result, ML models can be a powerful tool for drug Kpuu,brain prediction in the discovery stage.",

    "abstract": "Telapristone is a selective progesterone antagonist that is being developed for the long-term treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids. The population pharmacokinetics of telapristone (CDB-4124) and CDB-4453 was investigated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Data from two clinical studies (n = 32) were included in the analysis. A two-compartment (parent) one compartment (metabolite) mixture model (with two populations for apparent clearance) with first-order absorption and elimination adequately described the pharmacokinetics of telapristone and CDB-4453. Telapristone was rapidly absorbed with an absorption rate constant (Ka) of 1.26 h(-1). Moderate renal impairment resulted in a 74% decrease in Ka. The population estimates for oral clearance (CL/F) for the two populations were 11.6 and 3.34 L/h, respectively, with 25% of the subjects being allocated to the high-clearance group. Apparent volume of distribution for the central compartment (V2/F) was 37.4 L, apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F) was 21.9 L/h, and apparent peripheral volume of distribution for the parent (V4/F) was 120 L. The ratio of the fraction of telapristone converted to CDB-4453 to the distribution volume of CDB-4453 (Fmet(est)) was 0.20/L. Apparent volume of distribution of the metabolite compartment (V3/F) was fixed to 1 L and apparent clearance of the metabolite (CLM/F) was 2.43 L/h. A two-compartment parent-metabolite model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of telapristone and CDB-4453. The clearance of telapristone was separated into two populations and could be the result of metabolism via polymorphic CYP3A5.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiolabeled drugs holds great promise to assess the influence of membrane transporters on hepatobiliary clearance of drugs. To exploit the full potential of PET, quantitative pharmacokinetic models are required. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of different compartment models to describe the hepatic disposition of [11C]erlotinib as a small-molecule model drug which undergoes transporter-mediated hepatobiliary excretion. We analyzed two different, previously published data sets in healthy volunteers, in which a baseline [11C]erlotinib PET scan was followed by a second PET scan either after oral intake of unlabeled erlotinib (300 mg) or after intravenous infusion of the prototypical organic anion-transporting polypeptide inhibitor rifampicin (600 mg). We assessed a three-compartment (3C) and a four-compartment (4C) model, in which either a sampled arterial blood input function or a mathematically derived dual input function (DIF), which takes the contribution of the portal vein to the liver blood supply into account, was used. Both models provided acceptable fits of the observed PET data in the liver and extrahepatic bile duct and gall bladder. Changes in model outcome parameters between scans were consistent with the involvement of basolateral hepatocyte uptake and canalicular efflux transporters in the hepatobiliary clearance of [11C]erlotinib. Our results demonstrated that inclusion of a DIF did not lead to substantial improvements in model fits. The models developed in this work represent a step forward in applying PET as a tool to assess the impact of hepatic transporters on drug disposition and their involvement in drug-drug interactions.",

    "abstract": "To reveal unknown and potentially important mechanisms of drug action, multi-biomarker discovery approaches are increasingly used. Time-course relationships between drug action and multi-biomarker profiles, however, are typically missing, while such relationships will provide increased insight in the underlying body processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the dopamine D2 antagonist remoxipride on the neuroendocrine system. Different doses of remoxipride (0, 0.7, 5.2, or 14 mg/kg) were administered to rats by intravenous infusion. Serial brain extracellular fluid (brainECF) and plasma samples were collected and analyzed for remoxipride pharmacokinetics (PK). Plasma samples were analyzed for concentrations of the eight pituitary-related hormones as a function of time. A Mann–Whitney test was used to identify the responding hormones, which were further analyzed by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling. A three-compartment PK model adequately described remoxipride PK in plasma and brainECF. Not only plasma PRL, but also adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were increased, the latter especially at higher concentrations of remoxipride. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH) did not respond to remoxipride at the tested doses, while oxytocin (OXT) measurements were below limit of quantification. Precursor pool models were linked to brainECF remoxipride PK by Emax drug effect models, which could accurately describe the PRL and ACTH responses. To conclude, this study shows how a multi-biomarker identification approach combined with PK/PD modeling can reveal and quantify a neuroendocrine multi-biomarker response for single drug action.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is a challenging task in drug discovery and development. It requires determination of enzyme inhibition in vitro which is highly system-dependent for many compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the determination of intracellular unbound concentrations in primary human hepatocytes can be used to bridge discrepancies between results obtained using human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Specifically, we investigated if Kpuu could reconcile differences in CYP enzyme inhibition values (Ki or IC50). Firstly, our methodology for determination of Kpuu was optimized for human hepatocytes, using four well-studied reference compounds. Secondly, the methodology was applied to a series of structurally related CYP2C9 inhibitors from a Roche discovery project. Lastly, the Kpuu values of three commonly used CYP3A4 inhibitors—ketoconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole—were determined and compared to compound-specific hepatic enrichment factors obtained from physiologically based modeling of clinical DDI studies with these three compounds. Kpuu obtained in suspended human hepatocytes gave good predictions of system-dependent differences in vitro. The Kpuu was also in fair agreement with the compound-specific hepatic enrichment factors in DDI models and can therefore be used to improve estimations of enrichment factors in physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is an urgent demand to develop new technologies to characterize immunogenicity to biotherapeutics. Here, we developed an immunocapture LC-MS assay to isotype and semi-quantify monkey anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs. ADAs were isolated from serum samples using an immunocapture step with the Fab of the full-length mAb cross-linked to magnetic beads to minimize matrix interference. A positive monoclonal antibody control against the human immunoglobulin kappa light chain was used as a calibration standard for ADA quantitation. The final LC-MS method contains 17 multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions and an optimized 15-min LC method. The results suggested that IgG1 was the most abundant isotype in ADA-positive samples. IgG2 and IgG4 were identified at lower levels, whereas IgG3 and IgA levels were only observed at very minor levels. In addition, levels of total ADA measured by the LC-MS assay were comparable to results obtained using a traditional ligand binding assay (LBA). The LC-MS ADA assay enabled rapid immunogenicity assessment with additional isotype information that LBAs cannot provide.",

    "abstract": "Vancomycin is an effective but potentially nephrotoxic antibiotic commonly used for severe infections. Dosing guidelines for vancomycin in obese children and adolescents with or without renal impairment are currently lacking. This study describes the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in a large pediatric cohort with varying degrees of obesity and renal function to design practical dosing guidelines for this population. A multi-center retrospective population pharmacokinetic study was conducted using data from patients aged 1-18 years who received >1 dose of vancomycin and had ≥1 vancomycin concentration measured between January 2006 and December 2012. Besides pharmacokinetic data, age, gender, body weight, creatinine clearance (CLcr, bedside Schwartz equation), ward, race, and neutropenic status were collected. Population pharmacokinetic analysis and simulations were performed using NONMEM7.4. A total of 1892 patients (5524 samples) were included, with total body weight (TBW) ranging 6-188 kg (1344 normal weight, 247 overweight, and 301 obese patients) and CLcr down to 8.6 mL/min/1.73 m2. The two-compartment model, with clearance (CL) significantly increasing with TBW and CLcr, central and peripheral volume of distribution and inter-compartmental clearance increasing with TBW, performed well for all age, weight, and renal function ranges. A dosing guideline is proposed that integrates body weight and CLcr resulting in effective and safe exposures across all ages, body weight, and renal functions in the pediatric population. We have characterized the full pharmacokinetic profile of vancomycin in obese children and adolescents aged 1-18 years and propose a practical dosing guideline that integrates both body weight and renal function.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is generally used to quantify transplanted cell therapy products in biological samples. As the matrix effects on PCR amplification and variability in DNA recovery from biological samples are well-known limitations that hinder the assay's performance, a calibration curve is conventionally established for each matrix. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is based on the endpoint assay and advantageous in avoiding matrix effects. Moreover, the use of an external control gene may correct assay fluctuations to minimize the effects caused by inconsistent DNA recovery. In this study, we aimed to establish a novel and robust ddPCR method capable of quantifying human cells across various mouse biological samples using a single surrogate calibration curve in combination with an external control gene and DNA recovery normalization. Acceptable accuracy and precision were observed for quality control samples from different tissues, indicating the excellent quantitative and versatile potential of the developed method. Furthermore, the established method enabled the evaluation of human CD8+ T cell biodistribution in immunodeficient mice. Our findings provide new insights into the use of ddPCR-based quantification methods in biodistribution studies of cell therapy products.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective was to apply a population model to describe the time course and variability of serum creatinine (sCr) in (near)term neonates with moderate to severe encephalopathy during and after therapeutic hypothermia (TH). The data consisted of sCr observations up to 10 days of postnatal age in neonates who underwent TH during the first 3 days after birth. Available covariates were birth weight (BWT), gestational age (GA), survival, and acute kidney injury (AKI). A previously published population model of sCr kinetics in neonates served as the base model. This model predicted not only sCr but also the glomerular filtration rate normalized by its value at birth (GFR/GFR 0 ). The model was used to compare the TH neonates with a reference full term non-asphyxiated population of neonates. The estimates of the model parameters had good precision and showed high between subject variability. AKI influenced most of the estimated parameters denoting a strong impact on sCr kinetics and GFR. BWT and GA were not significant covariates. TH transiently increased $$\\mathrm{sCr}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mi>sCr</mml:mi> </mml:math> in TH neonates over the first days compared to the reference group.

    "abstract": "Abstract Comparative bioavailability studies often involve multiple groups of subjects for a variety of reasons, such as clinical capacity limitations. This raises questions about the validity of pooling data from these groups in the statistical analysis and whether a group-by-treatment interaction should be evaluated. We investigated the presence or absence of group-by-treatment interactions through both simulation techniques and a meta-study of well-controlled trials. Our findings reveal that the test falsely detects an interaction when no true group-by-treatment interaction exists. Conversely, when a true group-by-treatment interaction does exist, it often goes undetected. In our meta-study, the detected group-by-treatment interactions were observed at approximately the level of the test and, thus, can be considered false positives. Testing for a group-by-treatment interaction is both misleading and uninformative. It often falsely identifies an interaction when none exists and fails to detect a real one. This occurs because the test is performed between subjects in crossover designs, and studies are powered to compare treatments within subjects. This work demonstrates a lack of utility for including a group-by-treatment interaction in the model when assessing single-site comparative bioavailability studies, and the clinical trial study structure is divided into groups.

    "abstract": "Abstract The recruitment of a parallel, healthy participants (HPs) arm in renal and hepatic impairment (RI and HI) studies is a common strategy to assess differences in pharmacokinetics. Limitations in this approach include the underpowered estimate of exposure differences and the use of the drug in a population for which there is no benefit. Recently, a method was published by Purohit et. al. (2023) that leveraged prior population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling-based simulation to infer the distribution of exposure ratios between the RI/HI arms and HPs. The approach was successful, but it was a single example with a robust model having several iterations of development and fitting to extensive HP data. To test in more studies and models at different stages of development, our catalogue of RI/HI studies was searched, and those with suitable properties and from programs with available models were analyzed with the simulation approach. There were 9 studies included in the analysis. Most studies were associated with models that would have been available at the time (ATT) of the study, and all had a current, final model. For 3 studies, the HP PK was not predicted well by the ATT (2) or final (1) models. In comparison to conventional analysis of variance (ANOVA), the simulation approach provided similar point estimates and confidence intervals of exposure ratios. This PopPK based approach can be considered as a method of choice in situations where the simulation of HP data would not be an extrapolation, and when no other complicating factors are present.

    "abstract": "Abstract Tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) has been shown to be a potential surrogate marker of biological tumor activity. However, its availability in clinics is strongly limited due to ethical and practical reasons, as its assessment requires at least two subsequent tumor volume measurements in untreated patients. Here, a translational modeling framework to predict TVDT distributions in untreated cancer patient populations from tumor growth data in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice is proposed. Eleven solid cancer types were considered. For each of them, a set of tumor growth studies in PDX mice was selected and analyzed through a mathematical model to characterize the distribution of the exponential tumor growth rate in mice. Then, assuming an exponential growth of the tumor mass in humans, the growth rates were scaled from PDX mice to humans through an allometric scaling approach and used to predict TVDTs in untreated patients. A very good agreement was found between model predicted and clinically observed TVDTs, with 91% of the predicted TVDT medians fell within 1.5-fold of observations. Further, exploiting the intrinsic relationship between tumor growth dynamics and progression free survival (PFS), the exponential growth rates in humans were used to generate the expected PFS curves in absence of anticancer treatment. Predicted curves were extremely close to published PFS data from studies involving patient cohorts treated with supportive care or low effective therapies. The proposed approach shows promise as a potential tool to increase knowledge about TVDT in humans without the need of directly measuring tumor dimensions in untreated patients, and to predict PFS curves in untreated patients, that could fill the absence of placebo-controlled arms against which to compare treaded arms during clinical trials. However, further validation and refinement are needed to fully assess its effectiveness in this regard.",

    "abstract": "Orally administered artemisinin-based combination therapy is the first-line treatment against uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria worldwide. However, the increasing prevalence of artemisinin resistance is threatening efforts to treat and eliminate malaria in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to characterize the exposure-response relationship of artesunate in patients with artemisinin sensitive and resistant malaria infections. Patients were recruited in Pailin, Cambodia (n = 39), and Wang Pha, Thailand (n = 40), and received either 2 mg/kg/day of artesunate mono-therapy for 7 consecutive days or 4 mg/kg/day of artesunate monotherapy for 3 consecutive days followed by mefloquine 15 and 10 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days. Plasma concentrations of artesunate and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, and microscopy-based parasite densities were measured and evaluated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. All treatments were well tolerated with minor and transient adverse reactions. Patients in Cambodia had substantially slower parasite clearance compared to patients in Thailand. The pharmacokinetic properties of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin were well described by transit-compartment absorption followed by one-compartment disposition models. Parasite density was a significant covariate, and higher parasite densities were associated with increased absorption. Dihydroartemisinin-dependent parasite killing was described by a delayed sigmoidal Emax model, and a mixture function was implemented to differentiate between sensitive and resistant infections. This predicted that 84% and 16% of infections in Cambodia and Thailand, respectively, were artemisinin resistant. The final model was used to develop a simple diagnostic nomogram to identify patients with artemisinin-resistant infections. The nomogram showed > 80% specificity and sensitivity, and outperformed the current practice of day 3 positivity testing.",

    "abstract": "Reliable results of pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies are vital for correct decision making during drug discovery and development. Thus, ensuring high quality of bioanalytical methods is of critical importance. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR)-one of the tools used to validate a method-is included in the bioanalytical regulatory recommendations. The methodology of this test is well established, but the estimation of the sample size is still commented on and contested. We have applied the hypergeometric distribution to evaluate ISR test passing rates in different clinical study sizes. We have tested both fixed rates of the clinical samples-as currently recommended by FDA and EMA-and a fixed number of ISRs. Our study revealed that the passing rate using the current sample size calculation is related to the clinical study size. However, the passing rate is much less dependent on the clinical study size when a fixed number of ISRs is used. Thus, we suggest using a fixed number of ISRs, e.g., 30 samples, for all studies. We found the hypergeometric distribution to be an adequate model for the assessment of similarities in original and repeated data. This model may be further used to optimize the sample size needed for the ISR test as well as to bridge data from different methods. This paper provides a basis to re-consider current ISR recommendations and implement a more statistically rationalized and risk-controlled approach.",

    "abstract": "The phase III trial comparing onartuzumab + erlotinib vs. erlotinib in the second- and third-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). The objective was to assess whether doses higher than the phase III dose (15 mg/kg) might yield better efficacy without compromising the safety profile. Data were from 636 patients from the phase II and III NSCLC studies. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) models were fit to longitudinal tumor size data to estimate individual TGI metrics including time to tumor re-growth (TTG). Cox regression models were developed for time-to-event endpoints (progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and TTG) to investigate relationships with baseline prognostic factors and onartuzumab exposure. Incidence of adverse events was modeled by logistic regression. In the final models, higher onartuzumab exposure was associated with longer PFS, but not with longer OS. Longer OS was associated with higher baseline albumin, longer TTG, smaller number of metastatic sites, female gender, lower ECOG score, and younger age. TTG was the only TGI metric retained in the final OS model. Onartuzumab exposure was not significantly associated with TTG after adjusting for prognostic factors. Higher Cmin was associated with increased incidence of infusion reactions and peripheral edema. Higher onartuzumab exposure was not significantly associated with improved OS after adjusting for prognostic factors and TTG, and there was a trend of unknown clinical significance toward increased incidence of infusion reactions and peripheral edema. These results did not support testing higher onartuzumab doses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It has proven challenging to quantify ‘drug input’ from a formulation to the viable skin because the epidermal and dermal targets of topically applied drugs are difficult, if not impossible, to access in vivo . Defining the drug input function to the viable skin with a straightforward and practical experimental approach would enable a key component of dermal pharmacokinetics to be characterised. It has been hypothesised that measuring drug uptake into and clearance from the stratum corneum (SC) by tape-stripping allows estimation of a topical drug’s input function into the viable tissue. This study aimed to test this idea by determining the input of nicotine and lidocaine into the viable skin, following the application of commercialised transdermal patches to healthy human volunteers. The known input rates of these delivery systems were used to validate and assess the results from the tape-stripping protocol. The drug input rates from in vivo tape-stripping agreed well with the claimed delivery rates of the patches. The experimental approach was then used to determine the input of lidocaine from a marketed cream, a typical topical product for which the amount of drug absorbed has not been well-characterised. A significantly higher delivery of lidocaine from the cream than from the patch was found. The different input rates between drugs and formulations in vivo were confirmed qualitatively and quantitatively in vitro in conventional diffusion cells using dermatomed abdominal pig skin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The mechanistic neuropharmacokinetic (neuroPK) model was established to predict unbound brain-to-plasma partitioning ( K p,uu,brain ) by considering in vitro efflux activities of multiple drug resistance 1 (MDR1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Herein, we directly compare this model to a computational machine learning approach utilizing physicochemical descriptors and efflux ratios of MDR1 and BCRP-expressing cells for predicting K p,uu,brain in rats. Two different types of machine learning techniques, Gaussian processes (GP) and random forest regression (RF), were assessed by the time and cluster-split validation methods using 640 internal compounds. The predictivity of machine learning models based on only molecular descriptors in the time-split dataset performed worse than the cluster-split dataset, whereas the models incorporating MDR1 and BCRP efflux ratios showed similar predictivity between time and cluster-split datasets. The GP incorporating MDR1 and BCRP in the time-split dataset achieved the highest correlation ( R 2 = 0.602). These results suggested that incorporation of MDR1 and BCRP in machine learning is beneficial for robust and accurate prediction. K p,uu,brain prediction utilizing the neuroPK model was significantly worse compared to machine learning approaches for the same dataset. We also investigated the predictivity of K p,uu,brain using an external independent test set of 34 marketed drugs. Compared to machine learning models, the neuroPK model showed better predictive performance with R 2 of 0.577. This work demonstrates that the machine learning model for K p,uu,brain achieves maximum predictive performance within the chemical applicability domain, whereas the neuroPK model is applicable more widely beyond the chemical space covered in the training dataset.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dosing guidance is often lacking for chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to exclusion of such patients from pivotal clinical trials. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling supports model-informed dosing when clinical data are lacking, but application of these approaches to patients with impaired renal function is not yet at full maturity. In the current study, a ganciclovir PBPK model was developed for patients with normal renal function and extended to CKD population. CKD-related changes in tubular secretion were explored in the mechanistic kidney model and implemented either as proportional or non-proportional decline relative to GFR. Crystalluria risk was evaluated in different clinical settings (old age, severe CKD and low fluid intake) by simulating ganciclovir medullary collecting duct (MCD) concentrations. The ganciclovir PBPK model captured observed changes in systemic pharmacokinetic endpoints in mild-to-severe CKD; these trends were evident irrespective of assumed pathophysiological mechanism of altered active tubular secretion in the model. Minimal difference in simulated ganciclovir MCD concentrations was noted between young adult and geriatric populations with normal renal function and urine flow (1 mL/min), with lower concentrations predicted for severe CKD patients. High crystalluria risk was identified at reduced urine flow (0.1 mL/min) as simulated ganciclovir MCD concentrations exceeded its solubility (2.6–6 mg/mL), irrespective of underlying renal function. The analysis highlighted the importance of appropriate distribution of virtual subjects’ systems data in CKD populations. The ganciclovir PBPK model illustrates the ability of this translational tool to explore individual and combined effects of age, urine flow, and renal impairment on local drug renal exposure.

    "abstract": "Abstract The work aimed to develop the Absorption Driven Drug Formulation (ADDF) concept, which is a new approach in formulation development to ensure that the drug product meets the expected absorption rate. The concept is built on the solubility-permeability interplay and the rate of supersaturation as the driving force of absorption. This paper presents the first case study using the ADDF concept where not only dissolution and solubility but also permeation of the drug is considered in every step of the formulation development. For that reason, parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) was used for excipient selection, small volume dissolution-permeation apparatus was used for testing amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), and large volume dissolution-permeation tests were carried out to characterize the final dosage forms. The API-excipient interaction studies on PAMPA indicated differences when different fillers or surfactants were studied. These differences were then confirmed with small volume dissolution-permeation assays where the addition of Tween 80 to the ASDs decreased the flux dramatically. Also, the early indication of sorbitol’s advantage over mannitol by PAMPA has been confirmed in the investigation of the final dosage forms by large-scale dissolution-permeation tests. This difference between the fillers was observed in vivo as well. The presented case study demonstrated that the ADDF concept opens a new perspective in generic formulation development using fast and cost-effective flux-based screening methods in order to meet the bioequivalence criteria.",

    "abstract": "RO7297089, an anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)/CD16A bispecific tetravalent antibody, is being developed as a multiple myeloma (MM) therapeutic. This study characterized nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), soluble BCMA (sBCMA), and soluble CD16 (sCD16) changes following administration of RO7297089 to support clinical trials. Unbound and total RO7297089 concentrations were measured in cynomolgus monkeys. RO7297089 exhibited a bi-phasic systemic concentration-time profile, similar to a typical human immunoglobulin 1 antibody. Target engagement by RO7297089 led to a robust increase (~100-fold) in total systemic sBCMA levels and relatively mild increase (~2-fold) in total sCD16 levels. To describe the relationship of nonclinical PK/PD data, we developed a target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model that includes the systemic target engagement of membrane BCMA (mBCMA), sBCMA, membrane CD16 (mCD16), and sCD16. We then used this model to simulate the PK/PD relationship of RO7297089 in MM patients by translating relevant PK parameters and target levels, based on the literature and newly generated data such as baseline sCD16A levels. Our model suggested that the impact of TMDD on RO7297089 exposure may be more significant in MM patients due to significantly higher expression levels of both mBCMA and sBCMA compared to healthy cynomolgus monkeys. Based on model simulations, we propose more frequent dosing of RO7297089 compared to regular monthly frequency in the clinic at the beginning of treatment to ensure sustained target engagement. This study demonstrates a translational research strategy for collecting relevant nonclinical data, establishing a TMDD model, and using simulations from this model to inform clinical dose regimens.",

As rHuPH20-reactive antibodies potentially interact with endogenous PH20, we investigated rHuPH20 immunogenicity risk through hyaluronidase tissue expression, predicted B cell epitopes, CD4+ T cell stimulation indices and related these to observed clinical immunogenicity profiles from 18 clinical studies. Endogenous hyaluronidase PH20 expression in humans/mice was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, and deep RNA-Seq. rHuPH20 potential T cell epitopes were evaluated in silico and confirmed in vitro. Potential B cell epitopes were predicted for rHuPH20 sequence in silico, and binding of polyclonal antibodies from various species tested on a rHuPH20 peptide microarray. Clinical immunogenicity data were collected from 2643 subjects. From 57 human adult and fetal tissues previously screened by RT-PCR, 22 tissue types were analyzed by deep RNA-Seq. Hyaluronidase PH20 messenger RNA expression was detected in adult human testes. In silico analyses of the rHuPH20 sequence revealed nine T cell epitope clusters with immunogenic potential, one cluster was homologous to human leukocyte antigen. rHuPH20 induced T cell activation in 6-10% of peripheral blood mononuclear cell donors. Fifteen epitopes in the rHuPH20 sequence had the potential to cross-react with B cells. The cumulative treatment-induced incidence of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies across clinical studies was 8.8%. Hyaluronidase PH20 expression occurs primarily in adult testes. Low CD4+ T cell activation and B cell cross-reactivity by rHuPH20 suggest weak rHuPH20 immunogenicity potential. Restricted expression patterns of endogenous PH20 indicate low immunogenicity risk of subcutaneous rHuPH20.",

In some cases, ADAs have been reported to affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety of the drug. Accurate prediction of the ADA response can help drug developers identify the immunogenicity risk of the drug candidates, thereby allowing them to make the necessary modifications to mitigate the immunogenicity. In this study, we leveraged the rich clinical study data collected by Roche/Genentech to identify factors that impact drug immunogenicity. We focused on conventional monoclonal antibodies, but have included a variety of additional drug modalities in the analysis. We show that the clinical ADA incidences are associated with the mechanism of action of the drugs, the mechanism of action of comedications, the routes of drug administration and the diseases of the patient cohort. By combining these clinical factors with the in silico epitope prediction, we improved the prediction accuracy of drug immunogenicity in clinical trials (AUC of cross validation improved from 0.72 to 0.93).

    "abstract": "Abstract Since 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed classification criteria of narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drug products and tightened bioequivalence (BE) standards for these products by recommending a fully replicated, two-sequence, two-treatment, four-period crossover study design where BE is based on passing both scaled average BE criterion and within-subject variability comparison criterion, as well as the average BE criterion of 80.00%-125.00%. Currently, the BE study design and criteria for NTI drugs are somewhat different across regulatory agencies. The objective of this study is to survey pharmacokinetic BE data of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) of NTI drugs submitted to the FDA with initial submission dates between January 1, 2013 and October 1, 2022 to identify the impact of FDA’s current BE approach on generic NTI approval. Thirty-three NTI drug products from 100 ANDAs were identified with 93 ANDAs included in analysis. Eighty-seven ANDAs had four-way crossover studies, with 69 and 106 fed and fasting BE studies, respectively. For all NTI drugs, the range of average S WR for C max , AUC t , and AUC inf was between 0.05 and 0.27. Of the 20 studies that failed BE, 90%, 5%, and 5% failed reference scaled criteria only, variability comparison criteria only, and both, respectively. Further communication of this work with global regulatory agencies and the scientific community will help better understand current FDA NTI BE criteria and review experiences. These efforts will support the development of harmonized BE criteria for NTI drugs, in turn improving patient access to generic NTI drugs. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biotherapeutics have the potential to elicit unwanted immune responses that can lead to the production of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). It is critical that ADA responses are detected, characterized, and monitored to understand the safety and efficacy of a drug. ADA samples must remain stable in long- and short-term storage conditions to ensure reliable analysis. Whereas the stability of anti-vaccine antibodies has been well-studied, there are few reports examining the stability of anti-therapeutic antibodies using clinical samples. In this study, ADA samples from four clinical trials of antibody therapeutics were found to be stable after long-term storage (1–10 years) at -80°C and short-term storage (24 h to two weeks) at 4°C, 22°C, and 37°C. In addition, samples were stable after 16 freeze/thaw cycles. The results demonstrate the stability of ADA in clinical samples under various conditions. Consequently, the results observed herein suggest that the routine assessment of ADA sample stability may not be warranted. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bioanalytical Pharmacokinetics (PK) methods are designed for robust performance under rigorous regulatory compliance requirements to ensure the generated data is reliable and maintains integrity. In a phase 1 dose-finding clinical study, aberrant PK profiles of two co-administered biologics drugs were observed. Unexpectedly, we discovered high fill levels in collection tubes from the majority of samples. This led to the hypothesis that the highly filled tubes might cause difficulty in achieving complete sample thaw and thorough mixing at the time of sample analysis, potentially contributing to the abnormalities observed in the PK dataset. Evaluation of the impact of sample fill levels and processing procedure can be challenging since PK concentrations of study samples were unknown. Therefore, a systematic approach was employed to conduct a thorough examination using mock samples. The data illustrate a correlation between sample thawing and mixing process and the variability in the PK data. The concentrations from properly filled mock samples that underwent complete thawing and mixing showed 100% data reproducibility. In contrast, the concentrations from fully filled mock samples that did not follow the proper procedure showed sample recovery deviating by ± 30% from nominal value and exhibited considerable lack of precision . This data identified the root cause of aberrant PK, justifying revised sample preparation guidance and sample re-assay. Improved sample handling and subsequent reassay resolved the aberrant PK profile issues. In conclusion, this study reiterated that sample handling plays a crucial role in quality and reproducibility of PK data with immunoassays. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although exogenous ketogenic dietary supplements continue to grow in popularity, their pharmacokinetic properties have not been adequately studied, thus hindering their optimal use and benefits. Here, the metabolic characteristics of one such supplement (Veech ketone mono-ester (( R )-3-hydroxybutyl( R )-3-hydroxybutyrate) (KE)) were studied along with its metabolite- (R)-1,3-butanediol ((R)-1,3-BD), both of which are precursors and undergo metabolic conversion to (R)-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). The metabolism of aldol (an aldehyde intermediate between the conversion of (R)-1,3-BD to (R)-BHB was also evaluated, as it is frequently not considered in any scientific discussion. The metabolic parameters were calculated using pooled human (mixed gender) and pooled rat (male and female) liver fractions. These were later used to estimate the hepatic extraction ratio and the hepatic clearance of these molecules. KE showed rapid and non-saturable clearance in human and rat liver fractions, even at concentrations as high as 15,000 μM. In the case of (R)-1,3-BD, there was saturable metabolism in rats and humans with K m and V max values of 8,000 μM and 27.1 nmol/min/mg of protein (humans), 19,300 μM and 113.5 nmol/min/mg of protein (male rats), and 11,910 μM and 75.8 nmol/min/mg of protein (female rats). The metabolism of aldol showed rapid and non-saturable hepatic clearance in human liver fractions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Physical appearance (PA) is an attribute indicating the quality of parenteral pharmaceuticals. It is routinely evaluated during release and stability testing and included in regulatory filings. PA assessment of liquids involves three tests: visible particulates, clarity, and color. For each test, compendial general method chapters are available requiring minimal modification. This allows for a platform PA method approach, streamlining method readiness for new test articles. However, selecting the appropriate method is challenging, as no method suits all test articles, and pharmacopeias do not specify suitable condition(s) for each method. Improper method selection can lead to inappropriate specification setting and unreliable results. The need for guidance is especially urgent for vaccines, which often exhibit a wide range of PA attributes due to complex delivery systems and adjuvants that boost immunogenicity. This manuscript addresses this challenge by explaining method suitability and presenting a decision table for PA method selection based on the appearance properties of pharmaceuticals. A case study involving a yellow-turbid vaccine adjuvant is presented to demonstrate the practical application of the decision table. When color and turbidity make visual comparison to reference liquids difficult, instrumental clarity and visual qualitative methods are suitable options. The manuscript provides valuable insights on PA method selection and setting specifications for new parenteral pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the decision table enables platform methods for test articles sharing similar appearance properties, eliminating the need for individual methods, reducing document preparation time for method and verification protocol, and enhancing the consistency and efficiency of GMP testing for PA.

    "abstract": "Abstract Intestinal lymphatic absorption is a crucial alternative to portal uptake for highly lipophilic drugs (log P &gt; 5), bypassing first-pass metabolism. Unlike the portal-hepatic pathway, lymphatic uptake is rarely considered in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for oral delivery. Our study developed an innovative Gastro-Intestinal (GI)-lymph-PBPK model that includes GI absorption, chylomicron extraction (CE) to rescue drugs from gut extraction (GE), and bypass hepatic extraction (HE). This model introduces CE clearance (CL CE ), competing with GE clearance, to estimate the drug proportion subjected to CE versus GE. PBPK analysis for Buprenorphine revealed extensive GE (0.87) and HE (0.58), explaining the low bioavailability (F%) of 5.28% in rats. Buprenorphine prodrugs activated CL CE , leading to CE ranging from 0.37 to 0.79, boosting oral F% to 39.9%-79.9% in rats. To translate from rat to human, our model considered species differences in GI transit time, formulation, food-dependent drug dissolution, allometric scaling in CL CE , and between species variability in gut metabolism. Using Halofantrine, we established an allometric scaling factor for CL CE at 1.1. Accounting for six times faster human gut metabolism, our model predicted an extremely low oral F% of 0.382% for Buprenorphine in humans. Incorporating the allometric scaled CL CE competing with the extensive gut metabolism, our model predicted Buprenorphine prodrugs remains effective in enabling substantial absorption boosts, with oral F% estimates ranging from 15.8% to 56.7% in humans. This study highlights the significant potential of GI-lymph-PBPK modeling in predicting intestinal lymphatic absorption and facilitating cross-species translation. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The prevalence of obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide, however there is a notable gap in understanding how obesity affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs and how dosing should be adjusted in obese population. The goals of this work were to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue disposition of piperacillin, cefazolin, and cefoxitin in a rat model of diet-induced obesity compared to a lean cohort. Male Long-Evans rats were fed high-fat or control diets for 23 weeks. Various measures of body size and composition were collected. The animals were administered a mixture containing 50 mg/kg cefoxitin, 50 mg/kg cefazolin, and 120 mg/kg piperacillin. Plasma and tissues were collected and analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were develop to capture the biodistribution of these drugs in lean and obese cohorts. Most plasma and tissue concentrations were comparable between lean and obese rats after dosing based on mg/kg of total body weight; however, in some tissues concentration was consistently higher in obese animals. PBPKs successfully captured biodistribution of three drugs and both cohorts; however, cohort-specific (lean or obese) parameters were required for liver (for cefoxitin and cefazolin) and spleen (for all three drugs) for capturing the data.The results support the necessity of using mg/kg dosing for obese rats to achieve drug exposure comparable to that of lean rats. In the future, these models could be extended to predict plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue disposition of cefoxitin, cefazolin, and piperacillin in humans by incorporating interspecies scaling approaches.

    "abstract": "Abstract Use of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling for extrapolation to organ impairment populations requires successful prediction for physiological changes. For drugs bound to human serum albumin (HSA), prediction of albumin concentrations is crucial to predict population differences in fraction unbound in plasma (fu). In this study, a multi-variable model was developed for prediction of HSA concentrations in renal impairment, using easily accessible variables (BMI, eGFR, age, sex, race and ethnicity) as predictors. An increase of eGFR from 15 to 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 was predicted to elevate HSA concentration by 0.30—0.32 g/dL regardless of subjects’ characteristics. Data from obese patients undergoing mini-gastric bypass surgery was used for external validation (observed BMI from 44.5 to 27.3 kg/m 2 , leading to predicted HSA concentration change of 0.3 versus 0.1–0.3 g/dL), highlighting the model’s potential to enhance PBPK simulations for a broader population. Application of the new albumin model for predicting fu in renal impairment was evaluated with the single binding protein model. Consideration of inter-individual variability predicted by the albumin model could explain some variability in the observed fu data between different drugs and studies (54% observed records within 2.5th—97.5th percentile range of prediction). However, overall underprediction of fold-change in fu between healthy and severe renal impairment (45% observed data exceeded 97.5th percentile of prediction) was noted. Although accounting for changes in binding affinity in predictive models of fu remains a challenge, the newly developed albumin model can support generation of realistic virtual subjects to support PBPK predictions of plasma protein binding.

    "abstract": "Abstract Iberdomide is a BCS III CELMoD™ agent currently under development for treatment of multiple myeloma. Five formulations were used during clinical development, starting with active ingredient in gelatin capsule (AIC), followed by subsequent formulations in gelatin (F1), HPMC capsules (F2 and F3), and finally the intended commercial form (ICF). A food effect study with the Phase I AIC formulation showed no food effect and two relative bioavailability studies bridging from AIC to formulation F1 and F2 showed similar systemic exposure. Modeling and simulation, based on in vitro dissolution, was used to bridge gaps in clinical data to demonstrate lack of a food effect across all formulations including ICF. First, a previously developed population pharmacokinetic (PK) model showed that formulation was not a covariate on iberdomide PK. Then a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) informed by in vitro biorelevant dissolution was used to mechanistically describe iberdomide absorption. While minor differences between formulations were noted in their in vitro dissolution, PBPK modeling showed lack of a food effect across all five formulations. Sensitivity analysis using the PBPK model demonstrated that iberdomide permeability and total amount of drug released from formulation are the most sensitive parameters in defining the systemic exposure of iberdomide, in agreement with iberdomide’s BCS III classification where drug release from drug product, and not solubility, is the rate-limiting step of dissolution. Based on the totality of evidence, which included clinical and in vitro data supplemented by modeling and simulation, no food effect is expected with the ICF. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) is an informative model diagnostic that can offer advantages over the standard visual predictive check (VPC) when heterogenous study designs and adaptive dosing are used. However, a drawback with these plots is that prediction correction often results in y-axis values and trends that are unintuitive, difficult to explain, and challenging to communicate even among experts. The reference-corrected visual predictive check (rcVPC) offers a solution to these problems by leveraging a user-defined set of independent variables, for a more intuitive model diagnostic and an efficient communication of results to a wider audience. The rcVPC methodology is based on the definition of a reference dataset. Simulations are conducted with this reference dataset and the observed dataset, and then the simulated and the observed dependent variables are normalized by the population prediction for the user-defined independent variables in the reference dataset. The opportunity to manipulate time in the reference dataset is a unique feature that gives rcVPC the ability to visually characterize exposure–response relationships with delayed effect onset. The rcVPC approach was compared to pcVPCs and traditional VPCs for a range of examples inspired by real data. The rcVPC methodology was demonstrated to offer a more intuitive interpretation and more effective guidance to model development in a way that is not possible for VPC or pcVPC plots.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The pharmacokinetics of antibodies with varied binding kinetics were simulated to assess the role of affinity and binding microconstants (kon, koff) on tumor exposure and intra-tumoral distribution. Anti-HER2 constructs (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, VK3VH6, and conjugates with DM1 and gelonin) were produced, purified, and tested for binding and cytotoxicity in vitro , and for intra-tumoral distribution and anti-tumor efficacy in mice. Simulations demonstrated that homogeneity in intra-tumoral distribution increases with increases in koff and with decreases in kon. Interestingly, simulations also predicted that homogeneity in tumor distribution may be improved by decreasing kon and koff in parallel (without changing affinity). Relative to trastuzumab, pertuzumab exhibits similar affinity but a ~ fivefold smaller kon and koff, while VK3VH6 exhibits a similar koff but a ~ 30-fold lower kon and affinity. Conjugate concentrations associated with 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50s) were found to vary with affinity, where IC50 values were similar for pertuzumab and trastuzumab, and higher for VK3VH6. Consistent with model simulations, VK3VH6 and pertuzumab demonstrated more homogeneous tumor distribution than trastuzumab. Although treatment differences were not statistically significant, pertuzumab and VK3VH6 conjugates showed trends for increased survival time relative to mice treated with trastuzumab conjugates. Our simulation and experimental results demonstrate complex relationships between antibody-antigen binding kinetics, intratumoral distribution, and efficacy. The rate constant of association, kon, is an underappreciated determinant of intra-tumoral distribution; among high-affinity antibodies, those with lower values of kon may be expected to exhibit improved intra-tumoral distribution and, potentially, efficacy.

    "abstract": "Abstract DXd, a camptothecin derivative, is employed as the payload molecule for the antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which is in current clinical use for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer. Despite the clinical success of ADCs for treatment of cancer, exposure to released payload in plasma and extracellular fluids contributes to off-target toxicities, which limit ADC dosage and efficacy. In this study, we evaluated an anti-DXd antibody fragment, 8C2 Fab, for utility in mitigating DXd toxicity in cell culture and for improving the therapeutic index of T-DXd in vivo in mice. 8C2 Fab was produced, purified, and characterized for binding to DXd and T-DXd. In vitro competitive cytotoxicity assays showed that 8C2 Fab blocked the cell-killing effect of DXd, increasing the DXd concentration associated with 50% growth inhibition (IC 50 ) by 50-fold; however, 8C2 did not decrease the cytotoxicity of T-DXd. Co-administration of 8C2 Fab to mice with 600 mg/kg T-DXd significantly decreased the percentage body weight loss at nadir in mice compared to results found with T-DXd alone (12.8 ± 3.66% vs 7.08 ± 4.24%, p = 0.0331). In contrast, co-administration of 8C2 Fab with T-DXd (1 or 10 mg/kg) did not negatively impact the anti-tumor efficacy in mice bearing NCI-N87 xenograft tumors. Our results demonstrate that 8C2 Fab decreases DXd cytotoxicity in vitro , and decreases T-DXd-induced toxicity in vivo , while not inhibiting T-DXd anti-tumor efficacy in vitro or in vivo , supporting utility for improving the therapeutic index of T-DXd.

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the past three years, we have published a series of nine manuscripts demonstrating that all relevant pharmacokinetic relationships may be simply derived independent of differential equations, offering an alternative to traditional pharmacokinetic analyses. These derivations are based on an understanding of parallel and in series rate-defining processes, and account for all relevant drivers, including organ blood flow and drug delivery clearance kinetics, across both linear and nonlinear scenarios. In this tutorial, we present the simple derivation of renal clearance and hepatic clearance directly relevant to clinical pharmacokinetics, as applied to making drug dosing decisions based on measures of systemic exposure. We further advocate for a more streamlined and practical approach to teaching and applying clinical pharmacokinetics, noting that compartmental modeling, protein binding in hypothetical compartments, trapezoidal AUC calculations, and alternative volume of distribution parameters, aside from (the unfortunately misnamed) volume of distribution steady-state, often overcomplicate pharmacokinetics in practice. The key advantage of this simplified methodology is the ability to directly incorporate clearance from the drug delivery site into systemic pharmacokinetic relationships. This enables a clear understanding of how entering clearance can influence systemic AUC, helping explain: enhanced pharmacodynamic outcomes of slow drug delivery versus immediate-release formulations; systemic bioavailability measures exceeding unity, statistically significant discrepancies between urinary and systemic bioavailability measures; and changes in renal clearance as a function of drug clearance from the delivery site. These key concepts are illustrated by applying the proposed methodology to an example drug, analyzing all relevant clinical pharmacokinetic relationships required for dosing decisions.

This study evaluates the impact of gastric emptying kinetics on dipyridamole dissolution using a Gastrointestinal Simulator. A dynamic dissolution model incorporating first-order and Weibull kinetics was applied to simulate different gastric emptying profiles. Results indicate that dissolution behavior is significantly influenced by the rate and pattern of gastric emptying, affecting drug solubility and potential bioavailability. The Weibull model provided a more flexible fit to experimental data, but the external control shows that significant differences exist between theorical and experimental gastric volumes. These findings highlight the importance of integrating physiologically relevant gastric emptying models into biopharmaceutical assessments to improve the prediction of in vivo drug performance. This approach could enhance the design of oral formulations by optimizing dissolution profiles for weak base drugs. Graphical Abstracts",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is a key target for time-dependent inhibition (TDI) assessment during drug development. However, translating in vitro TDI data to in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) risk remains challenging due to the acknowledged overestimation when incorporating in vitro kinetics in predictive models. We investigated different in vitro TDI assay conditions in human liver microsomes (HLM) and evaluated their impact on the predictive accuracy for CYP3A4-related DDI for 32 marketed drugs. Considering assay sensitivity and in vivo DDI prediction accuracy with mechanistic static modeling (MSM), optimal incubation parameters were identified as: a pre-incubation time of 40 min for precipitants and 10 min incubation time for CYP3A4 substrate midazolam (10 μM) at 0.1 mg/mL HLM. A tendency to overestimate the DDI magnitude (AFE = 4.83, AAFE = 4.87) was still observed in MSM when using the unbound drug inhibition constant (KI, u ) and maximum inactivation rate (k inact ), measured under optimized incubation conditions. Improved predictions were achieved when applying the same parameters in physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models (AFE = 1.94, AAFE = 2.13), with 60% of predicted AUCR falling in the twofold range. These findings highlighted the importance of optimizing in vitro TDI incubation conditions, together with evaluating the benefits and limitations of numerical prediction approaches for predicting clinically significant CYP3A4 TDI effects with mechanistic static and PBPK models.

    "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to protein therapeutics have traditionally been assumed to be the most impactful subset of anti-drug-antibodies (ADA). NAbs can block the biotherapeutic from engaging its target impacting efficacy and may also cause serious safety events. Stand-alone NAb assays have been employed to detect neutralizing responses, often with reconfigured versions of other assays. These methods have historically been implemented in registrational trials for all molecules, and in early-stage studies for high risk biotherapeutics. However, data has demonstrated that NAb response and ADA magnitude are highly correlated. Additionally, the use of other markers to identify clinically relevant immunogenicity, such as apparent impact on pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD), has been increasing. This manuscript reviews the available data on clinically meaningful immunogenic responses to biologics and proposes a risk-based strategy to determine if and when to employ a stand-alone NAb assay. For molecules with a high risk of safety consequences of immunogenicity (e.g., biological mimics) a NAb assay is recommended. However, for lower-safety risk molecules a stand-alone NAb assay does not enhance the interpretation of clinical data and is likely not needed. A combination of other assessments including ADA status, magnitude and persistence, PK, and PD (and efficacy) can be used as a surrogate for NAb assay data. Integration of data from all clinical evaluations is recommended by Health Authorities and can provide a more accurate overall assessment of neutralizing activity. This approach identifies clinically impactful downstream readouts of neutralizing activity without the need for a stand-alone NAb assay.",

However, an oral eflornithine treatment against late-stage g-HAT would be preferable. Pharmacokinetics of eflornithine are enantioselective with different oral absorption of the enantiomers. L-eflornithine has a greater in vitro antitrypanosomal potency than D-eflornithine. This study aimed to integrate knowledge about in vitro potency and literature data from the only clinical study with enantiospecific pharmacokinetic oral data to predict L-eflornithine concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid to estimate the probability of target attainment. L- and D-eflornithine concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from the clinical study with enantiospecific data were described with a compartment model that was validated using external data with total eflornithine concentrations. Simulations were performed with oral L-eflornithine doses ranging between 125 to 1000 mg/kg/day administered twice to twelve times daily. The probability of target attainment analysis showed that oral L-eflornithine doses of 750 mg/kg/day administered four or twelve times daily (i.e., drinking a solution every 2nd hour) as monotherapy would be needed to acquire efficacious exposures. In combination with nifurtimox, L-eflornithine dosed at 375 mg/kg/day four or twelve times daily would give exposures over the threshold concentration in cerebrospinal fluid. The presented simulation framework may serve as a starting point to find a suitable oral dose regimen to assess the clinical potential for an oral L-eflornithine-based combination treatments against late-stage g-HAT.

Due to their inherent structural complexity and heterogeneous composition, accurate characterization and quantification of ADCs pose significant bioanalytical challenges. This review discusses recent advancements in bioanalytical methodologies, including ligand binding assays (LBAs), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)-based approaches, and emerging hybrid LBA-LC–MS/MS platforms. In addition, this review will discuss pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling approaches essential to ADC development, ranging from population PK models to mechanistic frameworks, including physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models. These modeling strategies allow detailed characterization of ADC absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination processes while also accounting for complexities introduced by payload deconjugation and drug-to-antibody ratio variability. By integrating robust bioanalytical methods with advanced modeling techniques, this review provides researchers with essential insights to enhance ADC characterization, inform experimental design, and ultimately facilitate the development of safer, more effective therapeutic candidates.

    "abstract": "Increasing the concentration of intravenous (IV) biologic formulations to render them appropriate for subcutaneous (SC) delivery is challenging because it impacts many interrelated variables, including volume, viscosity, and stability. This study gathered drug formulation expert insights regarding these challenges as well as development approach preferences and perceptions concerning formulation volume. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry experts familiar with creating high-concentration (≥ 100 mg/mL) biologic drug formulations for SC delivery completed an online survey between 26 April and 7 May 2024. In total, there were 100 respondents included. When asked to rank seven approaches to transitioning a formulation from IV to SC administration, responses showed that increasing drug concentrations to reduce injection volume and/or changing the primary container were considered riskier, more time-consuming, and more costly than maintaining the concentration and using an on-body delivery system (OBDS). The greatest challenges mentioned were solubility issues (75%), viscosity-related challenges (72%), and aggregation issues (68%). Most respondents (69%) reported delays in clinical trials or product launches due to high-concentration SC formulation challenges. Of these, 33.3% experienced delays of 6-9 months (weighted mean: 11.3 months), while 4.3% indicated that trials or launches were canceled entirely due to formulation difficulties. In conclusion, making minimal drug formulation concentration changes to an IV biologic formulation may reduce the risk, time commitment, and cost associated with developing a SC biologic formulation. Further education is needed around the transition of traditional IV formulations to low-concentration, large-volume SC formulations utilizing delivery formats such as an SC infusion pump or OBDS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Minipig models are rapidly gaining popularity in gene therapy preclinical studies. This includes biodistribution studies that are required by regulatory agencies, but are poorly described in the literature. This is particularly true for ddPCR assays with enhanced sensitivity over traditional “real-time” PCR. We, therefore, validated a novel duplex ddPCR assay for quantifying AVGN7, an AAV gene therapeutic featuring a codon-optimized human Smad7 gene and the porcine RPP30 reference gene, in Göttingen minipig tissues. The DNA extraction methods were optimized to ensure maximum recovery of target gene. Validation parameters included accuracy and precision, limit of detection, ruggedness/robustness, selectivity, recovery, dilutional linearity and stability. The assay was sensitive to 10 cp/µg gDNA while intra- and inter-accuracy and precision were demonstrated for the dynamic range of 25,000–5 cp/µL where the inter-assay total error was ≤ 35.5% for AVGN7 and ≤ 4.3% for RPP30. Moreover, ruggedness was assessed over time using multiple analysts, instruments and reagent lots, demonstrating high reliability and reproducibility. Linearity was established across 1,000-fold dilutions and stability after 6 freeze–thaw cycles and 24 h at room temperature. Selectivity was evaluated in unspiked and post-spiked samples using multiple lots of different tissue matrices. High recovery of AVGN7 during nucleic acid extraction was also demonstrated for all tissues. These data not only validate the assay for tracking and quantifying AVGN7 in preclinical studies with Göttingen minipigs, but additionally address challenges of using pig models in general while providing a procedural road map for developing other AAV biodistribution assays.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Generic ophthalmic drug product development is challenging, and innovative methodologies to complement traditional bioequivalence (BE) studies for BE assessment are desirable to promote their evaluation. Ocular physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models can provide insight into drug partitioning in eye tissues that are too invasive to access in humans. An approach has been previously validated to translate ocular exposure from rabbits to humans for some ophthalmic solutions and suspensions. This study aims to demonstrate the utility of an ocular PBPK model to predict human exposure following the administration of ophthalmic ointment. Ofloxacin (OFL) ointment is presented as a case study. The Ocular Compartmental Absorption and Transit (OCAT™) model within GastroPlus® v9.9 was used to build a PBPK model for OFL ophthalmic solution and ointment that accounts for OFL release from the formulation into the tears and eye tissues where it is applied, ointment application time, ocular absorption, and distribution in the rabbit eye. The model was subsequently used to predict OFL exposure in humans after topical administration of solution or ointment. Drug and formulation-specific parameters were used as validated in the mode for rabbits. Physiological parameters were adjusted to match human ocular physiology. Simulated human ocular pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles were compared with the observed ocular tissue concentration data to assess the OCAT model’s ability to predict human ocular exposure. The OCAT model for rabbits accurately described the observed concentrations in aqueous humor following the topical administration of OFL solution or ointment. For the ointment formulation, the Higuchi release rate and the application time of the formulation were fitted to describe the observed data. After adjustment of physiological parameters to represent the human eye, the predicted aqueous humor concentrations following ocular administration of OFL solution or ointment were within the range of observed values. More case studies for other ophthalmic ointment drug products will be needed to confirm this study’s results. Nevertheless, the positive preclinical to clinical extrapolation for OFL represents an important step in the validation process of human exposure using an ocular PBPK model validated in the rabbit.

    "abstract": "Abstract It is important to understand the key factors affecting the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacological response and toxicity of a drug to ensure clinical therapeutic efficacy and safety across disease populations. Traditionally, label dose-adjustment recommendations for patient populations are based on drug plasma concentrations. However, plasma PK may not be an appropriate surrogate for response and/or toxicity for drugs like statins with intracellular targets and tissue distribution influenced by membrane transporters. This study presents the integration of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model with a quantitative systems pharmacology and toxicology (PBPK-QSP-TOX) model for statins in patients with normal kidney function and in different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The QSP model was informed by 2753 measurements of circulating LDL concentrations in 1147 patients (NCT00654537). The TOX model was informed by a meta-analysis of creatine kinase elevation incidence per statin dose in 30 clinical studies (49,284 patients). The CKD populations accounted for disease related changes to 1) anatomy and physiology, 2) drug enzymes and transporters expression and 3) lipoprotein metabolism. This study provides a qualified PBPK-QSP-TOX model for statins that accurately describe plasma concentration–time profiles, lipid-lowering effect and myotoxicity risk over investigated dose range for patients with normal kidney function and varying degree of CKD.

    "abstract": "Abstract Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are commonly used in human drug discovery and development and human health risk assessment of environmental chemicals. One emerging application of PBPK models is to predict tissue residues and withdrawal times of drugs in food animals, which is important for human food safety assessment of animal-derived food products, such as meat, milk, and eggs. This review summarizes existing guidelines to establish the regulatory agency approved label withdrawal period and available pharmacometric methods to predict extralabel withdrawal times, with a focus on PBPK modeling. We conducted a comprehensive literature search on existing PBPK models in food animals. Two hundred thirteen PBPK models in different food animal species (e.g., cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and chickens) from 113 publications were identified. The general procedure to build a PBPK model for a drug in food animals to predict withdrawal times is summarized. Differences in PBPK modeling between humans and food animals and between different food animal species are discussed. Novel uses of PBPK models to predict extralabel withdrawal times are illustrated with recent case studies from the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (FARAD). Recent advances and challenges in PBPK modeling in food animals are discussed, followed by our future perspectives on how to develop more robust PBPK models for food animals to address the safety assessment of animal-derived food products.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recycling antibodies can enhance therapeutic efficacy by enabling efficient antigen removal through pH-dependent binding mechanisms enabling antibody recycling, but the optimal targets for this strategy remain unclear. This work employs a mathematical modeling approach using a minimal PBPK model, along with global and local sensitivity analyses, to explore how target turnover rates influence the suitability of recycling antibodies. We applied this approach to a scenario featuring a soluble antigen with high baseline levels (1000 nM) that necessitates treatment with an antibody with a high intravenous dosing regimen. Our findings indicate that the recycling strategy is most effective for target antigens expressed at high levels, and particularly for those with half-lives of 10 to 30 h. In contrast, for antigens expressed at sufficiently low levels, where the antibody can be present in significant excess, further optimization of conventional antibodies to achieve higher antigen-binding affinity at neutral pH can be beneficial. While optimizing the off-rate at acidic pH is often the primary focus in the engineering of recycling antibodies, our analysis indicates that the on-rate at pH 6 is also an important parameter, albeit to a lesser extent. Therefore, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) at pH 6 can be used as a composite parameter for effective design of recycling antibodies. For the soluble antigen embodied in the scenario described in this work, a pool of randomly selected antibodies, engineered to undergo recycling, reach half of their maximum antigen reduction capacity at a mean pH 6 K D of 520 nM and 180 nM for targets with half-lives of 10 and 30 h, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Using pharmacometrics to inform drug discovery and development decisions requires effective communication of models and data to all stakeholders. The new “vachette” visualization method presented here enables modelers and non-modelers to see how a model integrates and represents all data across relevant subgroups, showing how the model “sees” the data when it accounts for covariates. Vachette starts with user-provided model simulations (“curves”), together with observations used in creating (or otherwise relevant to) the model. It automatically produces a single, intuitive plot overlaying all observations onto a user-selected reference curve, accounting for covariate effects and preserving remaining random effects. The method automatically identifies characteristic landmarks (e.g., minima, maxima, and inflection points) which are used to split each curve into segments. A transformation on both x- and y-axes is then applied to each segment and its corresponding observations, accounting for covariate effects by aligning the segments to the reference, allowing intuitive visualization in one plot of covariate effects and of model fit to the data, preserving the distance between model predictions and the observations. Vachette-transformed data can also be used to enhance the utility of model assessments such as visual predictive checks and residual plots. Model visualizations using vachette enable easier and more effective evaluation and communication of the pharmacometric results critical to informing key decisions. Here the vachette method is described and its utility and flexibility are demonstrated through application to multiple types of pharmacometrics models, suggesting that vachette is a useful addition to the pharmacometrician’s toolbox.

    "abstract": "Abstract Short contacts between medical devices and medications that they contain can cause drug sorption or leaching of unwanted compounds which can have clinical consequences. However, the parameters that govern these interactions are still incompletely understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of the formulation parameters on migration of 2,4 Di-tert-butylphenol (2,4 DTBP) and sorption of tacrolimus (TAC) in a model micellar ophthalmic drug formulation which is known to interact with silicone elastomers. A design of experiments was established to evaluate the impact of the formulation parameters on 2,4 DTBP leaching and tacrolimus sorption by varying the initial concentrations of TAC (0.04; 0.2 and 1 mg/mL), polyoxyethylenated castor oil (KEL) (32; 80 and 200 mg/mL) and ethanol absolute (EtOH) (10 and 100 mg/mL), at 5°C and 25°C, during static contact between various formulations and silicone valves obtained from an ophthalmic multidose delivery device. Concentrations of 2,4 DTBP and TAC were monitored by liquid chromatography coupled with an UV–visible detector. Under the conditions studied, the amount of 2,4 DTBP leaching out increased during contact with the silicone valve, with increasing TAC concentration being quite interestingly the main factor decreasing its ability to leach out, whilst ethanol increased its leachability. The silicone valve did not cause any significant decrease of TAC concentrations over the duration of the study, regardless of the concentrations of KEL, EtOH, or temperature. This study showed the impact of formulation on the leaching of 2,4 DTBP from a silicone component. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced cardiac arrhythmia, especially occurrence of torsade de pointes (TdP), has been a leading cause of attrition and post-approval re-labeling and withdrawal of many drugs. TdP is a multifactorial event, reflecting more than just drug-induced cardiac ion channel inhibition and QT interval prolongation. This presents a translational gap in extrapolating pre-clinical and clinical cardiac safety assessment to estimate TdP risk reliably, especially when the drug of interest is used in combination with other QT-prolonging drugs for treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis. A multi-scale mechanistic modeling framework consisting of physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) simulations of clinically relevant drug exposures combined with Quantitative Systems Toxicology (QST) models of cardiac electro-physiology could bridge this gap. We illustrate this PBPK-QST approach in cardiac risk assessment as exemplified by moxifloxacin, an anti-tuberculosis drug with abundant clinical cardiac safety data. PBPK simulations of moxifloxacin concentrations (systemic circulation and estimated in heart tissue) were linked with in vitro measurements of cardiac ion channel inhibition to predict the magnitude of QT prolongation in healthy individuals. Predictions closely reproduced the clinically observed QT interval prolongation, but no arrhythmia was observed, even at ×10 exposure. However, the same exposure levels in presence of physiological risk factors, e.g., hypokalemia and tachycardia, led to arrhythmic event in simulations, consistent with reported moxifloxacin-related TdP events. Application of a progressive PBPK-QST cardiac risk assessment paradigm starting in early development could guide drug development decisions and later define a clinical “safe space” for post-approval risk management to identify high-risk clinical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Multiple imputation (MI) is an approach widely used in statistical analysis of incomplete data. However, its application to missing data problems in nonlinear mixed-effects modelling is limited. The objective was to implement a four-step MI method for handling missing covariate data in NONMEM and to evaluate the method's sensitivity to η-shrinkage. Four steps were needed; (1) estimation of empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs) using a base model without the partly missing covariate, (2) a regression model for the covariate values given the EBEs from subjects with covariate information, (3) imputation of covariates using the regression model and (4) estimation of the population model. Steps (3) and (4) were repeated several times. The procedure was automated in PsN and is now available as the mimp functionality ( http://psn.sourceforge.net/ ). The method's sensitivity to shrinkage in EBEs was evaluated in a simulation study where the covariate was missing according to a missing at random type of missing data mechanism. The η-shrinkage was increased in steps from 4.5 to 54%. Two hundred datasets were simulated and analysed for each scenario. When shrinkage was low the MI method gave unbiased and precise estimates of all population parameters. With increased shrinkage the estimates became less precise but remained unbiased.",

In this work, we used simulations to (1) evaluate different analysis methods for detecting PD interactions between two hypothetical anti-tubercular drugs in in vitro time-kill experiments, and (2) provide design recommendations for evaluation of PD interactions. The model used for all simulations was the Multistate Tuberculosis Pharmacometric (MTP) model linked to the General Pharmacodynamic Interaction (GPDI) model. Simulated data were re-estimated using the MTP–GPDI model implemented in Bliss Independence or Loewe Additivity, or using a conventional model such as an Empirical Bliss Independence-based model or the Greco model based on Loewe Additivity. The GPDI model correctly characterized different PD interactions (antagonism, synergism, or asymmetric interaction), regardless of the underlying additivity criterion. The commonly used conventional models were not able to characterize asymmetric PD interactions, i.e., concentration-dependent synergism and antagonism. An optimized experimental design was developed that correctly identified interactions in ≥ 94% of the evaluated scenarios using the MTP–GPDI model approach. The MTP–GPDI model approach was proved to provide advantages to other conventional models for assessing PD interactions of anti-tubercular drugs and provides key information for selection of drug combinations for Phase 2b evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Bioavailability/bioequivalence studies supporting clinical drug development or commercial supply of drug formulations are often time, cost, and resource intensive. The drug's pharmacokinetic (PK) variability, systemic half-life, and safety issues may pose additional challenges. The stable isotope label (SIL) approach provides a useful tool to significantly reduce the study size in clinical PK studies. Tafenoquine (TQ) is an 8-aminoquinoline under development for preventing Plasmodium vivax malaria relapse. This SIL study assessed the impact of differences in the in vitro dissolution profiles on in vivo exposure of TQ tablets. Fourteen healthy volunteers received a single dose of 300 mg TQ Intermediate Aged or 300 mg TQ Control formulations in this single-center, two-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study. Endpoints included the geometric means ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞); primary endpoint) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for Intermediate Aged versus Control TQ; correlation of PK parameters for venous versus peripheral (via microsample) blood samples; and safety and tolerability endpoints. Geometric mean ratios for PK parameters (AUC and Cmax) and their 90% confidence intervals fell well within standard bioequivalence limits (0.80-1.25). Only one mild adverse event (skin abrasion) was reported. In summary, this SIL methodology-based study demonstrates that the observed differences in the in vitro dissolution profiles between the Control and Intermediate Aged TQ tablets have no clinically relevant effect on systemic TQ exposure. The SIL approach was successfully implemented to enable the setting of a clinically relevant dissolution specification.This study (GSK study number 201780) is registered at clinicaltrials.gov with identifier NCT02751294.",

    "abstract": "After a century of applications of the seminal Michaelis-Menten equation since its advent it is timely to scrutinise its principal parts from an in vivo point of view. Thus, the Michaelis-Menten system was revisited in which enzymatic turnover, i.e. synthesis and elimination was incorporated. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies of the Michaelis-Menten system have been mainly based on the assumption that the total pool of enzyme, free and bound, is constant. However, in fact this may not always be the case, particularly for chronic indications. Chronic (periodic) administration of drugs is often related to induction or inhibition of enzymatic processes and even changes in the free enzymatic load per se. This may account for the fact that translation of in vitro metabolism data have shown to give systematic deviations from experimental in vivo data. Interspecies extrapolations of metabolic data are often challenged by poor predictability due to insufficient power of applied functions and methods. By incorporating enzyme turnover, a more mechanistic expression of substrate, free enzyme and substrate-enzyme complex concentrations is derived. In particular, it is shown that whereas in closed systems there is a threshold for chronic dosing beyond which the substrate concentration keeps rising, in open systems involving enzyme turnover this is no longer the case. However, in the presence of slow enzyme turnover, after an initial period of adjustment which may be quite long, the relation between substrate concentration and dose rate reduces to a linear expression. This new open framework is also applicable to transporter systems.",

    "abstract": "The study of weak or colloidal interactions of therapeutic proteins in different formulations allows prediction and optimization of protein stability. Various biophysical techniques have been applied to determine the second osmotic virial coefficient B2 as it reflects on the macromolecular distance distribution that governs solution behavior at high concentration. In the present work, we exploit a direct link predicted by hydrodynamic theory between B2 and the nonideality of sedimentation, commonly measured in sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation through the nonideality coefficient of sedimentation, kS. Using sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation for independent measurement of B2, we have examined the dependence of kS on B2 for model proteins in different buffers. The data exhibit the expected linear relationship and highlight the impact of protein shape on the magnitude of the nonideality coefficient kS. Recently, measurements of kS have been considerably simplified allowing higher throughput and simultaneous polydispersity assessment at higher protein concentrations. Thus, sedimentation velocity may offer a useful approach to compare the impact of formulation conditions on weak interactions and simultaneously on higher-order structure of therapeutic proteins.",

    "abstract": "IL-7 receptor-α (IL-7Rα) blockade has been shown to reverse autoimmune diabetes in the non-obese diabetic mouse by promoting inhibition of effector T cells and consequently altering the balance of regulatory T (Treg) and effector memory (TEM) cells. PF-06342674 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the function of IL-7Rα. In the current phase 1b study, subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D) received subcutaneous doses of either placebo or PF-06342674 (1, 3, 8 mg/kg/q2w or 6 mg/kg/q1w) for 10 weeks and were followed up to 18 weeks. Nonlinear mixed effects models were developed to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), target engagement biomarkers, and immunomodulatory activity. PF-06342674 was estimated to have 20-fold more potent inhibitory effect on TEM cells relative to Treg cells resulting in a non-monotonic dose-response relationship for the Treg:TEM ratio, reaching maximum at ~ 3 mg/kg/q2w dose. Target-mediated elimination led to nonlinear PK with accelerated clearance at lower doses due to high affinity binding and rapid clearance of the drug-target complex. Doses ≥ 3 mg/kg q2w result in sustained PF-06342674 concentrations higher than the concentration of cellular IL-7 receptor and, in turn, maintain near maximal receptor occupancy over the dosing interval. The results provide important insight into the mechanism of IL-7Rα blockade and immunomodulatory activity of PF-06342674 and establish a rational framework for dose selection for subsequent clinical trials of PF-06342674. Furthermore, this analysis serves as an example of mechanistic modeling to support dose selection of a drug candidate in the early phases of development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) has gained interest in physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) modelling and simulation from pharmaceutical industry, regulatory authorities, and academia. With the case study of an in-house PBPK model for inhaled compounds in rats, the aim of this work is to show how GSA can contribute in PBPK model development and daily use. We identified two types of GSA that differ in the aims and, thus, in the parameter variability: inter-compound and intra-compound GSA. The inter-compound GSA aims to understand which are the parameters that mostly influence the variability of the metrics of interest in the whole space of the drugs’ properties, and thus, it is useful during the model development. On the other hand, the intra-compound GSA aims to highlight how much the uncertainty associated with the parameters of a given drug impacts the uncertainty in the model prediction and so, it is useful during routine PBPK use. In this work, inter-compound GSA highlighted that dissolution- and formulation-related parameters were mostly important for the prediction of the fraction absorbed, while the permeability is the most important parameter for lung AUC and MRT. Intra-compound GSA highlighted that, for all the considered compounds, the permeability was one of the most important parameters for lung AUC, MRT and plasma MRT, while the extraction ratio and the dose for the plasma AUC. GSA is a crucial instrument for the quality assessment of model-based inference; for this reason, we suggest its use during both PBPK model development and use.",

The present review focuses on the bioanalytical challenges and considerations for RNA-based drugs, bispecific antibodies and multi-domain protein therapeutics, prodrugs, gene and cell therapies, and fusion proteins. Methods ranging from the conventional ligand binding assays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assays to quantitative polymerase chain reaction or flow cytometry often used for oligonucleotides and cell and gene therapies are discussed. Best practices for method selection and validation are proposed as well as a future perspective to address the bioanalytical needs of complex modalities.",

The use of living cells as the active medicinal ingredient present great opportunities to deliver treatment that can trigger the body’s own capacity to regenerate damaged or diseased tissue. Some of the challenges in controlling the quality of the finished cell-therapy product relate to the use of a variety of raw materials including excipients, process aids, and growth promotion factors. The quality of these materials is critical for ensuring the safety and quality of the finished therapeutic products. This review will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities associated with the qualification of excipients as well as that of the ancillary materials used in manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Itraconazole is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), associated with numerous drug-drug interactions (DDI). PUR1900, a dry powder formulation of itraconazole for oral inhalation, results in high lung and low systemic exposure. This project used physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to assess the DDI potential of inhaled PUR1900, using midazolam as a “victim drug.” The basic and mechanistic static models evaluated the DDI potential of PUR1900, assuming 5 mg of midazolam coadministration at steady-state itraconazole exposure. Subsequently, Simcyp® PBPK simulation software and pharmacokinetic data from a Phase 1 clinical trial with PUR1900 (NCT03479411) were used to optimize an existing itraconazole PBPK model. The model was applied to investigate the potential for CYP3A4 DDI when 5 mg of midazolam is co-administered with inhaled PUR1900 at a steady state in a virtual healthy population at PUR1900 doses up to 40 mg per day. The basic static and mechanistic static models suggested a strong likelihood for DDI with inhaled PUR1900. The PBPK model was consistent with PUR1900 Phase 1 trial data. The geometric mean C max and AUC ratios of midazolam at a maximum dose of 40 mg PUR1900 were 1.14 and 1.26, respectively, indicating a minimal likelihood of DDI with inhaled PUR1900. The low systemic exposure of itraconazole when administered as PUR1900 results in minimal to no CYP3A4 inhibition, reducing the concern of drug-drug interactions. As the risk of CYP3A4 DDI is predicted to be significantly lower when itraconazole is administered via oral inhalation as PUR1900, it is likely that PUR1900 can be safely used for the treatment of pulmonary fungal infections in patients taking pharmaceuticals currently contraindicated with oral itraconazole.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cell-based immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment in recent years and is rapidly expanding as one of the major therapeutic options in immuno-oncology. So far ten adoptive T cell therapies (TCTs) have been approved by the health authorities for cancer treatment, and they have shown remarkable anti-tumor efficacy with potent and durable responses. While adoptive T cell therapies have shown success in treating hematological malignancies, they are lagging behind in establishing promising efficacy in treating solid tumors, partially due to our incomplete understanding of the cellular kinetics (CK) and biodistribution (including tumoral penetration) of cell therapy products. Indeed, recent clinical studies have provided ample evidence that CK of TCTs can influence clinical outcomes in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge on the CK and biodistribution of anti-tumor TCTs. We will first describe the typical CK and biodistribution characteristics of these “living” drugs, and the biological factors that influence these characteristics. We will then review the relationships between CK and pharmacological responses of TCT, and potential strategies in enhancing the persistence and tumoral penetration of TCTs in the clinic. Finally, we will also summarize bioanalytical methods, preclinical in vitro and in vivo tools, and in silico modeling approaches used to assess the CK and biodistribution of TCTs.

    "abstract": "Abstract The administration of biotherapeutics has the potential to induce potent immune responses, including the induction of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) (1). Detection and characterization of ADA in clinical trials is an important component of a comprehensive immunogenicity program (2). ADA testing is mostly accomplished with ligand-binding assays (LBA). While LBA can be robust and specific, they are susceptible to various sources of interference (3). Of particular concern, interference from residual drug present in patient samples may lead to loss of ADA detection, producing false negative results. To mitigate drug interference, sample pretreatment procedures have been developed to enrich ADA from samples with high drug concentrations (4, 5). The pretreatment procedures can vary considerably but typically involve an initial step to liberate ADA from ADA-drug complexes and a subsequent step to affinity capture ADA and acid elute for detection. While these procedures can be highly effective, they have certain drawbacks when performed manually. First, the procedures are time-consuming and require near constant attention. Second, because of the manual workflow, the procedures can produce variable results between experiments and between different analysts with negative consequences for assay robustness. To address these drawbacks, we developed an automated procedure to enrich ADA by leveraging dual flow chromatography (DFC) and Streptavidin PhyTip® columns on a liquid-handling system (6). The enriched ADA were then tested in an LBA to evaluate the effectiveness of the automated enrichment procedure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As the field of gene therapy advances and as the importance of sex as a biological variable in shaping viral immune responses is recognized, the impact of sex on adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors mediated gene therapies remain largely unexplored. Here we review current understanding of the immune response against AAV gene therapy as well as the knowledge of sex differences observed in viral responses. We discuss sex differences in innate immune mechanisms such as Toll-like receptor recognition and complement activation, as well as the functional responses of key immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and T/B cells that are involved in AAV immunogenicity. Variations in pre-existing immunity, including differences in antibody levels and neutralizing activity among sexes, are also described. Additionally, we investigate evidence in the literature of sex differences in AAV transduction in animal and suggest a potential link between the immune responses and higher transductions in males.

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continues to pose a major global health challenge, with an estimated 39.9 M cases and 1.3 M new infections per year. Up to 75%, of people with HIV (PWH) are currently being treated with antiretroviral therapy. The development of effective treatments for HIV requires a detailed understanding of the virus-host interaction. Often, mathematical models are used to inform this understanding as well as to characterize therapeutic response. This work aims to develop a single and fully identifiable population semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (popPKPD) model integrating data (drug levels, CD4 + T cells and viral RNA) of five different antiretroviral (ARV) drugs administered in monotherapy: lenacapavir, bictegravir, tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine and elvitegravir. Data were obtained from six phase 1 clinical studies and model development was performed using NONMEM 7.5.1. The viral dynamics were best described by expanding the “basic” viral dynamics model with two more populations of infected cells: chronically and latently infected. Obtained death rates values of infected cells &amp; virus were consistent with literature values. Population baseline HIV-RNA was estimated to be 43,460 copies/mL, with an IIV of 141%, the estimated baseline concentrations of CD4 + cells varied largely across the different cell types in the model: 410, 20, 7 and 7 cells/mL for uninfected, infected, chronic and latently infected cells, respectively. The popPKPD model was able to capture key aspects of viral dynamics, drug behaviour, and treatment response. The models developed will serve as a useful tool for further development and optimization of these HIV therapies, especially when evaluating multiple ARVs to be administered in a novel combination setting.

    "abstract": "An important approach to modeling tolerance and adaptation employs feedback mechanisms in which the response to the drug generates a counter-regulating action which affects the response. In this paper we analyze a family of nonlinear feedback models which has recently proved effective in modeling tolerance phenomena such as have been observed with SSRI's. We use dynamical systems methods to exhibit typical properties of the response-time course of these nonlinear models, such as overshoot and rebound, establish quantitive bounds and explore how these properties depend on the system and drug parameters. Our analysis is anchored in three specific in vivo data sets which involve different levels of pharmacokinetic complexity. Initial estimates for system (k(in), k(out), k(tol)) and drug (EC(50)/IC(50), E(max)/I(max), n) parameters are obtained on the basis of specific properties of the response-time course, identified in the context of exploratory (graphical) data analysis. Our analysis and the application of its results to the three concrete examples demonstrates the flexibility and potential of this family of feedback models.",

Quantitative systems toxicology and safety (QSTS) models have potential to quantitatively translate the in vitro cardiac safety data to clinical level including simulation of TQT trials. Virtual TQT simulations have been exemplified with use of two related drugs tolterodine and fesoterodine. The impact of bio-relevant concentration in plasma versus estimated heart tissue exposure on predictions was also assessed. Tolterodine and its therapeutically equipotent metabolite formed via CYP2D6 pathway, 5-HMT, inhibit multiple cardiac ion currents (IKr, INa, ICaL). The QSTS model was able to accurately simulate the QT prolongation at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic dose levels of tolterodine well within 95% confidence interval limits of observed data. The model was able to predict the QT prolongation difference between CYP2D6 extensive and poor metaboliser subject groups at both dose levels thus confirming the ability of the model to account for electrophysiologically active metabolite. The QSTS model was able to simulate the negligible QT prolongation observed with fesoterodine establishing that the 5-HMT does not prolong QT interval even though it is a blocker of hERG channel. With examples of TOL and FESO, we demonstrated the utility of the QSTS approaches to simulate virtual TQT trials, which in turn could complement and reduce the clinical studies or help optimise clinical trial designs.",

    "abstract": "It is important to be able to simulate and predict formulation effects on the pharmacokinetics of a drug in order to optimize effectivity in clinical practice and drug development. Two formulations containing doxorubicin are used in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): a Lipiodol-based emulsion (LIPDOX) and a loadable microbead system (DEBDOX). Although equally effective, the formulations are vastly different, and little is known about the parameters affecting doxorubicin release in vivo. However, mathematical modeling can be used to predict doxorubicin release properties from these formulations and its in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. A porcine semi-physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was scaled to a human physiologically based biopharmaceutical (PBBP) model that was altered to include HCC. DOX in vitro and in vivo release data from LIPDOX or DEBDOX were collected from the literature and combined with these in silico models. The simulated pharmacokinetic profiles were then compared with observed porcine and human HCC patient data. DOX pharmacokinetic profiles of LIPDOX-treated HCC patients were best predicted from release data sets acquired by in vitro methods that did not use a diffusion barrier. For the DEBDOX group, the best predictions were from the in vitro release method with a low ion concentration and a reduced loading dose. The in silico modeling combined with historical release data was effective in predicting in vivo plasma exposure. This can give useful insights into the release method properties necessary for correct in vivo predictions of pharmacokinetic profiles of HCC patients dosed with LIPDOX or DEBDOX.",

Locally D-optimal designs are investigated for a quadratic dose–response model for log-transformed data subject to right censoring. Two-stage adaptive D-optimal designs using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model updating are explored through simulation for a range of different dose–response scenarios and different amounts of censoring in the model. The adaptive optimal designs are found to be nearly as efficient as the locally D-optimal designs. A popular equal allocation design can be highly inefficient when the amount of censored data is high and when the Weibull model hazard is increasing. The issues of sample size planning/early stopping for an adaptive trial are investigated as well. The adaptive D-optimal design with early stopping can potentially reduce study size while achieving similar estimation precision as the fixed allocation design.",

    "abstract": "The American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) biosimilar focus group on nonclinical and clinical assays has developed this manuscript to guide the industry on best practices and testing strategies when developing neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays for biosimilar programs. The immunogenicity assessment to biosimilar and originator drug products is one of the key aspects of clinical programs for biosimilars to demonstrate biosimilarity. Establishing that there are no clinically meaningful differences in immune response between a proposed product and the originator product is a key element in the demonstration of biosimilarity. It is critical to collect, evaluate, and compare the safety and immunogenicity data from the clinical pharmacology, safety, and/or efficacy studies especially when the originator drug product is known to have potential for immune-mediated toxicity. This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive review and recommendations on assay formats, critical reagents, approaches to method development, and validation of the neutralizing antibody assays in extrapolation within the scope of biosimilar drug development programs. Even if there are multiple options on the development and validation of NAb assays for biosimilar programs, the type of drug and its MoA will help determine the assay format and technical platform for NAb assessment (e.g., cell-based or non-cell-based assay). We recommend to always perform a one-assay approach as it is better to confirm the biosimilarity using one-assay for NAb. If a one-assay approach is not feasible, then a two-assay format may be used. This manuscript will provide all the details necessary to develop NAb assays for biosimilars.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inhibiting MerTK on macrophages is a promising therapeutic strategy for augmenting anti-tumor immunity. However, blocking MerTK on retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEs) results in retinal toxicity. Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) containing an anti-MerTK therapeutic and anti-PD-L1 targeting arm were developed to reduce drug binding to MerTK on RPEs, since PD-L1 is overexpressed on macrophages but not RPEs. In this study, we present a modeling framework using in vitro receptor occupancy ( RO ) and pharmacokinetics (PK) data to predict efficacy, toxicity, and therapeutic index ( TI ) of anti-MerTK bsAbs. We first used simulations and in vitro RO data of anti-MerTK monospecific antibody (msAb) to estimate the required MerTK RO for in vivo efficacy and toxicity. Using these estimated RO thresholds, we employed our model to predict the efficacious and toxic doses for anti-MerTK bsAbs with varying affinities for MerTK. Our model predicted the highest TI for the anti-MerTK/PD-L1 bsAb with an attenuated MerTK binding arm, which was consistent with in vivo efficacy and toxicity observations. Subsequently, we used the model, in combination with sensitivity analysis and parameter scans, to suggest an optimal molecular design of anti-MerTK bsAb with the highest predicted TI in humans. Our prediction revealed that this optimized anti-MerTK bsAb should contain a MerTK therapeutic arm with relatively low affinity, along with a high affinity targeting arm that can bind to a low abundance target with slow turnover rate. Overall, these results demonstrated that our modeling framework can guide the rational design of bsAbs. Graphical Abstract",

This study investigates correlations between plasma clearance (CLp) and drug- and patient-related characteristics in obese subjects, and evaluates the systematic accuracy of common weight-based dosing methods. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach that uses recent information on obesity-related changes in physiology was used to simulate CLp for a normal-weight subject (body mass index [BMI] = 20) and subjects with various severities of obesity (BMI 25-60) for hypothetical hepatically cleared drugs with a wide range of properties. Influential variables for CLp change were investigated. For each drug and obese subject, the exponent that yields perfect allometric scaling of CLp from normal-weight subjects was assessed. Among all variables, BMI and relative changes in enzyme activity resulting from obesity proved highly correlated with obesity-related CLp changes. Drugs bound to α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) had lower CLp changes compared to drugs bound to human serum albumin (HSA). Lower extraction ratios (ER) corresponded to higher CLp changes compared to higher ER. The allometric exponent for perfect scaling ranged from -3.84 to 3.34 illustrating that none of the scaling methods performed well in all situations. While all three dosing methods are generally systematically accurate for drugs with unchanged or up to 50% increased enzyme activity in subjects with a BMI below 30 kg/m",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monitoring anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to infliximab and adalimumab is critical to treatment management in various autoimmune disorders. The growing need for proactive therapeutic monitoring further requires the detection of ADAs in the presence of measurable concentrations of infliximab or adalimumab. To provide robust analytical assays for clinical application, we evaluated two automated immunoassays developed using ImmunoCAP™ technology and based on the bridging format to measure serum ADAs to infliximab and adalimumab respectively. Without an acid-dissociation step, these research prototype assays can detect a positive control monoclonal ADA towards infliximab and adalimumab, ranging from &lt; 25 ng/ml to 10,000 ng/mL. Both assays exhibit imprecision less than 20% at different ADA titer levels and can distinguish ADAs towards different drug targets. In method comparison using authentic patient samples, the quantitative results of the ADA assays are not directly comparable to two existing clinical immunoassays for ADAs (correlation coefficient r s = 0.673 for infliximab ADAs; r s = 0.510 for adalimumab ADAs), presumably due to the lack of commutable ADA standards and the polyclonal nature of ADAs. Nevertheless, there is qualitative agreement between the methods when evaluating putative positive and negative patient samples (overall agreement 0.83 for infliximab ADAs; 0.76 for adalimumab ADAs). Biotin and high levels of rheumatoid factors may interfere with the performance of the automated assays due to competitive binding with the biotinylated drug and non-specific formation of bridging complexes. The two ImmunoCAP assays can provide new analytical methods for proactive therapeutic monitoring of adalimumab and infliximab. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biotherapeutics are subject to inherent heterogeneity due to the complex biomanufacturing processes. Numerous analytical techniques have been employed to identify, characterize, and monitor critical quality attributes (CQAs) to ensure product safety, and efficacy. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based multi-attribute method (MAM) has become increasingly popular in biopharmaceutical industry due to its potential to replace multiple traditional analytical methods. However, the correlation between MAM and conventional methods remains to be fully understood. Additionally, the complex analytical workflow and limited throughput of MAM restricts its implementation as a quality control (QC) release assay. Herein, we present a simple, robust, and rapid MAM workflow for monitoring CQAs. Our rapid approach allowed us to create a database from ~700 samples, including site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) quantitation results using MAM and data from traditional charge variant and oxidation characterization methods. To gain insights from this database, we employ multivariate data analysis (MVDA) to thoroughly exploit the data. By applying partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, we demonstrate the ability to quantitatively predict charge variants in ion exchange chromatography (IEX) assay and oxidation abundances in hydrophobic-interaction chromatography (HIC) assay using MAM data, highlighting the interconnectivity between MAM and traditional product quality assays. These findings help evaluate the suitability of MAM as a replacement for conventional methods for release, and more importantly, contribute to enhanced process and product understanding.

    "abstract": "Abstract Per FDA guidance, method comparability should be established if an anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay is run by two or more independent laboratories during a study. Genentech, Inc. is evaluating an immunogenicity risk-based comparability approach consisting of both technical and clinical aspects. Technical comparability of the relative sensitivity (RS) is assessed using the Two One-Sided T-tests (TOST) statistical analysis which evaluates if the difference (in absolute value) of the RS means of the two laboratories is less than a pre-specified level of comparability, the practically significant difference (PSD). Clinical comparability is based on the molecule’s immunogenicity risk. A basic and in-depth assessment for low and high-risk molecules are used, respectively. An alternative strategy for molecules with limited incurred sample availability is to be used. In the basic assessment, samples are either unfortified or fortified with surrogate ADA positive control at method appropriate concentrations in a representative biological matrix. Acceptable comparability requires in both methods i) at least 80% of the unfortified samples screen and confirm negative, ii) at least 90% of the low concentration samples screen and confirm positive; and iii) 100% of the high concentration samples screen and confirm positive. The in-depth assessment uses at least 100 incurred samples from 30 or more ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients. The results are evaluated using a 2 by 2-confusion matrix and Cohen’s Kappa score where 1 indicates perfect agreement. Acceptable comparability requires a Cohen’s Kappa score of greater than 0.40. This strategy allows for a robust technical and clinical method comparability assessment. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate if model-based post-processing of common diagnostics can be used as a diagnostic tool to quantitatively identify model misspecifications and rectifying actions. The main investigated diagnostic is conditional weighted residuals (CWRES). We have selected to showcase this principle with residual unexplained variability (RUV) models, where the new diagnostic tool is used to scan extended RUV models and assess in a fast and robust way whether, and what, extensions are expected to provide a superior description of data. The extended RUV models evaluated were autocorrelated errors, dynamic transform both sides, inter-individual variability on RUV, power error model, t-distributed errors, and time-varying error magnitude. The agreement in improvement in goodness-of-fit between implementing these extended RUV models on the original model and implementing these extended RUV models on CWRES was evaluated in real and simulated data examples. Real data exercise was applied to three other diagnostics: conditional weighted residuals with interaction (CWRESI), individual weighted residuals (IWRES), and normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDE). CWRES modeling typically predicted (i) the nature of model misspecifications, (ii) the magnitude of the expected improvement in fit in terms of difference in objective function value (ΔOFV), and (iii) the parameter estimates associated with the model extension. Alternative metrics (CWRESI, IWRES, and NPDE) also provided valuable information, but with a lower predictive performance of ΔOFV compared to CWRES. This method is a fast and easily automated diagnostic tool for RUV model development/evaluation process; it is already implemented in the software package PsN.",

    "abstract": "Repeated time-to-event (RTTE) models are the preferred method to characterize the repeated occurrence of clinical events. Commonly used diagnostics for parametric RTTE models require representative simulations, which may be difficult to generate in situations with dose titration or informative dropout. Here, we present a novel simulation-free diagnostic tool for parametric RTTE models; the kernel-based visual hazard comparison (kbVHC). The kbVHC aims to evaluate whether the mean predicted hazard rate of a parametric RTTE model is an adequate approximation of the true hazard rate. Because the true hazard rate cannot be directly observed, the predicted hazard is compared to a non-parametric kernel estimator of the hazard rate. With the degree of smoothing of the kernel estimator being determined by its bandwidth, the local kernel bandwidth is set to the lowest value that results in a bootstrap coefficient of variation (CV) of the hazard rate that is equal to or lower than a user-defined target value (CVtarget). The kbVHC was evaluated in simulated scenarios with different number of subjects, hazard rates, CVtarget values, and hazard models (Weibull, Gompertz, and circadian-varying hazard). The kbVHC was able to distinguish between Weibull and Gompertz hazard models, even when the hazard rate was relatively low (< 2 events per subject). Additionally, it was more sensitive than the Kaplan-Meier VPC to detect circadian variation of the hazard rate. An additional useful feature of the kernel estimator is that it can be generated prior to model development to explore the shape of the hazard rate function.",

Two types of neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays (competitive ligand-binding assay [CLBA] and cell-based assay [CBA]) are commonly used to characterize neutralizing activities. To support the clinical development of benralizumab, a humanized, anti–interleukin-5 receptor α, anti-eosinophil monoclonal antibody, we developed and validated a CLBA and a CBA. The CLBA and CBA were compared for sensitivity, drug tolerance, and precision to detect NAbs in serum samples from clinical trials. The CLBA was more sensitive (27.1 and 37.5 ng/mL) than the CBA (1.02 and 1.10 μg/mL) in detecting NAbs to benralizumab for the polyclonal and monoclonal ADA controls, respectively. With the same polyclonal ADA control, the CLBA detected 250 ng/mL of ADA in the presence of 100 ng/mL of benralizumab, whereas the CBA detected 1.25 μg/mL of ADA in the presence of 780 ng/mL of benralizumab. In 195 ADA-positive samples from 5 studies, 63.59% (124/195) and 16.9% (33/195) were positive for NAb as measured by the CLBA and the CBA, respectively. ADA titers were strongly correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.91; n = 195) with CLBA titers. Moreover, the CLBA titer correlated with CBA percentage inhibition in the CBA-positive samples (Spearman's coefficient r = 0.50; n = 33). Our data demonstrated advantages of the CLBA in various aspects and supported the choice of the CLBA as a NAb assay for the phase III trials.",

    "abstract": "In vitro screening for pharmacological activity of existing drugs showed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Oral administration of these compounds to obtain desired pulmonary exposures resulted in dose-limiting systemic toxicity in humans. However, pulmonary drug delivery enables direct and rapid administration to obtain higher local tissue concentrations in target tissue. In this work, inhalable formulations for thermal aerosolization of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were developed, and their physicochemical properties were characterized. Thermal aerosolization of 40 mg/mL chloroquine and 100 mg/mL hydroxychloroquine formulations delivered respirable aerosol particle sizes with 0.15 and 0.33 mg per 55 mL puff, respectively. In vitro toxicity was evaluated by exposing primary human bronchial epithelial cells to aerosol generated from Vitrocell. An in vitro exposure to 7.24 μg of chloroquine or 7.99 μg hydroxychloroquine showed no significant changes in cilia beating, transepithelial electrical resistance, and cell viability. The pharmacokinetics of inhaled aerosols was predicted by developing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model that included a detailed species-specific respiratory tract physiology and lysosomal trapping. Based on the model predictions, inhaling emitted doses comprising 1.5 mg of chloroquine or 3.3 mg hydroxychloroquine three times a day may yield therapeutically effective concentrations in the lung. Inhalation of higher doses further increased effective concentrations in the lung while maintaining lower systemic concentrations. Given the theoretically favorable risk/benefit ratio, the clinical significance for pulmonary delivery of aerosolized chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 needs to be established in rigorous safety and efficacy studies.

    "abstract": "Abstract In vitro dissolution generally involves sink conditions, so dissolution equations generally do not need to accommodate non-sink conditions. Greater use of biorelevant media, which are typically less able to provide sink conditions than pharmaceutical surfactants, necessitates equations that accommodate non-sink conditions. One objective was to derive an integrated, one-parameter dissolution equation for percent dissolved versus time that accommodates non-sink effects via drug solubility and dissolution volume parameters, including incomplete solubility. A second objective was to characterize the novel equation by fitting it to biorelevant dissolution profiles of tablets of two poorly water-soluble drugs, as well as by conducting simulations of the effect of dose on dissolution profile. The Polli dissolution equation was derived, $$\\% \\;dissolved=100\\%\\left[1-\\frac{\\left({{M}_{0}-c}_{s}V\\right)}{{M}_{0}-{{c}_{s}Ve}^{{-k}_{d}\\left(\\frac{{{M}_{0}-c}_{s}V}{V}\\right)t}}\\right]$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>%</mml:mo> <mml:mspace /> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi> <mml:mi>s</mml:mi> <mml:mi>s</mml:mi> <mml:mi>o</mml:mi> <mml:mi>l</mml:mi> <mml:mi>v</mml:mi> <mml:mi>e</mml:mi> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>100</mml:mn> <mml:mo>%</mml:mo> <mml:mfenced> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mfrac> <mml:mfenced> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>M</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi>c</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mi>s</mml:mi> </mml:msub> <mml:mi>V</mml:mi> </mml:mfenced> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>M</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>c</mml:mi> <mml:mi>s</mml:mi> </mml:msub> <mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mi>e</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi>k</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi> </mml:msub> <mml:mfenced> <mml:mfrac> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>M</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi>c</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mi>s</mml:mi> </mml:msub> <mml:mi>V</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mi>V</mml:mi> </mml:mfrac> </mml:mfenced> <mml:mi>t</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> </mml:mrow> </mml:mfrac> </mml:mfenced> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> , where M 0 is the drug dose (mg), c s is drug solubility (mg/ml), V is dissolution volume (ml), and k d is dissolution rate coefficient (ml/mg per min). Maximum allowable percent dissolved was determined by drug solubility and not a fitted extent of dissolution parameter. The equation fit tablet profiles in the presence and absence of sink conditions, using a single fitted parameter, k d , and where solubility ranged over a 1000-fold range. k d was generally smaller when c s was larger. FeSSGF provided relatively small k d values, reflecting FeSSGF colloids are large and slowly diffusing. Simulations showed impact of non-sink conditions, as well as plausible k d values for various c s scenarios, in agreement with observed k d values. The equation has advantages over first-order and z -factor dissolution rate equations. An Excel file for regression is provided. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "In vivo analyses of pharmacological data are traditionally based on a closed system approach not incorporating turnover of target and ligand-target kinetics, but mainly focussing on ligand-target binding properties. This study incorporates information about target and ligand-target kinetics parallel to binding. In a previous paper, steady-state relationships between target- and ligand-target complex versus ligand exposure were derived and a new expression of in vivo potency was derived for a circulating target. This communication is extending the equilibrium relationships and in vivo potency expression for (i) two separate targets competing for one ligand, (ii) two different ligands competing for a single target and (iii) a single ligand-target interaction located in tissue. The derived expressions of the in vivo potencies will be useful both in drug-related discovery projects and mechanistic studies. The equilibrium states of two targets and one ligand may have implications in safety assessment, whilst the equilibrium states of two competing ligands for one target may cast light on when pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions are important. The proposed equilibrium expressions for a peripherally located target may also be useful for small molecule interactions with extravascularly located targets. Including target turnover, ligand-target complex kinetics and binding properties in expressions of potency and efficacy will improve our understanding of within and between-individual (and across species) variability. The new expressions of potencies highlight the fact that the level of drug-induced target suppression is very much governed by target turnover properties rather than by the target expression level as such.",

    "abstract": "Recently a framework was presented to assess whether pediatric covariate models for clearance can be extrapolated between drugs sharing elimination pathways, based on extraction ratio, protein binding, and other drug properties. Here we evaluate when a pediatric covariate function for midazolam clearance can be used to scale clearance of other CYP3A substrates. A population PK model including a covariate function for clearance was developed for midazolam in children aged 1–17 years. Commonly used CYP3A substrates were selected and using the framework, it was assessed whether the midazolam covariate function accurately scales their clearance. For eight substrates, reported pediatric clearance values were compared numerically and graphically with clearance values scaled using the midazolam covariate function. For sildenafil, clearance values obtained with population PK modeling based on pediatric concentration-time data were compared with those scaled with the midazolam covariate function. According to the framework, a midazolam covariate function will lead to systemically accurate clearance scaling (absolute prediction error (PE) < 30%) for CYP3A substrates binding to albumin with an extraction ratio between 0.35 and 0.65 when binding < 10% in adults, between 0.05 and 0.55 when binding > 90%, and with an extraction ratio ranging between these values when binding between 10 and 90%. Scaled clearance values for eight commonly used CYP3A substrates were reasonably accurate (PE < 50%). Scaling of sildenafil clearance was accurate (PE < 30%). We defined for which CYP3A substrates a pediatric covariate function for midazolam clearance can accurately scale plasma clearance in children. This scaling approach may be useful for CYP3A substrates with scarce or no available pediatric PK information.",

    "abstract": "Demonstrating bioequivalence (BE) of nasal suspension sprays is a challenging task. Analytical tools are required to determine the particle size of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the structure of a relatively complex formulation. This study investigated the utility of the morphologically-directed Raman spectroscopy (MDRS) method to investigate the particle size distribution (PSD) of nasal suspensions. Dissolution was also investigated as an orthogonal technique. Nasal suspension formulations containing different PSD of mometasone furoate monohydrate (MFM) were manufactured. The PSD of the MFM batches was characterized before formulation manufacture using laser diffraction and automated imaging. Upon formulation manufacture, the droplet size, single actuation content, spray pattern, plume geometry, the API dissolution rate, and the API PSD by MDRS were determined. A systematic approach was utilized to develop a robust method for the analysis of the PSD of MFM in Nasonex® and four test formulations containing the MFM API with different particle size specifications. Although the PSD between distinct techniques cannot be directly compared due to inherent differences between these methodologies, the same trend is observed for three out of the four batches. Dissolution analysis confirmed the trend observed by MDRS in terms of PSD. For suspension-based nasal products, MDRS allows the measurement of API PSD which is critical for BE assessment. This approach has been approved for use in lieu of a comparative clinical endpoint BE study [1]. The correlation observed between PSD and dissolution rate extends the use of dissolution as a critical analytical tool demonstrating BE between test and reference products.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous modelling of dense and sparse pharmacokinetic data is possible with a population approach. To determine the number of individuals required to detect the effect of a covariate, simulation-based power calculation methodologies can be employed. The Monte Carlo Mapped Power method (a simulation-based power calculation methodology using the likelihood ratio test) was extended in the current study to perform sample size calculations for mixed pharmacokinetic studies (i.e. both sparse and dense data collection). A workflow guiding an easy and straightforward pharmacokinetic study design, considering also the cost-effectiveness of alternative study designs, was used in this analysis. Initially, data were simulated for a hypothetical drug and then for the anti-malarial drug, dihydroartemisinin. Two datasets (sampling design A: dense; sampling design B: sparse) were simulated using a pharmacokinetic model that included a binary covariate effect and subsequently re-estimated using (1) the same model and (2) a model not including the covariate effect in NONMEM 7.2. Power calculations were performed for varying numbers of patients with sampling designs A and B. Study designs with statistical power >80% were selected and further evaluated for cost-effectiveness. The simulation studies of the hypothetical drug and the anti-malarial drug dihydroartemisinin demonstrated that the simulation-based power calculation methodology, based on the Monte Carlo Mapped Power method, can be utilised to evaluate and determine the sample size of mixed (part sparsely and part densely sampled) study designs. The developed method can contribute to the design of robust and efficient pharmacokinetic studies.",

There is a possible relationship between oseltamivir treatment and neuropsychiatric adverse events; although this has not been established, close monitoring is recommended on the prescription label. The objective of this study was to predict interindividual variability of human exposure to oseltamivir and its active metabolite Ro 64-0802. By leveraging mathematical models and computations, physiological parameters in virtual subjects were generated with population means and coefficient of variations collected from the literature or produced experimentally. Postulated functional changes caused by genetic mutations in four key molecules, carboxylesterase 1A1, P-glycoprotein, organic anion transporter 3, and multidrug resistance-associated protein 4, were also taken into account. One hundred thousand virtual subjects were generated per simulation, which was iterated 20 times with different random number generator seeds. Even in the most exaggerated case, the systemic areas under the concentration-time curve (AUCs) of oseltamivir and Ro 64-0802 were increased by at most threefold compared with the population mean. By contrast, the brain AUCs of oseltamivir and Ro 64-0802 were increased up to about sevenfold and 40-fold, respectively, compared with the population means. This unexpectedly high exposure to oseltamivir or Ro 64-0802, which occurs extremely rarely, might trigger adverse central nervous system effects in the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to build a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model coupled with age-appropriate in vitro dissolution data to describe drug performance in adults and pediatric patients. Montelukast sodium was chosen as a model drug. Two case studies were investigated: case study 1 focused on the description of formulation performance from adults to children; case study 2 focused on the description of the impact of medicine co-administration with vehicles on drug exposure in infants. The PBPK model for adults and pediatric patients was developed in Simcyp ® v18.2 informed by age-appropriate in vitro dissolution results obtained in a previous study. Oral administration of montelukast was simulated with the ADAM™ model. For case study 1, the developed PBPK model accurately described montelukast exposure in adults and children populations after the administration of montelukast chewable tablets. Two-stage dissolution testing in simulated fasted gastric to intestinal conditions resulted in the best description of in vivo drug performance in adults and children. For case study 2, a good description of in vivo drug performance in infants after medicine co-administration with vehicles was achieved by incorporating in vitro drug dissolution (under simulated fasted gastric to fed intestinal conditions) into a fed state PBPK model with consideration of the in vivo dosing conditions (mixing of formulation with applesauce or formula). The case studies presented demonstrate how a PBPK absorption modelling strategy can facilitate the description of drug performance in the pediatric population to support decision-making and biopharmaceutics understanding during pediatric drug development.

Its value is usually determined based on the likelihood that exploratory or developmental research can yield effective therapies. While the pharmaceutical industry has evolved into a highly specialized sector engaged in translational research, the academic medical research community has similarly embraced this paradigm largely through the motivation of the National Institute of Health (NIH) via its Roadmap initiative. The Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) has created opportunities for institutions which can provide the multidisciplinary environment required to engage such research. A key component of the CTSA and an element of both the NIH Roadmap and the FDA Critical Path is the bridging of bench and bedside science via quantitative pharmacologic relationships. The infrastructure of the University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia CTSA is highlighted relative to both research and educational objectives reliant upon quantitative pharmacology. A case study, NIH-sponsored research program exploring NK1r antagonism for the treatment NeuroAIDS is used to illustrate the application of quantitative pharmacology in a translational research paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the last decade, several regulatory guidelines on bioanalytical method validation (BMV) have been issued by regulatory agencies around the world. This has left the bioanalytical community struggling with regional differences in regulatory expectations when preparing for global pharmaceutical submissions. The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) has the mission to achieve greater harmonization worldwide to ensure that safe, effective, and high-quality medicines are developed and registered in the most resource-efficient manner. Following calls for harmonization, ICH-selected bioanalytical method validation and sample analysis among its topics for guidance development and earlier this year released a draft guideline (M10) on BMV for public consultation. In response, the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) held a 3-day workshop to provide a forum for regulatory, industry, and academic scientists to discuss the guideline and hear various points of view on key aspects. While there was agreement that the draft guideline is generally well written and comprehensive, specific topics generated considerable discussion and, in some cases, revision recommendations for consideration by the expert working group (EWG) responsible for the guideline content. This report provides a summary of the workshop proceedings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The addition of rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin (ATG) to the conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has significantly reduced the risk of graft- versus -host disease (GvHD) and graft failure. However, ATG has a small therapeutic window. Overexposure of ATG post-HCT hampers T cell immune reconstitution and has been associated with increased relapse rates and viral reactivations, whereas underexposure has been associated with an increased incidence of GvHD, both of which lead to increased mortality. Therapeutic drug monitoring of T cell binding ATG plasma levels provides a means to optimize dosing for patients at high risk for graft failure to ensure timely T cell immune reconstitution and subsequently increase survival chances. This manuscript describes the first liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify the pharmacologically active fraction of polyclonal ATG in plasma. This was achieved through immunoaffinity purification of active ATG from plasma with Jurkat T cells. After the binding and washing, samples were eluted, denatured, and trypsin-digested. Signature peptides originating from the IgG constant chain were measured with LC-MS/MS. Critical method parameters were optimized, and the method was successfully validated following European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines. The method covered the therapeutic range of ATG and was validated at a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 1 AU/mL with an overall CV and bias of 11.8% and − 2.5%, respectively. In conclusion, we developed a LC-MS/MS-based method to quantify active polyclonal rabbit ATG in human plasma. We suggest that this novel assay can be used to monitor and optimize dosing of ATG in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Item response theory (IRT) was used to characterize the time course of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-LUTS) measured by item-level International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS). The Fisher information content of IPSS items was determined and the power to detect a drug effect using the IRT approach was examined. Data from 403 patients with moderate-to-severe BPH-LUTS in a placebo-controlled phase II trial studying the effect of degarelix over 6 months were used for modeling. Three pharmacometric models were developed: a model for total IPSS, a unidimensional IRT model, and a bidimensional IRT model, the latter separating voiding and storage items. The population-level time course of BPH-LUTS in all models was described by initial improvement followed by worsening. In the unidimensional IRT model, the combined information content of IPSS voiding items represented 72% of the total information content, indicating that the voiding subscore may be more sensitive to changes in BPH-LUTS compared with the storage subscore. The pharmacometric models showed considerably higher power to detect a drug effect compared with a cross-sectional and while-on-treatment analysis of covariance, respectively. Compared with the sample size required to detect a drug effect at 80% power with the total IPSS model, a reduction of 5.9% and 11.7% was obtained with the unidimensional and bidimensional IPSS IRT model, respectively. Pharmacometric IRT analysis of the IPSS within BPH-LUTS may increase the precision and efficiency of treatment effect assessment, albeit to a more limited extent compared with applications in other therapeutic areas.",

    "abstract": "The current COVID-19 global pandemic has generated widespread interest across clinical, research, academic, and governmental laboratories, as well as at Biopharma companies for the application of in vitro diagnostic assays to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus or to characterize the emergence of an adaptive immune response against this virus.Following declaration of the COVID-19 public health emergency by Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services, on Jan.31, 2020, the FDA issued an \"immediatein-effect\" guidance on 29 February to make in vitro diagnostic tests available by Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to address the urgent need for IVD tests to support diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 infections (1).Subsequently in late April, the FDA released the umbrella EUA guidance to offer an additional route for expediting approval and market availability of serological tests for .Unlike molecular diagnostic and viral antigen tests that detect an active viral infection, serological assays detect serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in individuals who have exhibited an adaptive immune response as part of either an active or prior infection (3).As such, serology tests offer the potential to verify that individuals, who had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with clinical symptoms or who have remained asymptomatic, developed a humoral antibody response.Despite their perceived value, commercial serology assays, point-of-care devices, and homebrew laboratory developed tests (LDTs) vary appreciably with respect to their design attributes and performance capabilities.Consequently, serological assays are known to demonstrate inconsistency in antibody detection due to differences in their clinical sensitivity and specificity (4).For example, recent evidence suggests that some assays may be prone to false-positive results due to the presence of serum antibodies against other coronaviruses that are also crossreactive to structurally homologous epitopes present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus (5-7).While at present the overall value of serological testing remains unclear (8), this technology will undoubtedly find broad application in epidemiological surveillance studies, contact tracing, and in evaluating antigen-specific humoral immunity after active immunization (4,9,10).Currently, EUA-approved serological tests include high complexity ELISA designs, moderate complexity instrumentation-based tests, and lateral flow point-of-care devices.Because the reliability of serological assays remains a topic of concern to both the scientific community and general public, the FDA issued an updated policy on May 4, 2020 that required antibody test manufacturers to submit an EUA request within 10 business days (1).Shortly thereafter on May 21, approximately 50 tests were removed from the EUA approved list either because of a failure to submit data on time or due to technical concerns (3).By mid-August, the number of serology assays removed from the EUA approved list increased to 97, while the number of approved commercial tests is currently 37 (11,12).Continued vigilance for evaluation of assays on the EUA-approved list should help ensure that the reliability and value of serological testing will increase over time.During our development of a direct-binding immunoassay that employs SARS-CoV-2 trimer spike protein as the capture antigen (13), we noted a striking similarity between a serology assay that is used in a CLIA-certified lab for detection of SARS-CoV-2-reactive serum antibodies and those that are used widely in the Biopharma industry and CROs for detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in support of immunogenicity assessments of biotherapeutic drugs.Accordingly, we prepared Table I to highlight the similarities and differences between these two different categories of antibody assays.Upon inspection, it is readily apparent that some practices differ between these two testing paradigms",

No correlation of subvisible particulate counts exists between FIM and LO nor do the counts correlate with activity at both release and on stability. The subvisible particulate content of lyophilised Erwinia l-asparaginase appears to be consistent and stable over time and in line with other parenteral biopharmaceutical products. The majority (ca. 75%) of subvisible particulates in l-asparaginase DP were at the low end of the measurement range by FIM (2–4 μm). In this size range, FIM was unable to definitively classify the particulates as either protein or non-protein. More sensitive measurement techniques would be needed to classify the particulates in lyophilised l-asparaginase into type (protein and non-protein), so the LO technique has been chosen for on-going DP analyses. E. chrysanthemi l-asparaginase has a lower rate of hypersensitivity compared with native Escherichia coli preparations, but a subset of patients develop hypersensitivity to the Erwinia enzyme. A DP lot that had subvisible particulate counts on the upper end of the measurement range by both LO and FIM had the same incidence of allergic hypersensitivity in clinical experience as lots at all levels of observed subvisible particulate content, suggesting that the presence of l-asparaginase subvisible particulates is not important with respect to allergic response.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Composite scale data is widely used in many therapeutic areas and consists of several categorical questions/items that are usually summarized into a total score (TS). Such data is discrete and bounded by nature. The gold standard to analyse composite scale data is item response theory (IRT) models. However, IRT models require item-level data while sometimes only TS is available. This work investigates models for TS. When an IRT model exists, it can be used to derive the information as well as expected mean and variability of TS at any point, which can inform TS-analyses. We propose a new method: IRT-informed functions of expected values and standard deviation in TS-analyses. The most common models for TS-analyses are continuous variable (CV) models, while bounded integer (BI) models offer an alternative that respects scale boundaries and the nature of TS data. We investigate the method in CV and BI models on both simulated and real data. Both CV and BI models were improved in fit by IRT-informed disease progression, which allows modellers to precisely and accurately find the corresponding latent variable parameters, and IRT-informed SD, which allows deviations from homoscedasticity. The methodology provides a formal way to link IRT models and TS models, and to compare the relative information of different model types. Also, joint analyses of item-level data and TS data are made possible. Thus, IRT-informed functions can facilitate total score analysis and allow a quantitative analysis of relative merits of different analysis methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To date, information on the ontogeny of renal transporters is limited. Here, we propose to estimate the in vivo functional ontogeny of transporters using a combined population pharmacokinetic (popPK) and physiology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach called popPBPK. Clavulanic acid and amoxicillin were used as probes for glomerular filtration, combined glomerular filtration, and active secretion through OAT1,3, respectively. The predictive value of the estimated OAT1,3 ontogeny function was assessed by PBPK predictions of renal clearance (CL R ) of other OAT1,3 substrates: cefazolin and piperacillin. Individual CL R post-hoc values, obtained from a published popPK model on the concomitant use of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin in critically ill children between 1 month and 15 years, were used as dependent variables in the popPBPK analysis. CL R was re-parameterized according to PBPK principles, resulting in the estimation of OAT1,3-mediated intrinsic clearance (CL int,OAT1,3,invivo ) and its ontogeny. CL int,OAT1,3,invivo ontogeny was described by a sigmoidal function, reaching half of adult level around 7 months of age, comparable to findings based on renal transporter-specific protein expression data. PBPK-based CL R predictions including this ontogeny function were reasonably accurate for piperacillin in a similar age range (2.5 months–15 years) as well as for cefazolin in neonates as compared to published data (%RMSPE of 21.2 and 22.8%, respectively and %PE within ±50%). Using this novel approach, we estimated an in vivo functional ontogeny profile for CL int,OAT1,3,invivo that yields accurate CL R predictions for different OAT1,3 substrates across different ages. This approach deserves further study on functional ontogeny of other transporters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Avadomide is a cereblon E3 ligase modulator and a potent antitumor and immunomodulatory agent. Avadomide trials are challenged by neutropenia as a major adverse event and a dose-limiting toxicity. Intermittent dosing schedules supported by preclinical data provide a strategy to reduce frequency and severity of neutropenia; however, the identification of optimal dosing schedules remains a clinical challenge. Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling offers opportunities for virtual screening of efficacy and toxicity levels produced by alternative dose and schedule regimens, thereby supporting decision-making in translational drug development. We formulated a QSP model to capture the mechanism of avadomide-induced neutropenia, which involves cereblon-mediated degradation of transcription factor Ikaros, resulting in a maturation block of the neutrophil lineage. The neutropenia model was integrated with avadomide-specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models to capture dose-dependent effects. Additionally, we generated a disease-specific virtual patient population to represent the variability in patient characteristics and response to treatment observed for a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma trial cohort. Model utility was demonstrated by simulating the avadomide effect in the virtual population for various dosing schedules and determining the incidence of high-grade neutropenia, its duration, and the probability of recovery to low-grade neutropenia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract CD3-bispecific antibodies are a new class of immunotherapeutic drugs against cancer. The pharmacological activity of CD3-bispecifics is typically assessed through in vitro assays of cancer cell lines co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Assay results depend on experimental conditions such as incubation time and the effector-to-target cell ratio, which can hinder robust quantification of pharmacological activity. In order to overcome these limitations, we developed a new, holistic approach for quantification of the in vitro dose–response relationship. Our experimental design integrates a time-independent analysis of the dose–response across different time points as an alternative to the static, “snap-shot” analysis based on a single time point commonly used in dose–response assays. We show that the potency values derived from static in vitro experiments depend on the incubation time, which leads to inconsistent results across multiple assays and compounds. We compared the potency values from the time-independent analysis with a model-based approach. We find comparably accurate potency estimates from the model-based and time-independent analyses and that the time-independent analysis provides a robust quantification of pharmacological activity. This approach may allow for an improved head-to-head comparison of different compounds and test systems and may prove useful for supporting first-in-human dose selection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The determination of a tailored anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing strategy is based on the immunogenicity risk assessment to allow a correlation of ADAs with changes to pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety. The clinical impact of ADA formation refines the immunogenicity risk assessment and defines appropriate risk mitigation strategies. Health agencies request for high-risk biotherapeutics to extend ADA monitoring for patients that developed an ADA response to the drug until ADAs return to baseline levels. However, there is no common understanding in which cases an extension of ADA follow-up sampling beyond the end of study (EOS) defined in the clinical study protocol is required. Here, the Immunogenicity Strategy Working Group of the European Immunogenicity Platform (EIP) provides recommendations on requirements for an extension of ADA follow-up sampling in clinical studies where there is a high risk of serious consequences from ADAs. The importance of ADA evaluation during a treatment-free period is recognized but the decision whether to extend ADA monitoring at a predefined EOS should be based on evaluation of ADA data in the context of corresponding clinical signals. If the clinical data set shows that safety consequences are minor, mitigated, or resolved, further ADA monitoring may not be required despite potentially detectable ADAs above baseline. Extended ADA monitoring should be centered on individual patient benefit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative muscular disease affecting roughly one in 5000 males at birth. The disease is often caused by inherited X-linked recessive pathogenic variants in the dystrophin gene, but may also arise from de novo mutations. Disease-causing variants include nonsense, out of frame deletions or duplications that result in loss of dystrophin protein expression. There is currently no cure for DMD and the few treatment options available aim at slowing muscle degradation. New advances in gene therapy and understanding of dystrophin (DYS) expression in other muscular dystrophies have opened new opportunities for treatment. Therefore, reliable methods are needed to monitor dystrophin expression and assess the efficacy of new therapies for muscular dystrophies such as DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Here, we describe the validation of a novel Western blot (WB) method for the quantitation of mini-dystrophin protein in human skeletal muscle tissues that is easy to adopt in most laboratory settings. This WB method was assessed through precision, accuracy, selectivity, dilution linearity, stability, and repeatability. Based on mini-DYS standard performance, the assay has a dynamic range of 0.5–15 ng protein (per 5 µg total protein per lane), precision of 3.3 to 25.5%, and accuracy of − 7.5 to 3.3%. Our stability assessment showed that the protein is stable after 4 F/T cycles, up to 2 h at RT and after 7 months at − 70°C. Furthermore, our WB method was compared to the results from our recently published LC–MS method. Graphical Abstract Workflow for our quantitative WB method to determine mini-dystrophin levels in muscle tissues (created in Biorender.com). Step 1 involves protein extraction from skeletal muscle tissue lysates from control, DMD, or BMD biospecimen. Step 2 measures total protein concentrations. Step 3 involves running gel electrophoresis with wild-type dystrophin (wt-DYS) from muscle tissue extracts alongside mini-dystrophin STD curve and mini-DYS and protein normalization with housekeeping GAPDH.",

    "abstract": "Qualifying critical reagents in ligand binding assays by parallel testing of current and candidate reagent lots is recommended by regulatory agencies and industry groups, but specific guidance on the format of reagent qualification experiments is limited. Equivalence testing is a statistically sound approach that is consistent with the objective of critical reagent qualification. We present power analysis for equivalence regions ranging from 1.25- to 1.5-fold multiples of the GM ratio (centered on 1) of current and candidate lots, over a range of assay variability from 5 to 30% coefficient of variation (CV). A 1.25-fold equivalence region can be tested using 6 to 12 plates per lot for assays with up to 15% CV but is not practical for more variable assays. For these assays, wider equivalence regions are justified so long as care is taken to avoid assay drift and the assay remains suitable for the intended use. The equivalence test method is illustrated using historical data from passing and failing reagent qualification experiments. Simulation analysis was performed to support the design of qualification experiments using 6, 12, or 18 plates per lot over a broad range of assay variability. A challenge in implementing the equivalence test approach is selecting an appropriate equivalence region. Equivalence regions providing 90% power using 12 plates/lot were consistent with 1.5σ bounds, which are recommended for equivalence testing of critical quality attributes of biosimilars.",

To support clinical development of PF-07257876, neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays were developed as part of a tiered immunogenicity testing approach. Because PF-07257876 targets both CD47 and PD-L1, determination of domain specificity of a NAb response may provide additional insight relating to PK, efficacy, and safety. Due to limitations of functional cell systems, two cell-based binding assays were developed using electrochemiluminescence to detect domain-specific NAb. While both NAb assays utilized a cell-based binding approach and shared certain requirements, such as sensitivity and tolerance to potentially interfering substances, the development of each assay faced unique challenges. Among the hurdles encountered, achieving drug tolerance while preserving domain specificity for CD47 proved particularly challenging. Consequently, a sample pretreatment procedure to isolate NAb from potentially interfering substances was necessary. The sample pretreatment procedure developed was based on a bead-extraction and acid dissociation (BEAD) approach. However, the use of the standard BEAD approach with whole drug to capture NAb resulted in loss of NAb detection under certain circumstances. Specifically, mock samples containing a mixture of NAb positive controls against both binding domains of the bispecific antibody produced false-negative results in the cell-based binding assay. An adaptation made to the standard BEAD approach restored domain-specific NAb detection, while also contributing to an assay sensitivity of 1 µg/mL in the presence of a clinically relevant drug tolerance level of up to 400 µg/mL.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) techniques have gained popularity these last years as innovative tool for collection of blood pharmacokinetic (PK) samples in clinical trials as they offer many advantages over dried blood spot and conventional venous blood sampling. The use of Mitra ® , a blood collection device based on volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) technology, was implemented during clinical development of padsevonil (PSL), an anti-seizure medication (ASM) candidate. The present study describes the approach used to bridge plasma (obtained from conventional venous blood sampling) and blood exposures (obtained with Mitra ® ) to support the use of Mitra as sole blood PK sampling method in clinical trials. Paired blood (using Mitra ® ) and plasma samples (using conventional venous blood sampling) were collected in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with epilepsy. PSL concentration in plasma and blood were analyzed using different approaches which included evaluation of blood-to-plasma ratios (B/P) over time, linear regression, Bland-Altman analysis as well as development of a linear-mixed effect model based on clinical pharmacology studies. Results showed that the observed in vivo B/P and the measured bias between the 2 collection methods were consistent with the measured in vitro B/P. Graphical analysis demonstrated a clear time effect on the B/P which was confirmed in the linear mixed effect model with sampling time identified as significant covariate. Finally, the built-in model was validated using independent datasets and was shown to adequately predict plasma concentration based on blood concentration with a mean bias of less than 9% (predicted versus observed plasma concentration).

    "abstract": "Abstract Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal interstitial lung disease that affects three million patients worldwide and currently without an effective cure. Zinpentraxin alfa, a recombinant human pentraxin-2 (rhPTX-2) protein, has been evaluated as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of IPF. Clinical pharmacokinetic analysis of zinpentraxin alfa has been challenging historically due to interference from serum amyloid P component (SAP), an endogenous human pentraxin-2 protein. These molecules share an identical primary amino acid sequence and glycan composition; however, zinpentraxin alfa possesses α2,3-linked terminal sialic acid residues while SAP is an α2,6-linked isomer. By taking advantage of this only structural difference, we developed a novel assay strategy where α2,3-sialidase was used to selectively hydrolyze α2,3-linked sialic acid residues, resulting in desialylated zinpentraxin alfa versus unchanged sialylated SAP, following an immunoaffinity capture step. Subsequent tryptic digestion produced a unique surrogate asialo-glycopeptide from zinpentraxin alfa and allowed specific quantification of the biotherapeutic in human plasma. In addition, a common peptide shared by both molecules was selected as a surrogate to determine total hPTX-2 concentrations, i.e., sum of zinpentraxin alfa and SAP. The quantification methods for both zinpentraxin alfa and total hPTX-2 were validated and used in pharmacokinetic assessment in IPF patients. The preliminary results suggest that endogenous SAP levels remained largely constant in IPF patients throughout the treatment with zinpentraxin alfa. Our novel approach provides a general bioanalytical strategy to selectively quantify α2,3-sialylated glycoproteins in the presence of their corresponding α2,6-linked isomers. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) modeling based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have evolved into a promising approach for analysis of PK/PD data. SDE-NLME models go beyond the realm of standard population modeling as they consider stochastic dynamics, thereby introducing a probabilistic perspective on the state variables. This article presents a summary of the main contributions to SDE-NLME models found in the literature. The aims of this work were to develop an exact gradient version of the first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) method for SDE-NLME models and to investigate whether it enabled faster estimation and better gradient precision/accuracy compared to the use of gradients approximated by finite differences. A simulation-estimation study was set up whereby finite difference approximations of the gradients of each level were interchanged with the exact gradients. Following previous work, the uncertainty of the state variables was accounted for using the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The exact gradient FOCE method was implemented in Mathematica 11 and evaluated on SDE versions of three common PK/PD models. When finite difference gradients were replaced by exact gradients at both FOCE levels, relative runtimes improved between 6- and 32-fold, depending on model complexity. Additionally, gradient precision/accuracy was significantly better in the exact gradient case. We conclude that parameter estimation using FOCE with exact gradients can successfully be applied to SDE-NLME models.",

    "abstract": "Parameter estimation of a nonlinear model based on maximizing the likelihood using gradient-based numerical optimization methods can often fail due to premature termination of the optimization algorithm. One reason for such failure is that these numerical optimization methods cannot distinguish between the minimum, maximum, and a saddle point; hence, the parameters found by these optimization algorithms can possibly be in any of these three stationary points on the likelihood surface. We have found that for maximization of the likelihood for nonlinear mixed effects models used in pharmaceutical development, the optimization algorithm Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) often terminates in saddle points, and we propose an algorithm, saddle-reset, to avoid the termination at saddle points, based on the second partial derivative test. In this algorithm, we use the approximated Hessian matrix at the point where BFGS terminates, perturb the point in the direction of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue, and restart the BFGS algorithm. We have implemented this algorithm in industry standard software for nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM, version 7.4 and up) and showed that it can be used to avoid termination of parameter estimation at saddle points, as well as unveil practical parameter non-identifiability. We demonstrate this using four published pharmacometric models and two models specifically designed to be practically non-identifiable.",

We investigated the relationship between the steepness of the concentration–effect relationship and inter-individual variability (IIV) of the parameters of the sigmoid E max model, using the similarity between the sigmoid E max model and the cumulative log-normal distribution. In addition, it is investigated whether IIV in the model parameters can be estimated accurately by population modeling. Multiple data sets, consisting of 40 individuals with 4 binary observations in each individual, were simulated with varying values for the model parameters and their IIV. The data sets were analyzed using Excel Solver and NONMEM. An empirical equation (Eq. (11)) was derived describing the steepness of the population-predicted concentration–effect profile (γ*) as a function of γ and IIV in C50 and γ, and was validated for both binary and continuous data. The tested study design is not suited to estimate the IIV in C50 and γ with reasonable precision. Using a naive pooling procedure, the population estimates γ* are significantly lower than the value of γ used for simulation. The steepness of the population-predicted concentration–effect relationship (γ*) is less than that of the individuals (γ). Using γ*, the population-predicted drug effect represents the drug effect, for binary data the probability of drug effect, at a given concentration for an arbitrary individual.",

Given the lack of direct BE assessment in pediatric populations, the aim of this work is to develop a database of BE and relative bioavailability (relative BA) studies conducted in pediatric populations and to enable the identification of risk factors associated with certain drug substances or products that may lead to failed BE or different pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in relative BA studies in pediatrics. A literature search from 1965 to 2020 was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar to identify BE studies conducted in pediatric populations and relative BA studies conducted in pediatric populations. Overall, 79 studies covering 37 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were included in the database: 4 bioequivalence studies with data that passed BE evaluations; 2 studies showed bioinequivalence results; 34 relative BA studies showing comparable PK parameters, and 39 relative BA studies showing differences in PK parameters between test and reference products. Based on the above studies, common putative risk factors associated with differences in relative bioavailability (DRBA) in pediatric populations include age-related absorption effects, high inter-individual variability, and poor study design. A database containing 79 clinical studies on BE or relative BA in pediatrics has been developed. Putative risk factors associated with DRBA in pediatric populations are summarized.",

[4].Assuming a 10-fold intracellular accumulation of Nuc-TP relative to extracellular remdesivir, these inhibitory values were used to derive the intracellular Nuc-TP IC 50 and IC 90 values of 7.7 and 17.6 μM, which were compared with an estimated intracellular Nuc-TP concentration in the range of 4 to 10 μM in human lungs [1].However, other studies have reported IC 50 and IC 90 values for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of remdesivir that differed from",

    "abstract": "Suspended human hepatocytes (SHH) have long been used in assessing hepatic drug uptake, while plated human hepatocytes in short-term monolayer culture (PHH) have gained use in recent years. This study aimed to cross-evaluate SHH and PHH in measuring the hepatic uptake mediated by organic anion transporting polypeptide 1Bs (OATP1Bs). We compared the time courses of cell-to-medium (C/M) concentration ratios and initial uptake clearance values of the OATP1B substrates (pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, cerivastatin, pravastatin, dehydropravastatin, and SC-62807) between SHH and PHH. For all compounds except cerivastatin, the C/M ratios in SHH displayed an apparent overshoot (an initial increase followed by a decrease) during the 180-min uptake experiment, but not in PHH. Based on the literature evidence suggesting the possible internalization of OATP1Bs in primary hepatocytes, separate experiments measured the drug uptake after varying lengths of pre-incubation in the drug-free medium. The initial uptake clearances of pitavastatin and rosuvastatin declined in SHH beyond an apparent threshold time of 20-min drug-free pre-incubation, but not in PHH. Kinetic modeling quantitatively captured the decline in the active uptake clearance in SHH, and more than half of the active uptake clearances of pitavastatin and rosuvastatin were prone to loss during the 180-min uptake experiment. These results suggested a partial, time-delayed loss of the functional OATP1Bs in SHH upon prolonged incubation. Our results indicate that PHH is more appropriate for experiments where a prolonged incubation is required, such as estimation of unbound hepatocyte-to-medium concentration ratio (Kp,uu) at the steady-state.",

Nonclinical dose formulations are required to be analyzed to confirm the analyte concentration, homogeneity, and stability. Analytical samples that fall outside of the acceptance criteria are considered out of specification (OOS), and an investigation should be conducted. The US FDA has issued a guidance document for GMP studies on conducting OOS investigations. However, no regulatory guidance has been issued regarding nonclinical safety study (GLP) OOS investigations, which often vary in regard to content, assessment, and impact statements. There is opportunity to improve the quality of OOS investigations by defining expectations and providing guidance in several areas including root cause assessment, impact statements, and acceptable paths forward. This paper will provide recommendations of best practices for nonclinical dose formulation OOS investigations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Eflornithine is a recommended treatment against late-stage gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease. Standard dosing of eflornithine consists of repeated intravenous infusions of a racemic mixture of L- and D-eflornithine. Data from three clinical studies, (i) eflornithine intravenous monotherapy, (ii) nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy, and (iii) eflornithine oral monotherapy, were pooled and analyzed using a time-to-event pharmacodynamic modeling approach, supported by in vitro activity data of the individual enantiomers. Our aim was to assess (i) the efficacy of the eflornithine regimens in a time-to-event analysis and (ii) the feasibility of an L-eflornithine-based therapy integrating clinical and preclinical data. A pharmacodynamic time-to-event model was used to estimate the total dose of eflornithine, associated with 50% reduction in baseline hazard, when administered as monotherapy or in the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy. The estimated total doses were 159, 60 and 291 g for intravenous eflornithine monotherapy, nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy and oral eflornithine monotherapy, respectively. Simulations suggested that L-eflornithine achieves a higher predicted median survival, compared to when racemate is administered, as treatment against late-stage gambiense human African trypanosomiasis. Our findings showed that oral L-eflornithine-based monotherapy would not result in adequate efficacy, even at high dose, and warrants further investigations to assess the potential of oral L-eflornithine-based treatment in combination with other treatments such as nifurtimox. An all-oral eflornithine-based regimen would provide easier access to treatment and reduce burden on patients and healthcare systems in gambiense human African trypanosomiasis endemic areas.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms of ocular antidrug immune response, the incidence of ocular antidrug antibodies (ADAs), and the relationship between ocular and systemic ADA levels. Bioanalytical limitations and poor availability of ocular matrices make studies of ocular immunogenicity particularly challenging. We have recently reported a novel bioanalytical ADA assay and shown its applicability for the ADA detection in ocular matrices. In the present study, we used this assay to analyze a large set of preclinical samples from minipig and cynomolgus monkeys treated with different ocular biotherapeutics. We found a significant association between the incidence of ADAs in plasma and ocular fluids after a single intravitreal administration of the drugs. Importantly, none of the animals with ADA-negative results in plasma had detectable ADAs in ocular fluids and systemic ADA response always preceded the appearance of ocular ADAs. Overall, our results suggest the systemic origin of ocular ADAs and support the use of plasma as a surrogate matrix for the detection of ocular ADA response. Graphical Abstract",

One such method estimates both the ICF and latent variable time-course simultaneously, and another method establishes the ICF first then models the latent variable directly. To date, a direct comparison of the “simultaneous” and “sequential” methodologies described in this work has not yet been systematically investigated. Item parameters from a graded response IRT model developed from Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) study data were used as simulation parameters. Each method was evaluated under the following conditions: (i) with and without drug effect and (ii) slow progression rate with smaller sample size and rapid progression rate with larger sample size. Overall, the methods performed similarly, with low bias and good precision for key parameters and hypothesis testing for drug effect. The ICF parameters were well determined when the model was correctly specified, with an increase in precision in the scenario with rapid progression. In terms of drug effect, both methods had large estimation bias for the slow progression rate; however, this bias can be considered small relative to overall progression rate. Both methods demonstrated type 1 error control and similar discrimination between model with and without drug effect. The simultaneous method was slightly more precise than the sequential method while the sequential method was more robust towards longitudinal model misspecification and offers practical advantages in model building.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The interpretation of immunogenicity results for a mAb product and prediction of its clinical consequences remain difficult, despite enormous advances in methodologies and efforts toward the best practice for consistent data generation and reporting. To this end, the contribution from the clinical pharmacology discipline has been largely limited to comparing descriptively the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles by antidrug antibodies (ADA) status or testing the significance of ADA as a covariate in a population PK setting, similar to the practice for small-molecule drugs in investigating the effect of an intrinsic/extrinsic factor on the drug disposition. There is a need for a mAb disposition framework that captures the dynamics of ADA formation and drug’s interactions with the ADA and target as parts of the drug distribution and elimination. Here we describe such a framework and examine it against the PK, ADA, and clinical response data from a phase 3 trial in patients treated with adalimumab. The proposed framework offered a generalized understanding of how the dose, target affinity, and drug/ADA analyte forms affects the manifestation of ADA response with regard to its detections and alterations of drug disposition and effectiveness. Furthermore, as an example, its utility for dose considerations was demonstrated through predicting for late-stage trials of a PCSK9 inhibitor in terms of development in ADA incidence and titers, and consequences on the drug disposition, interaction with target, and downstream lowering effect on LDL-C.

    "abstract": "Abstract The clinical use of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, and other indications has been successfully established. A critical aspect of drug-antibody pharmacokinetics is immunogenicity, which triggers an immune response via an anti-drug antibody (ADA) and forms drug/ADA immune complexes (ICs). As a consequence, there may be a reduced efficacy upon neutralization by ADA or an accelerated drug clearance. It is therefore important to understand immunogenicity in biological therapies. A drug-like immunoglobulin G (IgG) was radiolabeled with tritium, and ICs were formed using polyclonal ADA, directed against the complementary-determining region of the drug-IgG, to investigate in vivo biodistribution in rodents. It was demonstrated that 65% of the radioactive IC dose was excreted within the first 24 h, compared with only 6% in the control group who received non-complexed 3 H-drug. Autoradiographic imaging at the early time point indicated a deposition of immune complexes in the liver, lung, and spleen indicated by an increased radioactivity signal. A biodistribution study confirmed the results and revealed further insights regarding excretion and plasma profiles. It is assumed that the immune complexes are readily taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. The ICs are degraded proteolytically, and the released radioactively labeled amino acids are redistributed throughout the body. These are mainly renally excreted as indicated by urine measurements or incorporated into protein synthesis. These biodistribution studies using tritium-labeled immune complexes described in this article underline the importance of understanding the immunogenicity induced by therapeutic proteins and the resulting influence on biological behavior.

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunogenicity evaluation is a critical part of drug development. Regulatory guidelines from multiple health agencies provide recommendations for the development and validation of anti-drug antibody (ADA) assays to assess immunogenicity in clinical trials. These recommendations primarily describe an ADA method run in one bioanalytical laboratory supporting a biotherapeutic molecule; however, there are increasing instances that may necessitate the support of the ADA method being run in more than one laboratory. A program can rapidly expand into multiple clinical studies within one or multiple countries, where the most appropriate way to support the program is by having multiple laboratories perform ADA sample analysis. In addition, there may be certain country-specific challenges that may make it infeasible to transport samples outside of the country for analysis. China for example has a lengthy sample exportation process that has potential to negatively impact study timelines. If multiple laboratories analyze samples using the same ADA method, comparable method performance should be established. Here, we describe a three-way assessment of ADA assay comparability between two US-based bioanalytical laboratories and one based in China. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance transporter 2 (MRP2) are efflux transporters involved in the absorption, excretion, and distribution of drugs. Bidirectional cell assays are recognized models for evaluating the potential of new drugs as substrates or inhibitors of efflux transporters. However, the assays are complicated by a lack of selective substrates and/or inhibitors, as well simultaneous expression of several efflux transporters in cell lines used in efflux models. This project aims to evaluate an in vitro efflux cell assay employing model substrates and inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP and MRP2 with knockout (KO) cell lines. The efflux ratios (ER) of P-gp (digoxin, paclitaxel), BCRP (prazosin, rosuvastatin), MRP2 (etoposide, olmesartan) and mixed (methotrexate, mitoxantrone) substrates were determined in wild-type C2BBe1 and KO cells. For digoxin and paclitaxel, the ER decreased to less than 2 in the cell lines lacking P-gp expression. The ER decreased to less than 3 for prazosin and less than 2 for rosuvastatin in the cell lines lacking BCRP expression. For etoposide and olmesartan, the ER decreased to less than 2 in the cell lines lacking MRP2 expression. The ER of methotrexate and mitoxantrone decreased in single- and double-KO cells without BCRP and MRP2 expression. These results show that KO cell lines have the potential to better interpret complex drug-transporter interactions without depending upon multi-targeted inhibitors or overlapping substrates. For drugs that are substrates of multiple transporters, the single- and double-KO cells may be used to assess their affinities for the different transporters. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract A soft-core oil-in-water (o/w) nanoemulsion (NE) is composed of nanometer (nm) sized oil droplets, stabilized by a surfactant layer and dispersed in a continuous bulky water phase. Characterization of the o/w NE molecule arrangements non-invasively, particularly the drug phase distribution (DPD) and its correlation to oil globule size (OGS), remains a challenge. Here we demonstrated the analytical methods of intact 19 F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and 1 H diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) NMR for their specificity in measuring DPD and OGS, respectively, on three NE formulations containing the active ingredient difluprednate (DFPN) at the same concentration. The results illustrated synchronized molecular rearrangement reflected in the DPD and OGS upon alterations in formulation. Addition of surfactant resulted in a higher DPD in the surfactant layer, and concomitantly smaller OGS. Mechanic perturbation converted most of the NE globules to the smaller thermodynamically stable microemulsion (ME) globules, changing both DPD and OGS to ME phase. These microstructure changes were not observed using 1D 1 H NMR; and dynamic light scattering (DLS) was only sensitive to OGS of ME globule in mechanically perturbed formulation. Collectively, the study illustrated the specificity and essential role of intact NMR methods in measuring the critical microstructure attributes of soft-core NE systems quickly, accurately, and non-invasively. Therefore, the selected NMR approach can be a unique diagnostic tool of molecular microstructure or Q3 property in o/w NE formulation development, and quality assurance after manufacture process or excipient component changes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunogenicity testing and characterization is an important part of understanding the immune response to administration of a protein therapeutic. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays are used to characterize a positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) response. Harmonization of reporting of NAb assay performance and results enables efficient communication and expedient review by industry and health authorities. Herein, a cross-industry group of NAb assay experts have harmonized NAb assay reporting recommendations and provided a bioanalytical report (BAR) submission editable template developed to facilitate agency filings. This document addresses key bioanalytical reporting gaps and provides a report structure for documenting clinical NAb assay performance and results. This publication focuses on the content and presentation of the NAb sample analysis report including essential elements such as the method, critical reagents and equipment, data analysis, study samples, and results. The interpretation of immunogenicity data, including the evaluation of the impact of NAb on safety, exposure, and efficacy, is out of scope of this publication. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bariatric surgery introduces significant changes in the gastrointestinal tract, which may affect oral drug absorption/bioavailability. Here we investigate the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) tadalafil for potentially impaired post-bariatric solubility/dissolution and absorption. Solubility was studied in vitro in different pHs, and ex vivo in gastric content aspirated from patients pre/post-surgery. Dissolution was studied in conditions mimicking pre/post-surgery stomach. Finally, the experimental data were used in physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model (GastroPlus ® ) to simulate pre- vs. post-surgery tadalafil PK. Tadalafil demonstrated low and pH-independent solubility, both in vitro and ex vivo . Tadalafil release from all drug products and under all gastric conditions was incomplete, with particularly poor dissolution (2%) of the highest dose under post-bariatric conditions. PBPK simulations revealed altered tadalafil PK after gastric bypass—but not after sleeve gastrectomy—compared to unoperated individuals, with 44–48% decreased C max , 35–56% decreased AUC and 44% shorter T max . This mechanistic analysis suggests that tadalafil may be as effective after sleeve gastrectomy as before the procedure; meanwhile, results after gastric bypass raise concerns regarding the bioperformance of the drug. In addition, the drug's duration of action may be much shorter after gastric bypass. Thus, the effectiveness of tadalafil, widely regarded as the ‘weekend pill’, may be shorter than expected among gastric bypass patients. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunogenicity assessment is vital in clinical trials and is measured through a multi-tiered approach (screening, confirmatory and titer assays). However, recent studies have suggested that titer results could be reported from ADA signal-to-noise ratios (S/N ratios=sample mean signal/negative control mean signal). More data analysis using two clinical trials of adalimumab: SB5-1003 (single-dose, healthy participants) and SB5-4001 (multiple-dose, interchangeability study, patients with plaque psoriasis), therefore, is indispensable whether substituting ADA S/N ratio as an alternative way of reporting titer results has no impact on interpretation on clinical outcome. In this study, we demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between S/N ratios and titers and no impact on overall PK results. Nonetheless, sub-analyses with time or adalimumab level showed a change in the regression between S/N ratios and titers, leading to different titer values from the same S/N ratio. These data demonstrate that S/N ratios may fully replace titers in limited circumstances such as a biosimilar study which goal is to prove equivalence between the originator and candidate product, but need a caution in other cases.

Here, we highlight the application of QST models to predict toxicities of cancer treatments, such as cytopenia(s) and gastrointestinal adverse effects, where narrow therapeutic indexes need to be actively managed. The importance of bifurcation analysis is demonstrated in QST models of hematologic toxicity to understand how different regions of the parameter space generate different behaviors following cancer treatment, which results in asymptotically stable predictions, yet highly irregular for specific schedules, or oscillating predictions of blood cell levels. In addition, an agent-based model of the intestinal crypt was used to simulate how the spatial location of the injury within the crypt affects the villus disruption severity. We discuss the value of QST modeling approaches to support drug development and how they align with technological advances impacting trial design including patient selection, dose/regimen selection, and ultimately patient safety.",

    "abstract": "For the management of iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS) in children, a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of IWS of commonly used opioids and sedatives is lacking. Here, we introduce a new mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modeling approach for studying IWS in pediatric clinical datasets. One thousand seven hundred eighty-two NRSwithdrawal scores of IWS severity were analyzed, which were collected from 81 children (age range: 1 month-18 years) that received opioids or sedatives by continuous infusion for 5 days or more. These data were successfully fitted with a PKPD model consisting of a plasma and a dependence compartment that well characterized the dynamics of IWS from morphine, fentanyl, and ketamine. The results suggest that (1) instead of decreasing the infusion rate by a set percentage at set intervals, it would be better to lengthen the weaning period when higher infusion rates are administered prior to weaning; (2) for fentanyl specifically, the risk of IWS might be lower when weaning with smaller dose reductions every 12 h instead of weaning with greater dose reductions every 48 h. The developed PKPD model can be used to evaluate the risk of IWS over time and the extent to which it is affected by different weaning strategies. The results yield hypotheses that could guide future clinical research on optimal weaning strategies. The mechanism-based PKPD modeling approach can be applied in other datasets to characterize the IWS dynamics of other drugs used in pediatric intensive care.",

    "abstract": "Between October 2020 and March 2022, FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) completed two pilot programs to assess the quality management maturity (QMM) of drug manufacturing establishments. Mature quality systems promote proactive detection of vulnerabilities, prevent problems before they occur, and foster a culture that rewards process and system improvements. A CDER QMM program may help to advance supply chain resiliency and robustness and mitigate drug shortages. One pilot program evaluated seven establishments located within the U.S. that produce finished dosage form products marketed in the U.S. A second pilot program evaluated eight establishments located outside the U.S. that produce active pharmaceutical ingredients used in drug products marketed in the U.S. The execution of these pilot programs afforded FDA the opportunity to learn important lessons about the establishment QMM assessment process, scoring approach, assessor behaviors, and perceptions of the assessment questions, reports, and ratings. Many of the participating establishments reported that the QMM pilot assessments helped to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and new areas for improvement which they had not previously identified through internal audits or CGMP inspections. There has been a great deal of interest in the outcomes of CDER's QMM pilot programs and this paper describes, for the first time, the lessons CDER learned and will continue to heed in the development of a QMM program.",

This study aimed to predict the efflux activity of MDR1 and BCRP using multiple machine learning approaches with molecular descriptors and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). In vitro efflux activity was determined using MDR1- and BCRP-expressing cells. Predictive performance was assessed using an in-house dataset with a chronological split and an external dataset. CatBoost and support vector regression showed the best predictive performance for MDR1 and BCRP efflux activities, respectively, of the 25 descriptor-based machine learning methods based on the coefficient of determination (R2). The single-task GCN showed a slightly lower performance than descriptor-based prediction in the in-house dataset. In both approaches, the percentage of compounds predicted within twofold of the observed values in the external dataset was lower than that in the in-house dataset. Multi-task GCN did not show any improvements, whereas multimodal GCN increased the predictive performance of BCRP efflux activity compared with single-task GCN. Furthermore, the ensemble approach of descriptor-based machine learning and GCN achieved the highest predictive performance with R2 values of 0.706 and 0.587 in MDR1 and BCRP, respectively, in time-split test sets. This result suggests that two different approaches to represent molecular structures complement each other in terms of molecular characteristics. Our study demonstrated that predictive models using advanced machine learning approaches are beneficial for identifying potential substrate liability of both MDR1 and BCRP.",

    "abstract": "Thorough exploration of alternative dosing frequencies is often not performed in conventional pharmacometrics approaches. Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) can provide novel insights into optimal dosing regimen and drug behaviors which could add a new dimension to the design of novel treatments. However, methods for such an approach are currently lacking. Recently, we illustrated the utility of frequency-domain response analysis (FdRA), an analytical method used in control engineering, using several generic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic case studies. While FdRA is not applicable to models harboring ever increasing variables such as those describing tumor growth, studying such models in the frequency domain provides valuable insight into optimal dosing frequencies. Through the analysis of three distinct tumor growth models (cell cycle-specific, metronomic, and acquired resistance), we demonstrate the application of a simulation-based analysis in the frequency domain to optimize cancer treatments. We study the response of tumor growth to dosing frequencies while simultaneously examining treatment safety, and found for all three models that above a certain dosing frequency, tumor size is insensitive to an increase in dosing frequency, e.g., for the cell cycle-specific model, one dose per 3 days, and an hourly dose yield the same reduction of tumor size to 3% of the initial size after 1 year of treatment. Additionally, we explore the effect of drug elimination rate changes on the tumor growth response. In summary, we show that the frequency-domain view of three models of tumor growth dynamics can help in optimizing drug dosing regimen to improve treatment success.",

The current study aimed to characterize BPH-LUTS progression using responses to the IPSS, the QoL, and the BII in an integrated item response theory (IRT) framework and assess the Fisher information of each scale. The power of this approach to detect a drug effect was compared with an IRT approach considering only IPSS responses. A unidimensional and a bidimensional pharmacometric IRT model, based on item-level IPSS responses in a clinical trial with 403 patients, were extended by incorporating patients' QoL and summary BII scores over the 6-month trial period. In the developed unidimensional integrated model, the QoL score was found to be the most informative, representing 17% of the total Fisher information, while the combined information content of the seven IPSS items represented 70.6%. In the bidimensional model, \"storage\" and both storage and \"voiding\" disability drove QoL and summary BII responses, respectively. Sample size reduction of 16% to detect a drug effect at 80% power was obtained with the unidimensional integrated IRT model compared with its counterpart IPSS IRT model. This study shows that utilizing the information content across the IPSS, QoL, and BII scales in an integrated IRT framework results in a modest but meaningful increase in power to detect a drug effect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Total score (TS) data is generated from composite scales consisting of several questions/items, such as the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The analysis method that most fully uses the information gathered is item response theory (IRT) models, but these are complex and require item-level data which may not be available. Therefore, the TS is commonly analysed with standard continuous variable (CV) models, which do not respect the bounded nature of data. Bounded integer (BI) models do respect the data nature but are not as extensively researched. Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) are an alternative that requires few assumptions and handles dropout without bias. If an IRT model exists, the expected mean and standard deviation of TS can be computed through IRT-informed functions—which allows CV and BI models to estimate parameters on the IRT scale. The fit, performance on external data and parameter precision (when applicable) of CV, BI and MMRM to analyse simulated TS data from the MDS-UPDRS motor subscale are investigated in this work. All models provided accurate predictions and residuals without trends, but the fit of CV and BI models was improved by IRT-informed functions. The IRT-informed BI model had more precise parameter estimates than the IRT-informed CV model. The IRT-informed models also had the best performance on external data, while the MMRM model was worst. In conclusion, (1) IRT-informed functions improve TS analyses and (2) IRT-informed BI models had more precise IRT parameter estimates than IRT-informed CV models.",

    "abstract": "Atazanavir increases plasma bilirubin levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Due to less costly and readily available assays, bilirubin has been proposed as a marker of atazanavir exposure. In this work, a previously developed nomogram for detection of suboptimal atazanavir exposure is validated against external patient populations. The bilirubin nomogram was validated against 311 matching bilirubin and atazanavir samples from 166 HIV-1-infected Norwegian, French, and Italian patients on a ritonavir-boosted regimen. In addition, the nomogram was evaluated in 56 Italian patients on an unboosted regimen. The predictive properties of the nomogram were validated against observed atazanavir plasma concentrations. The use of the nomogram to detect non-adherence was also investigated by simulation. The bilirubin nomogram predicted suboptimal exposure in the patient populations on a ritonavir-boosted regimen with a negative predictive value of 97% (95% CI 95-100). The bilirubin nomogram and monitoring of atazanavir concentrations had similar predictive properties for detecting non-adherence based on simulations. Although both methods performed adequately during a period of non-adherence, they had lower predictive power to detect past non-adherence episodes. Using the bilirubin nomogram for detection of suboptimal atazanavir exposure in patients on a ritonavir-boosted regimen is a rapid and cost-effective alternative to routine measurements of the actual atazanavir exposure in plasma. Its application may be useful in clinical settings if atazanavir concentrations are not available.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the quality of life (QoL) score, and the benign prostatic hyperplasia impact index (BII) are three different scales commonly used to assess the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-LUTS). Based on a phase II clinical trial including 403 patients with moderate to severe BPH-LUTS, the objectives of this study were to (i) develop traditional pharmacometric and bounded integer (BI) models for the IPSS, QoL score, and BII endpoints, respectively; (ii) compare the power and type I error in detecting drug effects of BI modeling with traditional methods through simulation; and (iii) obtain quantitative translation between scores on the three abovementioned scales using a BI modeling framework. All developed models described the data adequately. Pharmacometric modeling using a continuous variable (CV) approach was overall found to be the most robust in terms of type I error and power to detect a drug effect. In most cases, BI modeling showed similar performance to the CV approach, yet severely inflated type I error was generally observed when inter-individual variability (IIV) was incorporated in the BI variance function (g()). BI modeling without IIV in g() showed greater type I error control compared to the ordered categorical approach. Lastly, a multiple-scale BI model was developed and estimated the relationship between scores on the three BPH-LUTS scales with overall low uncertainty. The current study yields greater understanding of the operating characteristics of the novel BI modeling approach and highlights areas potentially requiring further improvement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a leading class of biotherapeutics. In oncology, patients often fail on early lines of biologic therapy to a specific target. Some patients may then enroll in a new clinical trial with a mAb specific for the same target. Therefore, immunoassays designed to quantify the current mAb therapy or assess immunogenicity to the drug may be susceptible to cross-reactivity or interference with residual prior biologics. The impact of two approved anti-PD-1 mAbs, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, was tested in several immunoassays for cemiplimab, another approved anti-PD-1 mAb. The methods included a target-capture drug concentration assay, a bridging anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay and a competitive ligand-binding neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay. We also tested bioanalytical strategies to mitigate cross-reactivity or interference in these assays from other anti-PD-1 biologics. Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab cross-reacted in the cemiplimab drug concentration assay. This was mitigated by addition of antibodies specific to pembrolizumab or nivolumab. ADA specific for pembrolizumab and nivolumab did not interfere in the cemiplimab ADA assay. However, pembrolizumab and nivolumab generated a false-positive response in a target-capture NAb assay. Our results demonstrate that similar exogenous pre-existing anti-PD-1 mAbs (biotherapeutics) such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab are detected and accurately quantified in the cemiplimab drug concentration assay. However, once steady state is achieved for the new therapy, prior biologics would likely not be detected. Cross-reactivity and interference in immunoassays from previous treatment with class-specific biotherapeutic(s) pose significant bioanalytical challenges, especially in immuno-oncology.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to explore the potential of biopharmaceutics in vitro tools to predict drug product performance in the pediatric population. Biorelevant dissolution set-ups were used to predict how age and medicine administration practices affect the in vitro dissolution of oral formulations of a poorly water-soluble compound, montelukast. Biorelevant age-appropriate dissolution studies of Singulair ® (granules and chewable tablets) were conducted with the µDISS profiler™, USP 4 apparatus, USP 2 apparatus, and mini-paddle apparatus. Biorelevant simulating fluids representative of adult and pediatric conditions were used in the dissolution studies. The biorelevant dissolution conditions were appropriately selected ( i.e. volumes, transit times, etc . ) to mimic the gastrointestinal conditions of each of the subpopulations tested. Partial least squares regression (PLS-R) was performed to understand the impact of in vitro variables on the dissolution of montelukast. Montelukast dissolution was significantly affected by the in vitro hydrodynamics used to perform the dissolution tests (µDISS profiler™: positive effect); choice of simulation of gastric (negative effect) and/or intestinal conditions (positive effect) of the gastrointestinal tract; and simulation of prandial state (fasted state: negative effect, fed state: positive effect). Age-related biorelevant dissolution of Singulair ® granules predicted the in vivo effect of the co-administration of the formulation with applesauce and formula in infants. This study demonstrates that age-appropriate biorelevant dissolution testing can be a valuable tool for the assessment of drug performance in the pediatric population. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Dissolution specifications are often essential in assuring the quality and consistency of therapeutic benefits of drug lots released to the market as in vitro dissolution is often considered to be a surrogate for bioavailability. Despite the importance of demonstrating the clinical relevance of the dissolution specifications, it is often challenging to achieve this goal. In this case study, a modeling and simulation approach was utilized to support the clinical relevance of the dissolution specifications for upadacitinib extended-release tablets. A level A in vitro in vivo correlation was developed and utilized in predicting upadacitinib plasma exposures for formulations which correspond to the upper and lower dissolution limits. Exposure-response models for upadacitinib efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were utilized to conduct clinical trial simulations to evaluate the efficacy and safety of formulations at the upper and lower dissolution boundaries. Each simulated clinical trial consisted of three treatment arms: (1) upadacitinib 15 mg QD using the target formulation, (2) upadacitinib 15 mg QD using a formulation at the lower dissolution boundary, and (3) upadacitinib 15 mg QD using a formulation at the upper dissolution boundary. Each simulated trial included 300 patients per arm and simulations were replicated 200 times. Results demonstrated that formulations at the lower and upper dissolution boundaries are predicted to have noninferior efficacy and comparable safety to the target 15 mg extended-release formulation. This approach was successfully utilized in demonstrating the clinical relevance of upadacitinib extended-release tablet dissolution specifications. Graphical Abstract.",

    "abstract": "RNA is a fundamental tool for molecular and cellular biology research. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has proved it is also invaluable in vaccine development. However, the need for cold storage to maintain RNA integrity and the practical and economic burden associated with cold chain logistics highlight the need for new and improved preservation methods. We recently showed the use of capillary-mediated vitrification (CMV), as a tool for stabilizing temperature-sensitive enzymes. Here, we demonstrate the use of CMV as a method to preserve mRNA. The CMV process was performed by formulating a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding mRNA with common excipients, applying the solution to a porous support, referred to as the scaffold, and drying the samples under vacuum for 30 min. The CMV preserved samples were stored at 55 °C for up to 100 days or 25 °C for 60 days and analyzed by electrophoresis and for transfection efficiency in a cell-based assay. The 55 °C-stressed mRNA exhibited comparable electrophoresis banding patterns and band intensity when compared to a frozen, liquid control. Additionally, the CMV stabilized mRNA maintained 97.5 ± 8.7% transfection efficiency after 77 days and 78.4 ± 3.9% after 100 days when stored 55 °C and analyzed using a cell-based assay in the CHO-K1 cell line. In contrast, a liquid control exhibited no bands on the electrophoresis gel and lost all transfection activity after being stored overnight at 55 °C. Likewise, after 60 days at 25 °C, the CMV-processed samples had full transfection activity while the activity of the liquid control was reduced to 40.1 ± 4.6%. In conclusion, CMV is a simple formulation method that significantly enhances the thermal stability of mRNA, requires minimal processing time, and could enable formulation of mRNA that can tolerate exposure to temperatures well above 25 °C during shipment and deployment in extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Twenty percent of baseline patient samples exhibited a pre-existing response in a bridging anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay for a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutic. In some cases, assay signals were more than 100-fold higher than background, potentially confounding detection of true treatment-emergent ADA responses. The pre-existing reactivity was mapped by competitive inhibition experiments using recombinant proteins or chimeric human mAbs with IgG4 heavy chain regions swapped for IgG1 sequences. These experiments demonstrated that the majority of the samples had reactivity to an epitope containing leucine 445 in the CH3 domain of human IgG4. The pre-existing reactivity in baseline patient samples was mitigated by replacing the ADA assay capture reagent with a version of the drug containing a wild type IgG1 proline substitution at residue 445 without impacting detection of drug-specific, treatment-emergent ADA. Finally, purification on Protein G or anti-human IgG (H + L) columns indicated the pre-existing response was likely due to immunoglobulins in patient samples. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "The two one-sided t-tests (TOST) procedure has been used to evaluate average bioequivalence (BE). As a regulatory standard, it is crucial that TOST distinguish BE from not-BE (NBE) when BE data are not lognormal. TOST was compared with a Bayesian procedure (BEST by Kruschke) in simulated datasets of test/reference ratios (T/R) which were BE and NBE, wherein (1) log(T/R) or T-R were normally distributed, (2) sample sizes ranged 10-50, and (3) extreme log(T/R) or T-R values were randomly included in datasets. The 90% \"credible interval\" (CrI) from BEST is a Bayesian alternative of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of TOST and it can be derived from a posterior distribution that is more reflective of the observed mean log(T/R) distribution that often deviates from normality. In the absence of extreme T/R values, both methods agreed BE when observed T/R were lognormal. BEST more accurately concluded BE or NBE, while requiring fewer subjects, when observed log(T/R) or T-R were normal in the presence of extreme values. Overall, TOST and BEST perform comparably on lognormal T/R, while BEST is more accurate, requiring fewer subjects when datasets are normal for T-R or contain extreme values. Of note, the normally distributed datasets only rarely contain extreme values. Our results imply that when BEST and TOST yield different BE assessment results from bioequivalent products, TOST may disadvantage applicants when T/R are not lognormal and/or include extreme T/R values. Application of BEST can address the situation when T/R are not lognormal or include extreme data values. Application of BEST to BE data can be considered a useful alternative to TOST for evaluation of BE and for efficient development of BE formulations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mankind has recently had to deal a series of virus-mediated pandemics, resulting in extensive morbidity and mortality rates that have severely strained healthcare systems. While dealing with viral infections as a healthcare concern is not new, our exceptionally mobile society has added to the critical challenge of limiting pathogen spread of a highly transmissible virus prior to the generation, testing, and distribution of safe and effective vaccines. The tremendous global effort put forth to address the recent pandemic induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection has highlighted many of the strengths and weaknesses of how vaccines are identified, tested, and used to provide protection. These uncertainties are exacerbated by the lack of clear and consistent messaging that can occur when the processes of research, development, and clinical testing that normally requires years of study and consideration are compressed into a few months. In this commentary, I will provide some background on the intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), and intradermal (ID) administration routes used for injectable vaccines and some information on potential immunological outcomes. With this background, I will address the recent FDA decision to allow an approved vaccine against monkeypox virus to be administered by ID, as well as its initial approval route via SC, injection as a dose-sparing strategy to maximize immunization numbers using current stockpiles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The genome content of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors is critical to the safety and potency of AAV-based gene therapy products. Empty capsids are considered a product-related impurity and a critical quality attribute (CQA) of the drug product, thus requiring characterization throughout the production process to demonstrate they are controlled to acceptable levels in the final drug product. Anion exchange chromatography has been used to achieve separation between empty and full capsids, but requires method development and gradient optimization for different serotypes and formulations. Here, we describe an alternative approach to quantitation that does not rely on achieving separation between empty and full capsids, but instead uses the well-established relationship between absorbance at UV A 260 / A 280 and relation to DNA/protein content, in combination with anion-exchange chromatography to allow one to calculate the relative proportion of empty and full capsids in AAV samples from a single peak. We call this approach ACUVRA: A nion-exchange C hromatography UV - R atio A nalysis, and show the applicability of the method through a case study with recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) process intermediates and drug substance. Method qualification and GMP validation in a quality control (QC) laboratory results show that ACUVRA is a fit-for-purpose method for process development support and characterization, while also being a QC-friendly option for GMP release testing at all stages of clinical development.",

    "abstract": "During covariate modeling in pharmacometrics, computational time can be reduced by using a fast preselection tool to identify a subset of promising covariates that are to be tested with the more computationally demanding likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is considered to be the standard for covariate selection. There is however a lack of knowledge on best practices for covariate (pre)selection in pharmacometric repeated time-to-event (RTTE) models. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate the performance of three covariate (pre)selection tools for RTTE models: the likelihood ratio test (LRT), the empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) test, and a novel Schoenfeld-like residual test. This was done in simulated datasets with and without a “true” time-constant covariate, and both in the presence and absence of high EBE shrinkage. In scenarios with a “true” covariate effect, all tools had comparable power to detect this effect. In scenarios without a “true” covariate effect, the false positive rates of the LRT and the Schoenfeld-like residual test were slightly inflated to 5.7% and 7.2% respectively, while the EBE test had no inflated false positive rate. The presence of high EBE shrinkage (> 40%) did not affect the performance of any of the covariate (pre)selection tools. We found the EBE test to be a fast and accurate tool for covariate preselection in RTTE models. The novel Schoenfeld-like residual test proposed here had a similar performance in the tested scenarios and might be applied more readily to time-varying covariates, such as drug concentration and dynamic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease with approximately 174 million cases worldwide. Electronic questionnaires are increasingly used for collecting patient-reported-outcome (PRO) data about disease symptoms. Our aim was to leverage PRO data, collected to record COPD disease symptoms, in a general modelling framework to enable interpretation of PRO observations in relation to disease progression and potential to predict exacerbations. The data were collected daily over a year, in a prospective, observational study. The e-questionnaire, the EXAcerbations of COPD Tool (EXACT®) included 14 items (i.e. questions) with 4 or 5 ordered categorical response options. An item response theory (IRT) model was used to relate the responses from each item to the underlying latent variable (which we refer to as disease severity), and on each item level, Markov models (MM) with 4 or 5 categories were applied to describe the dependence between consecutive observations. Minimal continuous time MMs were used and parameterised using ordinary differential equations. One hundred twenty-seven COPD patients were included (median age 67 years, 54% male, 39% current smokers), providing approximately 40,000 observations per EXACT® item. The final model suggested that, with time, patients more often reported the same scores as the previous day, i.e. the scores were more stable. The modelled COPD disease severity change over time varied markedly between subjects, but was small in the typical individual. This is the first IRT model with Markovian properties; our analysis proved them necessary for predicting symptom-defined exacerbations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A rare cause of megaloblastic anemia (MA) is thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in SLC19A2 (encoding THTR1), a thiamine transporter. The study objectives were to (1) functionally characterize selected TRMA-associated SLC19A2 variants and (2) determine whether current prescription drugs associated with drug-induced MA (DIMA) may act via inhibition of SLC19A2. Functional characterization of selected SLC19A2 variants was performed by confocal microscopy and isotopic uptake studies of [3H]-thiamine in HEK293 cells. Sixty-three drugs associated with DIMA were screened for SLC19A2 inhibition in isotopic uptake studies. Three previously uncharacterized SLC19A2 variants identified in TRMA patients exhibited disrupted localization to the plasma membrane along with near-complete loss-of-function. Ten of 63 drugs inhibited SLC19A2-mediated thiamine transport ≥ 50% at screening concentrations; however, with the exception of erythromycin, none was predicted to inhibit SLC19A2 at clinically relevant unbound plasma concentrations. Data from electronic health records revealed reduced levels of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in patients prescribed erythromycin, consistent with inhibition of SLC19A2-mediated thiamine transport. Here, we confirmed the role of three SLC19A2 variants in TRMA pathology. Additionally, we report that inhibition of SLC19A2 is a potential, but uncommon mechanism for DIMA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to illustrate how a new methodology to assess clinical trial outcome measures using a longitudinal item response theory–based model (IRM) could serve as an alternative to mixed model repeated measures (MMRM). Data from the EXACT (Exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease tool) which is used to capture frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations in COPD were analyzed using an IRM. The IRM included a graded response model characterizing item parameters and functions describing symptom-time course. Total scores were simulated (month 12) using uncertainty in parameter estimates. The 50th (2.5th, 97.5th) percentiles of the resulting simulated differences in average total score (drug minus placebo) represented the estimated drug effect (95%CI), which was compared with published MMRM results. Furthermore, differences in sample size, sensitivity, specificity, and type I and II errors between approaches were explored. Patients received either oral danirixin 75 mg twice daily ( n = 45) or placebo ( n = 48) on top of standard of care over 52 weeks. A step function best described the COPD symptoms-time course in both trial arms. The IRM improved precision of the estimated drug effect compared to MMRM, resulting in a sample size of 2.5 times larger for the MMRM analysis to achieve the IRM precision. The IRM showed a higher probability of a positive predictive value (34%) than MMRM (22%). An item model–based analysis data gave more precise estimates of drug effect than MMRM analysis for the same endpoint in this one case study.",

    "abstract": "The testing of protein drug candidates for inducing the generation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) plays a fundamental role in drug development. The basis of the testing strategy includes a screening assay followed by a confirmatory test. Screening assay cut points (CP) are calculated mainly based on two approaches, either non-parametric, when the data set does not appear normally distributed, or parametric, in the case of a normal distribution. A normal distribution of data is preferred and may be achieved after outlier exclusion and, if necessary, transformation of the data. The authors present a Weibull transformation and a comparison with a decision tree-based approach that was tested on 10 data sets (healthy human volunteer matrix, different projects). Emphasis is placed on a transformation calculation that can be easily reproduced to make it accessible to non-mathematicians. The cut point value and the effect on the false positive rate as well as the number of excluded samples of both methods are compared.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear mixed effects models are widely used to describe longitudinal data to improve the efficiency of drug development process or increase the understanding of the studied disease. In such settings, the appropriateness of the modeling assumptions is critical in order to draw correct conclusions and must be carefully assessed for any substantial violations. Here, we propose a new method for structure model assessment, based on assessment of bias in conditional weighted residuals (CWRES). We illustrate this method by assessing prediction bias in two integrated models for glucose homeostasis, the integrated glucose-insulin (IGI) model, and the integrated minimal model (IMM). One dataset was simulated from each model then analyzed with the two models. CWRES outputted from each model fitting were modeled to capture systematic trends in CWRES as well as the magnitude of structural model misspecifications in terms of difference in objective function values (ΔOFVBias). The estimates of CWRES bias were used to calculate the corresponding bias in conditional predictions by the inversion of first-order conditional estimation method's covariance equation. Time, glucose, and insulin concentration predictions were the investigated independent variables. The new method identified correctly the bias in glucose sub-model of the integrated minimal model (IMM), when this bias occurred, and calculated the absolute and proportional magnitude of the resulting bias. CWRES bias versus the independent variables agreed well with the true trends of misspecification. This method is fast easily automated diagnostic tool for model development/evaluation process, and it is already implemented as part of the Perl-speaks-NONMEM software.",

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was the modelled PD variable. A two-way cross-over study was simulated where a reference PG and a potentially biosimilar test product were administered to healthy volunteers. Differences in delivered dose amounts or potency between the products were simulated. A different baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was also considered. Additionally, the power to conclude PK or PD similarity based on areas under the PG concentration-time curve (AUC) and ANC-time curve (AUEC) were calculated. Delivered dose differences between the products led to a greater than dose proportional differences in AUC but not in AUEC, respectively. A 10% dose difference from a 6 mg dose resulted in 51% and 7% differences in AUC and AUEC, respectively. These differences were more pronounced with low baseline ANC. Potency differences up to 50% were not associated with large differences in either AUCs or AUECs. The power to conclude PK similarity was affected by the simulated dose difference; with a 4% dose difference from 6 mg the power was approximately 29% with 250 subjects. The power to conclude PD similarity was high for all delivered dose differences and sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of biologic-based therapeutics has revolutionized our ability to treat complex diseases such as cancer- and autoimmune-related disorders. Biologic-based therapeutics are known to generate anti-drug immune responses or immunogenicity in clinical patients which can lead to altered pharmacokinetics, decreased drug efficacy, and unwanted adverse clinical events. Assays designed to detect and assess anti-drug immune responses are used to help monitor patients and improve drug safety. Utilizing a tiered approach, screening assays are developed first to identify patients that are potentially positive for anti-drug-specific antibodies. Patients that screen positive are subjected to additional tiers of testing that include a confirmation assay to confirm the presence of expected anti-drug-specific antibodies, a titer assay to assess relative levels of anti-drug-specific antibodies, and, depending on the drug’s mechanism of action or concerns of adverse clinical reactions, further characterization such as drug neutralization and anti-drug antibody isotyping. This tiered approach can prove to be detrimental to clinical samples from exposure to multiple cycles of testing, freeze thaws, and repeated handling by lab personnel. Multiplexing some of these assays together may streamline the characterization of anti-drug immune responses and help reduce the repeated usage of clinical samples. In this study, we combined a screening assay and anti-drug isotyping assays into one multiplexed assay using the Luminex® xMAP® Technology. The multiplexed assay was developed and validated to meet the FDA recommended guidelines for immunogenicity assessments. These results show that multiplexed assays perform comparably to industry standards. This study should encourage labs to explore the use of multiplexing immunogenicity assays to characterize anti-drug antibody responses quickly, with less repeat testing and reduced sample handling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) comprise 3 distinct parts: a specific antibody carrier (mAb), a linker, and a cytotoxic payload. Typical pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of ADCs remains fragmented using separate noncompartmental analyses (NCA) of individual analytes, offering little insight into the dynamic relationships among the ADC components, and the safety and efficacy implications. As a result, it is exceedingly difficult to compare ADCs in terms of favorable PK characteristics. Therefore, there is a need for characterizing ADCs using the joint disposition properties critical for understanding the fate of an ADC complex and clinical implications. In this communication, we describe 3 joint disposition metrics (JDMs) for integrated NCA of ADCs based on a combination of common analytes of ADC, payload, conjugated payload, and total mAb. These JDMs were derived, each in a simple form of a ratio between appropriate PK parameters of two analytes, from the presumed drug delivery scheme behind typical ADC designs, in terms of (1) linker stability, (2) therapeutic exposure ratio, and (3) effective drug-to-antibody ratio in vivo . The validity of the JDM-based PK characterization was examined against model-based analyses via their applications to 3 clinical candidates: PF-06650808, PF-06647020, and PF-06664178. For instance, the linker stability estimates for PF-06650808, PF-06647020, and PF-06664178 were 0.31, 0.14, and 0.096, respectively, from the JDM-based analyses vs. 0.23, 0.11, and 0.086 by the model-based approach. Additionally, the JDMs were estimated for a number of FDA-approved or otherwise well-documented ADCs, showing their utilities in comparing ADCs in terms of favorable PK characteristics.

    "abstract": "A cell-based assay was developed to detect neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (NAbs) against odronextamab, a CD20xCD3 bispecific monoclonal antibody (mAb) under investigation for treatment of CD20+ B cell malignancies. In this assay, odronextamab bridges between two cell types, CD20-expressing HEK293 cells and CD3-expressing Jurkat T cells that generate a luciferase signal upon CD3 clustering. Patient samples containing NAbs directed to either arm of the bispecific drug block the odronextamab bridge formation between the cell lines thus preventing the generation of the luciferase signal. We determined that other anti-CD20 therapeutics also block bridge formation, resulting in false-positive results. In patient samples from odronextamab clinical trials, approximately 30% of baseline samples had a strong false-positive NAb signal that correlated with the presence of prior rituximab (anti-CD20) therapy. We determined that rituximab interference can be minimized by the addition of anti-rituximab antibodies in the NAb assay. Understanding and mitigating the impact of prior biologic exposure is increasingly important for implementing a successful bioanalytical strategy to support clinical drug development, especially in the immuno-oncology field. Odronextamab neutralizing antibody assay, interference, and mitigation. A Design of the odronextamab neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay where anti-CD20xCD3 drug bridges between CD20-expressing HEK293 cells and Jurkat T cells expressing an NFAT response element and luciferase reporter. True NAb prevents odronextamab from bridging between target and effector cells, thus preventing the expression of luciferase. B Interference with odronextamab from other anti-CD20 therapeutic antibodies (e.g., rituximab) from prior disease treatment generates a false-positive NAb result. Assay interference can be mitigated with an anti-idiotypic antibody against the interfering therapy.",

Accordingly, pediatric patients with Chagas disease take nifurtimox thrice daily with food at one of two body weight-adjusted dose ranges. We investigated possible relationships between pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and pharmacodynamic efficacy and safety data collected in an analysis population of 111 participants in CHICO, using a published population PK model to estimate nifurtimox exposure at the patient level. Pediatric exposure to nifurtimox was benchmarked against levels of nifurtimox exposure known to be effective in adults with Chagas disease. Given the complex dosing regimen for nifurtimox, we also modeled nifurtimox exposure associated with simpler dosing strategies. We found no relationship between exposure to nifurtimox and efficacy measures (e.g., serological response to treatment), or between exposure and safety outcomes (including typical adverse events, e.g., headache, decreased appetite, nausea/vomiting). The analysis population appeared to represent the overall CHICO population based on the similarity of their baseline characteristics and the profiles of adverse events in the two groups. Modeled exposure based on the dosing regimen in CHICO was within the reference range derived from phase 1 data in adults. The relationship between nifurtimox exposure and cure is complex; a simplified pediatric dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The liver is central to the elimination of many drugs from the body involving multiple processes and understanding of these processes is important to quantitively assess hepatic clearance of drugs. The synthetic STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes protein) agonist is a new class of drugs currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a potential anticancer therapy. In this study, we used ML00960317 (synthetic STING agonist) to investigate the hepatobiliary disposition of this novel molecular entity. A bile-duct cannulated (BDC) rat study indicated that biliary excretion is the major route of elimination for ML00960317 (84% of parent dose in bile). The human biliary clearance using in vitro sandwich cultured human hepatocyte model predicted significant biliary excretion of ML00960317 (biliary excretion index (BEI) of 47%). Moreover, the transport studies using transporter expressing cell lines, hepatocytes, and membrane vesicles indicated that ML00960317 is a robust substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MRP2.

    "abstract": "The multi-drug combination regime, FOLFIRINOX, is a standard of care chemotherapeutic therapy for pancreatic cancer patients. However, systematic evaluation of potential pharmacodynamic interactions among multi-drug therapy has not been reported previously. Here, pharmacodynamic interactions of the FOLFIRINOX agents (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin (Oxa) and SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan) were assessed across a panel of primary and established pancreatic cancer cells. Inhibition of cell proliferation was quantified for each drug, alone and in combination, to obtain quantitative, drug-specific interaction parameters and assess the nature of drug interactions. The experimental data were analysed assuming Bliss independent interactions, and nonlinear regression model fitting was conducted in SAS. Estimates of the drug interaction term, psi (ψ), revealed that the Oxa/SN-38 combination appeared synergistic in PANC-1 (ψ = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4, 0.9) and modestly synergistic, close to additive, in MIAPaCa-2 (ψ = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.6, 1.0) in 2D assays. The triple combination was strongly synergistic in MIAPaCa-2 (ψ = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1, 0.3) and modestly synergistic/borderline additive in PANC-1 2D (ψ = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.6, 1.0). The triple combination showed antagonistic interactions in the primary PIN-127 and 3D PANC-1 model (ψ > 1). Quantitative pharmacodynamic interactions have not been described for the FOLFIRINOX regimen; this analysis suggests a complex interplay among the three chemotherapeutic agents. Extension of this pharmacodynamic analysis approach to clinical/translational studies of the FOLFIRINOX combination could reveal additional pharmacodynamic interactions and guide further refinement of this regimen to achieve optimal clinical responses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Showing analytical similarity is key to license biosimilar products with reduced or circumvented clinical effort. Statistical procedures to assess analytical similarity of quality attributes at drug product level have been highly debated by academia, industry, and regulatory agencies. In the past, a tiered approach was recommended by regulators, consisting of equivalence tests and quality range tests. However, this approach has recently been withdrawn by FDA. New guidelines of FDA and EMA favour the usage of quality range tests. Moreover, it has recently been shown that simple range tests, such as the 3SD test, are flawed, since they do not control the agency risk of falsely declaring a non-biosimilar product as being biosimilar (Type I error). This has also been highlighted by regulators recently. In this contribution, we developed a novel bootstrapping test for assessing analytical similarity that overcomes current flaws of equivalence and range tests. The developed test shows the desired properties, that is, (i) similarity conditions can be easily defined, (ii) differences of mean and the variance between the biosimilar and the innovator can be studied simultaneously, and (iii) the Type I error of the test can be controlled at a low level, e.g. 5%, evenly along the entire similarity condition. Moreover, the test shows up to 10% higher mean power values in the similarity region compared to existing range tests that aim to control the Type I error. Hence, this test is superior to existing quality range tests and is perceived compliant with current regulatory requirements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Omalizumab is the first approved anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) agent for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent inadequately controlled allergic asthma in adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years old). In 2016, it was approved in pediatric patients (6–11 years old). The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize the relationship between serum free IgE and pulmonary function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]) in pediatrics using a population-based pharmacodynamic model. Data collected during the steroid-stable period (first 24 weeks) of an omalizumab trial with pediatric asthma patients (Study IA05) were used to build the pediatric IgE–FEV1 model. The previously developed population IgE–FEV1 model in adults/adolescents was adapted to characterize the FEV1 and IgE relationship in pediatrics with different magnitude and onset of response. The pediatric IgE–FEV1 model adequately characterized the IgE–FEV1 relationship in pediatrics, particularly at the extremes of the observed body weights (i.e., ≤ 30 kg) and IgE values at screening (i.e., &gt; 700 IU/mL). The estimated sigmoidal free IgE–FEV1 curves were similar in shape and maximum effect, but the estimated free IgE concentration leading to 50% maximum effect (IC50) in pediatric patients (39.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 24.3–63.9 ng/mL) was higher than estimated in adults (19.8, 95% CI 15.1–24.5 ng/mL). The model further confirmed that the current omalizumab dosing rationale based on the mean target free IgE level of 25 ng/ml was appropriate. The pediatric model can be used to predict population FEV1 response for omalizumab when combined with an omalizumab pharmacokinetic–IgE model. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an endogenous inhibitor of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. In patients with hemophilia A or B, inhibition of TFPI is an alternative therapeutic approach that augments the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Marstacimab is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes TFPI and is being evaluated as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with severe hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors (antibodies against coagulation factors). However, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of marstacimab may be affected by the induction of antidrug antibody (ADA) responses. Here, we describe the evolution and validation of three quasi-quantitative electrochemiluminescence-based methods to detect marstacimab ADAs, starting from their use in a first-in-human phase 1 study to their use in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies of patients with severe hemophilia. For all three methods, validation criteria evaluated the performance of the assays in screening and confirmatory cut points, precision, selectivity, drug tolerance, target interference, and stability. Additional criteria for validation were dilution linearity (Methods 1 and 2) and low positive control concentration, prozone effect, plate homogeneity, and robustness (Method 3). The three methods met validation criteria and are a potentially valuable tool in detecting the induction of marstacimab ADAs during treatment in patients with hemophilia. Graphical abstract",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SHetA2 using preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of ovarian cancer and establish a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)/PD model to describe their relationships with SHetA2 concentrations in mice. We found that daily oral administration of 60 mg/kg SHetA2 for 7 days resulted in consistent plasma PK and tissue distribution, achieving tumor drug concentrations required for growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cell lines. SHetA2 effectively induced cyclin D1 degradation in cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, with up to 70% reduction observed and an IC 50 of 4~5 µM. We identified cyclin D1 as a potential PD marker for SHetA2, based on a well-correlated time profile with SHetA2 PK. Additionally, we examined circulating levels of ccK18 as a non-invasive PD marker for SHetA2-induced apoptotic activity and found it unsuitable due to high variability. Using a PBPK/PD model, we depicted SHetA2 levels and their promoting effects on cyclin D1 degradation in tumors following multiple oral doses. The model suggested that twice-daily dosing regimens would be effective for sustained reduction in cyclin D1 protein. Our study provides valuable insights into the PK/PD of SHetA2, facilitating future clinical trial designs and dosing schedules.",

    "abstract": "In dose-response studies with censored time-to-event outcomes, D-optimal designs depend on the true model and the amount of censored data. In practice, such designs can be implemented adaptively, by performing dose assignments according to updated knowledge of the dose-response curve at interim analysis. It is also essential that treatment allocation involves randomization-to mitigate various experimental biases and enable valid statistical inference at the end of the trial. In this work, we perform a comparison of several adaptive randomization procedures that can be used for implementing D-optimal designs for dose-response studies with time-to-event outcomes with small to moderate sample sizes. We consider single-stage, two-stage, and multi-stage adaptive designs. We also explore robustness of the designs to experimental (chronological and selection) biases. Simulation studies provide evidence that both the choice of an allocation design and a randomization procedure to implement the target allocation impact the quality of dose-response estimation, especially for small samples. For best performance, a multi-stage adaptive design with small cohort sizes should be implemented using a randomization procedure that closely attains the targeted D-optimal design at each stage. The results of the current work should help clinical investigators select an appropriate randomization procedure for their dose-response study.",

The assessment of critical quality attributes (CQAs), product-process interactions, identification of appropriate in process analytical methods, and process modeling is part of a robust quality by design (QbD) framework to support further development and control of manufacturing processes. QbD implementation in the context of the GMMA platform will ensure robust manufacturing of batches with desired characteristics, facilitating technical transfer to local manufacturers, regulatory approval, and commercialization of vaccines based on this technology. Here, we summarize the methodology suggested, applied to a first step of GMMA manufacturing process. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract A well-documented pharmacometric (PMx) analysis dataset specification ensures consistency in derivations of the variables, naming conventions, traceability to the source data, and reproducibility of the analysis dataset. Lack of standards in creating the dataset specification can lead to poor quality analysis datasets, negatively impacting the quality of the PMx analysis. Standardization of the dataset specification within an individual organization helps address some of these inconsistencies. The recent introduction of the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Analysis Data Model (ADaM) Population Pharmacokinetic (popPK) Implementation Guide (IG) further promotes industry-wide standards by providing guidelines for the basic data structure of popPK analysis datasets. However, manual implementation of the standards can be labor intensive and error-prone. Hence, there is still a need to automate the implementation of these standards. In this paper, we present PmWebSpec, an easily deployable web-based application to facilitate the creation and management of CDISC-compliant PMx analysis dataset specifications. We describe the application of this tool through examples and highlight its key features including pre-populated dataset specifications, built-in checks to enforce standards, and generation of an electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD)-compliant data definition file. The application increases efficiency, quality and semi-automates PMx analysis dataset, and specification creation and has been well accepted by pharmacometricians and programmers internally. The success of this application suggests its potential for broader usage across the PMx community. Graphical Abstract",

Proof of concept was validated with Microcrystalline Cellulose laced with water, as well as water/acetone mixtures absorbed in a spray-dried Copovidone powder. To illustrate the role of impermeability of the base, we derive a model of vapor sorption that reveals the existence of a kinetic limit when solids are thinly spread, and a diffusion limit with greatly diminished effective diffusivity at large powder thickness. By monitoring the residual solvent content of powders, this new in situ technique offers advantages over indirect methods like mass spectrometry of vapor effluents, but without complications associated with probe fouling. To prescribe design guidelines and interpret signals, we model the electric field shed by the probe when a powder holds variable solvent mass fraction in the vertical direction. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Characterizing and mitigating factors that impact product immunogenicity can aid in risk assessment and/or managing risk following manufacturing changes. For follow-on products that have the same indication, patient population, and active product ingredient, the residual immunogenicity risk resides predominantly on differences in product and process related impurities. Characterizing differences in innate immune modulating impurities (IIRMI), which could act as adjuvants by activating local antigen presenting cells (APCs), can inform the immunogenicity risk assessment potentially reducing the need for clinical trials. To date, assays to detect trace levels of IIRMI are being used to support regulatory decisions by FDA for selected synthetic peptide drug products that refer to reference listed drugs of rDNA origin but not recombinant protein or peptide products where more complex mixtures of trace impurities including host cell proteins are expected. Here we describe an exercise to explore whether or not there are differences in the innate immune response elicited by an insulin glargine (produced in E. coli ) and its interchangeable biosimilar insulin (produced in P. pastoris ) that could indicate differences in IIRMI. Our results suggest the two products elicit comparable innate immune responses as determined by the expression of 90 immune-related genes, including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, CCL3, CCL2, and CXCL8. The data suggest that these assays can provide useful information when assessing recombinant proteins for the presence of IIRMI. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Recognizing the approach of a dramatic expansion of peptide therapeutics reaching the marketplace in recent years, led by GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and liraglutide, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) branch of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final guidance in 2021 that was intended to assist generic drug producers in meeting Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) obligations to establish \"sameness\" of their active peptide drug relative to that produced by innovator companies. Research and a published report by FDA scientists on best practices followed, which promulgated the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and principal component analysis (PCA) and established a quantitative standard by which \"sameness\" of higher order structure for the applicant's peptide drug could be judged. A key requirement is that drug product samples be analyzed directly and non-invasively, a condition which in practice restricts sample modification to the addition of a small amount of deuterium oxide to allow signal lock and spectral data alignment (as required for NMR analysis). In the study described herein, data are presented to illustrate that 1) relatively small differences in sample pH can cause significant shifting of certain proton resonances, 2) that such resonance shifting is readily reversible and due to the degree of protonation of specific amino acid residues (rather than reflecting differences in higher order structure), and 3) that small differences in pH variability between sample cohorts can frequently cause failure to meet the quantitative benchmark established by the agency. Methodology is presented by which drug sample pHs can be aligned with minimal impact, and a recommendation is made that minor sample pH adjustments be allowed in assessing \"sameness\" of peptide drug higher order structure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Longitudinal pharmacometric models offer many advantages in the analysis of clinical trial data, but potentially inflated type I error and biased drug effect estimates, as a consequence of model misspecifications and multiple testing, are main drawbacks. In this work, we used real data to compare these aspects for a standard approach (STD) and a new one using mixture models, called individual model averaging (IMA). Placebo arm data sets were obtained from three clinical studies assessing ADAS-Cog scores, Likert pain scores, and seizure frequency. By randomly (1:1) assigning patients in the above data sets to “treatment” or “placebo,” we created data sets where any significant drug effect was known to be a false positive. Repeating the process of random assignment and analysis for significant drug effect many times ( N = 1000) for each of the 40 to 66 placebo-drug model combinations, statistics of the type I error and drug effect bias were obtained. Across all models and the three data types, the type I error was (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th percentiles) 4.1, 11.4, 40.6, 100.0, 100.0 for STD, and 1.6, 3.5, 4.3, 5.0, 6.0 for IMA. IMA showed no bias in the drug effect estimates, whereas in STD bias was frequently present. In conclusion, STD is associated with inflated type I error and risk of biased drug effect estimates. IMA demonstrated controlled type I error and no bias.",

COE is a locally acting complex drug product indicated to increase tear production in patients whose production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The path to approval required overcoming numerous scientific challenges to determining therapeutic equivalence to the reference listed drug. Researchers in CDER’s Office of Pharmaceutical Quality and Office of Generic Drugs developed a quality by design approach to understand the effects of process and formulation variables on the product’s critical quality attributes, including globule size distribution (GSD), turbidity, viscosity, zeta potential, surface tension, and osmolality. CDER researchers explored multiple techniques to perform physicochemical characterization and analyze the GSD including laser diffraction, nanoparticle tracking analysis, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, asymmetric field flow fractionation, and two-dimensional diffusion ordered spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance. Biphasic models to study drug transfer kinetics demonstrated that COEs with qualitative and quantitative sameness and comparable GSDs, analyzed using earth mover’s distance, can be therapeutic equivalents. This body of research facilitated the review and approval of the first U.S. generic COE. In addition, the methods and fundamental understanding developed from this research may support the development and assessment of other complex generics. The approval of a generic COE should improve the availability of this complex drug product to U.S. patients. Graphical Abstract",

We used six RUV models to be tested with 12 real data examples. Each example was first linearized; then, we assessed the agreement in improvement of fit between the base model and its extended models for linearization and conventional analysis, in comparison to residual modeling performance. Afterward, we compared the estimates of parameters’ variabilities and their uncertainties obtained by linearization to conventional analysis. Linearization accurately identified and quantified the nature and magnitude of RUV model misspecification similar to residual modeling. In addition, linearization identified the direction of change and quantified the magnitude of this change in variability parameters and their uncertainties. This method is implemented in the software package PsN for automated model building/evaluation with continuous data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bioequivalence testing is an essential step during the development of generic drugs. Regulatory agencies have drafted recommendations and guidelines to frame this step but without finding any consensus. Different methodologies are applied depending on the geographical region. For instance, in the EU, EMA recommends using average bioequivalence test (ABE), while in the USA, FDA recommends using population bioequivalence (PBE) test. Both methods present some limitations ( e.g. , when batch variability is non-negligible) making it difficult to conclude to equivalence without subsequently increasing the sample size. This article proposes an alternative method to evaluate bioequivalence: between-batch bioequivalence (BBE). It is based on the comparison between the mean difference (Reference − Test) and the Reference between-batch variability. After presenting the theoretical concepts, BBE relevance is evaluated through simulation and real case (nasal spray) studies. Simulation results showed high performance of the method based on false positive and false negative rate estimations (type I and type II errors respectively). Especially, BBE has shown significantly greater true positive rates than ABE and PBE when the Reference residual standard deviation is higher than 15%, depending on the between-batch variability and the number of batches. Finally, real case applications revealed that BBE is more efficient than ABE and PBE to demonstrate equivalence, in some well-known situations where the between-batch variability is not negligible. These results suggest that BBE could be considered as an alternative to the state-of-the-art methods allowing costless development.",
