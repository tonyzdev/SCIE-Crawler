    "abstract": "Malachite green (50 mg/L) was completely decolorized under static anoxic condition within 5 h by bacteria Kocuria rosea MTCC 1532; however decolorization was not observed at shaking condition. K. rosea have also shown decolorization of azo, triphenylmethane and industrial dyes (cotton blue, methyl orange, reactive blue 25, direct blue-6, reactive yellow 81, and red HE4B). Semi-synthetic media containing molasses, urea and sucrose have shown 100, 91, 81% decolorization respectively. Induction in the activities of malachite green reductase and DCIP reductase was observed during MG decolorization suggesting their involvement in the decolorization process. UV-Visible absorption spectrum, HPLC and FTIR analysis showed degradation of MG. Toxicity study revealed the degradation of MG into non-toxic products by K. rosea.",

    "abstract": "Solvothermal synthesis has shown to have a great potential to synthesize Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) with less than 10 nm size. In this study, we present a rapid synthesis of ZnO NPs in which ZnO NPs with more uniform shape and highly dispersed were synthesized using zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 ∙2H 2 O) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a precursor and absolute ethanol as solvent via solvothermal method. Few techniques were exploited to characterize synthesized ZnO NPs including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Synthesized ZnO NPs that were prepared via solvothermal synthesis method at 60 o C for 3 hours exhibited a wurtzite structure with a crystalline size of 10.08 nm and particle size of 7.4 ± 1.2 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectrum has shown peak at 357 nm indicate the presence of ZnO NPs. Hence, better quality with uniform size ZnO NPs can be easily synthesized with reduced amount of time via solvothermal synthesis method rather than using other complicated and lengthy synthesis methods.",

Thermal analysis (TG/DTA) showed that the complexwas easily decomposedinto the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles at low temperature (175 °C) without using any expensive and toxic solvent or a complicated equipment. The obtained product was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Optical and magnetic properties of the products were studied by UV-visible spectroscopy and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively. FT-IR, XRD and EDX analyses confirmed the formation of highly pure spinel-type Co 3 O 4 phase with cubic structure. SEM and TEM images showed that the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles have a sphere-like morphology with an average size of 17.5 nm. The optical absorption spectrum of the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles showed two band gaps of 2.20 and 3.45 eV, which in turn confirmed the semiconducting properties. The magnetic measurement showed a weak ferromagnetic order at room temperature. Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) demonstrated that the as-prepared Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles have good photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation",

    "abstract": "In this work, a fundamental investigation on the removal of methylene blue from aqueous solutions by wheat bran is conducted in batch conditions. Removal kinetic data are determined, and the effects of different experimental parameters, such as wheat bran mass, initial concentration of methylene blue, agitation speed, solution pH, particle size, temperature, and ionic strength on the kinetics of methylene blue removal are investigated. The cationic dye recovery increases with an increase of sorbent mass, solution pH, and temperature. Methylene blue removal decreases with an increase of initial concentration, particle size, and ionic strength. The agitation speed showed a limited influence on the removal kinetics. Modeling of kinetic results shows that sorption process is best described by the pseudo-second order model, with determination coefficients higher than 0.996 under all experimental conditions. The applicability of both internal and external diffusion models shows that liquid-film and particle diffusion are effective sorption mechanisms. The activation energy of sorption calculated using the pseudo-second order rate constants is found to be 13.41 kJ mol –1 from an Arrhenius plot. The low value of the activation energy indicates that sorption is an activated and physical process. Thus, wheat bran, a low cost and easily available biomaterial, can be efficiently used as an excellent sorbent for the removal of dyes from wastewater. It can be safely concluded that wheat bran is much economical, effectual, viable, and can be an alternative to more costly adsorbents.",

    "abstract": "An electrochromic material changes its optical properties in the visible part of the spectrum under a certain applied potential. The change is reversible and the material returns to its original state under the opposite electric field. Recently, electrochromism has been applied in electrochromic devices, where in a battery-like assembly the throughput of solar light is controlled by the voltage and is usually termed a smart window. In the first part of this article a brief theoretical introduction to electrochromism and the functioning of smart windows is given. Since in the last decade nickel oxide has been extensively studied as an ion-storage material in electrochromic devices, some properties of nickel oxide are explained in the following part. The electrochromic response (reversibility during potential switching and the degree of coloration) of a nickel oxide thin film, used in a electrochromic device, strongly depends on the degree of heat treatment. Thermal analysis of thin films can give valuable information about a suitable temperature and the duration of heat-treatment when thin films are prepared by chemical methods of deposition. Since thermal analysis of thin films deposited on a substrate is not a common analytical technique, basic strategies are also summarized in the article. After this theoretical introduction, the application of TG analysis to optimisation of the electrochromic response of sol-gel prepared Ni oxide thin films is presented. The electrochromic properties of thin films, thermally treated to different degrees, were tested using spectroelectrochemical methods. Additional techniques (IR, TEM, AFM and EXAFS) were indispensable in following structural and morphological changes during the heat treatment.",

Spices are used for their flavour and aroma and also for the sensations that they produce; they can be used as colouring as for their nutritional and antioxidant properties. The aim of this work was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of six spices widely used in the Murcia Region (Spain): oregano (Origanum vulgare), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), sage (Salvia officinalis), cumin (Cuminum cyminum) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum L). Essential oils were chemically analysed and identified by GC-MS. The principal components of sage essential oil were camphor (24.95%), 1,8-cineole (24.75%) and camphene (7.63%). Major oil components of oregano included carvacrol (61.21%) and p-cymene (15.12%). The essential oil of thyme was characterized by a high content of terpinen-4-ol (13.15%), γ-terpinene (9.21%) and cis-sabinene hydrate (7.65%). The predominant compounds in clove essential oil were eugenol (85.5%), β-caryophyllene (10.54%) and α-humulene (3.12%) while β-pinene (12.75%), α-pinene (36.42%) and camphor (15.65%) were the main constituents of rosemary essential oil.

Aggregation of AuNPs was induced by desorption of the AFB1 binding aptamer from the surface of AuNPs as a result of the aptamer target interaction leading to the color change of AuNPs from red to purple. The linear range of the colorimetric aptasensor covered a large variation of AFB1 concentration from 80 to 270 nM and the detection limit of 7 nM was obtained. Also, the catalytic activity of the aggregated AuNPs was greatly enhanced by chemiluminescence (CL) reaction, where the detection limit was enhanced to 0.5 nM with a regression coefficient of R 2 = 0.9921. Here we showed that the sensitivity of detection was increased by employing CL and using the catalytic activity of aggregated AuNPs, on the luminol–hydrogen peroxide reaction. Therefore the proposed nanobiosensor was demonstrated to be sensitive, selective, and simple, providing a viable alternative for rapid screening of toxin in foods.",

    "abstract": "A nanoparticle is the simplest structural component due to its nanometer-sized diameter. Nanoparticles are typically atoms or molecules that generate a radius (or diameter) of less than 100 nm when bonded collectively. The latest developments in nanotechnology provide a wide range of methods for studying and monitoring various medical and biological processes at the nanoscale. Nanoparticles can help diagnose and treat diseases, such as cancer, by carrying drugs directly to cancer cells. They can also be used to detect disease biomarkers in the body, helping to provide early diagnosis. It is likely that the data will have a positive effect on biology and medicine. It is plausible that nanoparticles could be used in theranostic applications and targeted drug delivery. This could significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the amount of time, effort, and money needed to diagnose and treat diseases. It could also reduce the side effects of treatments, providing more precise and effective treatments. Nanoparticles for biomedical applications include polymeric and metal nanoparticles; liposomes and micelles; dendrimers and quantum dots; etc. Among the nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles have emerged as a promising platform for drug delivery applications. Gold nanoparticles are highly advantageous for drug delivery applications due to their excellent biocompatibility, stability, and tunable physical and chemical properties. The present review provides an in-depth discussion of the various approaches to gold nanoparticle synthesis and drug delivery applications.",

The pH range of interest was 5.5-9.5 and was controlled by addition of an appropriate phosphate buffer. The temperature of the reaction mixture was controlled in the range 25-80 o C. The rates of production of oxidising species at pH 7 decrease in the following order: Cu(II) > Cr(III) > Co(II) > Fe(III) > Mn(II) > Ni(II), while Cd(II) and Zn(II) did not exhibit any catalytic activity and Ni(II) only led to a significant production of oxidising species at pH > 7.5.

After the water degumming, the amount of phosphorus was reduced to 70.4 mg kg-1 in extracted rapeseed oil and to 60.9 mg kg-1 in pressed one. The residual amount of phosphorus in extracted and pressed sunflower oils was 56.9 mg kg-1 and 50.1 mg kg-1 respectively.

In this paper, the relevance two groups of these compounds (emulsifiers and hydrocolloids) for bakery applications are described. Emulsifiers are commonly added to commercial bakery products to improve bread quality and dough handling characteristics. Some frequently used emulsifiers are diacetyl tartaric acid esters of monodiglycerides and lecithin, which are known as dough improvers, and monoacylglycerols, which are applied as antistaling agents or crumb softeners. Food hydrocolloids are high-molecular weight hydrophylic biopolymers used as functional ingredients in the food industry. In the baked goods, hydrocolloids have been used for retarding the staling and for improving the quality of the fresh products. They help to minimize the negative effects of the freezing and frozen storage. An improvement in wheat dough stability during proofing can be obtained by the addition of sodium alginate, κ- carrageenan and xanthan gum. Carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and alginate can be added as anti-staling agents that retarded crumb firming.",

The elemental and crystalline nature of Ag NPs were confirmed from EDX and XRD analysis. SEM and TEM images showed that the Ag NPswere spherical and with sizes in the range of 25-60 nm.

    "abstract": "In recent years, membrane technology has been widely used in wastewater treatment and water purification. Membrane technology is simple to operate and produces very high quality water for human consumption and industrial purposes. One of the promising technologies for water and wastewater treatment is the application of forward osmosis. Essentially, forward osmosis is a process in which water is driven through a semipermeable membrane from a feed solution to a draw solution due to the osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane. The immediate advantage over existing pressure driven membrane technologies is that the forward osmosis process per se eliminates the need for operation with high hydraulic pressure and forward osmosis has low fouling tendency. Hence, it provides an opportunity for saving energy and membrane replacement cost. However, there are many limitations that still need to be addressed. Here we briefly review some of the applications within water purification and new developments in forward osmosis membrane fabrication.",

The results showed that the AV 17 adsorption capacity was positively correlated to the BET surface area. The best fit of kinetic data to pseudo-second-order kinetic was determined. The adsorption follows both the Langmuir and Temkin isotherms. The Langmuir adsorption capacity was determined to be 26.455 mg/g at the initial dye concentration of 160 mg/L. The endothermic nature of adsorption was confirmed by the acquired thermodynamic data. Maximum desorption of 97.33% was achieved in 0.2 M NaOH for AAPS in the first cycle.

Effects of solvents, temperatures (25, 55 and 90 °C) and times (5 and 10 min) were evaluated with regard to total phenols (TP), total flavonoids (TF) and phenolic compound contents. Tomato peel extracts contain high amounts of kaemferol-3- O -rutinoside (8.5 to 142.5 mg kg -1 ), p -coumaric acid (3 to 111.5 mg kg -1 ) and chlorogenic acid derivative (10.5 to 109 mg kg -1 ). Results revealed that extraction time has no significant ( p > 0.05) influence on TP, TF and phenolic compounds recovery (exception is cis - p -coumaric acid hexoside). On the other hand, the influence of temperature and chosen solvent on polyphenols yield is significant. Considering interest of consumers to intake natural compounds exhibiting antioxidant properties, this work suggests that tomato peel waste can be used as one of sustainable resources for polyphenols production by MAE.",

Photocatalytic degradation of the dyes was monitored under simulated visible light using pristine TiO 2 , C/S/doped-TiO 2 and Fe 3+ /C/S doped-TiO 2 with varying concentrations of Fe 3+ . The influence of catalyst doping, solution pH, and light intensity were also examined. Doping TiO 2 with Fe 3+ /C/S caused reduction in its band gap value with the resultant improvement in its visible light activity. The photocatalytic efficiency of the catalysts are given as follows: TiO 2 < C/S/TiO 2 < Fe 3+ /C/S-TiO 2 with Fe 3+ /C/S-TiO 2 (0.3 % Fe 3+ ) as the best performing photocatalyst. The monoazo dye experienced higher degradation efficiency than the diazo dye. Degradation of the azo dyes was observed to decrease with increasing pH from 3 to 12. Increased visible light intensity enhanced the photodegradation efficiency of the dye. Dye decolourization was observed to be faster than its mineralization.",

The order of efficiency is attributed, among other factors, to their ability to produce HO. radicals. Various anions are shown to exhibit an inhibitory effect in the order: I->Br->F->Cl->SO42->NO3-. The inhibitory effect of Cl- is observed at higher concentrations than F- and Br-, even though I- displays inhibition at all concentrations.

The value of separation factor, RL, from Langmuir equation and Freundlich constant, n, give an indication of favourable adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity qm based on Langmuir model was found to be 294-303 mg/g at 25 °C, is in good agreement with the experimental values.",

    "abstract": "In this work, graphene oxide/Co3O4 nanocomposite was synthesized via hydrothermal decomposition of [Co(en)3] (NO3)3 complex onto graphene oxide nanosheets. The as-prepared nanocomposite (denoted as GO/Co3O4) was structurally characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopies (TEM and SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, magnetic measurements, and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The results demonstrated successful immobilization of Co3O4 nanoparticles with an average diameter size of around 12.5 nm on the surface of graphene oxide nanosheets. The adsorption performance of GO/Co3O4 nanocomposite was investigated towards different organic dyes in aqueous solutions. The results displayed that the adsorption rate of the GO/Co3O4 nanocomposite was 98% for methylene blue (MB) in 12 min, and 66% and 45% for Rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) in 40 min, respectively. The effects of various important parameters including adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH, and temperature on the adsorption process were investigated in detail. The equilibrium adsorption data were better fitted by Langmuir isotherm. Adsorption kinetics is well-modeled using pseudo-second-order model. Different thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was physisorption and spontaneous. The findings of the present work highlighted facile fabrication of GO/Co3O4 and its application for rapid and efficient removal of MB from wastewater.",

The FTIR analysis of the adsorbent suggested the occurrence of interaction between the carboxyl group on oak shell modified magnetic nanoparticles (OSMMN) surface and Ni (II). Also, the morphology and size of the adsorbent were observed by SEM and TEM. Additionally, the effect of different parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, solution pH and initial concentration of nickel (II) ions were investigated on the adsorption of nickel. The adsorption experiments showed that the maximum Ni(II) adsorption was obtained as contact time=15 min, temperature=25 o C, adsorbent dosage=2.6 g/L, and pH=4.5. In these conditions, 93.88 % Ni(II) was removed from aqueous solution. Moreover, in order to study equilibrium behavior of adsorption, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were applied. The results showed that the experimental data were fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model, and the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent using Langmuir model was determined to be 454.54 mg/g which was a considerable amount.",

This material, which is well known to offer an interesting combination of an alloying and conversion mechanism, is capable of accommodating nine equivalents of lithium per unit formula, resulting in a high specific capacity (≥ 1,000 mAh g -1 ). The resulting composite anode material displayed a stable capacity of ca. 1,091 mAh g -1 for 190 cycles at a medium de-lithiation potential of 1.7 V and at a charge/discharge rate of 1C. Furthermore, the material displays an excellent high rate capability up to 20C, displaying a reversible capacity of still 216 mAh g -1 . Studies on Fe and Zn losses of the ZnFe 2 O 4 active material by dissolution in the electrolyte were performed and compared to those of silicon-, germanium and tin-based high-capacity anode materials. In conclusion, ion dissolution from metal containing anode materials should not be underestimated in view of its impact on the overall cell performance and cycling stability.",

Corrosion protection is a necessity which enables the safe and well-functioning of metal structures and devices. In addition to long-term efficiency, corrosion protection should be environmentally and economically acceptable. Growing population with needs on modern and high-tech technologies is boosting consumption of base and rare earth metals. All these issues are putting high demands on area of corrosion protection with the main goal to prolong the life-time of metal materials, reduce the need for steeply increasing production and thus preserve resources. In this review contemporary modes of corrosion protection of metal materials with the emphasis on copper and aluminium base alloys as one of most important base metals are presented.

The performance and inhibition mechanism of compound L against the corrosion of carbon steel in 1 M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4 were studied by the weight loss method and by electrochemical techniques (Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)). Outcome data obtained from these methods displayed that with increasing the concentration of compound L, its inhibition efficacy (η %) increases and reached 82.85% at 1 × 10–2 M, 25 °C using weight loss method.

    "abstract": "Almost hundred years old concepts on hydrogen bonding are brought into light to be compared to the contemporary views and theories. The first findings were based on qualitative grounds and relied upon observations of simple experiments and very much on human imagination. It is a challenge to contrast the old and new views and to see if they could be verified or revised. Over the last decades there has been tremendous development of methods for structure elucidation and many hydrogen bonded molecular structures were determined and deposited in structural data bases. The structural aspect of hydrogen bond in the solid state is well defined. However, the knowledge of hydrogen bonded structures in the liquid state is still limited. Studies on hydrogen bond dynamics, which are in progress, with new experimental methods will help to better understand processes in solutions. In many systems the functioning of hydrogen bonding at atomic level has been still an enigma. In biological reactions the proton transfer is a key issue of acid-base enzyme catalysis and ribozymic function, transport reactions such as water wires functioning through the membrane protein channels and photosynthetic reaction centres. The paramount example for the unique role of the proton in specificity and rates is the storage life's genetic information: hydrogen bonds define the complementarities of G with C and A with T whereas the hydrogen transfer controls the genetic mutations. Ultra-fast time-resolved spectroscopies of hydrogen bonds and proton-transfer processes accompanied by very sophisticated theoretical frameworks such as multidimensional quantum dynamics and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics are offering new insights into functioning of hydrogen bond.",

LEL describes well the properties which are well accounted by the majority of the selected molecular descriptors: octane number MON, entropy S, volume MV, or refraction MR, particularly the acentric factor AF parameter, but also more difficult properties like boiling point, melting point and logP. LEL is the best correlated with the WK (Wiener-type number, taken the reciprocal of entries in the combinatorial Dp matrix, of higher rank, calculated by TOPOCLUJ software) indices. In a second set of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, LEL was proved to be as good as the Randi} χ index (a connectivity index) and better than the Wiener index (a distance based index). In addition, it is well defined mathematically and shows interesting relations in particular classes of graphs, these recommending LEL as a new, powerful topological index. The actual study proved the considered TIs are basic topological descriptors in prediction of various molecular properties, with good perspective in QSPR/QSAR studies.",

The effects of operational parameters such as aquatic plant quantity, initial dye concentration, initial pH of the solutions and temperature of the medium were studied in order to determine the optimum phytoremediation conditions. The plant's photosynthetic pigments were determined quantitatively in order to detect the plant's response to abiotic stress. During the phytoremediation experiments the parallel sub-processes (phytosorption, phytoextraction, phytodegradation) were observed and analysed. The mechanisms of phytoremediation were studied using Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, thin layer chromatography and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Results show that the plant tolerated high concentrations (300 mg/L) of dyes, and was able to remove from the environment and accumulate in its cells the dyes up to a significant percentage (crystal violet was removed by about 80% and malachite green by 90%).",

The reason is gas-particle partitioning (GPP) in the aerosol, its sensitivity to temperature and particulate phase composition, and sampling artefacts', and reactivity's sensitivities towards particulate phase composition. Furthermore, most PAHs are subject to re-volatilisation upon deposition to surfaces (multihopping). Levels and sources of 2-6-ring unsubstituted PAHs were studied in remote environments of Europe, Africa and Antarctica. Global atmospheric transport and fate of 3-5-ring PAHs were simulated under various scenarios of photochemistry and GPP. GPP influences drastically the atmospheric lifetime, compartmental distributions and the LRTP of PAH. Mid latitude emissions seem to reach the Arctic but not the Antarctic.",

The as-prepared P 2 W 18 @MIL-101(Cr) nanohybrid was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, EDX, SEM, zeta potential measurements and BET surface area. The results demonstrated the successful loading of K 6 P 2 W 18 O 62 (~36 wt.%) into porous MIL-101(Cr) framework . Compared with the pristine MIL-101(Cr), the encapsulated sample demonstrated a significant decrease in both surface area and pore volume owing to the insertion of large Dowson-type POM into the cages of MOF. The resulting P 2 W 18 @MIL-101(Cr) was applied as a new adsorbent to remove methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) organic dyes from aqueous solutions. The effect of effective parameters such as adsorbent dosage, dye concentration, pH, and the temperature was studied on the dye removal process. Furthermore, the selective adsorption of the nanohybrid was investigated towards MB/MO, MB/RhB, MO/RhB and MB/MO/RhB mixed dye solutions. The nanohybrid showed rapid and selective adsorption for cationic MB and RhB dyes from mixed dye solutions. The results indicated that the dye adsorption followed Langmuir isotherm. The thermodynamic data showed that the adsorption is an endothermic process. This nanohybrid can function as a recyclable efficien adsorbent for the rapid removal of various cationic textile dyes from aqueous solutions.",

    "abstract": "Museums and galleries house increasingly large collections of objects and contemporary art made of plastic materials, many of which undergo rapid material change. The main degradation processes of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) are elimination of HCl and plasticizer migration or leaching. This results in visible discolouration, stickiness and cracking. Degradation is known to be a multi-stage process that includes HCl elimination, formation of conjugated polyenes and cross-linking. Elimination of HCl begins due to structural irregularities (allylic and tertiary chlorides) and results in the formation of polyenes. When at least 7 conjugated double bonds are present, discolouration of PVC becomes visible. Non-invasive techniques, such as IR and Raman spectroscopy are used for polymer identification and plasticizer quantification. Plasticizer degradation and particularly the late stages of PVC degradation can be investigated using SEC, GC-MS, TGA and DSC. Studies in heritage collections have revealed that, apart from HCl, PVC objects emit 2-ethylhexanol and other volatile degradation products, however, there is currently no indication that HCl is emitted at usual indoor conditions. There seems to be a general lack of systematic research into PVC degradation at the conditions of storage and display, which could result in the development of dose-response functions and in the development of preventive conservation guidelines for the management of PVC collections.",

Besides, the possibility was examined of determining DON on the basis of the ratio of ATR signals at 1709 cm– 1 and 1743 cm– 1. Reference measurements were performed by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The concentration range for contaminated samples was 2.51– 12.14 mg/kg. Classification efficiency was 100% for ATR spectra, whereas DR spectra did not show so obvious clustering of contaminated and blank samples. The ATR technique appeared advantageous owing to its easier use and interpretation of results, which were better in respect of classification and quantification. Quantification using partial least squares (PLS1) regression, as well as multiple linear regression (MLR) showed good correlation with DON reference data for the mentioned wheat genotype.",

Addition of apple fibr e powder up to 10 % is feasible to produce sensorically acceptable cookies. In generally, it c an be stated that enrichment of cookies with apple fibre powder is advantageous due to the incre ased nutritional value, as apple fibre is rich source of dietary fibre.",

    "abstract": "The brewery spent grain (BSG) represents approximately 85% of the total quantity of by-products from the brewing industry. The biogas production from the BSG has been the subject of several studies in recent years, due to relatively high energy consumption in the brewing process and due to the increasing energy costs. The biodegradability of raw and pre-treated BSG in a single-stage and two-stage solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) system was determined in this study. The results show that the BSG have a biogas potential of 120 L/kg. In the single-stage system, the biogas yield obtained from raw BSG (87.4 L/kg) was almost equal to the yield obtained from the pre-treated BSG (89.1 L/kg), while the methane yield was 51.9 and 55.3 L/kg and the biodegradation was 62.0% and 62.2% for raw and pre-treated BSG, respectively. In two-stage SS-AD the pre-treated BSG showed better results, with the biogas yield of 103.2 L/kg and the biodegradation of 73.6%, while the biogas yield obtained from raw BSG was 89.1 L/kg, with the biodegradation of 63.5%. In two-stage process the obtained methane yields from raw and pre-treated BSG were identical (58.7 L/kg).",

During this period performance of the fuel cell improves until it reaches its nominal performance. The exact mechanism of this initial conditioning is not completely understood, but it is assumed that during the conditioning process the polymer membrane, as well as the polymer in the catalyst layer, get humidified, and the number of active catalyst sites increases. Activation procedure proposed here consists of temperature and potential cycling. Temperature cycling is a new approach for the conditioning and the idea is to rapidly cool the running cell at some point to allow the membrane to equilibrate with condensed water which should result in higher intake of water within the membrane. The results show that proposed procedure is better or at least comparable to some conventional procedures for the initial conditioning.",

The results obtained from the experimental work indicate that investigated fruit powders without or with minimal addition of maltodextrin can be produced. Additionally, it was observed that an increase in process temperature results in a higher loss of colour, antioxidant activity and intensity of the flavour profile.",

The aim was to compare the degradation efficiencies of the studied catalysts for decolorization of methylene blue solution as the model organic pollutant. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the optimal operational conditions for magnetite/H2O2 and goethite/H2O2 systems. The [H2O2] of 0.2 M, catalyst dosage of 1 g/L, pH 9.0 and reaction time of 5h were chosen by RSM. The pH value of 3.0 was used in the case of Fe+2/H2O2 system. The experimental results showed that homogeneous Fenton oxidation system was the most effective system under both acidic and neutral conditions but decreased at pH value of 9.0 due to the decrease in available Fe2+ ions in the solution and generation of ferric hydroxide sludge. Fe3O4/H2O2 system represented better removal efficiency than FeO(OH)/H2O2 system that could be attributed to the presence of FeII cations in magnetite structure and its larger surface area.",

Due to being sustainable energy source and environmental friendly, bioethanol production from algae is becoming increasingly popular all over the world. However, yield of bioethanol production from algae is lower than first generation feedstock's currently, and needs to be improved. In order to increase bioethanol yield, pre-treatments should be performed as cell disruption process on algal biomass. For this reason, researchers investigate the most appropriate pre-treatment method and its parameters for high yield bioethanol production from algae. In this study, cultivated Chlorella minutissima was utilized for bioethanol production. Effects of pre-treatment method (dilute acid and alkaline), chemical concentration, pre-treatment temperature and pre-treatment time on bioethanol yield were investigated. It was found that, the highest bioethanol yield was obtained as 18.52% with acid pre-treatment at pre-treatment temperature of 100°C and pre-treatment time of 60 minutes.",

The sensing layer is deposited on an interdigitated (IDT) structure, comprising a Si substrate, a SiO 2 layer, and IDT electrodes. The structure exhibits good RH sensitivity when varying RH from 0% up to 90%, either in humid nitrogen or in a humid air environment. The conductivity of the sensing layer decreases, while the RH level increases. During the interaction with the water molecules (acting as electron donors), the number of holes will decrease and oxidized single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs), considered normally p -type semiconductor, will become more resistive. The sensing mechanism is explained in terms of the Hard Soft Acid Base (HSAB) paradigm, building on the fact that water molecules are hard bases, while oxidized carbon nanohorns can be virtually assimilated with hard acids.",

Batch kinetic studies showed that CeO 2 /AC is the most efficient adsorbent with an equilibrium time of 10 minutes that was needed to obtain adsorption capacity of 52.68 mg/g. CO 2 adsorption at 30 °C exhibits the optimum temperature with only 6.53% loss in adsorption capacity after 5 cycles of CO 2 adsorption-desorption. The CeO 2 on AC was detected through X-ray diffraction and the scanning electron microscope image shows well-distributed CeO 2 particles on AC surfaces. CO 2 adsorption at 30 °C is best fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetics with R 2 = 0.9994 and the relative error between calculated and experimental adsorption capacity only 1.32%. The adsorption considering chemisorption is responsible for improving adsorption capacity. The addition of CeO 2 on AC enhanced the adsorption capacity by providing active sites to attract CO 2 .",

Electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN) was applied to deposit copper on a gold electrode by using controlled potential or controlled current deposition method. It was found that deposition of copper was better using controlled potential technique. The process of film formation on copper plated on gold was studied in 3 % sodium chloride in the absence and presence of ATA or BTAH.

The experimental determination of the crystal structure of the compound has been achieved using X-ray diffraction data. The important characteristic of the structure is the existence of a dihedral angle formed by the benzene and thiazolidinone rings being equal to 86.0° indicating an absence of π–π stacking as well as that the structure is non planar. In the crystal, the molecules are linked by C–H···O and C–H···N hydrogen bonds, these bonds being responsible for the three-dimensional molecular structure packing. In order to compare the experimental results with those of the theoretical calculation, quantum chemical DFT calculations were carried out using B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) basis set.

Extracts have been acquired using conventional extraction techniques and extraction with supercritical fluids (SCFs). The effect of extraction method and experimental parameters (time, pressure, temperature and solvent mixture) mostly believed to affect the extraction process was undertaken. The quantitative parameters studied are: total phenolic compounds, proanthocyanin content, and the phenolic constituent profile. The qualitative parameter analyzed is antioxidant capacity. The results demonstrate that the contents of the major constituents significantly varied among the different types of materials. The highest content of total phenolics was determined in the extract from the white grape skin, macerated with MeOH (26.7 mg GA/g extract), and similar, 25.6 mg GA/g extract in the MeOH extract attained by Soxhlet. Ellagic acid (0.650 mg/100 g extract), catechin (0.164 mg/100 g extract), gallic acid (0.133 mg/100 g extract) as well as caffeic acid (0.038 mg/100 g extract) are the major compounds present in the rosehip extracts attained by maceration using MeOH as solvent. The presence of epictechin, hesperidin/neohesperidin, rutin, and chlorogenic acid was also confirmed. Aspects of each type of processing were correlated with the chemistry of the material. The obtained extracts could be used as natural bioactive compounds in several industrial applications.",

Chromatographic behavior of these ionizable compounds highly depends on the interactions with the solvent as confirmed experimentally and by calculation of distribution of this species as a function of pH. Chromatograms show the optimal separation of five purine (uric acid, hypoxanthine, xanthine, adenine, and guanosine), and four pyrimidine (cytosine, uracil, cytidine and tymine) bases at pH around four. Accordingly, acetate buffer was selected due to high buffer capacity in this region. By variation of pH, concentration of buffer and volume ratio between buffer and methanol, we found that a mixture of 50 mM acetate buffer of pH 4.0 ± 0.1 with 3 % of methanol ensures reproducibility, complete separation in less than 15 minutes and compatibility with MS detection. Developed method was validated and applied for the analysis of complex clinical and beverage samples.",

Impedance measurements on different oxides ((La,Sr)FeO 3- d = LSF, Sr(Ti,Fe)O 3- d = STF, and Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 = PZT) are presented, and demonstrate how the chemical capacitance may affect impedance spectra in different types of electrochemical cells.

    "abstract": "A great number of pollution problems come as a result of the emission of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) into the environment and their control becomes a serious challenge for the global chemical industry. Adsorption is a widely used technique for the removal of VOCs due to its high efficiency, low cost, and convenient operation. In this study, the feasibility to use a locally available clay, as adsorbent material to control VOCs emissions is evaluated. Natural clay is characterised by different physical-chemical methods and adsorptive interaction features between VOCs and natural clay are identified. Toluene (T), methanol (M) and benzaldehyde (B) are used here as representatives of three different kinds of VOCs. Adsorption isotherms onto natural clay and faujasite-Y type zeolite (Fau Y) are obtained at room temperature. According to Langmuir model data, maximum adsorption capacities ( q m ) of Fez natural clay and zeolite toward methanol (M), toluene (T) and benzaldehyde (B) at 300 K are 8, 0.89 and 3.1 mmol g -1 , and 15, 1.91 and 13.9 mmol g -1 respectively. In addition, the effect of temperature on the adsorption of toluene onto natural clay is evaluated in the range from 300 to 323K. An increase on temperature reduces the adsorption capacity of natural clay toward toluene, indicating that an exothermic physical adsorption process takes place. The enthalpy of adsorption of toluene onto Fez natural clay was found to be -54 kJ mol -1 . A preliminary cost analysis shows that natural clay could be used as an alternative low cost adsorbent in the control of VOCs from contaminated gas streams with a cost of US$ 0.02 kg -1 compared to Fau Y zeolite with US$ 10 kg -1 .",

According to literature, 100 000 different dyes are used worldwide in the printing, food and textile industries. Remazol Brilliant Violet-5R belongs to the group of azo dyes used in the textile industry. The purpose of this paper is to study the removal of anionic dye RBV-5R using calcined eggshell. We investigated the effect of initial dye concentration (20-100 mg/L RBV-5R), biomass amount, contact time, temperature, and pH on the adsorption process. We calculated the amounts of adsorbed material in equilibrium and the efficiency of the adsorption process. Various studies were performed on the adsorption process and the adsorbent morphology (EDX, SEM, FTIR, Raman), as well as isotherm (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich), kinetic and diffusion models were used to characterize the process. Calcined eggshell was also characterized by thermogravimetric, BET surface methods. Based on the results obtained, it can be said that the calcined eggshell can be used effectively to remove the dye from the aqueous solution.",

The 96-h LC50 value of Thmx was calculated as 8.95 mg active ingredient L–1. As the dose of Thmx increased, oxidative stress was induced by the inhibition/activation of antioxidant enzymes, while the activities of acetylcholinesterase, carboxylesterase and adenosinetriphosphatases were inhibited.

It is essential for formulation scientists to identify strategies to improve the solubility and dissolution rate of candidate drugs in order to improve their bioavailability. The present study investigated electrospun polymeric nanofibers for efavirenz, a Class II drug in the Biopharmaceutical Classification System. In order to fabricate nanofibers, hydrophilic spinnable polymer like Soluplus was used. Statistical design of experiments was used to optimize electrospinning parameters. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies confirmed the presence of nanofibrous material in the mat. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies advocated the amorphization of efavirenz in the nanofiber samples. The nanofiber-based platform significantly improved in vitro dissolution of efavirenz compared to pure efavirenz crystals.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome P450, nitric oxide synthase, and chloroperoxidase are typical thiolate-heme enzymes, in which heme iron coordinated with the cysteine thiolate activates molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. A new group of thiolate-heme proteins is becoming recognized. In these proteins, termed heme-responsive/sensing proteins, or simply heme-sensor proteins, the thiolate-heme iron has a sensor function. All known heme-sensor proteins use a cysteine residue to bind heme. The first question is why cysteine is employed in this capacity. Ligation of heme with thiolate, the presence of redox-dependent ligand switches, fast heme dissociation rates from the heme-sensor proteins, and formation of 5-coordinated NO-Fe(II) heme complexes, appear to be common characteristics of heme-sensor proteins. The Cys-Pro (CP) motif may also be important for heme binding in some heme-sensor proteins. In this minireview, we summarize the inorganic and physicochemical characters of heme-sensor proteins, and include short comments on heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), and neuronal PAS protein 2 (NPAS2), under study in our laboratory over the last several years. Some gas-sensing heme-sensor proteins, with thiolate-heme complexes, will also be briefly discussed.",

In particular, conversion of organic substrates to hydrogen via dark fermentation process is of great interest. The aim of this study was fermentative hydrogen production using anaerobic mixed culture using different carbon sources (mono and disaccharides) and further optimization by varying a number of operating parameters (pH value, temperature, organic loading, mixing intensity). Among all tested mono- and disaccharides, glucose was shown as the preferred carbon source exhibiting hydrogen yield of 1.44 mol H2/mol glucose. Further evaluation of selected operating parameters showed that the highest hydrogen yield (1.55 mol H2/mol glucose) was obtained at the initial pH value of 6.4, T=37 °C and organic loading of 5 g/L. The obtained results demonstrate that lower hydrogen yield at all other conditions was associated with redirection of metabolic pathways from butyric and acetic (accompanied by H2 production) to lactic (simultaneous H2 production is not mandatory) acid production. These results therefore represent an important foundation for the optimization and industrial-scale production of hydrogen from organic substrates.",

Altogether 332 eight-grade students were involved in the investigation, with an average age of 14.2 years. Students were videotaped during chemistry lessons, and their worksheets were collected afterward. The 12 chemistry teachers, who conducted lessons in these schools, were interviewed before the lessons; their teaching plans were also collected.

The results indicate that many teachers in Slovenian primary schools are not fully aware of the potential of experimental work integrated into chemistry lessons for the development of students' experimental competence. Further research of the value of different kinds of training to support teachers for the use of experimental work in chemistry teaching is needed.",

    "abstract": "Borax sludge is the waste produced by a trommel sieve in the borax production process and is used as an adsorbent for Cr(III) removal. The effects of various parameters, including pH, initial Cr(III) concentration and contact time were investigated for batch adsorption of Cr(III). The experimental results obtained were applied to different adsorption isotherms and kinetic models. The results indicated that the Temkin isotherm (R2 = 0.9749) was most suitable to explain the adsorption characteristics of borax sludge, and the removal of Cr(III) was achieved by a physisorption process. The overall kinetic data fitted the pseudo-second order rate model (R2 = 0.9990). According to thermodynamic studies, which were carried out at different temperatures, changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) values for Cr(III) adsorption by borax sludge were determined to be 69.395 kJ/mol and 0.276 kJ/mol K, respectively. The study implied that borax sludge could be used as an alternative adsorbent in the adsorption of Cr(III) from aqueous solutions.",

    "abstract": "Most industrial waste discharges are often contaminated with phenolic compounds, which constitute a major source of water pollution owing to their toxicity and low biodegradability. Development of cost-effective treatment of such industrial wastewater is therefore of paramount importance. Towards this end, we explore the efficacy of Pine bark powder (PBP), which is an agricultural solid waste material, as a low-cost biosorbent without any pre-treatment, for the adsorptive removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) from aqueous media. The PBP was thoroughly characterized and the effect of important adsorption parameters were examined in the present investigation. The batch equilibrium data were analyzed using well-known isotherm models. Freundlich isotherm model provided the best description of the equilibrium biosorption behavior. At 25 ± 1°C, the maximum biosorption capacity ( q max ) was 289.09 mg/g, which is higher than most biosorbents reported in the literature while the removal as high as 97% was obtained. Moreover, the biosorption process was fast, attaining equilibrium in less than 120 min of contact. The Elovich model accurately described the kinetics data. In view of high biosorption capacity and fast removal rates, PBP can be used for an efficient and cost-effective treatment of 2,4,6-TCP contaminated wastewater.",

The ZnO-PMMA nanocomposites were prepared by adding the appropriate amount of ZnO into MMA and subsequent MMA radical polymerization. According to the experimental results and model-free isoconversional activation energy calculations, the addition of ZnO into PMMA played a double role. The ZnO concentrations up to 0.15% stabilized the composite by shifting the degradation interval toward higher temperatures and increasing the apparent activation energy relative to pure PMMA. At higher concentrations, the catalytic effect of ZnO started to prevail and was reflected in the lower temperature intervals of intense PMMA degradation and lower apparent activation energy. The addition of ZnO generally did not change the nature of the PMMA decomposition process.",

It is often assumed that these visualizations support students’ understanding and enable them to solve problems more efficiently. The research presented here investigates students’ use of an explanatory key while solving tasks based on submicroscopic representations. The following features of the explanatory key were examined: 1) colored versus black-and-white, and 2) pictorial versus textual. Eye-fixation patterns and students’ verbal explanations indicated that the presence of color in the key does not influence students’ task solving. However, significant differences were observed with regard to a textual versus pictorial key used in the tasks: students spent more time and fixated more frequently on the key while solving tasks using a textual key in comparison to a pictorial key. The results indicate that the type of explanatory key might play an important role in revealing students’ representational competence with regard to submicroscopic representations.",

Adsorption isotherms of the process were studied by the ARIAN model and analysis of obtained data showed that there were two kinds of adsorption sites on the surface of Mg-Al-LDH. Results of instrumental analysis showed that these adsorption sites were –OH groups located on the surface of mesopores and micropores of adsorbent and were named MP and 003 sites, respectively. The kinetic data were studied by the KASRA model and ISO and intraparticle diffusion (pore-diffusion) equations which showed that CR molecules were adsorbed at first on the MP sites. Also, during the adsorption of CR on MP sites the interaction of CR with adsorbent surface was rate-controlling step. Furthermore, during CR adsorption on 003 sites, adsorption kinetics was diffusion-controlled.",

Suberin containing mainly bifunctional fatty acids can theoretically form a three dimensional network in the presence of glycerol, which is also found in green but not in white cotton. How this three-dimensional network influences the structure of the individual crystallites of cotton cellulose was investigated in this research. To confirm the presence of suberin in the green cotton fibre, infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed. According to the results of infrared spectroscopy, it was found, that O6 - H … Obridge bond which is normally found in cellulose I, is missing at the spectrum of green cotton. Additionally, two bands at 700 cm -1 and at 1201 cm -1 due to the OH - in plane bending appeared. To get a clear picture concerning the structural differences between the green cotton and the other types, the X-ray diffraction measurements and iodine absorption were carried out. According to the results we found out, that the presence of suberin does not influence the structure of the individual crystallites but hinders the development of the crystallites in the green cotton fibres.",

    "abstract": "Modification of polypropylene (PP) with wollastonite fillers was investigated in this paper. Three types of different silane pretreated wollastonite mineral filler were used for preparation of binary PP/wollastonite composites. The composite samples were homogenized in a Brabender Plasti-Corder kneading chamber and compression moulded into plates on a laboratory press. The adhesion between the wollastonite fillers used in this study and the PP matrix was predicted on the basis of the calculated adhesion parameters (work of adhesion, interfacial free energy and spreading coefficient) obtained by the surface free energy of pure materials. The contact angle method was used to determine surface free energy of components. The obtained values of adhesion parameters at the interface in the composites were correlated with mechanical properties as well as morphology observations of corresponding composites and were proved to be in relatively good agreement with the mechanical property measurements. Stronger adhesion in investigated composites has reflected in higher yield stress and tensile strength at break but in lower elongation at break and impact resistance.",

As samples differ in their sugar content considerably, the influence of sugars on derivatization was investigated using two internal standards: (i) primary AA norvaline and (ii) secondary AA sarcosine, in real samples and in model fructose and glucose solutions. A strong matrix effect was observed, especially when concentrations of sugars exceeded 50 g/L. The influence of sugars on derivatization of secondary AA sarcosine was more pronounced than on the primary AA norvaline. For quantitative evaluation of AA in samples with variable but high sugar content we propose to use external calibration in combination with internal standard method, where the response factors for individual AA are corrected with respect to that of internal standards.",

    "abstract": "An improved decolorization method for measuring the antioxidant activity of food samples using N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD) is developed. DMPD radical cation (DMPD° + ) is generated through a reaction between DMPD and potassium persulfate and is subsequently reduced in the presence of hydrogen-donating antioxidants. This assay has a clear edge over the previous DMPD assay (the DMPD/FeCl 3 assay) for the determination of antioxidant activity on a number of counts. The chemistry involves the generation of a more stable DMPD radical mono-cation by a reaction with potassium persulfate. The DMPD radical cation generator does not involve Fe(II) ions, which through Fenton's Reaction could cause negative deviation in the antioxidant activity of food extracts. The assay can equally be applied to the determination of antioxidant capacity of both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. The experimental procedure is rapid, inexpensive and ensures sensitivity along with reproducibility in the measurement of antioxidant activity of hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds and thus has a promising aspect of use in screening large number of fruit samples. The effectiveness of new DMPD decolorization assay was verified by evaluating the antioxidant capacity of different fruit samples.",

The oils were found to be rich in neutral lipids (95.2 and 94.7% of total lipids) and low in polar lipids (3.7 and 3.6% of total lipids) for A. indicum and A. muticum respectively. GC-MS data showed that the main fatty acid was linoleic acid in both the species. Total phenolic compounds in each sample were determined according to Follin-Ciocalteu’s method as, 13.770 and 38.815 mg/g of oil, respectively. Total antioxidant activity of both oils was checked by ABTS, FRAP, DPPH and oleic acid peroxidation methods. These methods indicated the presence of both the slow reacting and fast reacting components in the seed oils of both the herbs. The seed oil of Abutilon indicum and Abutilon muticum showed broad spectrum activity as they were active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The findings reveal seeds of Abutilon species, indigenous to Pakistan to be potentially valuable herb for oil production, delivery of drugs and cosmetic active ingredients.",

Plasma trans-activation response element (TAR) RNA has been suggested as one of the possible biomarkers. TAR RNA is produced during non-processive transcription in HIV-1 productively infected and latent T cells. Here, plasma samples and paired exosome samples of 55 subjects from the observational SCOPE cohort were analysed for the presence of TAR RNA. First, a PCR-based assay was optimized, which provided 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in differentiating HIV-1 infected non-controllers from uninfected individuals. Next, TAR RNA was detected in the plasma of 63% of aviremic HIV-1-infected patients, who were either treated with antiretroviral therapy or were elite controllers. Although TAR RNA levels did not correlate with patient gender, age, CD4 levels, CD8 levels, they tended to correlate with CD4/CD8 ratio (P = 0.047). This study is the first to investigate plasma TAR RNA in a relatively large cohort of HIV-1-infected patients. We additionally show that the TAR RNA molecules in the plasma of aviremic patients are not limited to exosomes.",

Electrochemical measurements and long-term immersion tests were performed on iron in NaCl solution, whilst computational study explicitly addresses the molecular level details of the bonding on iron surface by means of density functional theory calculations (DFT). Experimental data were the basis for the determination of inhibition efficiency and mechanism. Mercapto group has a beneficial effect on corrosion inhibition at all studied inhibitor concentrations, whereas the beneficial effect of methyl group is smaller and most pronounced around 1mM concentration. The latter is in stark contrast with the behaviour found previously on copper, where the effect of methyl group was detrimental. Explicit DFT calculations reveal that methyl-group has a negligible effect on the inhibitor–surface interaction. In contrast, the presence of mercapto group involves the strong S–surface bonding and consequently the adsorption of inhibitors with mercapto group is found to be more exothermic.",

The graphene oxide (GO) was functionalized with 9-aminoanthracene and produced graphene oxide-9-aminoanthracene (GO-9-AA). FTIR, XRD, TGA, TEM and Raman spectroscopy techniques were used for characterization of the adsorbents. Adsorption of naphthalene (NAP), acenaphthylene (ACN), and phenanthrene (PHN) as a model of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was investigated by GO-9-AA. The adsorbent showed excellent removal efficiency towards PAHs from aqueous solution. Equilibrium data of the adsorption process were successfully fitted with Freundlich model from single solute system, and the maximum adsorption capacities followed the order of NAP > ACN >PHN. The kinetic analysis revealed that the overall adsorption process was fast and successfully fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The anthracene ring makes GO-9-AA π-electron rich, thus facilitating π-π EDA interaction between NAP, ACN and PHN with GO-9-AA.",

The statistical parameters of the generated model are excellent: Q2 = 0.708, R2 = 0.997. The external validation results were (r2 0 = 0.922, K= 1.016, R2 pred = 0.674, r2 m= 0.778) indicating that the constructed model has good predictive power. Based on the contour map of the CoMFA model, we were able to propose six novel compounds with higher neuraminidase inhibitory activity than the most active compound. The six proposed molecules were submitted to molecular docking to analyse the bindings formed between the newly designed molecules and the neuraminidase. All of the proposed molecules were found to be more stable on the active site of neuraminidase than the reference molecule (1SJ). SwissADME was used to estimate the pharmacokinetic properties of each proposed molecule, while ProToxII and VEGA QSAR were used to investigate any potential toxicity. Finally, a reaction mechanism for synthesizing the six proposed compounds was described, which could potentially be explored further in the search for novel neuraminidase inhibitors. In conclusion, this study has identified potential candidates for the development of more effective neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza.",

The complete conversion into oxons was noticed within five minutes in case of NBS, a partial conversion in case of sodium hypochlorite, and no oxo-products were observed using other oxidants. Since the NBS is efficient in acidic conditions and hypochlorite in alkaline media, the hydrolysis during the oxidation process can be significantly avoided using appropriate pHs. All oxidation experiments were verified using GC-MS analysis. Compounds of interest were quantified by using standard solutions of thio-OPs and identification of formed oxo-OPs was based on MS spectra. The formed oxo-analogs were detected using AChE-bioassay with TLS detection, which enabled determination of parent thio-compounds at ppb levels.

The separation of polyphenols from grapes was performed using narrow bore C18 Luna column (Phenomenex, 2 x 150 mm, 3μm) and monitored at 320 nm. The majority of white grapes polyphenols was represented by four hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs). According to their UV-Vis spectra and chromatographic retention properties they corresponded to trans-caftaric, trans-coutaric, cis-coutaric and trans-fertaric acid. To confirm the identity of separated polyphenols, they were also directed to the ion trap mass spectrophotometer (Finnigan LCQ Deca) fitted with electrospray ionization (ESI) probe. Spectra were recorded in negative mode between m/z 100 and m/z 500. The mass spectrometer was programmed to do two consecutive scans: a full mass (MS) and an MS 2 scan of the most abundant ion in the full mass spectra. The results confirmed the assumptive identification of three HCAs; trans-caftaric, trans-coutaric and trans-fertaric acids in white grape berries cv. Rebula based on HPLC-DAD analysis.",

X-ray analyses indicate that the complexes are dioxomolybdenum(VI) species. Complex 1 contains ethanol as co-ligand, and complex 2 contains methanol as co-ligand. The coordination geometry around the Mo atoms can be described as distorted octahedron, with one imino-N and two phenolate-O of the Schiff base ligand, and one oxo group defining the equatorial plane, and with the other oxo group and one solvent-O occupying the axial positions. The catalytic oxidation property of the complexes with tert -butylhydroperoxide in CH 2 Cl 2 was studied. Both complexes have excellent catalytic properties on cyclooctene and cyclohexene, and good properties on 1-hexene and 1-octene.",

The results indicated that the highest adsorption efficiency (84.5%) was obtained at pH 6, adsorbent concentration of 5 g/L, sulfate ion concentration of 20 ppm, 65 min and temperature of 45 °C. Also, the adsorption equilibrium study showed that the adsorption process follows the Langmuir isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 9.3 mg/g. In addition, the thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption process on the activated carbon surface was spontaneous. Moreover, the adsorption process was exothermic accompanied by a decrease in irregularity. Furthermore, the adsorption kinetic study indicated that the adsorption process follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.",

Especially in nanometre-scale systems, the SCL effects could be used to manipulate the conductivity and construct artificial conductors. Recently, existence of such effect either at the electrolyte/cathode interface or at the interfaces inside the composite electrode in all solid state lithium batteries (ASSLB) has attracted attention. Therefore, in this article, the principle of SCL on basis of defect chemistry is first presented. The SCL effects on the carrier transport and storage in typical conducting systems are reviewed. For ASSLB, the relevant effects reported so far are also reviewed. Finally, the perspective of interface engineer related to SCL in ASSLB is addressed.",

    "abstract": "TiO 2 is known as a photocatalyst and is often utilized for the oxidative mineralisation of pollutants. The correlation between the thickness, mass, surface topography and the type of support of the titania films and their photocatalytic activities were studied in this work. TiO 2 films were deposited on two different glass supports via sol-gel methods. Film thicknesses and weights have been measured. Film surfaces were characterized by AFM measurements. The presence of surfactant in the sol and the type of support influence the morphology of film's surface and the UV absorption characteristics. The addition of surfactants also increases the thicknesses of calcined films. For the photocatalytic experiments the titania film was immersed in an aqueous solution of Plasmocorinth B. Sodium glass support reduces the photocatalytic activity compared to protected glass support with a thin silica layer. The photocatalytic activity was found to increase with the number of TiO 2 layers in all cases. However, when comparing different films with the same number of TiO 2 layers, the addition of Pluronic F-127 surfactant in the sol was shown to have a significant positive effect on the photocatalytic activity. The use of this surfactant results in thicker and heavier films and consequently in more efficient absorption of UVA light.",

After the dyeing and textile finishing processes the content of dioxins was up to fifteen times higher. More than 85% of the total dioxin content was found in dyed polyester.

The advantages of this method involve the green reaction conditions, simple workup, broad substrates, excellent yields and the reuse of the nanocatalyst. One of the indicators to measure antimicrobial activity is Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) that this measure and heterocyclic compounds synthesis inhibition zone diameter was measured on examined bacteria using well diffusion, disc diffusion and determination of antibiotic susceptibility.

In the first phase of the research, a concept map was produced representing the reactions of hydrocarbons, organic halogenated compounds and organic oxygen compounds, and in the second phase the produced concept map was introduced in lessons. Its impact was tested on a sample consisting of 186 students (average age of 17.8 years), who were divided into a control group (88 students) and an experimental group (98 students). Prior to the experiment, the two groups were equalised in terms of their level of development of formal logical thinking and their average grade in chemistry. A knowledge test, consisting of five problem tasks comprising multiple parts, was used as a quantitative instrument for measuring the impact of the applied concept map. The content of the knowledge test was selected on the basis of the chemistry lesson plan (reactions of organic oxygen compounds) for general upper secondary schools (in Slovenian: gimnazije). An analysis of the task solving showed statistically significant differences in the responses of the experimental group members and the control group members (experimental group M = 15.9; SD = 6.33; control group M = 13.6; SD = 7.93; p = 0.03). The produced concept map contributed to the more effective interrelation of concepts and, consequently, to more effective problem task solving.",

The effect of square wave (SW) frequency, SW amplitude and step potential, as well as accumulation parameters (time and potential) were studied to select the optimal experimental conditions.

Obvious relationship between diapause and cold hardiness of this species is poorly understood, especially on metabolomic level. Therefore, we have compared the metabolomic patterns in polar extract of hemolymph of non-diapausing and diapausing larvae of O. nubilalis.

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is studying the encapsulation effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs ) on the stabilizing process of titanium dioxide molecule dimers (TiO2)2. First, a theoretical study was performed concerning the guest species that are various titanium dioxide dimers. Five structures were treated as following: i) Cis (C) or ii)Trans (T) relatively to a square shaped fragment Ti2O2, iii) a mixed Tetrahedral/Pyramidal (T/P) disposition while two titanium atoms are sharing three oxygen atoms, and finally not bonded dimers in iv) parallel (P) and v) orthogonal (O) positions respectively. Only the (T), (C) and (T/P) isomers may be considered as stable compounds. The structure of the T-dimer is more stable than the Cis one by only 6.5 kcal mol-1. Typically, intra and extracyclic Ti-O bond lengths are 1.84Å and 1.61Å respectively. (T/P) dimer can be described as a metastable structure since its energy is higher than (T) one by 19 kcal mol-1. NBO analysis highlights the participation of dative bonding between oxygen lone pair and vacant titanium 3d orbitals. (P) and (O) structures represent transitory species that transform into the more stable structure which is the T-dimer. The second and principal part of this work concerns the re-optimization of the studied structures placed inside the CNT (12,0). Only (T), (C) and (P) dimers are stabilized by encapsulation through the establishment of strong interactions with the CNT wall. The (T / P) and (O) isomers which are converted into (T) and (P) dimers respectively, are leaving the nanotube while they still interacting with its edge. These favorable results are indicating in one hand the possibly detection of (T) and (C) isomers, and in another hand that the process of polymerization of the TiO2 molecule which is leading to nanostructured materials could be controlled by encapsulation within the CNTs.",

The impedance spectra have been fitted with two equivalent circuits using a nonlinear least squares fit program. Information about the ionic conductivity and the structure of the layers has been extracted. A new physical model which is able to explain the circuit parameters is proposed. It assumes that the LiCl-layer contains a large number of narrow tunnels and cracks filled with liquid catholyte. It is explained why such tunnels probably are formed, and for a typical case it is shown that tunnels associated with most of the LiCl grain boundaries of the fine crystalline layer near the Li surface are requested in order to explain the impedance response. The LiCl production rate and through this, the growth rate of the LiCl-layer, is limited by the electron conduc­tivity of the layer. Micro-calorimetry data parallel with impedance spectra are used for determination of the electron conduc­tivity of the LiCl-layer.",

    "abstract": "Several phenolic acids (PAs), caffeic, vanillic, syringic, p-coumaric and ferulic acid, found in Slovenian red wines were studied using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For isolation of the PAs from wine samples, solid phase extraction (SPE) using hydrophilic modified styrene - HLB cartridges was used. The bound PAs were extracted after basic hydrolysis and o-coumaric acid was used as the internal standard (ISTD). The method developed was validated and the linear concentration range for all analytes was from 1 to 100 mg L -1 with correlation coefficients above 0.999. We show that the method is repeatable (RSD<2%), recoveries were above 96%, and LOD and LOQ values were acceptable. In all of the wine samples tested, caffeic and p-coumaric acid were determined to be the predominant PAs (17-72 mg L -1 ), while other compounds were found in lower concentrations. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CLU) were used to study differences between wines related towards varieties and Slovenian wine regions. The results demonstrate that variety has more influence on PAs content than wine regions in Slovenian red wines.",

The in vitro cytotoxic activity of some selected compounds was evaluated against two human cell lines: prostate cancer (PC-3) and colon cancer (HCT-116). A preliminary study of the structure-activity relationship of the target compounds was discussed. Most of the synthesized compounds showed remarkable activity on the tested cell lines, while compound 16c had the highest potency against the PC-3 cell line with an IC50 of 5.48 μM compared to Doxorubicin (IC50 = 7.7 μM), the reference standard used in this study. On the other hand, 6c and 18c were the most active against HCT-116 (IC50 = 6.12 and 6.56 μM, respectively) relative to IC50 = 15.82 μM of the standard. Thus, some of the synthesized thienopyrimidine derivatives, specially 6c, 16c and 18c, have the potential to be developed into potent anticancer agents.",

The mobility of metals after addition of ABC to tailings at four different application rates (0.6 g, 1.2 g, 1.8 g and 3.6 g ABC per 100 g of tailings) was evaluated by Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) one step extraction. The obtained results indicated that the mobility of Pb, Cr and Cd gradually decreased with increasing quantity of added ABC. According to the TCLP, mobile concentrations of Pb in tailings exceeded threshold values for almost eight times. After ABC addition, Pb TCLP-extractable concentrations decreased from 39 mg L-1 in tailings to lower than the TCLP limit values of 5 mg L-1 at all ABC application rates, except in mixtures with the lowest addition of ABC. We concluded that ABC could be a successful metal stabilization agent for multi-metal contaminated soil, although attention should be paid at highly As contaminated soil.",

Here we studied the ability of mono- and polyunsaturated FAs to affect LD formation and survival in Hela cervical cancer cells. We found that the LD content in Hela cells increases with cell density, but it decreases in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Exogenously-added unsaturated FAs, including oleic (OA), linoleic (LA), arachidonic (AA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), displayed a similar ability to alter LD formation in Hela cells. There was a dual, concentration-dependent effect: low micromolar concentrations suppressed, while higher concentrations of FAs induced LD formation. In serum starved Hela cells, OA stimulated LD formation, but, contrary to expectations, it promoted cell death. Our results reveal a link between cell population density and LD formation in Hela cells and show that unsaturated FAs may both suppress and stimulate LD formation. This dynamic regulation of LD content must be accounted for when studying the effects of lipids and lipid metabolism-targeting drugs on LD metabolism in HeLa cells.",

Human milk samples were diluted in ultrapure water. The infant formula of powder samples (suitable for an infant 1-6 months of age) and standard reference material (SRM-1849) were analyzed in parallel . The results have shown that FAAS method was more sensitive for Fe determination in human milk while ICP-OES was more sensitive for both Zn and Cu detection. The limit of quantification for both Zn and Cu was 5 µg L -1 and 10 µg L -1 for Fe and the recovery for Zn, Fe and Cu was ranged from 90 % to 94 %, 97 % to 103 % and 90% to 102 %, respectively. Mean concentrations of Zn, Fe, and Cu in human milk samples were 5.35, 0.47 and 0.83 mg L -1 , respectively while these values in infant formula were ranged from 3.52 - 4.75 mg L -1 , 3.37 - 4.56mg L -1 and 0.28 - 0.41 mg L -1 , respectively. Despite the sample complexity, the proposed method using dilution of milk samples with waterwas simple, rapid, effective and accurate. ICP-OES was a better method for Zn determination while FAAS was a better method for Fe determination. In the case of Cu both methods were comparable.",

In this work we report on results of thermal lens spectrometry (TLS) coupled to flow injection analysis (FIA) as a highly sensitive FIA-TLS method of iron detection. The concentration of iron redox species was determined using 1,10-phenanthroline (PHN), that forms stable complexes with Fe(II) ions which are characterized by an absorption maximum at 508 nm. The TLS system using a 633 nm probe laser and 530 nm pump laser beam was exploited for on-line detection in flow injection analysis, where a PHN solution was used as the carrier solution for FIA. The concentration of the complexing agent affects the quality of the TLS signal, and the optimal concentration was found at 1 mM PHN. The achieved limits of detection (LODs) for Fe(II) and total iron were 33 nM for Fe(II) and 21 nM for total iron concentration. The method was further validated by determining the linear concentration range, specificity in terms of analytical yield and by determining concentration of iron in a water sample from a local water stream.",

There are many areas with very soft low-mineralised water around the world.

Enrichment of drinking water by minerals including calcium and magnesium is very important particularly in regions where drinking water is prepared by desalination. The aim of this work was to study and intensify the recarbonization process. Half-calcined dolomite in combination with carbon dioxide constitutes the chemistry of the applied method. Advantages of using a fluidised bed reactor contributed also significantly to the process efficiency enhancement. Continuous input of carbon dioxide into the fluidised bed recarbonization reactor resulted in an increase in the recarbonization rate by about one order of magnitude compared with the process in without carbon dioxide addition. Very good fit of experimental data for hydrodynamic characteristics of fluidised bed was obtained using simple model based on the Richardson and Zaki expansion equation. The first order model describes kinetic data from the recarbonization process with a good accuracy. Higher recarbonization rates were observed with smaller particles of half-calcined dolomite.",

The obtained differences in the dissolution were explained through the determination of crystal morphology its orientation and assignation of the molecular functional groups that were emerging on the surface of the dissolving crystal face. The dissolution rates of the particular crystal faces were found to be distinctly higher than others. The dissolution rate of single crystals differed as a consequence of higher incidence of more polar faces in case of rod shaped crystals isolated from more hydrophilic solvent mixture which we have established through a thorough research of the single crystal morphology, orientation and the assignation of specific functional groups for each of evolved crystal faces.",

When carboxyl groups were modified by various chemical treatments, the adsorption capacity decreased dramatically, showing that carboxyl groups play a fundamental role in the bioadsorption process.

    "abstract": "The synthesis and biological activity of a variety of analogues to the naturally occurring anti-bacterial and anti-fungal Distamycin A were explored by a number of authors. These compounds were subject to a large array of assays. Some of these compounds showed high activity against a range of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi. To explore the anti-parasitic activity of this class of compounds, specific modifications had to be made. A number of these compounds proved to be active against Trypanosoma brucei. The binding of a number of these compounds to short sequences of DNA were also examined using footprinting assays as well as NMR spectroscopy. Computer modelling was employed on selected compounds to understand the way these compounds bind to specific DNA sequences. A large number of variations were made to the standard structure of Distamycin. These changes involved the replacement of the pyrrole moieties as well as the head and tail groups with a number of heterocyclic compounds. Some of these MGBs were also investigated for their capability for the treatment of cancer and in particular lung cancer.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the synthesized products. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine the effects of reaction time and reaction temperature on the morphology of the products. Thermal dehydration kinetics were studied using thermal gravimetry and differential thermal gravimetry analysis (TG/DTA). The Doyle and Kissinger non-isothermal kinetic methods were used to analyse the TG/DTA data. The XRD results confirmed the successful synthesis of Zn 3 B 6 O 12 ·3.5H 2 O at a range of reaction temperatures and times. Additionally, FT-IR and Raman analysis of the products identified peaks specific to zinc borate. Using the methods of Doyle and Kissinger, the activation energies of thermal dehydration of zinc borate were found to be 341.61 kJ/mol and 390.17 kJ/mol, respectively.",

After that, its homopolymerization was carried out by free radical polymerization method at 60 °C initiated with benzoyl peroxide. Spectral characterizations were achieved by 1H-NMR and FTIR spectroscopies. The kinetics of thermal degradation of the new polymer, poly(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl methacrylate), poly(DFPMA), were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at different heating rates. The initial decomposition temperature of the polymer changed from 216.3 °C to 243.5 °C depending on the increasing heating rate. The thermal decomposition activation energies in a conversion range of 7-19% were 79.45 kJ/mol and 81.56 kJ/mol by the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Kissinger methods, respectively. Thermodegradation mechanism of the poly(DFPMA) were investigated in detail by using different kinetic methods available in the literature such as Coats-Redfern, Tang, Madhusudanan and Van Krevelen. Among all these methods, the best result was obtained for Coats-Redfern method (E =90.93 kJ/mol) at the optimum heating rate of 15 °C/min for D1 mechanism. That means the thermodegradation mechanism of poly(DFPMA) proceeds over a one-dimensional diffusion type deceleration mechanism.",

Non-formal education serves as a valuable complement to the formal school system, enabling the exploration of topics often overlooked in formal curricula due to rigid regulations or teachers’ lack of expertise. The review included 236 primary articles, of which 19 met strict inclusion criteria. The results indicate that the most employed approaches in non-formal education are inquiry-based learning, laboratory work with an emphasis on independent experimental activities, and science camps. Non-formal education significantly contributes to the development of chemical literacy, fosters interest in science, and improves attitudes toward chemistry. The authors highlight the need for further research in this field and greater integration of non-formal approaches into formal education to enhance the scientific literacy of young learners.",

The pyzaH molecules are coordinated as monodentate ligands only through heterocyclic nitrogen in 1, 2 and 3, as shown by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The chloride ions are coordinated as terminal ligands in 1, [ZnCl2(pyzaH)2]∙2H2O, but act as bridging ligands in the 1D complexes [MCl2(pyzaH)2]n∙2nH2O (M = Mn, 2, Co, 3). The supramolecular architectures of the complexes differ due to the coordination of the chlorides, the hydrogen bonds and the parallel stacking arrangements of the pyzaH molecules. In contrast to the isolated crystals of 1, 2 and 3, the manganese(II) (2a) and nickel(II) (4), compounds do not contain water. According to the IR spectra and the results of thermal analyzes, the proposed formula is [MCl2(pyzaH)2]. Powder X-ray and thermal analysis results demonstrate the isostructural nature of complexes 2a and 4. The low thermal stability of 1 is due to the monodentate coordination of pyzaH in 1. Thermal decomposition of 1, 2a and 4 in air produces oxides MO (M = Mn, Ni, Zn).",

The methanol extract of S. kotschyi demonstrated higher concentrations of secondary metabolites and antioxidant activity than S. pumilio. Both species predominantly contained caffeic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and epicatechin, though S. pumilio had a notably higher caffeic acid content. Additionally, S. kotschyi extract showed greater cytotoxicity against HeLa and SH-SY5Y cancer cells, while S. pumilio exhibited greater wound-healing efficacy. Two previously unexplored Saponaria species reveal a remarkable richness in secondary metabolites and potent antioxidant activity. Given their diverse phenolic constituents, these species emerge as promising candidates for therapeutic applications in cervical cancer and neuroblastoma, as well as playing a potentially critical role in tissue repair and regeneration-areas that merit further in-depth investigation.",

    "abstract": "The growing interest in health-promoting food options has highlighted the need to explore new sources with unique nutritional compositions. Plants are rich sources of bioactive compounds with biological effects. Urelytrum giganteum Pilg is a perennial wild tufted grass that grows in dry tropical African countries. Traditionally, it has been used to treat several diseases, however, up to date, no study has been done on this plant. This study analyzed the solvent extraction of Urelytrum giganteum Pilg, a perennial wild tufted grass in dry tropical African countries, to determine its proximate analysis, antioxidant potential, chemical composition, antimicrobial efficacy, and molecular docking. The Soxhlet extraction method was employed, and the obtained extracts were subjected to phytochemical evaluation, DPPH radical scavenging activity, a scavenging assay of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), disk diffusion evaluation and molecular docking studies. The phytochemicals identified included alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, phenolic substances, tannins, carbohydrates, terpenes, and C-glycosides. The ethanol extract showed the highest activity in terms of DPPH (70.2 μg/mL), H2O2 (60.7 μg/mL), and alpha glycosidase (72.3 μg/mL) activities and antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (17 mm). Most of the phytochemicals demonstrated notable inhibitory activity, with Stigmasterol showing the highest inhibition score. This underscores the potential of U. giganteum as a promising nominee for the pharmaceutical industry. The identified phytochemical and antioxidant compounds could be promising nutraceuticals or food additives for overall well-being.",

In this work, the high-pressure ultrasonic-assisted extraction (HUE) technique was employed for the first time to extract cannabinoids from industrial hemp leaves. A maximum extraction yield (60.02 ± 0.09 mg/g) was obtained through the single-factor experiments, which was much higher compared to ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UE, 42.88 ± 0.02 mg/g) and stirring extraction (SE, 35.35 ± 0.07 mg/g). The optimized HUE conditions were: extraction time was 40 min, EtOH concentration was 60%, extraction temperature was 60 °C, ultrasonic power was 400 W, RL/S was 20 mL/g, stirring rate was 400 rpm, and extraction pressure was 0.6 MPa. The total phenolic content (TPC, 244.36 ± 0.84 mg GAE/g extract) and the total flavonoids content (TFC, 0.27 ± 0.02 mg RE/g extract) of the HUE extract were also the highest. The HUE mechanism was revealed to some extent by several characterizations including surface morphology that HUE could deeply destroy the structure of leave particles. Furthermore, the in vitro antioxidant activity of HUE extract was the best among the three extracts. The EC50 values against DPPH and ABTS were 0.28 mg/mL and 0.25 mg/mL, respectively. In summary, this work confirmed that HUE was a suitable method for extracting cannabinoids and the obtained extract with a high content of cannabinoids had great application values.",

Besides design complexity, it is predicted that the current lithium resources will not be sufficient to meet the increasing demands from other markets and lithium prices are expected to increase. It is necessary to search for a new raw material that gives the same performance to prevent the possibility of a supply shortage in the construction sector. In this study, ternary system accelerated with aluminum sulphate was comprehensively investigated in comparison with commonly used accelerators.

Complex 1 was characterized by X-ray structural analysis, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and was studied as a flame retardant-hardener for epoxy resins. The crystals of 1 consist of [Cu(deta)2]2+ cations, Cl– anions and uncoordinated water molecules. Each Cu(II) atom is chelated with two tridentate molecules of deta, which bond to the central Cu(II) atom in a non-equivalent manner. This results in a distorted tetragonal bipyramidal environment around the Cu(II) atom. The crystal packing of the structural units in 1 is determined by both the dominant cation-anion interaction and strong hydrogen bonds, such as N–H···Cl, N–H···O, and O–H···Cl. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to determine the electron structure of 1 using the restricted formalism of B3LYP method with a 6-31G* orbital basis set. The d-orbitals of the Cu2+ ion are split due to the interaction of a tetragonal bipyramidal environment and the chelation, resulting in the visually observed dark blue color of crystals of 1. This color closely corresponds to the calculated value of the visible light wavelength (λ = 661.37 nm), which is related to the energy of photons absorbed by the complex (Δ = 1.874 eV).",

The methodology involved passing the wastewater through three successive columns packed with various adsorbent materials. The efficiency was evaluated by measuring several chemical and physical properties before and after treatment, including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), acidity, turbidity, chloride, nitrate, nitrite, sulphate, phosphate, Na, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, total phenols, and total flavonoids. The initial values of these properties varied among the samples. After treatment, the measured properties were significantly changed, including an increase in pH from 4.8 to 6.9, EC from 12990 μS/cm to 1407 μS/cm, turbidity from 7328 NTU to 2791 NTU, chloride from 3400 ppm to 422 ppm, nitrate from 307 ppm to 4.34 ppm, Na from 293 ppm to 178 ppm, K from 2243 ppm to 86 ppm, Ca from 91 ppm to 60 ppm, and a significant reduction in total phenols from 9821 mg/g to 35 mg/g.

Three primary mechanisms were developed: sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET), single electron transfer followed by proton transfer (SET-PT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Several thermodynamic descriptors were computed in both gas and solvent phases at the B3LYP/6-311G and 6-311G (d, p) level of theory. Our findings suggest that compounds 3a, 3c, 3f, 4d, and 4e may scavenge free radicals through one of these three pathways. The results indicate that SPLET is favored in polar environments, while HAT is the thermodynamically preferred mechanism in the gas phase and non-polar solutions. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) attached to the π conjugated system at the N position of the benzofuran derivatives decrease bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE), while electron-donating groups (EDGs) are helpful to decrease the ionization potentials (IPs). The results of the multilinear regression statistical analyses indicate a good correlation between the IC50 and ionization potential, in addition to the proton dissociation enthalpy, proton affinity, and the electron transfer enthalpy descriptors.",

    "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles synthesized using Verbascum uschakense extract at a reaction temperature of 60 °C were characterized through multiple analytical techniques. These included ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Ultraviolet-visible spectral analysis revealed a surface plasmon resonance peak at 432 nanometers, indicating the successful formation of silver nanoparticles. Microscopic analyses demonstrated that the nanoparticles were predominantly spherical in shape, with particle sizes ranging between 4 and 14 nanometers. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that the silver nanoparticles possessed a face-centered cubic crystal structure, as evidenced by characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 38.21°, 44.46°, 64.59°, and 77.48°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, respectively. Regarding the biological activities, the antioxidant capacity of the aqueous extract of V. uschakense was evaluated by its ability to scavenge free radicals. At a concentration of 1 milligram per milliliter, the extract demonstrated a 86.93 percent scavenging effect against the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. In comparison, the silver nanoparticles synthesized from the plant extract exhibited a 60.04 percent scavenging effect at the same concentration. Additionally, the silver nanoparticles showed strong inhibition in the 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay, with values comparable to those obtained using the standard antioxidant TroloxThe antimicrobial properties of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were examined using the disc diffusion method. The nanoparticles exhibited inhibitory activity against several pathogenic microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, and fungal species belonging to the Candida genus. These results highlight the potential of V. uschakense-mediated silver nanoparticles as multifunctional bioactive agents with both antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The study demonstrates that green synthesis offers a sustainable and effective approach to producing nanomaterials with potential applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical fields.",

    "abstract": "The continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 levels due to industrial emissions and fossil fuel combustion has intensified the need for efficient carbon capture. Solid adsorbents are favoured for their reusability and low energy demand, yet often face limitations in thermal stability and adsorption performance. This study examines the effect of co-loading manganese (Mn) with potassium (K), copper (Cu), and calcium (Ca) on fibrous silica KCC-1 for CO2 capture over a wide temperature range. KCC-1 was synthesised via a microemulsion method, and metals were introduced using an ultrasonic-surfactant-assisted impregnation technique. Characterisation using XRD, FTIR, BET, FESEM-EDX, and CO2-TPD confirmed structural integrity, surface functionality, and adsorption behaviour. CaO-MnO@KCC-1 shows the most balanced textural properties and the highest CO2 uptake due to its strong basicity and varied adsorption site strength. This highlights its potential as a temperature-flexible CO2 adsorbent.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to develop various types of asphalt materials with enhanced rheological properties compared to unmodified asphalt. Three types of polymeric materials (PS), (PFR), and (PP)-were used to modify Al-Doura asphalt, with the goal of evaluating their impact on the rheological characteristics of the resulting asphalt systems. These modified materials were then compared with each other with both local and international standards to assess their suitability for specific applications. Polymeric waste materials were used instead of virgin polymers to reduce environmental pollution and lower modification costs. The modification process was carried out using two approaches: physical treatment and chemical treatment. The chemical method involved a catalytic reaction using 2% (FeCl₃) and 1% (S). Results showed that chemical treatment had a more significant positive impact on the rheological properties of the asphalt systems compared to physical treatment. In both approaches, the addition of polymers led to an increase in de-asphaltene %, with the highest values recorded for AsPS (44.5%), AsPFR (40%), and AsPP (40%). Furthermore, chemically modifying asphalt with PS produced the most notable improvements among the tested polymers. Based on key performance indicators such as softening point, penetration, ductility, penetration index (PI), and asphaltene %, the modified asphalt samples demonstrated suitability for use in producing mastic, which are widely applied as waterproofing material.",

The carbothioamide (L) ligand and triphenylphosphine (Ph3P) as co-ligand, was coordinated with Cu(I), Cu(II), and Pd(II) metal ions to synthesis the corresponding complexes: [CuCl2(L)] 1, [CuCl(L)(Ph3P)] 2, [PdCl2(L)] 3, and [PdCl(L)(Ph3P)]Cl 4. The ligand and all complexes were collected in solid form after the reactions and characterized by magnetic susceptibility, elemental analysis, molar conductivity, FT-IR, UV-Vis, and 1H, 13C, 31P-NMR techniques. The molar conductance values in DMSO (5.8–16.3 Ω–1 cm2 mol–1) confirmed all the complexes to be non-electrolytic except for the Pd(II) complex 4 (32.6 Ω–1cm2 mol–1) that behaves as a 1:1 electrolyte. According to spectroscopic evidence, the carbothioamide ligand behaves as an N, S donor and chelating agent. Magnetic susceptibility measurements combined with electronic spectral data suggest that the Cu(II) and Pd(II) complexes have square planar geometry, whereas the Cu(I) complex 2 has a tetrahedral geometry. Elemental analysis and 1H-NMR spectroscopy confirmed the mononuclear structure of all complexes. DFT calculations showed that the synthesized complexes 1, 3, and 4 exhibit higher thermodynamic stability than the free ligand (L), with ΔE values of 1.4695, 2.1116 eV, 1.9076 eV, and 1.2980 eV, respectively. In contrast, complex 2 has ΔE = 0.5385 eV, indicating lower thermodynamic stability. Among the complexes, complex 2 (S = 3.7140 eV) exhibited the highest softness, and all complexes were observed to be softer than the triphenylphosphine ligand. According to the results, electron transitions are easier in certain complexes than in their ligands, which suggests that the prepared complexes could be used in the photocell in future studies.",

This review delves into how modern techniques accelerate drug discovery and development, significantly reducing costs. We focus on the robust synergy of bioinformatics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-throughput screening (HTS). Bioinformatics aids in the identification and validation of drug targets by analyzing vast genomic and proteomic datasets. AI enhances lead compound identification and optimization through predictive modeling and machine learning (ML) algorithms, slashing the time required for these stages. HTS facilitates the rapid screening of vast compound libraries to pinpoint potential drug candidates. AI-based approaches, such as HTS and predictive modeling, enhance early-stage decision-making, minimize trial-and-error experimentation, and contribute to cost-efficiency across the pipeline. Moreover, advancements in computational chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations provide deeper insights into drug-target interactions, further accelerating the design of effective and selective drugs. In drug discovery, drug candidates are tested in laboratory and live animal settings to assess their effectiveness, pharmacokinetics, and safety. By integrating these preclinical methods, the efficiency and success of drug discovery can be significantly improved, leading to more effective and safer drugs. This review underscores the important role of these technologies in contemporary drug development and explores their promising implications for future research and clinical applications.",

Because waste broth expressed biodegradability (BOD 5 /COD ratio was 0.40), biological treatment was the first choice. At the same time, in preliminary ready biodegradability assessment test, diluted broth degraded 65% as well it was not toxic to mixed bacterial culture of activated sludge. Further experiments in pilot laboratory biological treatment plant confirm acceptable treatment efficiency up to 0.01 vol% of the broth added (76%). However, we had considered additional pretreatment method to be able to enhance biotreatability. Fenton procedure was optimised in batch reactor using different concentrations of Fe 2 + , H 2 O 2 , temperatures (40/45 °C), as well as different retention times (up to 30 minutes). The highest treatment efficiency reached only 44% according to COD, but ready biodegradability of the sample increased (82%). Fenton oxidation was confirmed as possible method for pretreatment of broth, because it slightly enhanced biodegradability, it reduced organic pollution and formed products were non-toxic. We have focused our future work into a study on optimisation of applied procedure for improving biotreatability of the investigated broth.",

Repeated measurements of YTT accuracy with the standard toxicants showed EC 50 values characterized by low standard deviation and coefficient of variation (7.62%). Moreover, the YTT was compared to standard prokaryotic biotests by estimating the toxicity of wastewater from pharmaceutical sources. The toxicity of wastewaters measured by YTT agrees sufficiently with those measured by standard methods of the determination of toxicity such as inhibition of bioluminescence, TTC-dehydrogenase activity, aerobic bacterial growth and anaerobic sludge biogas production.

    "abstract": "The content of phenolic compounds in grape skins of the red grape variety 'Merlot' using different extraction solvents and analytical techniques were studied. The 1% solution of 2,6-di-rert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) in methanol and ethanol/formic acid/water solution were used as extraction media, and the content of phenolic compounds was determined using HPLC and spectrophotometry. Methanol compared to ethanol/formic acid/water performed better, as statistically significantly higher contents were determined. The following contents were determined: (+)-catechin 68-74 mg kg -1 , (-)-epicatechin 32-35 mg kg -1 , oenin 440-450 mgkg -1 ,rutin2.9-3.5 mg kg -1 ,myricetin 0.4-0.5 mg kg -1 , kaempferol 2.3 mg kg -1 andquercetin3.2-3.6 mg kg -1 . Using spectrophotometry, an arbitrary procedure was followed for determination of phenolic compounds extracted with ethanol/formic acid/water. Thus, the content of total phenols (791-1127 mg kg -1 ), tartaric esters (219 mg kg -1 ) flavonols (163-167 mg kg -1 ) and total anthocyanins (2179-2219 mg kg -1 ) was determined. A comparison with literature data is difficult due to different varieties studied, ecological conditions, ripening stage, analytical methods etc., but some similarities can be observed. For our understanding of the process of grape maturation and its quality, it is of importance to develop a reliable and simple method.",

Additionally we examined functional dependence of individual bond contributions on modeling property by varying also the exponent appearing in connectivity index.

Regular consumption of whole grain cereals is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, colon cancer and obesity. Whole grain food and, especiall y, dietary fiber are drawing attention due to many potential benefits.

There is lack of precise explanations of underlying mechanisms but i t has been proven that the risk of obesity may be reduced by replacing of refined cereal sourc es with more whole grain, high-fiber and low glycaemic index food. Whole grain cereals and dietary fiber in particular enhance satiety, promote satiation, prolong gastric emptying time an d slow nutrient absorption. Synergic effect of many beneficial components such as fiber, resistant starch and antioxidants may be responsible for slowing the rate of glucose absorpt ion, delaying insulin release and blunting glycaemic response, what may influence weight management.",

Furthermore, fine wheat flour was substituted with different levels of chickpea flour (0, 10, 20 and 30 % w/w) to produce crackers. The addition of chickpea flour at level more than 10 % showed adverse effect to physical properties of cra ckers embodied in reduced volume index, width and spread ratio. Sensory evaluation of crack ers revealed that enhancing level of chickpea flour in crackers caused higher intensity of leguminous taste and odour and cracker had slightly bitter taste.

Simple potentiometric carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) based on atomoxetine–derivatized with tetraphenylborate (ATM-TPB) or phosphotungstic acid (ATM-PTA) as ion-pairs decorated with TiO 2 nanoparticles and sodium tetraphenylborate (Na-TPB) as additives were most useful. Parameters affecting the performance of the electrodes were investigated, such as paste composition, type of plasticizers, kind of electroactive materials and interfering species. The electrodes were notable for bringing down the detection limit to 8.0 x 10 -7 M and 9.2 x 10 -7 M, wide linear ranges 1.1 x 10 -6 –1.0 x 10 -2 M and 1.75×10 -6 –1.00×10 -2 M, slope 58.7±0.5 mV/decade and 67.2±0.8 mV/decade, respectively. Importantly, the potential reading became more stable and rapidly attained in the presence of additives. The selectivity for the drug over other species such as inorganic and organic cations, as well as different excipients that are likely incorporated in pharmaceutical preparations was high making their effect negligible on the response of the electrodes. The sensors, as indicator electrodes, were successfully applied for determination of the drug in pharmaceutical preparation, urine and serum with good accuracy, excellent recovery and efficiency.",

Maximum removal efficiency for untreated WGT was 89% (4 g biomass, 100 mL solution of 94 mg/L, 316 K). It was found that the adsorption of MG increased by increasing temperature from 296 to 316 K. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔHº, ΔSº, ΔGº) were calculated, and indicated that dye adsorption onto the studied biomass was endothermic and non-spontaneous. Six chemical treatments were tested (four acidic – H 3 PO 4 , H 2 SO 4 , HCl, and tartaric acid, one oxidant – H 2 O 2 , and one basic – NaOH) in order to study the chemical groups responsible for MG adsorption onto WGT biomass. The alkali and acidic treatments led to an increase of adsorption efficiency up to 92% and 95% (H 2 SO 4 ) respectively. The FTIR spectroscopy results emphasized the modifications of the biomass surface and how these are influencing the adsorption process.",

Comparative uptake of bexarotene on amino-functionalized silica host at various functionalization degrees is discussed in details taking into account all structural features, of matrix as well as properties of the drug molecules. The obtained results proved a successful bexarotene loading on amino-functionalized MCM-41 silica.

In vitro dissolution tests showed a prolonged release of bexarotene during 12 h, reaching 50% release of loaded active molecules. The prolonged release has been demonstrated to be a result of the presence of aminopropyl groups on the silica pore walls.",

Components of the mixture were chosen based on the references giving their characteristics relevant to their possible action in the solution and/or at the surface of the steel. The efficiency of the protective layer formed under the influence of the inhibitor mixture, and then measured by the LPR probe in the inhibitor-free solution, was the lowest under quiescent conditions (75%) and the highest (95%) under flow conditions. Both, LPR and EIS data indicate that the inhibitor modified layer presents a barrier for diffusion of oxygen that acts as a primary corrosion reaction depolarizer in the investigated neutral chloride solution. The demonstrated persistence of the inhibitor modified layer is of primary interest as it gives possibility batch application.",

    "abstract": "Identification and determination of diethylene glycol (DEG) in glycerin-based products was successfully achieved using FT-IR spectroscopy. Studied samples included 0.5% to 20% by mass DEGspiked into cough syrup, two paracetamol syrup formulations, and two food supplements. The characteristic DEGwavenumbers at 881 cm -1 and 1083 cm -1 were used for its quantitative determination in the studied samples. A very good accuracy in determining the DEG fraction was achieved with a mean error% of ±2.02% to ±7.69% upon using the corrected absorbance at 881 cm -1 . The corrected absorbance at 1083 cm -1 band was used in the case of paracetamol formulations and resulted in a mean error% ranging from ±2.50% to ±10.28%. The values of limit of detection of the current method ranged from 0.051% to 0.068% DEG for all studied samples.",

    "abstract": "Plum ( Prunus domestica L.) is a fruit widely cultivated across Europe and its processing generates a considerable amount of waste in form of discharged plum kernels. This creates a new opportunity to exploit plum kernels in order to provide an alternative to conventional edible oils. The main aim of this study was to obtain high-quality oil from plum kernel seeds by applying traditional cold pressing (CP) and supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO 2 ) extraction as a modern technology. The obtained oils were characterized based on the chemical composition of fatty acids and tocopherols. In obtained oils, twelve fatty acids were identified. The oleic acid was the most dominant in both oils (68.66% in oil obtained by ScCO 2 , 65.86% in oil obtained by CP), followed by linoleic acid (22.24-25.44%). While total tocopherols content in oil obtained by ScCO 2 was 4 to 5.8-fold higher than CP. The results proved that the utilization of plum kernel seeds possess high potential as an alternative oil source due a high amount of oleic acid and tocopherols and a low amount of saturated fatty acids and amygdalin.",

A novel approach for precise and reliable assay of phytic acid, based on the difference between end points by potentiometric titration, has been presented. Twelve phytic acid protons are classified into three groups of acidity, which enables detection of 2 to 3 distinct equivalent points (EPs) depending on experimental conditions, e.g. counter-ion concentration. Using the differences between individual EPs enables correct phytate determination as well as identification of potential contamination and/or determination of initial protonation degree. Impact of uncertainty of phytate amount on the calculation of protonation constants has been evaluated using computer simulation program (Hyperquad2013). With the analysis of titration curves different binding sites on phytate ligand have been proposed for complexation of Ca2+ and Fe3+ ions.",

    "abstract": "We employed molecular dynamics simulations with separate thermostats for translational and rotational temperatures in order to study the effects of these degrees of freedom on the hydration of ions. In this work we examine how water models, differing in charge distribution, respond to rise of the rotational temperature. The study shows that popular water models can be divided, with respect to the distribution of negative charge, into two groups leading to a different response upon an increase in the rotational temperature. Differences arise in the hydration of cations, as the negative charge distribution on the model solvent represents the determining factor in such cases. The cation-water correlation increases with the increasing rotational temperature when negative charge is placed in (or close to) the centre of the water molecule (a typical example is the SPC water model) and decreases when the negative charge is shifted from its centre (as in the TIP5P model of water). Since all the water models examined here have similar distributions of positive charge, they all exhibit similar trends in solvation of anions upon an increase of rotational temperature. As expected, the effect of translational temperature variation is the same for all water models studied; any increase in translational temperature decreases the solute-water correlations.",

According to the Plackett-Burman design results, ionic strength of the sample solutions, the aspiration/dispersion cycles, and the rate and time of centrifuge did not show significant effects on the extraction of morin and quercetin. The optimized conditions of extraction were as follows; the volume of the extraction solvent of 83.6 μL, pH of 4.34 for the sample, and 1-undecanol as extraction solvent. Under these conditions, the linear calibration curve was in the ranges of 1–1000 ng/mL and 0.5–1000 ng/mL for morin and quercetin, respectively, with the determination coefficient values above 0.99. The limit of detection of morin and quercetin was 0.3 and 0.2 ng/mL, respectively. The extraction recoveries for 10 ng/mL of morin and quercetin were 98.9% and 96.5%, respectively; while, relative standard deviations (n = 3) were lower than 3.2%.",

    "abstract": "Copper, like iron and zinc, is one of the most essential trace elements for organisms. Different forms of copper have distinctive and specific uses. For example, copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NP) are widely used in the world as a nanomaterial. Copper sulphate (CuSO4) is worldwide used as a fungicide in agriculture and as an algaecide in aquaculture. Nowadays, the increasing use of these chemicals raises concerns regarding their potential effects on the health of aquatic organisms and ecological risks. Therefore, in the present research, toxic effects of CuSO4 and CuO-NP, alone and in combination, were evaluated using biochemical markers (plasma biochemical and gill and liver oxidative stress) in freshwater fish, Oreochromis niloticus. The fish were exposed to 0.05 mg/L CuSO4, CuO-NP, and CuSO4+CuO-NP for 4 and 21 days. Especially at 21 days, CuSO4 and CuO-NP, alone and combined, generally increased plasma alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, cortisol, glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and tissue malondialdehyde while they decreased plasma total protein, and tissue superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione. Consequently, our results illustrate that CuSO4 and CuO-NP have similar toxic effects in fish, however, co-exposure of CuO-NP and CuSO4 is more toxic than effects of these chemicals alone.",

Prussian red (PR) a low spin iron (III) coordination compound was doped in polythiophene (PTP) matrix to explore propensity of this inorganic-organic hybrid composite material towards wastewater treatment. PR doping was observed to improve mechano, thermal, electrical, and photocatalytic attributes of pure PTP. PTP/PR composite characterization was attempted using the powder X-ray diffraction, TEM, TGA, FTIR, BET analysis and UV-Visible spectroscopy. Optimization of adsorption conditions, adsorbent regeneration, adsorption thermodynamics studies of PTP/PR were carried out using malachite green (MG) dye as a model system. Under optimized conditions 92% MG dye adsorption was observed over 20 mg PTP/PR nanocomposite in 20 minutes at pH 7. PTP/PR nanocomposite also demonstrated a complimentary performance with real wastewater samples. Thermodynamic studies indicate spontaneous process with electrostatic attraction as the predominant noncovalent interaction.

Several factors affect the corrosion and scaling of water, which include pH, temperature, alkalinity, Ca2+ hardness, TDS, concentrations of Cl–, SO42–, CO32–, and HCO3–. Also, several indices can be measured using these properties such as the Langelier saturation index, Ryznar index, Aggressive index, Larson, Scold index, water quality index, and Puckorius index. These indicators determine the degree of corrosiveness and sedimentation of water. The purpose of this review article was to study the impact of various factors on the corrosiveness and sedimentation of water. To this end, different sources of water in different countries were studied and the impact of physical and chemical parameters on their corrosiveness was investigated. Also, the reaction mechanism of water corrosion inside the pipe was studied. Finally, practical and constructive suggestions were presented to solve the problems of corrosion and sedimentation of desalination water.",

Various statistical approaches were used to assess the statistical quality of the developed models, and the obtained results were very good. This study used a novel statistical metric known as the index of ideality of correlation for the final assessment of the model, and the results that were obtained suggested that the model was good.

The final assessment of the designed inhibitors, was performed with the use of molecular docking studies, highlighting exceptional correlation with the QSAR modeling results.

This study adopts a multidisciplinary approach, including the characterization of the compound through X-ray diffraction. A theoretical model for EMBTh has been established and validated by comparing the results of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) with theoretical calculations from density functional theory (DFT). The molecule’s electronic properties were analyzed using frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), which indicated an energy gap of 3.3 eV, suggesting good kinetic stability. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) identified nucleophilic regions near hydrogen atoms and electrophilic regions close to oxygen atoms. Additionally, intermolecular interactions were examined using a Hirshfeld surface analysis, showing that hydrogen contacts dominate, contributing 89.3%, which includes O···H/H···O, C···H/H···C, and H···H interactions. In contrast, examining intramolecular interactions through non-covalent interaction (NCI-RDG) analysis localized the van der Waals forces, highlighting the steric effects of the rings. Finally, a molecular docking study was performed to assess the anti-eczema potential of the EMBTh compound.

    "abstract": "In the context of pharmacological intervention for pain, Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid, member 1 (TRPV1), as a non-selective cation channel belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels, has emerged as a promising target. However, the availability of selective TRPV1 antagonists and their associated pharmacological properties remains limited. This research paper explores various QSAR modeling techniques applied to a range of piperazinyl-aryl compounds acting as TRPV1 antagonists. The descriptors utilized in the creation of conformation-independent QSAR models included local molecular graph invariants and the SMILES notation, along with the incorporation of the Monte Carlo optimization method as a model development technique. Several statistical methods were employed to evaluate the quality, robustness, and predictive capacity of the developed models, yielding positive results. For the best developed QSAR model following statistical parameters were obtained for training set R2 = 0.7155, CCC = 0.8134, IIC = 0.7430, Q2 = 0.6970, RMSE = 0.645, MAE = 0.489 and F = 157; and for test set R2 = 0.9271, CCC = 0.9469, IIC = 0.9635, Q2 = 0.9241, RMSE = 0.367, MAE = 0.329 and F = 328. Additionally, molecular fragments derived from SMILES notation descriptors, which explain observed changes in the evaluated activity, were identified, leading to the design of four new antagonists. The final validation of the QSAR model and the designed antagonists was conducted through molecular docking, which demonstrated strong correlation with the QSAR modeling results.",

The hydrophobic effect is determined by the concentration of Tung Oil and the duration of a thermal drying process. The hydrophobic effect is investigated by capillary rise tests and contact angle measurements. Scanning electron microscopy SEM is used to investigate the surface topography of the fiber material and the deposited hydrophobic material.

From the molecules studied it is evident that SDZ act as the most electro-active agent, possessing the highest biological activity.

The effects of pH and generation size of JCPDs were also investigated. Extent of binding (EOB) data can be appropriately expressed by a tetradentate coordination for JCPDs at pH 9 where the maximum removal of metal ions was observed. At pH 9.0, the affinity of both generations towards heavy metal ions was also observed in the decreasing order of Zn(II) &gt; Co(II) &gt; Ni(II) &gt; Cu(II) &gt; Cd(II). Results revealed that the highest total binding capacity was observed for G3-NH 2 (262.79 ± 1.62 mg/g) as a little bit higher than that of G4-NH 2 (257.27 ± 2.57 mg/g). EOB studies also proved the active contribution of amide groups to metal binding ability of PAMAMs. Both generations were selective towards Cu(II) ions at lower pH 5 and pH 7.

According to the cyclic voltammetry studies, Ni- Cu alloy compared to pure nickel can demonstrate a significantly higher response for ethanol oxidation. So, the enhancement of the anodic peak current corresponding to the oxidation of nickel hydroxide was accompanied with attenuated cathodic current in the presence of ethanol. The anodic peak currents have a linearly dependence on the square root of scan rate which is the characteristic of diffusion-controlled processes. Based on the chronoamperometry measurements, the reaction exhibited a Cottrellian behavior and the diffusion coefficient of ethanol was found to be 1.26 - 10-5 cm2 s-1. The impedance spectroscopy declared electro-catalytic behavior of Ni-Cu electrode for oxidation of ethanol and showed that the charge transfer resistance decreases by increasing the ethanol concentration.",

We also review the recent developments in the large-scale hepatic computational models where we focus on object-oriented models as a part of our research. The object-oriented modelling approach is beneficial in efforts to describe the interactions between the tissues, such as how metabolism of the liver interacts with metabolism of other tissues via blood. Importantly, this modelling approach can account as well for transcriptional and post-translational regulation of metabolic reactions which is a difficult task to achieve. The current and potential clinical applications of large-scale hepatic models are also discussed.

Using amperometric current-time (i-t) curve, the proposed sensor provided a wider linear range (0.5–2500 μM) and a lower detection limit (0.1 μM) towards nitrite compared with the method of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). This analytical method gave good selectivity in the practical measurement of nitrite in pickles.",

In our present work we studied the influence of iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) surface driers with strontium (Sr) through drier on the film formation of HS alkyd coatings. The kinetics of autoxidation was analysed using FT-IR spectroscopy. Further, applicative properties like drying time and film hardness were examined. In the end, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the quality of cured HS alkyd coating films after exposure in the humidity chamber. It was established that the addition of the Sr drier to surface driers accelerates the film formation process. As higher amounts of the Sr drier were added, final drying times were reduced and film hardness increased. The highest quality of cured films were observed for Co/Sr and Fe/Sr drier combination at 1:1 concentration ratio.",

The introduction of a dynamic combinatorial chemistry method served as a step forward due to the involvement of biological macromolecular targets (receptors) in the synthesis of high affinity products. The major breakthrough was a synthetic method in which building blocks are irreversibly combined due to the presence of a receptor. Here we present various receptor-based combinatorial chemistry approaches. Huisgen's cycloaddition (1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azides and alkynes) forms stabile 1,2,3-triazoles with very high receptor affinity that can reach femtomolar levels, as the case with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors shows. Huisgen's cycloaddition can be applied to various receptors including acetylcholinesterase, acetylcholine binding protein, carbonic anhydrase-II, serine/threonine-protein kinase and minor groove of DNA.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a chromium speciation and preconcentration method with the use of the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) technique. This method is based on single-drop microextraction (SDME) technique. Nowadays the microextractions have become popular, because low amount of organic solvent needs to be used for the separation. The sample was introduced into the extraction cell with a single chloroform droplet. For the separation and enrichment of chromium species, an ion-pair forming compound was used. After the extraction, the chromium content of the droplet was determined by GFAAS. The analytical sensitivity of the standard SDME technique was improved by increasing the volume of organic phase and by sample recirculation. Because of the increased contact area and the developed extraction device, the stability of droplet was markedly increased. As an application we have determined the Cr(VI) content of sea water by the GFAAS technique using these separation/enrichment methods. Under the optimized extraction conditions, the linear range, detection limit ( S/N = 3) and precision (RSD, n = 3) for Cr(VI) were 0.14 – 5.00 μg/L, 0.042 μg/L, and ≤ 3.0%, respectively. The advantages of this method are the following: cost efficiency, the high enrichment of chromium species and easy usage with the GFAAS technique. Therefore the concentration of the chromium species can be determined at the ng/L level.",

    "abstract": "Integrins are plasma membrane proteins, whose dysfunction frequently results in cancer pathology, and therefore they represent important targets of anti-tumour therapy. Snake venoms are a rich source of disintegrins (Dis), proteins that specifically bind integrins and thus interfere with their functions. In an attempt to discover new molecules for treatment of breast cancer, the major type of cancer in women, we isolated a dimeric Dis (Vaa-Dis) from the venom of the nosehorned viper. By cell viability testing we demonstrated that 50 nM and higher concentrations of Vaa-Dis were toxic to highly invasive human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. Wound-healing assay revealed that already at one order of magnitude lower concentrations Vaa-Dis efficiently inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration. This exposed a promising anti-metastatic potential of Vaa-Dis and a good perspective of these natural snake venom proteins for further research and development towards the application in breast cancer treatment.",

This paper focuses on how submicroscopic representations (SMRs) are integrated into Slovenian chemistry textbook sets with respect to the curriculum topics for 8th and 9th Grade. Textbook set analysis is based on four holistic SMRs descriptors (direct, indirect, combined descriptor, and SMRs without descriptors), which support learners' recognition of SMRs' informational value at different levels by providing different accompanying SMRs add-ons. The textbook sets analysis revealed that the number of SMRs varies significantly with regard to different curriculum topics. The overall proportion of the descriptors that enable the learner a direct recognition of SMRs is low in all curriculum topics. Interestingly, the descriptors that do not enable the learners a direct recognition of SMRs prevail in textbook sets. To obtain more detailed insight into the criteria based on which the textbook authors integrate SMRs with various descriptors into textbook sets, further studies are necessary.",

Thermodynamic parameters that characterize the process indicated that the adsorption is spontaneous and endothermic. The values for the separation factor, R L were less than one which confirms that the adsorption process was favorable. Equilibrium data fitted well to the Langmuir model with a higher adsorption capacity of soy bran (74.07 mg g -1 ) towards arsenic(V) ions than mustard husk (65.79 mg g -1 ).

According to students’ achievements in solving these tasks at different levels of education, their explanations were identified. To explain in greater detail how students attempted to solve the authentic tasks, an eye-tracking method was used to identify the differences in the total fixation durations on specific areas of interest at the specific SMRs between successful and unsuccessful students in three age groups. A total of 79 students participated in this research. The data were collected with a structured interview conducted with students when solving three authentic tasks displayed on the computer screen. The tasks comprise text (as problem and questions), macro-images (photos of the phenomena) and SMRs of the phenomena. The eye-tracker was also used to measure the students’ gaze fixations at the particular area of interest. The results show that successful students’ justifications for a correct SMR include macroscopic and sub-microscopic representations of the chosen concepts. Along different stages of education, the selection success increases and sufficient justifications comprise the sub-microscopic level. It could be concluded that there are mostly no significant differences between successful and unsuccessful students within the same age group in the total fixation duration at the correct SMR. Further studies are needed to investigate the information-processing strategies between high and low achievers in solving various authentic tasks comprising SMRs and those that integrate all three levels of the representation of chemical concepts.",

Characterization study of these methyl ( 1 ), ethyl ( 2 ) isopropyl ( 3 ) and n -butyl ( 4 ) ester of 4-((4-chlorophenylsulfonamido)methyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid was done by using FTIR, NMR mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. The compounds were optimized with Gaussian software according to basis set B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and their different parameters related to structure were calculated. Furthermore, all compounds of the series were screened for their in vitro biological applications involving anti-bacterial ( Chromohalobactor salixgens , Halomonas halofila , Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus subtilis , and Shiegella sonnei ), anti-fungal ( Aspergillus niger ), anti-oxidant (DPPH scavenging activity) and enzyme inhibition (acetylcholine esterase and butyrylcholine esterase) study. Sulfonamide based esters were also docked against selected enzymes (AChE and BChE) using MOE software for their mode of binding. Results obtained from these biological evaluations showed that such compounds have potential against targeted activity.",

    "abstract": "Despite being around for more than 40 years, DNA sequencing is regarded as young technology in clinical medicine. As sequencing is becoming cheaper, faster and more accurate, it is rapidly being incorporated into clinical laboratories. In 2003, the completion of the first human genome opened the door to personalized medicine. Ever since it has been expected for genomics to widely impact clinical care and public health. However, many years can pass for genomic discoveries to reflect back and benefit the patients. DNA sequencing represents a less biased approach to diagnostics. It is not only a diagnostic tool, but can also influence clinical management and therapy. As new technologies rapidly emerge it is important for researchers and health professionals to have basic knowledge about the capabilities and drawbacks of the existing sequencing methods, and their use in clinical setting and research. This review provides an overview of nucleic acid sequencing technologies from historical perspective and later focuses on clinical utilization of sequencing. Some of the most promising areas are presented with selected examples from Slovenian researchers.",

To unravel the role of Tyr residues in α-synuclein fibrillation, we prepared recombinant N-terminal (Y39A) and C-terminal (Y(125,133,136)A) mutants of α-synuclein and examined their fibrillation propensities by thioflavin T and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) fluorescent probes, SDS-PAGE and atomic force microscopy. We demonstrate that in contrast to wild-type α-synuclein, both mutants show large, but comparable delays in the fibrillation process and exhibit enhanced hydrophobicity during fibril-like assembly. Both Tyr mutants form fibril-like structures after prolonged incubation periods, which are morphologically distinct from those of the wild-type protein. Our results suggest that the N-terminal and C-terminal Tyr residues of α-synuclein are important primarily for the initiation of the fibrillation process.",

Thus, the reaction of 1 with cyclohexanone and either of benzaldehyde, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde or 4-chlorobenzaldehyde gave the annulated derivatives 2a-c, respectively. The antitumor evaluations of the newly synthesized products against the three cancer cell lines MCF-7 (breast adeno-carcinoma), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer) and SF-268 (CNS cancer) showed that compounds 2b, 6, 11b, 11c, 12b, 16a, 16b and 18a exhibited optimal cytotoxic effect against cancer cell lines, with IC50 values in the nM range. Bioactive compounds are often toxic to shrimp larvae. Thus, in order to monitor these chemicals in vivo lethality to shrimp larvae (Artemia salina), Brine-Shrimp Lethality Assay was used. Compounds 11b, 12b and 16b showed no toxicity against the tested organisms.",

The concentration range was between 0.1 - 5 mmol/L, the pH range was between 1.8 and 10.5; the stirring time was between 2 and 60 min; and the amount of resin was between 0.025 and 0.15 g.

The rate constant values for samarium(III) adsorption were calculated for both film and particle diffusion processes. It is observed to follow the order (Na+)>(H+). Temperature is found to have an insignificant effect on both diffusional processes. Various thermodynamic parameters (ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG°) from samarium(III) exchange on the resin were calculated. The optimum conditions were found to be a concentration of 1 mmol/L, pH of 9.3, stirring time of 20 and 5 min for Amberlite IRC-50 (H+) and (Na+) forms, respectively, and 0.15 g of resin.

The lanthanide ions in both compounds are eight coordinated and show a square antiprism geometry. The mercury ions exhibit various coordination motifs. Compound 1 exhibits ultraviolet upconversion photoluminescence emission, whereas compound 2 displays red photoluminescence. The photoluminescence emissions arise from the characteristic 4f electron intrashell transitions of the 6P7/2 → 8S7/2 of the Gd3+ ions in compound 1 and the 4F9/2 → 4I9/2, 4F7/2 + 4S3/2→ 4I9/2, 4F5/2 + 2H9/2→ 4I9/2, 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 of the Nd3+ ions in compound 2.

The need to reduce the time from product discovery to market introduction is an inherent concern. In order to achieve the prescribedproduct quality characteristics, the process of engineering experimentation has to be optimized. Therefore, an experimental design method for crystallization processes is presented in this paper. Initially, the standardized Taguchi method was used to plan a minimum number of experiments. After identifying the working levels of the design factors and the main performance characteristics of the product under study, the method can be successfully applied to the crystallization processes. The simultaneous variations of the main crystallization parameters and their interactions were investigated using orthogonal array technique. A statistical analysis of 'signal-to-noise' ratio was followed by performing a variance analysis. After developing some special criteria, which depend on performance objectives, the optimal levels of the design factors were determined.\r\nCrystallization of $KNO_3$ with desirable particle size as a performance characteristic was used to illustrate the design procedure. The effects of rotational frequency of the stirrer, linear cooling rate and added admixture on final particle size were studied. In order to keep the selected parameters constant during the experiment and to ensure reproduction of entire experiment the automated reaction calorimeter RC1 was used.",

The following 13 physical chemical parameters were regularly controlled: temperature, pH, conductivity, nitrate, AOX (adsorbable organic halogens), metals such as chromium, pesticides (desethyl atrazine, atrazine and 2,6-dichlorobenzamide), highly-volatile halogenated hydrocarbons (trichlorometane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and 1,1,2-trichloroethene). For handling the results different chemometrics methods were employed, such as basic statistical methods for the determination of mean and median values, standard deviations, minimal and maximal values of measured parameters and their mutual correlation coefficients, cluster analysis (CA), the principal component analysis (PCA), the clustering method based on Kohonen neural network, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

An increase in the conversion and in the reaction rate was observed as the CALB/substrate ratio, temperature and pressure, were increased from 4.3 to 19.9, from 40 °C to 80 °C and from 8 MPa to 10 MPa, respectively.

    "abstract": "Density functional calculations were performed on the metal complexes formed during the synthesis of barium zirconate (BZY). This compound has been synthesized previously, but the molecular interactions present during the formation of the ligand–metal complexes are unknown. In this study, calculations were carried out to determine the preferred coordination sites for the metal complexes. The cations Ba 2+ , Y 3+ , and Zr 4+ were modeled to interact with two deprotonated chelating agents (citric acid [CA] and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]) at strategic positions. Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level of theory with basis set 6-31G* and Universal Gaussian Basis Set (UGBS) was used. The relevant geometries, binding energies, and charge distributions of the complexes are reported. It was found that both CA and EDTA can bind the metal cations investigated in this study. Metal cations prefer to form bonds at the electron-rich sites of the chelating agents. Of the three metal cations considered, Zr 4+ was found to possess the strongest bonds to deprotonated CA and EDTA, followed by Y 3+ and then Ba 2+ .",

AAXAD-4 resin was used as an efficient solid phase for the preconcentration and speciation of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) ions by column technique. The concentration of chromium species was determined by microsample injection system-flame atomic absorption spectrometer (MIS-FAAS). Selective retention of Cr(III) ions was achieved at pH 8.0 and eluted using 1.0 mL of 3.0 mol L –1 HCl and 1.0 mL of 2.0 mol L –1 NaOH, successively, at the flow rate of 5.0 mL min –1 . The maximal sorption capacity of AAXAD-4 resin for Cr(III) ions was found to be 67.0 mg g –1 . The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) for Cr(III) ions were found to be 0.041 and 0.131 µg L –1 , respectively, with preconcentration factor (PF) of 375 and relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3.75% (n=11). The method was validated using certified reference materials (CRMs) and successfully applied to the real samples, spiked with Cr(III) and Cr(VI) ions.",

The dialdehyde monomers differ only in the orientation of the aromatic ring (ortho or para) and were synthesized by condensation reaction between aromatic aldehyde and 1,6-dibromohexane. The molecular mass of the monomers was recorded through E.I mass spectrum. The polymers structures were confirmed by elemental microanalysis, FT-IR, 1 HNMR and UV-Vis Spectroscopy. The morphology of monomers and polymers was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All the polymers were soluble in DMSO (on heating) and somewhat in other solvents. Thermal stability of polymers was analyzed by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA), all the polymers showed good thermal stability higher than their corresponding monomers. The TG of polymers indicated maximum rate of weight loss (T max ) within 412-708 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra of polymers were recorded and the results indicated that all the polymers were photo-responsive and indicated 1 to 4 emission bands with maximum within 349-606 nm. The limit of detection of polymers was within 0.625-1.25 µg/ml. The polymers were also examined for their antimicrobial activities against bacteria and fungi.",

Electron-withdrawing groups cause a decrease in PA and PDE and a rise in BDE, IP and ETE. Dependences of studied reaction enthalpies on Hammett constants can be considered linear. In the case of HAT and SPLET mechanisms, we have found linear dependences between corresponding enthalpies (BDE, PA, ETE) and length of phenolic C‐O bond.

    "abstract": "For a variety of biological and medical reasons, the ongoing development of humane caspase-2 inhibitors is of vital importance. Herein, a hybrid (Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics - QM/MM), two-layered molecular model is derived in order to understand better the affinity and specificity of peptide inhibitor interaction with caspase-2. By taking care of both the unique structural features and the catalytic activity of human caspase-2, the critical enzyme residues (E217, R378, N379, T380, and Y420) with the peptide inhibitor are treated at QM level (the Self-Consistent-Charge Density-Functional Tight-Binding method with the Dispersion correction (SCC-DFTB-D)), while the remaining part of the complex is treated at MM level (AMBER force field). The QM/MM binding free energies (BFEs) are well-correlated with the experimental observations and indicate that caspase-2 uniquely prefers a penta-peptide such as VDVAD. The sequence of VDVAD is varied in a systematic fashion by considering the physicochemical properties of every constitutive amino acid and its substituent, and the corresponding BFE with the inhibition constant ( K i ) is evaluated. The values of K i for several caspase-2:peptide complexes are found to be within the experimental range (between 0.01 nM and 1 μM). The affinity order is: VELAD ( K i =0.081 nM) &gt; VDVAD ( K i =0.23 nM) &gt; VEIAD ( K i =0.61 nM) &gt; VEVAD ( K i =3.7 nM) &gt; VDIAD ( K i =4.5 nM) etc. An approximate condition needed to be satisfied by the kinetic parameters (the Michaelis constant - K M and the specificity constant - k cat / K M ) for competitive inhibition is reported. The estimated values of k cat / K M , being within the experimentally established range (between 10 -4 and 10 -1 μM -1 s -1 ), indicate that VELAD and VDVAD are most specific to caspase-2. These two particular peptides are nearly 1.5, 3 and 4 times more specific to the receptor than VEIAD, VEVAD and VDIAD respectively. Additional kinetic threshold, aimed to discriminate tightly bound inhibitors, is given.",

The removal of heavy metals Cd(II) and Pb(II) by the synthesized materials Na-MnO2, Urchin-MnO2 and Cocoon-MnO2 according to the mineral structure and nature of the sites were also studied. Kinetically, the lamellar manganese oxide material Na-MnO2 was the most efficient of the three materials which had more vacancies in the MnO6 layers as well as in the space between the layers. The nanomaterials Urchin-MnO2 and Cocoon-MnO2 could exchange with the metal cations in their tunnels and cavities, respectively. The maximum adsorbed quantities followed the order (Pb(II): Na-MnO2 (297 mg/g)&gt;Urchin-MnO2 (264 mg/g)&gt;Cocoon-MnO2 (209 mg/g), Cd(II): Na-MnO2 (199 mg/g)&gt;Urchin-MnO2 (191 mg/g)&gt;Cocoon-MnO2 (172 mg/g)).

In the present featured paper the similarity and differences between common, “classical” electrolytes and common surfactants and ionic liquids along with the surface-active ionic liquids are discussed in order to stress their significance and point out on their weak points. A short survey of the literature data reveals namely that ionic liquids in solutions behave like “classical” electrolytes and can be described by existing models in the range of their validity. There is still a lack of models describing well the concentrated electrolyte solutions and here ionic liquids, less limited by solubility as common electrolytes, can serve as model systems. The micellization of surface-active ionic liquids in aqueous solutions can be described in the same way as for common surfactants, but surface-active ionic liquids offer more possibilities to study specific ion and isomer effects. They are also quite promising systems to study the aggregation processes in non-aqueous solutions.",

Additionally, the influence of sample preparation (frozen storage/drying) was evaluated. Extraction was performed in 60% ethanol with 0.15% HCl at a solvent-to-sample ratio of 15/1. Our results show that the ultrasonic pretreatment proved particularly useful for the recovery of high amounts of total anthocyanins in freeze-dried samples, ascorbic acid in frozen and oven air-dried samples, and total antioxidant capacity in freeze-dried and oven air-dried samples. The total phenolics content was not significantly influenced by the ultrasonic pretreatment. Freeze-drying increased the content of targeted compounds, to a very high significant level (p < 0.001) for anthocyanins and ascorbic acid. Oven air-drying at 45 °C drastically decreased the ascorbic acid content. Ultrasonication enhanced the extraction yield of black currant valuable compounds in strong relation to the operating conditions.",

    "abstract": "The presence of dye molecules in water resources has harmful effects on environment. Therefore, it is important to remove dyes from wastewater using eco-friendly materials. In this study, adsorptive removal of diazo dye Direct Red 28 (DR-28) and tetra azo dye Direct Black 22 (DB-22) was investigated by using a new composite, kaolin supported zinc ferrite (KZF) as adsorbent. Characteristics of the composite, KZF were determined using various techniques such as FTIR, SEM, XRD, VSM, and EDS/Mapping. The adsorption of DR-28 and DB-22 on KZF was studied as a function of contact time, initial dye concentration, adsorbent amount, temperature, initial pH of the solution as well as the heat treatment of the composite. The removal of DR-28 was found to be 92.4% for the KZF concentration of 1g/200mL, initial dye concentration of 20 mg/L, contact time of 120 min at original pH and 21 °C. On the other hand the removal of DB-22 was found to be 91.7% under the same conditions at 40 °C. The results showed that Langmuir isotherm is suitable for the adsorption of DR-28 and DB-22 on KZF under given conditions. It was found that adsorption of DR-28 on KZF was exothermic while that of DB-22 was endothermic. The enthalpy changes (ΔH0) for the adsorption of DR-28 and DB-22 dyes on KZF were found to be –24.59 kJ/mol and 61.95 kJ/mol respectively. ΔS0 for the adsorption of DR-28 dye was found to be negative while ΔS0 for the adsorption of DB-22 was positive. The kinetic data fitted well to the pseudo second order model for the adsorption of DR-28 and DB-22 on KZF composite. These results showed that the prepared adsorbent KZF could be used as an adsorbent for the efficient removal of anionic dyes.",

The electroactivity of lactoferrin was studied by three various electrochemical methods (linear sweep, differential pulse and square wave voltammetry). Based on the results obtained, we utilized flow injection analysis with electrochemical detection (FIA-ED) for determination of lactoferrin. We found out that the most suitable FIA-ED conditions were as follows: working electrode potential of 900 mV, Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 4.5) as the mobile phase, its flow rate 1 ml min -1 . Finally, we attempted to follow the changes of lactoferrin signal in the presence of chemical compounds or under the physical conditions leading to changes in its structure.

Appropriate statistical methods and different chemometric tools were used to evaluate the obtained data, namely, (i) descriptive statistics, (ii) principal component analysis (PCA), (iii) cluster analysis, and (iv) linear discriminant analysis (LDA). It was confirmed that Slovenian natural mineral water samples differ most from the German ones but are relatively similar to the Czech and Hungarian ones. Water samples from Hungary are similar to waters from the eastern part of Slovenia.",

    "abstract": "Mutagenic impurities (MIs) are of serious concern for pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies and public health. The first guideline addressing the control of genotoxic impurities (GTIs) dates back to 2006. Since then there have been several updates and refinements, which eventually resulted in the guideline, published by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) in June 2014. The ICH M7 guideline, compared to previous ones, offers greater flexibility in terms of control strategies for GTIs in drug substances. More specifically, it describes a control strategy that relies on process controls in lieu of analytical testing which is based on understanding the process chemistry and process parameters that impact the levels of GTIs. This principle is adopted in the theoretical purge factor determination tool proposed by Teasdale et al. Several case studies applying the proposed theoretical purge factor determination tool were published in recent years. The results confirm the tool's good predictability of the extent to which the impurity is removed by the process. Hopefully, this approach will soon be released as an in-silico tool, generally accepted by the regulatory agencies.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, a newly developed method based on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) was optimized for the simultaneous determination of antazoline hydrochloride (ANZ) and naphazoline hydrochloride (NFZ) in ophthalmic formulations. Isocratic separation of ANZ and NFZ was performed at 40 °C with an ACE Excel 2 C18-PFP column (2 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min-1 whereas the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/phosphate buffer (60:40, v/v, pH 3.0) containing 0.5% triethylamine. Both analytes were detected at a wavelength of 285 nm and the injection volume was 1.0 μL. The overall run time per sample was 4.5 min with retention time of 0.92 and 1.86 min for NFZ and ANZ, respectively. The calibration curve was linear from 0.500-100 μg mL-1 for ANZ and NFZ with a correlation coefficient ≥ 0.9981 while repeatability and reproducibility (expressed as relative standard deviation) were lower than 1.28 and 2.14%, respectively. In comparison with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the developed UHPLC method had remarkable advantages over HPLC as the run time was significantly reduced by 3.4-fold with a 5-fold decreased solvent consumption. Forced degradation studies indicated a complete separation of the analytes in the presence of their degradation products providing high degree of method specificity. The proposed UHPLC method was demonstrated to be simple and rapid for the determination of ANZ and NFZ in commercially available ophthalmic formulations providing recoveries between 99.6 and 100.4%.",

The synthetic procedure used successfully produced single-phased, homogeneous ZnFe 2 O 4 , CoFe 2 O 4 , and Co 0.75 Zn 0.25 Fe 2 O 4 , as well as mixed oxides, whose composition depended both on the duration of the high energy ball milling and the ratio Zn(II)/Co(II). The formation of spinel-like structures was proved by XRD, Mössbauer spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. For the characterization of the samples low-temperature N 2 adsorption, UV/Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were applied. The energy band gap of the samples was calculated, suggesting they are promising photocatalysts. The decomposition of the Malachite Green in model water solutions under UV-light irradiation was successfully achieved in the presence of the samples as photocatalysts. The highest rate constant was obtained for the sample synthesized at longer milling time in combination with higher Zn(II)/Co(II) ratio. The photocatalytic activity of the ternary mixed oxides was compared with the pure hematite, α-Fe 2 O 3 , and the binary ZnFe 2 O 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 ferrites with spinel structure that were treated in the same way. A synergetic effect of α-Fe 2 O 3 and the spinel-like structure on the photocatalytic properties of ternary mixed metal oxide was detected.",

The electronic absorption spectrum of complex is also different and the mode and extent of DNA-binding ability of complex are significantly altered owing to the presence of suitably substituted fluorine.

    "abstract": "Chlorpyrifos (CPS) is a toxic pesticide present in several pesticide formulations, with low degradability by natural processes. The degradation leads to the toxic metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO). The analytical techniques used for the CPS and CPO analysis, like UPLC-PDA and GC-MS, are accurate but also expensive and time consuming, and they need sample pretreatment. In the search of a more rapid and simple analytical procedure, atmospheric solids analysis probe with mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS) was optimized for the determination of CPS and CPO in apples ( Malus domestica „Idared”). The identification of the analytes was based on protonated ion and isotopic pattern, while the quantification was based on peak intensities. The obtained results were confirmed by re-validated UPLC-PDA and GC-MS techniques. CPS and CPO concentrations determined by ASAP-MS and UPLC-PDA showed moderate discrepancies (on average by 10-20%), thus demonstrating that ASAP-MS can be a semiquantitative tool for the quantification of these compounds. As additional goal of this work, the efficiency of a gamma irradiation treatment to remove CPS and CPO from apples was tested by analyzing their content before and after the irradiation: 89-99% of CPS and CPO were degraded with doses of 3.5-3.8 kGy and 66-72 h of irradiation per sample. Identical degradation results were obtained by UPLC-PDA and ASAP-MS, indicating that the latter technique is well suitable to rapidly check pesticide degradation in apples.",

For this reason, we implemented a methodology containing nine detailed successive steps that include a quantitative structure–activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) study performed to develop a model that relate s the structures of 190 pesticides compounds to their n-octanol–water partition coefficients ( logk ow ). We used the unique atomic signatures which represent the structures and acts as independent variables while the property ( logk ow ) as the dependent variable. The model was constructed using 130 molecules as training set, and predictive ability tested using 60 compounds. Modeling of logk ow of these compounds as a function of the signatures descriptors was established by multiple linear regression (MLR) using (LOO) cross-validation. As a result, a QSAR/QSPR equation with 14 atomic signatures was hereby obtained with a R 2 =0.659273, Q 2 =0.65617 and RMSE training = 0.930192, s=1.37297 for the training set and in leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation experiment set value, q 2 =0.605676, RMSE LOO = 1.0936 respectively.

In the nickel complex, there are three bridges across the Ni-Ni atom pairs, involving two phenolate O atoms of a Schiff base ligand, and an O–C–O moiety of a μ 2 -η 1 :η 1 -OAc group. The central Ni atom is located on an inversion center and has octahedral coordination involving four bridging O atoms from two Schiff base ligands in the equatorial plane and two O atoms from two μ 2 -η 1 :η 1 -OAc ligands in the axial positions. The coordination around the terminal Ni atoms is also octahedral, with two imino N and two phenolate O atoms from a Schiff base ligand defining the equatorial plane, and with two O atoms respectively from a μ 1 -η 1 :η 0 -OAc and a μ 2 -η 1 :η 1 -OAc ligands occupying the axial positions.

The characterization of the synthesized catalysts was carried out by XRD, TEM, XPS, FT-IR, and ICP-OES analyses. The increased basicity of the Bi 2 O 3 -Co 3 O 4 hybrids contributed to the much better catalytic activity in PMS activation resulting in a considerably higher rate of AO7 degradation compared to that obtained with bare Co 3 O 4 . The sample with 50 wt.% Bi 2 O 3 showed the best performance under a broad pH range with very low Co leaching of 72 mg/L even under acidic conditions. Degradation of 50 mg/L AO7 reached almost 100% within a short duration of 12 min by using very low catalysts concentration of 0.1 g/L and [PMS]/[AO7] = 6. The influence of the Bi 2 O 3 content, catalyst dosage, molar ratio of [PMS]/[AO7], initial pH, and temperature on AO7 degradation were studied. Surface-bound sulfate radicals generated in the Bi 2 O 3 -Co 3 O 4 /PMS oxidation system were proved as the predominant radical species through radical quenching experiments.",

On the other hand, its efficiency as photocatalyst is limited since it can only be excited under UV-light radiation and has a rapid electron-hole recombination that occurs during the photodegradation. There are many studies focusing on adjusting the synthesis methods, addition of dopants and modifying the TiO2 structure to enhance its photocatalytic performance. Among them, synthesis of TiO2 as porous nanoparticles as one of the strategies in modifying the TiO2 structure has gained attention due to its benefits for better adsorption and accessibility of various pollutants onto the reactive site of catalyst, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance. In this review, we recapitulated on modifications of synthesis methods for TiO2 and their effect on the structure along with the photocatalytic performance. Recent progress for TiO2 in terms of synthesis approaches, effect of dopants, modified structures, and applications are also briefly discussed in this review.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the nano-sepiolite modified carbon paste electrode (CCPE) was prepared for the determination of ketoconazole (KC). The effects of pH, the proportion of the electrode modifier, deposition potential, and deposition time were investigated. Ketoconazole shows one irreversible oxidation peak at about the potential value of 0.6–0.7 V at different pH values. CV studies show that the modified electrode performed a catalytic effect on the peak signal of KC compared to the bare electrode. This catalytic behavior of CCPE was used for the development of a sensitive detection method. The impact of pH and scan rates on the anodic peak potentials and currents were examined, and the scan rate results show that the oxidation behavior of KC was controlled by the adsorption process at the CCPE surface. Therefore, adsorptive stripping differential pulse voltammetry (AdsDPV) and adsorptive stripping square wave voltammetry (AdsSWV) methods were developed for KC analysis. The two different linear ranges were obtained as (0.1-1.0) nM and (3.0-10.0) nM for AdsDPV, and (0.1–10.0) nM and (3.0–10.0) nM for AdsSWV, respectively. The detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) limits were found to be 0.017 nM and 0.056 nM for AdsDPV and 0.025 nM and 0.083 nM for AdsSWV, respectively. Besides, the proposed new sensor has obtained very high recovery values in the analysis of KC in the pharmaceutical shampoo.",

In order to validate this principle, changes in the magnetizability (Δξ) and its cube-root (Δξ1/3) are computed at B3LYP/LanL2DZ level of theory for some elementary chemical reactions. The principle is found to be valid for 77% of reactions under study. It is observed that the molecules with the lowest sum of ξ or ξ1/3 are generally the most stable. The principle fails to work in the presence of hard species. A comparative study is also made with change in hardness (Δη), electrophilicity index (Δω), polarizability (Δα) and their cube-roots (Δη1/3, Δω1/3, Δα1/3). It is observed that the Minimum Magnetizability Principle is nearly as reliable as Minimum Electrophilicity Principle.

    "abstract": "In this reported work, an anodically pretreated boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode was used for the inexpensive, simple and quick detection of a natural dye, lawsone. Lawsone had a well-defined, irreversible and diffusion-controlled oxidation peak at approximately +0.19 V in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 2.5) using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The oxidation peak heights of lawsone were significantly increased in PBS using the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Under optimized experimental conditions, the calibration curve was linear over a concentration range of 0.1-5.0 μM with detection limit of 0.029 μM in 0.1 M PBS (pH 2.5) containing 0.1 mM CTAB by using square-wave voltammetry (SWV). To evaluate the practical applicability of the BDD electrode, it was used for the quantification of lawsone in commercial henna, a natural dye made from the leaves of the henna plant.",

In this work, the indoor pollution of a printing and photocopy center in Ljubljana, Slovenia was investigated. The particle number concentration time series and the particle size distributions were measured continuously for a period of one month by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). Our measurements clearly showed that during operating hours the total number concentration of nanoparticles (size between 15 and 750 nm) increased in both working rooms with laser printers as well as in a room with photocopy machines. In rooms with laser printers the bimodal particle size distribution was frequently observed (i.e. max. at ca. 20 or 30 nm and at ca. 100 nm), with the aged particles persisted in the room over the night and over the weekend. In the photocopy room the situation was different, again with a sharp increase in concentration of small particles (ca 20 nm) and their growth to bigger sizes, but after closing a decrease to the background concentration. The results undoubtedly proved that the fast increase in nanoparticles (size below 50 nm) was associated with processes, the intense laser printing and photocopying activity . Our study also confirmed that the ventilation of the room is a very important factor which affects the life time of aged nanoparticle in the indoor environment.",

Most epitope mapping approaches are labor intensive and costly. In this study, we evaluated panning of phage-displayed random peptide libraries against antibodies as a tool for cognate epitope identification. We used six antibodies directed to three model protein antigens as targets to show that the approach is applicable to both mono- and polyclonal antibodies. The technique is well-suited especially for identification of linear epitopes. Mapping of conformational epitopes is more challenging, tends to be more subjective and requires use of computational tools. Nevertheless, when combined with functional data such as structure-activity relationship of antigen muteins, one can make reliable conformational epitope predictions based on phage display experiment data. As the described approach is fast and relatively inexpensive, we suggest it is employed early in antibody characterization and later validated by complementary methods.",

The liquid-crystalline polyurethane complexes were formed at acid/pyridine molar ratios up to 0.4 exhibiting crystal-smectic and smectic-nematic transitions similar to those of the polyurethane complexes with pendant pyridyl units reported on recently. The analogous low-molar mass urethane complex exhibited lower isotropization temperature and a less ordered smectic phase than the polymeric complexes.",

Denatured albumen was most effectively hydrolysed at 60 °C and pH 8.5. Hydrolysis rate between pH 7 and pH 9 was relatively high and therefore hydrolysis without pH regulation was performed. Bitter peptides, which were formed as a result of Alcalase hydrolysis, were degraded with Flavourzyme, a mixture of fungal exopeptidases and endopeptidases. Degree of hydrolysis over 30 and high yield of peptides soluble over a wide pH range were obtained by combination of peptidases. Hydrolysate, which contained substantial amount of dipeptides and tripeptides was only moderately bitter and had an overall acceptable flavour.",

Analysis of the respective subgroups yielded classification schemes for solvents versus the individual groups of cations. The respective solvent parameters derived from statistical analysis for the subgroups did not depend on each other. Correlations with solvent parameters claiming to account for �solvent softness� were only found for the parameters derived from the subgroup consisting of Ag+ and Hg2+.

The coordination geometry around the Cu(II) ions is five coordinate with a distorted square pyramid geometry, comprising two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom belonging to the bcen ligand and two nitrogen atoms of the cyano groups of two Ni(CN)4 2- units. The distance between the copper ion and the amide oxygen of the dangling arm of an adjacent tetranuclear species is within the expected range for an axial Cu-O bond, and hence suggests that the amide oxygen of an adjacent tetranuclear complex may weakly coordinate to the copper ion in an axial position.

UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was used to study the enhanced photocatalytic activity, which shows the red-shift of the band-edge as compared to ZnO nano particles. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity is possibly due to the synergistic effect of improved adsorptivity of dyes, enhanced visible light absorption and effective charge separation.",

Seven samples of polyaspartic coating with different amounts of nano-silica were prepared and applied to low carbon steel plates. The results showed that only 2% of the nano-silica per total weight formulation gave excellent protective as well as physical properties to the coating. The unique result was non-agglomeration and compatibility of nano-particles with the other compounds in the formulation structure. Time dependant behaviour of the coatings was followed by the EIS, SEM and FTIR methods and by exposure in a salt spray chamber. The main advantage was superior mechanical and chemical resistance and durability of a single coat, the properties that reduce emission of VOC and overall cost of the coating application process",

The electrocatalytic properties of the modified electrode IrO x /GC were evaluated with regards to electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and ascorbic acid (AA). The developed electrode-catalyst have been extensively studied by various electrochemical techniques. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) experiments indicated that the modified electrode possesses excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of both nitrite and AA in neutral medium and offers simultaneous quantification of these substances. Constant potential amperometry studies also were performed – the IrO x /GC showed sensitive response to nitrite (159.7 μA mM –1 cm –2 ) with a wide linear range from 0.002 to 10 mM at 0.77 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl), and to AA (96.2 µA mM –1 cm –2 ) with a linear range from 0.01 to 3 mM at 0.025 V. The detection limit was 0.63 μM nitrite and 4 μM AA, respectively, and both of them had fast response within 5 s. Considering the simple and rapid electrodeposition procedure for preparation, IrO x /GC is a new electrode-catalyst for sensitive and selective quantitative detection of nitrite and AA. The wide linear range, good selectivity, reproducibility of the amperometric response and long-time stability of the IrO x /GC make it a promising sensing material for practical nonenzymatic quantitative detection of nitrite and AA.",

    "abstract": "Targeting guanine (G)-rich DNA sequences, folded into non-canonical G-quadruplex (G4) structures, by small ligand molecules is a potential strategy for gene therapy of cancer disease. BRACO-19 has been recently established as a unique (thermodynamically favorable and highly selective) binder, being involved in the external stacking mode of interaction with a G4-DNA formed in the c-Myc oncogene promoter region (P. M. Mitrasinovic, Croat. Chem. Acta 2019 , 92 , 43-57). Herein, hit-to-lead ligands are identified using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). Search of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases is performed using the key pharmacophore features of BRACO-19. At the very outset, out of a total of 29,009 entries, 95 hits are extracted and evaluated by docking them in the binding sites of G4. Then, 22 hits are chosen by observing the binding free energies. Consequently, 3 hit-to-lead candidates are selected on the basis of structural criteria. Finally, a lead candidate structure is proposed using analog design and considering both the physicochemical requirements for optimal biological activity and a variety of pharmacological standpoints. Implications of the present study for experimental research are discussed.",

The binding modes of these molecules were ascribed through molecular docking studies. These synthesized bi-heterocyclic molecules were identified as potent inhibitors relative to the standard (kojic acid) and compound 5 inhibited the tyrosinase non-competitively by forming an enzyme-inhibitor complex. The inhibition constant K i (0.09 µM) for compound 5 was calculated from Dixon plots. Computational results also displayed that all compounds possessed good binding profile against tyrosinase and interacted with core residues of target protein.",

    "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical secondary structures that fold within guanine (G) rich strands of regulatory genomic regions. Recent evidences suggest their intimate involvement in important biological processes such as telomere maintenance, end-capping and protection, chromosome stability, gene expression, viral integration, and recombination. Mechanistic details of how and why G4 structures influence biological function indicate a rationale for treating G4s as emerging molecular targets for future therapeutics. In other words, the structural heterogeneity with well-defined binding sites, thermal stability and abundance of G4s in telomeres, oncogene promoter regions, and viral genomes make G4s attractive targets for small molecules, aimed to selectively recognize them over all other nucleic acids structures, particularly duplex forms that are most abundant in the genome. Herein, a critical survey of well-characterized G4-interactive ligands as potential tools in anti-cancer and antiviral therapies is presented. Effects that these ligands selectively exert in vitro and in vivo models are summarized. Unique ligands involved in specific G4 recognition are put forward. A key question, how to design and develop new G4 specific ligands that conform to the structural and physicochemical requirements for optimal biological activity, is discussed by considering both remarkable advances over the last few years and our recent contributions.",

On the other hand, its efficiency as photocatalyst is limited since it can only be excited under UV-light radiation and has a rapid electron-hole recombination that occurs during the photodegradation. There are many studies focusing on adjusting the synthesis methods, addition of dopants and modifying the TiO 2 structure to enhance its photocatalytic performance. Among them, synthesis of TiO 2 as porous nanoparticles as one of the strategies in modifying the TiO 2 structure has gained attention due to its benefits for better adsorption and accessibility of various pollutants onto the reactive site of catalyst, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance. In this review, we recapitulated on modifications of synthesis methods for TiO 2 and their effect on the structure along with the photocatalytic performance. Recent progress for TiO 2 in terms of synthesis approaches, effect of dopants, modified structures, and applications are also briefly discussed in this review.",

Seven factors, viz. lignocellulose, glucose, yeast extract, peptone, KH(2)PO(4), MgSO(4) 7H(2)O and MnSO(4) H(2)O at three levels and pH at two levels. OA layout of L18 (2(1) x 3(7)) was selected for the proposed experimental design using Minitab 17 software.

    "abstract": "Density functional theory calculations were carried out in order to study the effects of the adsorption of acrolein molecule on the structural and electronic properties of TiO 2 anatase nanoparticles. The ability of pristine and N-doped TiO 2 anatase nanoparticles to recognize toxic acrolein (C 3 H 4 O) molecule was surveyed in detail. It was concluded that acrolein molecule chemisorbs on the N-doped anatase nanoparticles with large adsorption energy and small distance with respect to the nanoparticle. The results indicate that the adsorption of acrolein on the N-doped TiO 2 is energetically more favorable than the adsorption on the pristine one, suggesting that the N doping can energetically facilitate the adsorption of acrolein on the N-doped nanoparticle. It means that the N-doped TiO 2 nanoparticle can react with acrolein molecule more efficiently. The interaction between acrolein molecule and N-doped TiO 2 can induce substantial variations in the HOMO/LUMO molecular orbitals of the nanoparticle, changing its electrical conductivity which is helpful for developing novel sensor devices for the removal of harmful acrolein molecule. The large overlaps in the projected density of states spectra reveal the formation of chemical bond between two interacting atoms. Charge analysis based on Mulliken charges indicates that charge is transferred from the acrolein molecule to the TiO 2 nanoparticle.",

To screen and study the impact of various formulation and process factors on the critical quality attributes (CQA), the Placket-Burman design and central composite design were utilized. The number of HPH cycles, poloxamer 188 concentration, and tween 80 concentration were shown to be significant parameters (P<0.05), that were further optimized using Central Composite Design. The zeta potential of optimized lyophilized MTX-NS was determined to be -11.6 ± 7.52 mV and the average particle size was 260 ± 0.25 nm. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments revealed a greater than 80% inhibition, with apoptotic cells shrinking, fragmentation, and cell death. Furthermore, the Cmax and AUC0-t were increased by 2.53 and 8.83 folds, respectively. The relative bioavailability of MTX-NS was found to be 8.83 times higher than that of MTX-aqueous dispersion.

The effective usage of Turkish sweetgum bark is a meaningful work for environmental utilization of agricultural residues. The effects of experimental parameters like solution pH, contact time, initial concentration of adsorbate and amount of bisorbent dosage were investigated in a series of batch studies at 25 °C. Taguchi's Orthogonal Array (OA) analysis was used to find the best experimental parameters for the optimum design process in this study. The functional groups and surface properties of biosorbent were characterized by using Fourier transformer infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The experimental data were fitted to Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm models. There is a good agreement between the parameters and this confirms the monolayer adsorption of 2,4-DCP onto sweetgum bark. As a result of kinetic studies, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to be suitable for all the data. Also, the results of the study show that Turkish Sweetgum bark can be potential as a low-cost alternative commercial adsorbents for removal 2,4 dichlorophenol from aqueous solutions.",

For this reason they need to exhibit a superior chemical stability in aqueous media. We have studied the influence of the synthesis parameters on the chemical stability of NaYF4 nanoparticles co-doped with Yb3+ and Tm3+. These nanoparticles have different crystal structures, and were synthesized hydrothermally or with thermal decomposition. The samples were characterized with X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The up-conversion fluorescence of nanoparticles dispersed in water was measured at 400–900 nm. The partial dissolution of the fluorine in water was detected with an ion-selective electrode for all the samples. The dissolution of the other constituent ions was analysed with an optical emission spectrometer using inductively coupled plasma. The nanoparticles with a hexagonal crystal structure and sizes of around 20 nm that were synthesized with thermal decomposition showed a superior chemical stability in water together with a superior up-conversion fluorescence yield.",

Effect of temperature, pressure, type and concentration of the catalyst solution, the steam flow rate or stripping module, the moisture content of the wood particles and geometric characteristics such as size and type of the reactor, particle size and bed height were considered systematically. One stage process was only taken into consideration. Lab-scale and pilot-scale studies were performed. The results of the non-catalysed laboratory experiments were compared with an actual non-catalysed (auto-catalysed) industrial process and with experiments on the pilot scale, the latter with 28% higher furfural yield compared to the others. Application of sulphuric acid as catalyst, in an amount of 0.03-0.05 g (H2SO4 100%)/g d.m. (dry material), enables a higher production of furfural at lower temperature and pressure of steam in a shorter reaction time. Pilot scale catalysed experiments have revealed very good performance for furfural formation under less severe operating conditions, with a maximum furfural yield as much as 88% of the theoretical value.",

However, the role of blood formed elements and gas transmitters in these processes still remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ozone on oxygen transport and the pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance in a red cell suspension. Methods: The red cell suspension was incubated with ozone at a concentration of 6 mg/l and substances affecting the synthesis of gas transmitters (nitroglycerin, sodium hydrosulfide). Parameters of blood oxygen transport and pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance were determined. Results: The effect of ozone on blood oxygen transport was found which was manifested in an increase in oxygen partial pressure and the degree of oxygenation. The index of hemoglobin –oxygen affinity p50 actual was raised and a shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve rightwards was noticed. The addition of the gas transmitter donor, nitric oxide, enhanced the effect of this gas on the parameters of oxygen transport in the erythrocyte suspension Conclusion: We found that ozone induced a change in oxygen-binding properties of the erythrocyte suspension which is a mechanism of action of the above gas on the adaptive processes in the body realized directly at the level of erythrocytes.",

Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis were applied to characterize SiO2-Cys. Using the batch technique, sorption of As(III) ion by SiO2-Cys was studied, and the effects of pH, sorbent dosage, temperature, initial concentration, and contact time were all taken into consideration. According to kinetic studies, the pseudo-second-order equation adequately described the sorption of the As(III) ion. The spontaneity of the sorption process on SiO2-Cys is suggested by the negative values of Gibbs free energy (G°). Positive values of enthalpy (ΔH°) indicate the endothermic adsorption process and the positive values of entropy (ΔS°) for As(III) ions adsorption imply that the adsorption involves increasing randomness. The Langmuir model, which has a maximum sorption capacity for SiO2-Cys of (66.67 mg/g) at 25°C, provided a better fit to the sorption isotherm.",

However, there is a notable absence of available pharmacological data for these substances. To gain a deeper understanding of their pharmacology, we employed the Monte Carlo optimization conformation-independent method as a tool for developing QSAR models. These models were built using optimal molecular descriptors derived from both SMILES notation and molecular graph representations. The resulting QSAR model demonstrated robustness and a high degree of predictability, proving to be very reliable. Moreover, we were able to identify specific molecular fragments that exerted both positive and negative effects on binding activity. This discovery paves the way for the swift prediction of binding activity for emerging benzodiazepines, offering a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional in vitro/in vivo analyses.",

The column operated in a two-phase concurrent upflow mode and also as the liquid-batch. Different concentrations of aqueous solutions of carboxyl methyl cellulose and xanthan took the role of non-Newtonian liquids, and air was used as the gas phase. Due to the experimental conditions most of these experiments were taken in the heterogeneous hydrodynamic regime. The superficial gas velocity affected the gas hold-up most, for both polymer solutions, while the impact of the effective viscosity was much more pronounced in the case of xanthan solutions. The liquid flow rate showed a minor effect on the measured parameter. Finally, empirical correlations for the gas holdup prediction as a function of gas velocity and effective viscosity of the liquid were developed for CMC solutions. The xanthan solutions exhibit a more complex dependence on the prevailing effective liquid viscosity, which still needs to be studied.",

The oxide formation is explained as a sequence of Cu 2 O layer growth, ippl, cationic defect accumulation and Cu(II) adsorption on the oxide/solution interface, and a dissolution/precipitation step similar to the mechanism previously reported in oxalate free solutions. The oxalate adsorption at pH = 9 increases the dissolution rate and a greater thickness of the outer layer, oppl, is obtained. Nevertheless, the oxalate adsorption at pH = 7 decreases the cationic defect on the cuprous oxide/electrolyte interface, promoting the Cu 2 O growth. For copper particles immersed in solutions of pH between 7 and 9, the measured isoelectric point values, iep, (11.8 < iep < 11.5) shifts in the presence of oxalate to pH between 11.6 and 11.0, respectively. This shift in the iep to a lower pH value indicates oxalate adsorption on the Cu/ Cu 2 O particles.",

RDE was made of monocrystal silicon wafer, layered by a thin film of vaporized gold as a substrate. Obtained results shown that the limiting current density is not achieved in citrate and thallium free electrolyte. The rotation speed had significant influence on the process rate at lower temperatures. At elevated temperatures gold deposition occurred in a kinetic domain. Tafel slopes confirmed that the electrochemical reaction occurs in two steps depending on electrode potential and the presence of thallium ions in the electrolyte. The reaction kinetics is changed in the presence of thallium ions, as well. The mechanism of gold deposition is predominantly dependent on the electrolyte composition. In the citrate solution, free of thallium, the adsorption of Au(CN)- and CN- on the electrode surface is presumed, resulting in the formation of AuCNad species, which afterwards are reduced to the metallic gold. In the citrate solution containing thallium, an adsorption of Tl+ ion on the surface is presumed at the potential of -750 mV/SCE, including its catalytic effect as an adatom. The presence of thallium was not confirmed by AES and SEM analyses. Simultaneously, the presence of thallium in a citrate solution shifts the deposition potential to the positive values.",

    "abstract": "The adsorption of arsenic from aqueous solution onto natural and modified zeolites was investigated. The natural zeolites were modified by ion-exchange (NH 4 NO 3 ) and addition of aluminum (Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 ). The natural and modified zeolites were characterized by XRF, XRD, N 2 sorption, FTIR, NH 3 -TPD, zeta potential and SEM. Ion-exchange with NH 4 + of NZ results in the significant exchange of most cations and an increase in surface area and pore volume of samples as well as surface acidity. While the introduction of aluminum into the zeolite increased its As (V) removal amount, it decreased its As (III) removal. Ion-exchange with NH 4 + of the natural zeolite increased significantly its As(III) and As(V) adsorption capacity. The adsorption of both As(III) and As(V) with natural and modified zeolites obeys pseudo second order kinetics. The Langmuir isotherm model for all adsorbents was best fitted to the isotherm data obtained. The highest adsorption capacity for As(III) and As(V) was obtained onto the zeolite modified with ammonia and their calculated qm values are 28.7 mg/g and 36.6 mg/g, respectively. The calculated thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and favorable.",

With the addition of the corrugated cardboard dust into the HDPE and PLA polymer matrix the changes in density, uniformity, chemical structure and transition temperatures of the samples were detected.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to prepare poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), biocomposites with incorporating various percentages of calcium carbonate using extrusion processing. Calcium carbonate was synthesized in the absence and presence of poly(vinyl sulfonic acid). The polymorph and morphology of calcium carbonate chanced with the introduction of poly(vinyl sulfonic acid). The rhombohedral calcite was obtained in the absence of poly(vinyl sulfonic acid). Rhombohedral calcite transformed into spherical vaterite with the addition of poly(vinyl sulfonic acid). The influence of filler contents on the properties of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) composites was studied. The structure and properties of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)/ calcium carbonate biocomposites were investigated by XRD, FTIR, TGA, DSC, SEM, OTR and DMA. The nucleation effect of the calcium carbonate on the crystallization of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) was observed in the DSC and XRD measurements by increasing crystallinity of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate). It was shown that the variation of the barrier properties of biocomposites was influenced by polymorph and morphology of calcium carbonate. The addition of 0.5 wt% of the rhombohedral calcite and spherical vaterite increased the barrier properties by 25% and 12%, respectively compared to neat polymer. The dynamic mechanical properties of composites based on rhombohedral calcite and spherical vaterite in poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) matrix were investigated. The storage modulus increases by adding both particles in the composites over a wide range of temperature (-30 to 150 °C) where the reinforcing effect of calcite and vaterite was confirmed. At the same loading level, rhombohedral calcite led to more increase in the storage modulus, while less increase in storage modulus was observed in the presence of spherical vaterite particles.",

Expectedly, the feruloylation of HlH induced a rearrangement of the protein molecule, a decrease in the α-helical structure at the expense of β-structures was observed. Besides, the FA-HlH conjugates were more prone to aggregation, which is probably due to the stabilization of the partially unfolded protein molecules by non-covalent bonding. Interestingly, the thermal stability of HlH was not affected by the modification. The native and feruloylated HlH were not toxic to normal fibroblasts (BJ cells). We observed a decrease in cell viability of breast cancer MCF-7 cells to about 66% after a 48h exposure to 70 µg/well of FA-HlH-2.",

Synthesized AgNPs were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. The effect of pH on the stability of nanoparticles was investigated. SDS modified silver nanoparticles (SDS-AgNPs) and SDS with β-cyclodextrin modified silver nanoparticles (SDS-CD-AgNPs) demonstrated sensitive and selective colorimetric detection of Mn 2+ and Cr 2+ ions at ppm level, respectively. The prepared SDS-AgNPs and SDS-CD-AgNPs solution showed a color change visible to the naked eye from yellow to orange upon adding Mn 2+ and Cr 2+ ions, respectively; however, other metal ions did not induce such a change. In addition, the results of SEM and DLS for both sensors showed the aggregation of nanoparticles after adding Mn 2+ or Cr 2+ . Overall, the results of this study show the successful synthesis of AgNPs, SDS-AgNPs, and SDS-CD-AgNPs as simple, rapid, sensitive, selective colorimetric sensors with high potential for rapid and on-site detection of Mn 2+ and Cr 2+ ions.",

The exchanged cations are known for their catalytic properties in homogeneous catalysis. The main purpose is to study the effect of the exchanged cations on the yield and the kinetics of the reaction. The characterization of montmorillonite was carried out by XRD, which allows us to follow the evolution of the basal spacing d001 as a function of the exchanged cation and to show that the exchange operation has not altered the montmorillonite structure. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) is determined by the titration of the exchanged cation by atomic absorption. The product of the reaction is characterized by NMR, IR and by the determination of the melting point. In addition, the importance of the introduction order of the reagents into the reaction medium has been demonstrated on the yield and the kinetics. Finally, the obtained results show that the exchanged montmorillonite is competitive with other costly heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts.",

Considering all the methods found in literature, there is not one using infrared spectrometry for quantitative purpose, so the method developed and validated could be considered an innovation and clean alternative. This is due to the fact that it is fast, easy to handle, low cost, and non-toxic as well as generating minimal waste. The method can be applied in the routine analysis of vancomycin dosage form and is an important option for the current and sustainable pharmaceutical analysis.",

Further, to clarify the biosorption mechanism process, the isothermal, kinetic, and thermodynamic parameters were determined. The functional groups and surface morphology of the biosorbent were identified using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy in the absence and presence of hexavalent chromium, respectively. Based on the results, the maximum biosorption capacity was determined as 194.57 mg g–1 under acidic conditions at 45 °C. From the kinetics studies, the biosorption process was observed to follow the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models well.

    "abstract": "12-Monoketocholic acid (12-MKC) shows a promotive effect in the transport of some drugs (lidocaine, morphine, quinine, gliclazide, etc.). In the mechanism of pharmacological action of 12-MKC an important role plays its aggregation (self-association), as well as formation of mixed micelles. These phenomena were studied by the 1 H NMR spin-lattice relaxation method using solutions of sodium salt of 12-MKC in D 2 O and in D 2 O solution saturated with 1-octanol. The function describing the dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1 ) on the concentration of Na-12-MKC (c BA ) in D 2 0 has one inflexion point (at the concentration of 48 mM), whereas the same function for the saturated solution of 1-octanol has two inflexion points (one at the concentration of 45 mM and the other at 87 mM). These differences in the curves T 1 = f(c BA ), as well as the shift of the solubilization curve of lecithin in the presence of 1-octanol towards higher concentrations of Na-12-MKC, indicate that sodium salt of this keto-bile acid forms mixed micelles with 1-ocatnol, so that the application of the micellar solution of Na-12-MKC in the presence of 1-octanol decreases membrane toxicity (membrane lysis) of this bile acid. The curves T 1 = f(c BA ) for methyl esters of 12-MKC and cholic acid in the CDCl 3 solution have one inflexion point at the concentration above 5 mM, indicating formation of the micelles of Small's type, whereas methyl ester of 3,7,12-triketocholic acid forms a gel-like structure.",

According to the results, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, B-type complex has been found to be more stable than the A-type, however, the energy difference is such that B to A conversion could be possible by means of haptotropic shift of the chromium moiety. The interaction energy of the B-type complex is greater then the A-type, supporting the stability of the former over the latter.

The Au particles were deposited under optimum growth conditions for maximum dispersion on polymer film to achieve highly sensitive glucose sensor.

The sensor showed wide linear range from 0.01–8 mM along with swift response time of less than 5 s. Moreover, a high sensitivity of 113.6 A mM-1 cm-2 is obtained along with low detection limits of 0.5 M. The sensor also showed high stability, reproducibility, and repeatability. Furthermore, the sensor has shown high selectivity towards glucose exclusively in the presence of interferents such as sucrose, uric acid, and ascorbic acid. The practical applicability of the proposed sensor was confirmed from successful analysis of glucose in different juice samples and these results were comparable to the commercial glucose meter. Thus, our sensor stands promising non-enzymatic sensor for routine analysis of glucose.",

A powerful experimental method to gain insights on the allergen epitopes is the selection of peptides from biological libraries that bind to anti-allergen antibodies. In this work, we aimed to map IgE epitopes of Amb a 1 using epitope-mimicking short peptides – mimotopes that were affinity-selected from phage-displayed random peptide libraries. The peptides weakly aligned with the Amb a 1 primary sequence, thus suggesting that the epitopes are conformational. When the peptides were mapped onto the surface of Amb a 1 homology model, the EpiSearch analysis predicted the location of four potential epitopic sites on surface patches centred at residues K 104 , S 110 , H 214 , and W 312 . The peptides matching to the predicted epitopes bound selectively to the IgE from pool of ragweed-allergic patients' sera and therefore represent mimetics of Amb a 1 IgE epitopes. The knowledge of IgE epitopes is a prerequisite for the rational design of molecular-based approaches to diagnosis and immunotherapy of allergic diseases.",

Some unique features of the H-SAN are evaluated using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm, SEM and TEM. Conversion and molecular weight determinations were carried out using GC and SEC respectively. Adding of H-SAN by 3 wt% results in decrement of conversion from 94 to 73%. In addition, molecular weight of copolymer chains decreases from 19500 to 16000 g.mol -1 . However, polydispersity index values increases from 1.29 to 1.65. Linear increase of ln(M 0 /M) with time for all the samples shows that copolymerization proceeds in a living manner. Increasing thermal stability of the nanocomposites is demonstrated by TGA. DSC results show a decrease in glass transition temperature from 70.3 to 63.5 °C by addition of 3 wt% H-SAN.",

Benzotriazoles are an important group of emerging pollutants found in low µg/L concentrations, entering the environment through wastewater treatment facilities due to their insufficient removal, and through industrial and other use. Two new dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) methods were developed for the extraction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic benzotriazoles from environmental waters. Liquid chromatographic method coupled to tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated for surface water. Validation parameters were satisfactory and the overall DLLME-LC-MS/MS method was found to be applicable to analysis of the chosen analytes in environmental waters. It was used to determine benzotriazoles in surface water and wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. In surface waters, concentration was below the limit of detection, while concentrations determined in wastewater were estimated between 2.7 and 12.0 mg/L.",

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveals that the title compound crystallizes in the triclinic system of the P –1 space group, and exists as isolated mononuclear complex. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds lead to the formation of chains, and the layered supramolecular structure is formed by the strong π×××π stacking interactions. Solid-state photoluminescent characterization reveals that the title compound has an emission in the green region. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculation shows that the nature of the photoluminescence of the title compound originates from the ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT; from the HOMO of the p-orbital of ligand HMCA to the LUMO of the oxygen atoms). A wide optical band gap of 2.25 eV is found by the solid-state UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectrum.",

The surface analysis was completed by contact angles measurements. It was found that the type of electrolyte along with the applied voltage influence the structure of the sample and being more precise, the anodic oxidation in H 3 PO 4 electrolyte promotes the evolution of flaky structures and eventually of pores by increasing the applied voltage, while the anodizing performed in glycerol-based electrolyte results in the formation of nanoporous structures that evolve into nanotubes as the applied voltage grows. Based on experimental data a film forming mechanism for α-ZP and ZrO 2 was proposed and correlated to analyzed surface properties.",

We have designed and synthesized two such probes, 8 and 9 , that are based on the thiazole-coumarin scaffold. Both are environment sensitive and exhibit similar shifts of emission spectra in a variety of solvents as probes based on 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD). In particular, the second, positively charged probe 9 labels the plasma membrane selectively with limited redistribution to other membranes of the cell. Unfortunately, compared to the other two probes tested, 8 and 6-NBD-PC , it exhibits the highest rate of photobleaching.

    "abstract": "Polysorbates (PS) are the most common non-ionic surfactants used in protein formulations. Their degradation has been studied intensively in recent years. Ester bond hydrolysis is one of many pathways of PS degradation that can lead to accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs) and particle formation. The distribution and quantity of FFAs in PSs impacts directly on product quality. Characterization of input PS is highly relevant, because the initial content of FFAs differs greatly between manufacturers. The purpose of this study was to set up a quick and simple analytical method for the quantitative evaluation of FFAs in PS. The content of FFAs was measured for selected PS 20 and 80, using two methods, 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H NMR) and the European pharmacopoeia method for determining acid value (I A ). These methods have been evaluated using the method of standard addition and, based on the results, they are interchangeable. It was concluded that 1 H NMR is a useful tool for quality control of input PS and a rapid method for indicating the rate of PS degradation by hydrolysis and oxidation. Further, a newly discovered impurity in PS raw material, the long chain ketone 12-tricosanone, can be identified using 1 H NMR.",

    "abstract": "Due to the current spreading of the new disease CoViD-19, the World Health Organization formally declared a world pandemic on March 11, 2020. The present trends indicate that the pandemic will have an enormous clinical and economic impact on population health. Infections are initiated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoproteins of human coronavirus (hCoV) binding to host receptors. Ongoing research and therapeutic product development are of vital importance for the successful treatment of CoViD-19. To contribute somewhat to the overall effort, herein, single point mutations (SPMs) of the binding site residues in hCoV-OC43 S that recognizes cellular surface components containing 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) are explored using an in silico protein engineering approach, while their effects on the binding of 9-O-Ac-Sia and Hidroxychloroquine (Hcq) are evaluated using molecular docking simulations. Thr31Met and Val84Arg are predicted to be the critical – most likely SPMs in hCoV-OC43 S for the binding of 9-O-Ac-Sia and Hcq, respectively, even though Thr31Met is a very likely SPM in the case of Hcq too. The corresponding modes of interaction indicate a comparable strength of the Thr31Met/9-O-Ac-Sia and Val84Arg/Hcq (or Thr31Met/Hcq) complexes. Given that the binding site is conserved in all CoV S glycoproteins that associate with 9-O-acetyl-sialoglycans, the high hydrophobic affinity of Hcq to hCoV-OC43 S speaks in favor of its ability to competitively inhibit rapid S-mediated virion attachment in high-density receptor environments, but its considerably low specificity to hCoV-OC43 S may be one of the key obstacles in considering the potential of Hcq to become a drug candidate.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a new approach for the determination of carbamazepine and lamotrigine in biological samples by ionic liquid dispersive liquid-phase microextraction prior to high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The effects of different ionic liquids (ILs) on the extraction efficiency of carbamazepine and lamotrigine were investigated. The highest extraction efficiencies of carbamazepine and lamotrigine were obtained using 30 µL of 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [C8MIM][PF6]. Several factors affecting the microextraction efficiency, such as the type and volume of extracting solvent, type and volume of disperser solvent, salt concentration, and pH of the sample solution have been optimized. The calibration plots were linear in the range of 0.1-20 mg L -1 for carbamazepine and 0.3-40 mg L -1 for lamotrigine with detection limits of 0.04 mg L -1 for carbamazepine and 0.07 mg L -1 for lamotrigine in plasma samples. The results confirm the suitability of the presented method as a sensitive method for the analysis of the target analytes in urine and plasma samples.",

Validation parameters included linearity, accuracy, precision, and limit of quantitation and detection. Good linearity was obtained over the range of 2.5–100 μg/mL (R2 = 0.9979) of curcumin. The developed HPLC method was precise, with &lt;2% relative standard deviation. Accuracy, stability, and robustness studies were also found to be acceptable. Bland-Altman plot showed an acceptable repeatability coefficient. The method was under statistical control, revealed by a control chart. After CU–NC administration, pharmacokinetic parameters i.e. Cmax, AUC0-∞, and AUMC0-∞, were observed to be 97.69 ± 10.84 μg/mL, 1402.77 ± 9.67 (μg/mL) ∙ h, and 35140.16 ± 14.67 (μg/mL) ∙ h2, respectively.

The dissolved sulfur effect in the Product-liquor that feeds to the columns, on the Basic Nickel Carbonate (BNC) properties and the operation expenses was determined. When increasing the sulfur in the liquor, we augment the selectivity towards the sulfate formation in the BNC molecule; therefore the energy consumption to the BNC thermal decomposition in the calcination process increases. Also, the nickel dissolved in the columns effluent increases due to complex reaction with [SO42–] and [S2O32–] ions, thus the expenses for consumption precipitation reagent increase too. Feeding carbonated liquor in the range 1.60 ≤ NH3/CO2 &lt; 1.80 and CO2-rich solution increases the CO2 in the BNC with decreasing in sulfate; then, the mean diameter particle increases, the filtration resistance and the cake moisture diminish, which augments the productivity and reduces the energy consumption in the process of filtration and calcination. Keeping a pH between 8.4 and 8.7 in the columns outlet the greatest economic benefit is obtained of 0,125 ($ · h–1) per (m3 · h–1) of Product-liquor.",

The result of comparing MMT with its modified sulfonated form (SMMT) indicated that SMMT is a more effective adsorbent than MMT. The evaluations showed that the optimum conditions for the THMs removal occur at 20 °C, 10 mg of adsorbent, 1 mg/L of THMs concentration, and 120 min for the adsorption time. The maximum adsorption capacity of CHCl3, CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl, and CHBr3 was achieved: 0.49, 0.45, 0.43, and 0.38 mg/g at C0 = 0.10 mg/L; 1.71, 1.62, 1.56, and 1.45 mg/g at C0 = 0.50 mg/L; and 4.43, 4.35, 4.23, and 3.67 mg/g for C0 = 5.00 mg/L, respectively. The THMs adsorption was compared between SMMT, powdered activated carbon (PAC), and granular activated carbon (GAC) and the results showed that SMMT is as effective as PAC and better than GAC and its production cost is lower than for the activated carbon.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the MALDI MS/MS data for colchicine and its alkylthio derivatives have been described.

Distribution of fatty acids, n-alkanes and iso-alkanes, phthalate esters, siloxanes, different sterols, various sugars and sugar alcohols, compounds of lignin and resin acids, dicarboxylic acids from photochemical reactions, PAHs, organic nitrogen compounds and products from secondary oxidation of monoterpenes were determined. The use of silicone grease for the purpose of lubricating the impact surface of the air sampler caused higher values of gravimetric determination. Solid particles may have been bounced from the surface of a greasy impact plate and re-entrained within the air stream and then collected on a sample filter. The carryover of siloxanes was at least from 5% up to 15% of the accumulated particles weight, depending on ambient temperature. This was the reason that the gravimetric results for determination of PM10 according to the standard EN 12341:2014 were overestimated.",

These Au thin films were deposited on glass substrates by the gravitational sedimentation of Au colloids. The colloids were formed by chemical reduction in ethanol using HAuCl4 and NaBH4 with no added surfactants. Without stabilizing agents the colloids quickly aggregated, settled to the bottom and formed a thin film. The sedimentation of the colloids was monitored using UV-vis spectroscopy. Thin films with Au loads ranging between 0.25 and 4.0 g m–2 were prepared and characterized by means of UV-vis spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The results showed that nanostructured Au films with a very high specific surface area were formed. The films were electrically conductive and partially transparent to visible light.",

The presented biosensor consists of a previously developed stainless steel electrochemical cell constructed as a three-electrode system in the RCW side-by-side configuration. The electrochemical stability of the sensing electrode was evaluated by measuring the open circuit potential (OCP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to determine the impedimetric response of the biosensor with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells attached to the working electrode (WE) in the absence (0.9% NaCl) and presence (10 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl) of caffeine. Moreover, the limit of detection (LOD) was determined. In this way, a new approach in biosensor development has been established, which involves assembling a low-cost and disposable electrochemical system to detect alkaloids such as caffeine. The developed biosensor represents a good candidate for detecting caffeine in beverages, foods, and drugs with the merits of time-saving, robustness, low cost, and low detection limit.",

By using this simple methodology, we obtained a small series of 25 esters. For each of the obtained compounds we have performed structural characterization, in vitro antimicrobial testing and in silico calculation of physico-chemical, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties. Despite numerous data on the synthesis and bioactivity of carvacryl ester lower homologues, there are scarce data on esters with acid components higher than C9, so that among 25 compounds, 10 were reported for the first time (spectral characterization for 12 are herein the first reported). Our research is also the first comprehensive study of carvacryl esters antifungal and of medium/long chain fatty acid esters antibacterial activities. Interesting result is that all the synthesized esters, regardless the nature of the R residue, have shown activity on fungal strain Aspergilus niger and on yeast Candida albicans comparable to carvacrol. Besides presented experimental data, implementation of in silico calculation of physico-chemical, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties on the prepared compounds, may be valuable information in further research.",

Thermodynamic parameters also demonstrated that these drugs were more stable in the aqueous media. Global descriptors and the reactivity of these drugs were found to be related.

A three-tier achievement test (with 10 three-tier tasks to identify misconceptions) was used to collect the data. The results show that the Slovenian students' knowledge of the lithosphere and pedosphere is adequate. On average, students achieved 55.6% of all possible points. The lowest level of knowledge was found for the topic of soil formation. The number of misconceptions on this topic is low and does not exceed 30% for any task. The highest number of misconceptions was found for the topic of soil formation and pollution.",

A nanofiber mat consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), nanoTiO2, and citric acid (PTC) was prepared using an electrospinning technique at a constant flow rate (0.5 ml/h). The morphology of the mat was detected using (FESEM) technique and image J software. The results show that the mat has a nanofiber morphology with an average diameter of 170 nm. This mat was used to remove methylene blue (MB) from water in two ways, the adsorption process and by photodegradation using UV light. The kinetic study of the adsorption of methylene blue MB on a PTC mat was carried out. Results show that the pseudo-second order is the best to describe the adsorption, of MB, and the intraparticle diffusion is the rate determining step. Seven isotherm models; four of two-parameters and three of three-parameters were used to examine the adsorption experimental data by applying linear and non-linear regression methods using six error functions. The results showed comparable data between linear and non-linear regression methods for two parameters isotherms, and the best isotherm fitting with the data were Freundlich and Temkin models. On the contrary, three parameters isotherms showed distracted data between linear and non-linear regression methods. In addition, the results appear that the best predictive error function was Chi-square.",

The spectral results indicate an increase of binding constant and partition coefficient values in the presence of glucose and NaCl whereas the addition of urea leads to a decrease of binding strength and quinizarin partitioning into SDS micelles. Thus, the rise of NaCl and glucose concentrations is favorable for the quinizarin distribution into SDS micelles.

Among the tested compounds, compound 4 exhibited the strongest antidiabetic and antidepressant activities, inhibiting α-glycosidase, α-amylase and MAO-A enzyme activities, respectively. Moreover, all of the tested compounds strongly scavenged the ABTS and DPPH radicals and the ABTS radical scavenging activities of 3 and 4 were found to be higher than the commercial antioxidants BHA and trolox. None of the tested compounds showed any significant anti-Parkinson’s disease activity or neuroprotective action.

It is relatively difficult to control them due to their efficiency enabling formation of large amounts of recombinant proteins. Our work was focused on the influence of the media composition on the behavior of the pET3a expression system and we tried to select appropriate medium for inoculum preparation as well as appropriate production medium. We found out that media without glucose trigger unexpectedly high activity of /acUV5 promoter. Accumulation level of 15% of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) in total cellular proteins was obtained in LBP medium (modified Luria-Bertani) without addition of IPTG inducer. Glucose addition into medium for inoculum preparation successfully represses expression of recombinant protein during inoculum preparation phase. Optimal optical density for high quality of inoculum is around OD 600nm = 4,0, when culture is in the middle of exponential growth phase. Presence of glucose is required also in production medium. GYSP medium containing glucose, enables by 25% higher recombinant protein accumulation level than LBP medium without glucose. In contrast to LBP medium it enables comparably high recombinant protein accumulation level also without addition of antibiotic into the production medium.",

For this purpose some experiments were initially performed in computer-controlled RC1 reactor provided data of dynamic pH profiles during batch propagation of differently activated grains. Experimental data were mathematically analyzed and using the special methodology of minimizing the absolute deviation of pH(t) profiles the minimal time for grains activation was determined. We established that optimal inoculum activity could be ensured only by the kefir grains, which were previously activated at least over eleven successive days. In the second part of research the growth curve of optimally activated kefir grains was constructed using experimental measurements and fitted with Gompertz model. The present results were compared with the results obtained by our previous study 14 , where classically activated grains were used.

The resolving power of the method is tested by studying of the mixtures of dye molecules. The multiple wavelength titration curves are used to form matrix, D, which is then factored into matrices A, containing the absorption spectra of the components, and C, containing their temperature-dependent concentrations.

In the paper, the calculated values, i.e., NBO (natural bond orbitals) charges, bond lengths, dipole moments, electron affinities, heats of formation and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) properties are presented. For the QSAR studies, we used multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) statistical modeling. The results show a high correlation between experimental and predicted activity values, indicating the validation and the good quality of the derived QSAR models. In addition, statistical analysis reveals that the ANN technique with (9-4-1) architecture is more significant than the MLR model. The virtual screening based on the molecular similarity method and applicability domain of QSAR allowed the discovery of novel anti-proliferative activity candidates with improved activity.",

Subjective wine evaluation, made by wine experts, is combined with commonly used chemical and physico-chemical properties, measured in analytical laboratory. Importance of the measured variables was determined by principal component analysis and confirmed by analysis of variance. Linear discriminant analysis enabled not only a very successful wine classification but also prediction of the wine category for unknown samples. The wine categories were set up either by three wine varieties, or two vintages, wine producers; two or three wine categories established by wine quality reflected either total points obtained in sensorial evaluation or the points obtained for a particular quality descriptor like colour, taste and bouquet.",

Agglomerates on AC were observed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microanalysis by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and revealed the presence of OMD deposited on the surface. The activation energy and the factor of frequency for the reaction were determined as E a = 1.2 kcal/mol and A = 2.2. The value of E a indicates that the precipitation of OMD on the AC was controlled by mass transfer in aqueous solution and the order of reaction was zero. The adsorption capacities of AC were q = 14 mg Pb(II)/g AC and q = 9.1 mg As(V)/g AC.

The volume of eluent to recover rutin was found to decrease with the increase of methanol concentration. The recovery of rutin was increased from 20 to 80% methanol system, but slightly decreased in the 100% methanol system. Approximately, 70% of rutin could be recovered using the 80% methanol system. This solvent system also appears to have the lowest distance (9.44 MPa1/2) for rutin as estimated by Hansen solubility. The recovered rutin rich fraction could achieve up to 3.96 mg/g of fraction which was about 4-fold increment from the crude extract. The increment was also noticed for its antioxidant capacity expressed as scavenging activity which was 2 times higher than crude extract. A portion of water (20%) in the 80% methanol system is important to improve the yield of rutin. Rutin is a glycosylated flavonol, and therefore a small portion of water could enhance its elution compared to the lower performance of 100% methanol in rutin recovery.",

    "abstract": "Gravity transport of granular materials in vertical pipes is one of the most fundamental steps in bulk powder handling and processing. Presented study investigates powder flow characteristics in vertical pipes with open and closed outlets and condition of free powder fall. Powder flow of pharmaceutical grade powders was observed in transparent, vertical pipe model. Description of flow structures was performed. Powder volume flow rate, acceleration, and dilatation were quantified and correlated with powder properties. The results show that in pipes with a closed outlet the escaping air slows down the powder flow, resulting in a much slower flow than in pipes with an open outlet. A dense granular flow was detected in an open outlet condition, whereas in a closed outlet condition two concurrent flow regimes were observed: a slow moving, dense powder bed, and a fast dilute powder flow. Differences in flow regimes may promote segregation, with important implications to industrial processes.",

Based on chronopotentiometric (galvanostatic) experiments, we discuss the materials performance in terms of cell energy efficiency and electrode polarization. We propose and justify the use of the “inflection point criterion” for determination of total overpotential ( h total ). We further demonstrate that the general current-overpotential characteristics can be represented by introducing the total resistance of the cell - R total .We find consistently that whereas in LCO the general current-overpotential characteristics is more or less linear, there is significant deviation from linearity in LiFePO 4 and even bigger in LiMnPO 4 . The phenomenon is discussed in terms of state-of-the art knowledge about phase transformation phenomena in these materials.",

Therefore, we developed the rose petal-derived graphene quantum dots embedded zinc metal organic frameworks (RP-GQDs@Zn-MOFs) based fluorescence \"On-Off-On\" nanoprobe for quercetin sensing. Initially, RP-GQDs were synthesized using rose petal waste and then subjected to embedding into Zn-MOFs. Herein, the addition of copper ions (Cu2+) results in fluorescence \"Switch Off\" whereas quercetin inclusion resulted in the formation of the quercetin-Cu2+ complex. It regains the RP-GQDs@Zn-MOFs quenched fluorescence termed as \"Switch On\" because of the static quenching mechanism. It demonstrated a wide concentration range and low detection limit of 100 ng/mL to 1400 ng/mL (R2=0.99) and 37.84 ng/mL, respectively. The selectivity study shows the high specificity for quercetin in presence of interfering compounds because of Cu2+ coordination between the carbonyl oxygen atom and the 3-OH group of quercetin. Moreover, the designed probe shows good stability, repeatability, and real-time analysis possibility.",

Isoconversional model-free analysis was applied to the isothermal and nonisothermal curing of diallylterephthalate performed by DSC at different sets of heating rates. The results of the kinetic analysis in a form of kinetic triplet $(Ea, A, ƒ(α))$ present the variation of the Arrhenius parameters with the calculation method, reaction extent, process mode and heating rates applied. This variation is a sign of the complex and multi-step reaction mechanism. Such a mechanism was approximated with one step $(1-α)^n$ reaction model. With the isokinetic relationship - IKR (compensation effect) in the form of $lnA=aEa,app+b$ it was found out that the isothermal and nonisothermal IKR lines converge to different singular points. From the correlation procedure with the experimental data isothermal narrowest point – NPI was selected as a common point. The curing process in the isothermal and nonisothermal process conditions, respectively, was successfully simulated with the obtained kinetic parameters. The possible alternative reaction paths and the partial diffusion control of the curing process are the reasons for the limiting usage of the model-free kinetic analysis method. This method was mainly used as a preliminary step for further analysis with other methods.",

Phytonutrient lycopene is a dominant antioxidant in these products while beta-carotene is present in significantly lower quantities. Therefore for all practical reasons the interfering effect of beta-carotene at 502 nm analytical wavelength can be neglected. The LED-OW method is low-cost and simple, yet accurate and precise. The major attributes of the new method are its rapid speed of response and the fact that no preparation whatsoever of the sample is needed before the analysis. The lycopene found in tomato products studied here varies from 8 mg/100 g to 60 mg/100 g fresh product. Results obtained by LED-OW method were compared to the outcome of conventional, time consuming spectrophotometric methods and the correlation was very good (R ≥ 0.98). Precision of the LED-OW instrumental setup ranged from 0.5 to 7.4% ; the RSD achieved for lycopene-richest samples (≥ 40 mg/100 g) did not exceed 1.7%. Repeatability of analysis by LED-OW was found to vary between 0.7 and 7.1%.",

    "abstract": "Cysteine cathepsins are peptidases with housekeeping functions that play different specific roles in different tissues. Endogenous peptidase inhibitors, such as cystatins and thyropins are the ultimate way of controlling their activity. It appears, however, that cathepsin X, a monocarboxypeptidase, whose overexpression is associated with several pathological processes, is not under the control of endogenous inhibitors. Inhibitors belonging to various groups inhibit other cathepsins tested, but none decrease the carboxypeptidase activity of cathepsin X. This absence of inhibitor control is another feature that distinguishes cathepsin X from other members of the cysteine peptidases.",

    "abstract": "The paper demonstrates how the Hard-Soft Acid Base (HSAB) theory can be used as a valuable criterion in the selection process of semiconducting metal oxides (MOX) suitable as sensing layers for ammonia detection. Six different cases of ammonia detection performed by chemiresistive sensors employing MOX and related nanocomposites as sensing layers are identified and discussed. The role of HSAB as an efficient selection tool for appropriate sensing layer (any type of gas), is further reinforced by analyzing and discussing literature results on MOX-based trimethylamine sensing layers. By analyzing the operation of a fiber-optic ammonia sensor, we demonstrate that the HSAB principle can be also successfully applied to the selection of sensing layers for detectors employing other sensing principles, different than the chemiresistive one. Changing the sensing paradigm (i.e., the amino groups-based compounds are part of the sensing layer, rather than part of the analyte), the paper shows that these types of molecules (polymers, carbon nanotubes, ionic liquids) are appropriate constituents of a CO 2 sensing layer, in full accordance to the HSAB criteria.",

We developed a system that enables the formation of irreversible isopeptide bonds on the surface of Lactococus lactis . This was achieved through the following two protein/peptide pairs, SpyCatcher/SpyTag and SnoopCatcher/SnoopTag. 1-3 Attachment of tagged model protein B-domain to the cell surface of Lactococccus lactis displaying the corresponding catcher protein was demonstrated using flow cytometry.

Each copper(II) ion is coordinated by two other carboxylate ligands in monodentate and a 2,2ʹ-bipyridine molecule in bidentate manner. Thus the geometry around each penta-coordinated copper(II) ion is square pyramidal with distortion factor τ = 0.04. Purity and uniform crystalline nature of the complex was assessed from powder XRD spectrum. ESR signal consisted of partially resolved hyperfine splitting pattern while electrochemical studies revealed diffusion controlled electron transfer processes with diffusion co-efficient of 1.628×10 –7 cm 2 s –1 . The results of all spectroscopic experiments support each other. The complex afforded mixed binding mode with DNA yielding DNA-binding constant values of 3.667×10 4 and 1.438×10 4 M –1 using cyclic voltammetry and absorption spectroscopy, respectively.

    "abstract": "Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) epithelial cells are one of the most used therapeutic medical lines for the production of different biopharmaceutical drugs. They have a high consumption rate with a fast duplication cycle that makes them an ideal biological clone. The higher accumulated amounts of toxic intracellular intermediates may lead to lower organism viability, protein productivity and manufactured biosimilar, so a careful optimal balance of medium, bioreactor operational parameters and bioprocess is needed. A precise phenomenological knowledge of metabolism's chemical transformations can predict problems that may arise during batch, semi-continuous fed batch and continuous reactor operation. For a better detailed understanding (and relations), future performance optimization and scaling, mechanistic model systems have been built. In this specific work, the main metabolic pathways in mammalian structured CHO cultures are reviewed. It starts with organic biochemical background, controlling associated phenomena and kinetics, which govern the sustaining conversion routes of biology. Then, individual turnover paths are described, overviewing standard mathematical formulations that are commonly applied in engineering. These are the core of black box modeling, which relates the substrates/products in a simplified relationship manner. Moreover, metabolic flux analysis (MFA)/flux balance analysis (FBA), that are traditionally characterizing mechanisms, are presented to a larger portion extent. Finally, similarities are discussed, illustrating the approaches for their structural design. Stated variables' equations, employed for the description of the growth in the controllable environmental conditions of a vessel, the researched reaction series of proliferating dividing CHO population, joint with the values of maximal enzymatic activity, and solutions are outlined. Processes are listed in a way so that a reader can integrate the state-of-the-art. Our particular contribution is also denoted.",

The study included an innovative application of the commercial flexible gel electrodes in a two-electrode setup for following the impedance of the two high-durability offshore coating systems exposed to 1440 h of neutral salt spray (NSS) according to EN ISO 9227. The results were compared to those of the EIS measurements during 8000 h long exposure to a liquid electrolyte in a press-on cell according to the established EN ISO 16773 method. Complementary methods of differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis have been used for surface, interface and depth profiling of coating characteristics that were commented with respect to the EIS results. The technique was applied on high-durability coatings Zn (R) + EP + EP or PUR intended for the protection in the coastal and offshore areas corresponding to C5- (H) and CX corrosivity categories in accordance with EN ISO 12944. EIS has been found to give sound quantitative results for coating impedance and a good estimation of long term coating behaviour within the first 100 h of accelerated exposure. It can be considered a promising tool for the early detection of coating damage during weathering tests.",

The recoveries for all elements in lipsticks were between 90% and 110%, except for Cd and Pb they were &lt;90% and &gt;110%, respectively. The health risk assessment was determined by calculating the average daily intake (ADD), hazard quotient (HQ), and hazard index (HI). The highest mean value for ADD was for Fe (4.8×10 -1 mg kg -1 day -1 ), and the lowest was for Co (9.3×10 -6 mg kg -1 day -1 ). There was no significant toxic health risk for any of the elements (HQ &lt; 1), except for Fe (HQ &lt; 3) which indicates a potential health risk.

The method is based on the previous sulphanilamide (SA) and sulphathiazole (STZ) diazotization in the medium of 0.6–0.7 M hydrochloric acid and their subsequent interaction with amoxicillin at pH = 10.5 with formation of yellow-colored azo compouds. Effective molar absorptivities at the absorbance maxima at 445 nm (SA) and 448 nm (STZ) for azo compounds were (1.74 ± 0,06)∙10 4 L×mol -1 ×cm -1 and (1.97 ± 0,05)∙10 4 L×mol -1 ×cm -1 , respectively. Stoichiometric ratios of the components of azo compounds were determined using continuous variations method. Based on the optimum reaction conditions, new methods were developed. These methods allow to determine the amoxicillin in concentration range 1.3–32.9 mg×mL -1 with sulphanilamide and 0.7–27.4 mg×mL -1 with sulphathiazole. The methods were successfully validated for amoxicillin determination in tablets \"Amoxil\".",

The crystallization experiments were performed in batch mode at 25 °C, pH 9 with three amino acid concentrations. The CTT crystals were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, particle size and zeta potential analysis. All of the amino acids used in this study were found to significantly affect the surface electrical charge, size, and morphology of the obtained crystals. In addition, the thermal decomposition of the produced crystals obtained in pure media was examined and the obtained data were used to investigate the decomposition kinetics of the crystals with the help of three different model-free kinetic methods, namely Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), and Starink. The average activation energy of the crystals for the first, second, third, and fourth stages using the FWO, KAS, and Starink methods was calculated to be 91.0, 158.0, 249.1, and 224.8 kJ/mol; 89.6, 155.9, 250.7, and 221.1 kJ/mol; 88.6, 156.8, 250.5, and 220.4 kJ/mol, respectively.

Thermodynamics of micellization was studied by the fitting of the mass-action model to the ITC data. The micellization of SDS in all the studied systems is an entropy-driven at lower temperatures and an enthalpy-driven at higher temperatures. It was also found that with the increasing nonpolar character of IL the interactions between the SDS should be stronger leading to more negative Gibbs free energy and enthalpy of micellization. To obtain information about the micellar charge, the conductivity and zeta-potential measurements were performed at 298.15 K. It is assumed that the charge screening between negative sulfate heads is more efficient in the presence of ILs due to their possible incorporation into the micellar structure reflecting in less negative zeta-potential of micelles comparing to SDS in water and consequently higher degrees of micelle ionization due to the larger portion of sodium ions in solution.",

Sterol levels in camelina oil samples were determined by gas chromatography after saponification and solid phase extraction. The method was validated, and the results proved that the chosen method is specific and selective, repeatable and accurate. The quantitatively assessed average contents of sterols in camelina oil samples of Slovenian origin were 21.4 mg 100 g–1 for brassicasterol, 153.6 mg 100 g–1 for campesterol, 3.9 mg 100 g–1 for stigmasterol, and 447.0 mg 100 g–1 for β-sitosterol.

The reaction probably proceeds by the in situ formation of nitriles followed by successive [3+2]cycloaddition with sodium azide. A variety of aldehydes were used to obtain the corresponding tetrazoles. The catalyst was recovered by simple filtration and reused at least five times without significant loss of catalytic activity.

The results show that both the two models provided good quality predictions, yet the ANN showed a clear superiority over RSM for both data fitting and estimation capabilities. A 4.1-fold increase in lipase production was recorded under the following optimal condition: incubation temperature (37.9 °C), cultivation time (111 h), and Tween 80 (3.27%, v/v). Furthermore, the partially purified lipase showed good stability, high compatibility, and significant wash performance with various commercial laundry detergents, making this novel lipase a promising potential candidate for detergent industries.",

The procedure consists of microwave sample digestion and the determination of selenium using atomic fluorescence spectrometry with a hydride generation system (HG-AFS). The method allows the determination of selenium in a range of 0.5―100.0 μg L ―1 with a detection limit not higher than 0.2 μg L ―1 and with good repeatability not exceeding 1 %. It was applied for determination of selenium in women's plasma samples (n = 90) with a suspicion of a thyroid cancer and the control group of women (n = 87). Most of the obtained results were in the range 30.0―60.0 μg L ―1 and either did not match the physiological level of selenium in human plasma or indicate moderate selenium deficiency. In the further examinations the thyroid tissues taken from 30 patients were analyzed. In most of the cases the selenium concentration was found to be lower (0.14―1.67 μg g ―1 wet weight) than its physiological level in a healthy tissue. On this basis the hypothesis has been drawn that selenium can be considered as an additional marker of the thyroid cancer disease.",

In the present work, TiO2 powders doped and co-doped with sulfur and nitrogen and modified with platinum were prepared by particulate sol-gel synthesis. PXRD measurements revealed that the replacement of HCl with H2SO4 during synthesis reduced the size of the crystallites from ~ 30 nm to ~20 nm, increasing the surface area from ~44 m2/g to ~80 m2/g. This is consistent with the photocatalytic activity of the samples and the measured photocurrent behavior of the photocatalysts. The results showed that the properties of the powders (i.e., surface area, crystallite size, photocurrent behavior) depend strongly not only on the type but also on the amount of acid and dopants used in the synthesis. Doping, co-doping and modification of TiO2 samples with nitrogen, sulfur and platinum increased their photocatalytic activity up to 6 times.",

The adsorption behavior of MB was fitted better by the Langmuir isotherm than by the Freundlich isotherm, and the maximum adsorption capacity of nanozeolite L was obtained 80.64 mg g–1. The negative values of Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) and the positive value of the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) affirmed that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic.

High thermal stabilization (about 10 °C) of the DNA helix after the association with actinomycin D clearly demonstrates the intercalative binding mode. The presence of SDS micelles leads to the release of intercalated actinomcyin D molecules from DNA double helix and their further relocation in surfactant micelles.

This enzyme is ubiquitous throughout bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, making it an attractive target for antibacterial drug discovery. We investigated the binding mode of twenty five reported Mycobacterium tuberculosis alanine racemase inhibitors. The results obtained from molecular docking studies emphasized the importance of inhibitor interaction with Lys42, Tyr46, Arg140, His172 and Tyr175 residues at the catalytic binding pocket of alanine racemase enzyme. The predicted binding free energies showed that van der Waals and nonpolar solvation interactions are the driving force for binding of inhibitors. Molecular dynamics simulation studies of four such inhibitor-alanine racemase systems were further explored to study the inhibition mechanism. The quantum chemical parameters calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G**++ level of theory indicated that the inhibitors must have low values of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and high values of electrostatic potential for stronger interactions. We expect that this study can provide significant theoretical guidance for design of potent Mycobacterium tuberculosis alanine racemase inhibitors in future.",

The maximum loading efficiency of the sorbent for metformin was obtained at pH 7 and its maximum in-vitro release was achieved at pH 1.6, using a phosphate-buffered saline medium. The loading capacity of the sorbent was dependent on the initial metformin concentration and exceeded to 19.6 mg/g in a 200 mg/L solution. A study of the adsorption isotherms for the drug indicated the best fitting into the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms at the low and high metformin concentrations, respectively. The results indicated that the prepared Fe3O4@SiO2@TG adsorbent, as a non-toxic and low-cost sorbent, was quite appropriate for drug delivery applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the determination of economically most feasible conditions to obtain polystyrene with various target molecular weights through ultrasound-assisted emulsion polymerization. Briefly, batch polymerizations of styrene have been performed by ultrasound-assisted emulsion polymerization process using different reaction feed compositions. Polymerization rates were calculated using the monomer conversions at various reaction times. Also, molecular weights of the synthesized polymers, as well as the Mark-Houwink constants, were determined by intrinsic viscosity and gel permeation chromatography measurements. It was found that the polydispersity index of the polymers is ranging from 1.2 to 1.5, and the viscosity average molecular weights are in between 100000-1500000 g/mol depending on the reaction conditions. Finally, model equations were also developed for response variables, and the most economical ways of reaching various target molecular weights were interpreted by response surface methodology based multi objective optimization.",

Elevated temperature (30 °C) affected HSS stability and significantly reduced the t95% (4.6–6.3 h).

Different chemical modifications were applied to the upper membrane surface, i.e. the surface which was exposed to interaction with nonsolvent (water) in the coagulation bath during the membrane formation. The membrane surface was modified by the series of Friedel-Crafts electrophilic substitutions of aromatic rings in the polysulfone molecules. As a reagent 1-chlorodecane or propylene oxide dissolved in hexane and $AlCl_3$ as a catalyst were used. In the former case a hydrophobic and in the latter one a hydrophilic coating was achieved, respectively. The membrane surface was also modified by sulfonization with sulfuric (VI) acid water solution; in this way negative charges were introduced at the membrane surface. The membranes, unmodified and chemically modified, were characterized by measuring the membrane thickness, the deionized water flux through the membrane, the zeta potential and contact angle. The specific chemical modifications of the membrane surface affect the water flux, the zeta potential and contact angle values whereas the membrane thickness remains unchanged. These effects are interpreted in terms of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, changes of the membrane surface charge and the thickness of shear layer at the membrane surface, all with respect to the particular modification applied. Reaction with 1-chlorodecane gave a hydrophobic surface by nonpolar $–(CH_2)_9-CH_3$ groups and reaction with propylene oxide gave a hydrophilic surface with polar group $-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-OH$. The surface of sulfonized polysulfone membranes contained ionizable ($-SO_3H$) functional groups.",

Here we study another class of modified indices defined as W-min, W-lambda(G)=Sigma(V(G)(lambda)m(G)(u, nu)(lambda)-m(G)(u, nu)(2 lambda)) and show that some of the important properties of W(G), W-m(G) and W-lambda(G) are also properties of W-min, W-lambda(G), valid for most values of the parameter lambda. In particular, if T-n is any n-vertex tree, different from the n-vertex path P-n and the n-vertex star S-n, then for any lambda = 1 or lambda W-min, W-lambda(T-n) > W-min, W-lambda(S-n). Thus for these values of the parameter lambda, W-min, W-lambda(G) provides a novel class of structure-descriptors, suitable for modeling branching-dependent properties of organic compounds, applicable in QSPR and QSAR studies. We also demonstrate that if trees are ordered with regard to W-min, W-lambda(G) then, in the general case, this ordering is different for different lambda.",

The optimum conditions for VIV and VV extraction were found. VIV is extracted in chloroform as a 1:2:2 complex (V:DN:MTT) with lmax = 570 nm and e570 = 2.9´104 dm3 mol-1 cm-1. However, this wavelength was found unsuitable for precise spectrophotometric measurements due to time dependent absorbance changes. VV forms predominantly a 1:1:1 complex with lmax = 335 nm. The calibration graph for this oxidation state is linear in the range of 0.06-1.5 mg cm-3. The molar absorptivity, Sandell's sensitivity and limit of detection were calculated to be 1.6 ´ 104 dm3 mol-1 cm-1, 3.2 ng cm-2 and 0.02 mg cm-3, respectively.

Even in the era of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography still offers many advantages, such as simplicity, rapidity, and cost-effectiveness, which predict TLC to be the first-choice method for the laborious optimization process requiring analysis of numerous samples. In this work, a thin-layer chromatography method with chemical and densitometric detection was used to optimize a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) process for the extraction and preconcentration of estradiol in human urine. The chromatographic system consisted of silica gel plates as the stationary phase and toluene-ethanol (9:1; v/v ) mixture as the developing solvent. The plates were dyed with 10% phosphomolybdic acid reagent and sequentially evaluated densitometrically at λ = 430 nm. In the context of DLLME optimization, parameters including the type and volume of extraction and dispersive solvents, centrifugation, salt addition and extraction time, were studied. The proposed DLLME-TLC method was successfully applied to the determination of estradiol in real human urine samples.",

In second step; oxidation of SO on surface of Ge-BNNC through the Langmuir Hinshelwood (LH) and Eley Rideal (ER) mechanisms was investigated.

The proposed method involves a pre-column derivatization of species followed by RP-HPLC separation with Thermo Hypersil Gold reversed-phase column and UV detection at 315 nm. A flow rate of 0.9 mL min -1 was used in the proposed method. An efficient separation of biogenic amines was successfully performed in 11 min with a good resolution using 35:65 % ( v/v ) acetonitrile-water mixture as the mobile phase.

With the addition of all metal ions to the DMSO solution of ligands, the peaks at 558 and 549 nm increase in intensity with hypsochromic or bathochromic shifts except Zn 2+ ions and 2 , while the peaks at 388 and 391 nm dramatically decrease in intensity. In both cases, the largest shift is observed after addition of copper ions. In solution, both receptors produce a cation blue shift from 558 and 549 nm to 503 and 497 nm with the sensible color change of solutions from purple-red to orange. Therefore, both compounds can highly recognize copper ions in DMSO solution. In the next step, Benesi-Hildebrand plot and Job's method are used for determination of binding constant ( K a ) and stoichiometry of formed complexes, respectively. Also, the investigation of solvent effect in the UV-vis spectra of ligands shows that the generation of hydrazine and enaminone tautomers increases in highly polar solvents such as DMF and DMSO. Finally, the antioxidant activity of ligands is studied by DPPH method. The results show that NO 2 withdrawing groups in 1,2-[1-(3-imino-4-hydroxophenylazo-4-nitrobenzene)]-4-nitrobenzene probably affect keto−enol equilibrium. As a result, this ligand reduces free radicals to non-reactive species by donating hydrogen.",

In this study, adding either of the two dipeptides to NK-92 cells, resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity toward the targeted K562 cells and increased death rate of the target cells. Cathepsin C is known to generate cytotoxic polymers from various dipeptides, however, in the case of the dipeptides Glu-Lys and Gly-Glu, cathepsin C was unable to polymerize them. Unexpectedly the dipeptides were found to be inhibitors of the transferase activity of cathepsin C (IC50 &lt; 20 mM), and weak competitive inhibitors of the peptidase activity with K i values in the millimolar range.

    "abstract": "Investigation of the interaction of quinizarin (Q), an analogue of the core unit of different anticancer drugs, with anionic SDS micelles has been performed by absorption and conductance measurements in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and over the temperature range of 298.15–323.15 K. The values of binding constant (K b ), partition coefficient (K x ) and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters (Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy) for the binding and distribution of quinizarin between the bulk aqueous solution and surfactant micelles have been determined and discussed in terms of possible intermolecular interactions. Values of critical micelle concentration (CMC) and degree of ionization (α) for SDS in the absence and the presence of quinizarin have been evaluated from conductometric study. Comparing the absorption spectra of quinizarin in SDS micelles with the spectra in different solvents revealed that quinizarin molecules are located in the hydrophilic region of SDS micelles. The trend of changes in Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy with temperature shows that both binding and partition processes are spontaneous and entropy driven. In addition, the hydrophobic interactions are the main forces involved in binding and partition processes.",

In this study, the adsorption of lead (II) ions by chemically modified polyurethane was reported. Polyurethane (PU) was chemically modified by sulphonation and chlorination to obtain sulphonated PU (SPU) and chlorinated PU (CPU). The adsorption parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent loading and initial metal ion concentration were optimized in batch experiments for both the adsorbents. Maximum Pb (II) ion adsorption of 90 and 85% was observed for SPU and CPU respectively at optimal conditions. Isotherms results showed that the equilibrium data was fitted with Freundlich isotherm and followed multilayer adsorption mechanism. Adsorption of Pb (II) ions by both SPU and CPU followed pseudo second order kinetics. The outcome of this study showed that chemical modification of PU is effective for efficient removal of Pb (II) ions from effluent.",

At pH = 2 and 318 K, maximum adsorption capacity (qe,max) of the adsorbent was 1275.2 mg g–1 which is one of the highest capacity in the literature. Thus, GO/PAMAM in this work acted as a superadsorbent for ARS. At the incipient of adsorption, ARS– molecules were adsorbed on Ph sites that was reaction-controlled step, (Ea = 114.5 kJ mol–1). Adsorption of ARS–on the remaining sites was diffusion–controlled. In alkaline media, two other types of ARS molecules were identified during that were adsorbed on Ph and –NH+ 3 sites. Further increasing the pH of the solution, decreased the number these two sites and yielded a reduced adsorption capacity (qe,max).

The optimum condition of the analysis is dithranol as a matrix with tetrahydrofuran as solvent and the ratio of [Zn(DTP)(DMSO)2] + to matrix is 1:75 by volume. And then, this developed method is applied for the analysis of ZDDPs additive in a commercial lubricating oil.

Analysis of stable states following equilibration phases indicated a higher intrinsic stability of the homohexamer as opposed to the dimer, and of N-D1 domains as opposed to the D2 domain. The molecular dynamics of the proposed allosteric binding model reproduced important molecular interactions identified experimentally with high frequency throughout the trajectory.

The cells exhibited expected voltages, relatively high current densities and could be charged and discharged several times. The capacities were relatively low (120 mAh in the case of Al-Pb system), mostly due to unoptimised cell construction.

Pairwise distribution functions were calculated between C-alpha atoms of 20 amino acids in a large ensemble of Protein Data Bank structures.

    "abstract": "Abstract High energy mechanical ball milling, which includes mechanical alloying (MA) and mechanical grinding (MG), has been extensively used in the last 20 years as a non-equilibrium processing method analogous to the previous interest in very rapid solidification cooling (rates from 106 to 1010 K/s) for synthesizing, at room temperature, all kinds of materials. Both mechanical alloying of dissimilar powders and mechanical grinding of single composition powder have resulted in a wide variety of entirely new metastable alloys including amorphous alloys, nanocrystalline materials, extended solid solutions, alloys from elements with a widely different melting point, all sorts of compounds and composites and otherwise difficult to process novel materials, and even those alloys which are immiscible by conventional processing methods. The crystallite size of MA and MG materials decreases rapidly with milling time to reach a saturation value, generally in the range from 1 to 30 nm, attributing the name nano-sized materials to MA and MG end products. During the milling process the interaction between milling balls and powder particles can be characterized by processes like cold-welding, plastic deformation and further fragmentation of the particles. A high defect structure of the lattice, the immense magnification of the boundary surface and high diffusion rate leads to low activation energies for the transformation of the structure. The current state of the mechanism of the metastable phase formation during milling in systems which exhibit a negative heat of mixing of the components will be given from the thermodynamic and kinetic viewpoints. On the other hand, although phase formation in systems with positive heats of mixing is far from being understood, a possible explanation will also be given. Various application areas where the MA technology could be used will be illustrated as well.",

Corrosion reactions in which CO2 is present accelerate the formation of a protective FeCO3 layer, but the success of such a passivation depends on the saturation concentration and the corresponding temperature. Significantly better results compared to untreated steels were obtained at lower temperatures by increasing the pressure. To explain the differences in corrosion rates between samples, the activation energy for the layer dissolution was also discussed. It can be assumed that the compressibility of the CO2 at different pressures has an influence on the formation of the protective iron carbonate layer and its properties and thus to on the corrosion behaviour.",

Numerous simulation runs were made by taking various typical feed compositions classified as lean and rich. The effects of increasing the amount of C1, C5 in the feed stream on the efficiency of energy utilization are presented. A validation analysis was performed. The results show similar trends and good agreements. It was concluded from the results that when the concentration of methane in the gas mixture increase, the exergetic efficiency decreases. The results also show that the values of thermodynamic properties depend on the relative amount of heavy components in the feed stream.",

The obtained compound was characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and its crystal structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. X-ray structure analysis has shown that the central zinc ion is four-coordinated by two monodentate salicylato ligands and two pyridine molecules, forming a distorted tetrahedron. Since the asymmetric unit consists of two halves of coordination molecules, orthorhombic Ibca space group symmetry leads to two coordination molecules with slightly different geometry. The comparison between the two is given in terms of interatomic distances and angles, and also in terms of differences in intermolecular interactions obtained as a result of Hirshfeld surface analysis.

The results show that the variation of machining parameters changes the chemical composition of the workpieces. By increasing the discharge current and decreasing the Pulse-on time, the copper and the carbon diffuse onto the surface of the workpiece. Consequently, the chemical composition of the workpiece surface changes, leading to an increment of the corrosion resistance. The XRD analysis shows the formation of Fe2C, Cr3C2, and CuNi.

Herein, we report a rationally designed fluorescent probe (1) for the detection of Cu2+ synthesized by integrating 2-hydrazinylbenzothiazole with 3-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin. The probe alone is non-fluorescent due to the isomerization of C=N in the excited state. The addition of Cu2+ can cause a delayed fluorescence enhancement. A comparative study of 1 and its analogues indicated that the turn-on fluorescence response was thanks to the sulfur atom coordinating to Cu2+. The response delay of 1 in sensing Cu2+ was ascribed to the gradual transition from N-coordination to S-coordination (N and S in thiazole moiety). The proposed new function of S-donor would provide a new approach for the turn-on fluorescence sensation of Cu2+.",

The adsorbents’ structures were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. Specific surface areas were determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Tell equation. The study was carried out under various parameters influencing the manganese removal efficiency such as pH, temperature, contact time, adsorbent dose and initial concentration of manganese ion. The maximum adsorption capacity reached 42.02 mg/g for acid-treated Opuntia ficus indica, and only 20.8 mg /g for pure Opuntia ficus indica. The Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms equations were tested, and the best fit was obtained by the Langmuir model for both adsorbents. The thermodynamic study shows that chemisorption is the main adsorption mechanism for the activated adsorbent while physisorption is the main adsorption mechanism for the pure adsorbent. The kinetics of the adsorption have been studied using four kinetics models of pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion. Structural analyses indicate the appearance of MnOx oxides on the cellulose fibers. The adsorption mechanisms consist of an electrostatic interaction followed by oxidation of the Mn (II) to higher degrees, then probably by binding to the surface of the adsorbent by different C-O-MnOx bonds.",

In the first step, the appropriate adsorbent for sodium adsorption was determined among the three adsorbents, which the results showed that the AC had the highest sorption efficiency. Then, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the impact of different factors on the Na+ ion sorption efficiency using the AC. The highest removal efficiency was obtained to be 95.91% at optimum conditions such as pH of 11, contact time of 45 min, temperature of 25 °C, sodium ion concentration of 900 mg/L, and adsorbent dosage of 5 g/L. Also, the best conditions using the genetic algorithm was obtained at contact time of 94.97 min, adsorbent dosage of 3.52 g/L, Na+ ion concentration of 939.92 mg/L and pH value of 10.92. Moreover, the maximum sorption capacity using the Langmuir model was obtained to be 249.67 mg/g, which was a significant value. Besides, the equilibrium and kinetic studies indicated that the experimental data of sodium adsorption process were fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. Furthermore, the thermodynamic study indicated that the sorption process was endothermic. Generally, among the three adsorbents used, activated carbon with a high removal efficiency and significant sorption capacity can be considered as a promising adsorbent for the removal of sodium from wastewater on an industrial scale.",

Due to the limitations of molecular mechanics (MM) methods, docking analysis failed to give precise results about interactions that influence binding affinity of the ligands, but we presumed that aromatic-aromatic interactions, or edge-to-face, to be more precise, play an important role in the binding process. In order to further elaborate on this hypothesis, ah initio approach was used to calculate possible edge-to-face interactions on a model system and correlate them to ligand affinity. Obtained results indicate that those dispersive interactions can show notable influence on the binding of the ligands to 5-HT 1A receptor. Stabilization energies of modeled receptor-ligand complex, calculated using Becke's half-and-half hybrid DFT method showed strong correlation with the affinity of investigated ligands towards 5-HT 1A receptor.",

    "abstract": "The poloxamer P-407 hyperlipidemia mouse is a genetically unaltered, nondiet-induced model of atherosclerosis which is useful in studying effects of lipid lowering drugs. While the model is relatively well described on the biochemical level, the knowledge regarding the global gene expression was lacking so far. As expected, the P-407 elevates plasma triglycerides and cholesterol. Using microarray analysis and RT-PCR we show for the first time that poloxamer triggers a concerted modulation of hepatic genes involved in multiple steps of atherogenesis, such as lipid metabolism, initiation of atherogenesis, lesion formation, and atheroma progression. 106 hepatic genes were upregulated and only 40 downregulated, suggesting that upregulation of atherogenic genes precedes the atheroma formation. Modulated expression of circadian genes has also been observed in this type of hyperlipidemia but further studies are needed to elucidate whether this effects the rhythm of animals.",

This toxicity can be reduced by functionalization of NPs with L-glutathione reduced or bovine serum albumin by reducing their surface charge. Functionalization was confirmed with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering and zeta potential measurements. Viability assays showed that bovine serum albumin coating reduced NPs cytotoxicity immediately after 3 h exposure and that such NPs were more toxic to urothelial papillary neoplasm cells compared to normal porcine urothelial cells at 50 μg/ml NPs concentration.

Nevertheless, new, interesting fragmentation of described caffeine derivatives was observed. Moreover, heats of formation of odd-electron ions of 8-alkylaminocaffeine derivative s were calculated.",

This compound is characterized by a three-dimensional (3-D) framework. Photoluminescence experiments with solid-state samples uncovered that this compound can show yellow light emission with the emission peaks at 490, 545, 586 and 621 nm, respectively. These photoluminescence emission peaks are originated from the characteristic emission of the 4 f electrons intrashell transition of the 5 D 4 → 7 F J ( J = 6, 5, 4, 3) of the Tb 3+ ions. An energy transfer mechanism is expatiated by applying the energy level figure of the terbiumions and isonicotinic acid. This compound possesses a remarkable CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.3525, 0.4032). A wide optical band gap of 2.51 eV of the title compound is determined by using the solid-state UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.",

Mechanical inoculation by rubbing sap from a PVY infected plant onto the leaf surface together with a fine abrasive powder is the most convenient way of experimental transmission of PVY to host plants. However, factors determining reproducibility of this process need to be determined. In the present study, it was shown that higher titre of the virus in the inoculum resulted in faster increase of PVY NTN RNA titre in the inoculated leaves, as well as in faster translocation of PVY NTN from inoculated leaves into upper non-inoculated leaves. The final titre of PVY NTN RNA in upper non-inoculated leaves was independent of the virus titre in the inoculum. In addition, the occurrence of the disease symptoms was followed and the dependence to the titre of the virus in the inoculum was observed.",

The single crystal structure of 2b has been determined. The relationship between the structures and photophysical properties of both complexes are considered, and the DFT calculations have been used to further support the deduction. These Ir(III) complexes emit red light with quantum yields of 39.9–51.9% in degassed CH 2 Cl 2 solution at room temperature. Also, their emission originates from a hybrid 3 MLCT/ 3 LLCT/ 3 LC excited state. All these results show that iridium(III) complexes 2a - 2b are suitable for red-phosphorescent materials in OLEDs.",

According to the results of the study, six proteins from Corchorus olitorius, Cucumis sativus , Capsicum chinense, Carica papaya, Morus notabilis and Jatropha curcas were defined as the allergens. In conclusion, in silico tools developed under the field of bioinformatics can provide a big contribution to the estimation of unknown allergen proteins in different fruits.

All investigated blends were prepared by Brabender kneading chamber. A two-stage degradation pattern is seen in the case ofPCL, whilePLAexhibits only single stage degradation. On the other hand, the degradation of neat TPS proceeds through three degradation stages. It was found that addition ofPLAaffects the degradation ofPCL/PLAblends indicatingPLA's destabilising effect onPCL. TPS addition thermally destabilizes both,PCLandPLA, but notably thePCLsample. Likewise, that addition of TPS thermally destabilized all investigated ternary blends. The obtained data were used for the kinetic analysis of the degradation process. By using the isoconversional Friedman method and the multivariate nonlinear regression method kinetic analysis was performed. Kinetic analysis revealed the complexity of the thermal degradation process for neat samples and all investigated blends.

There is some scientific evidence that the molecular complexity of Alzheimer’s pathophysiology is associated with the formation of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. A novel cross- phenotype association analysis of imaging genetics reported a brain atrophy susceptibility gene, namely FAM222A and the protein Aggregatin encoded by FAM222A interacts with amyloid-beta (Aβ)-peptide (1-42) through its N-terminal Aβ binding domain and facilitates Aβ aggregation. The function of Aggregatin protein is unknown, and its three-dimensional structure has not been analyzed experimentally yet. Our goal was to investigate the interaction of Aggregatin with Aβ in detail by in silico analysis, including the 3D structure prediction analysis of Aggregatin protein by homology modeling. Our analysis verified the interaction of the C-terminal domain of model protein with the N-terminal domain of Aβ. This is the first attempt to demonstrate the interaction of Aggregatin with the Aβ. These results confirmed in vitro and in vivo study reports claiming FAM222A helping to ease the aggregating of the Aβ-peptide.",

The prepared nano material has been characterized by XRD, SEM, UV-Visible, and FTIR analysis. More prominently, the Fe2O3 and other impurities are removed though a simple work-up and the material prepared shows to be effective in catalyzing the conversion of reactants to products in good yields. Further, some of the synthesized acyl thioureas were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.",

Swollen, penetrable particles can act as a host for the active ingredients and provide stability, stimuli-responsiveness and recyclability for the guest. Thermoresponsive colloidal gel particles are especially attractive for such applications due to the extremely soft structure, size and responsiveness. Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) is a much studied, popular thermoresponsive polymer. The polymer has low toxicity and the phase transition temperature is close to body temperature. During the phase transition, the polymer becomes less soluble, the particle expels a large part of water and the particle collapses to a more compact form. The diffusion of material in and from the particles is largely affected by this transition. As the solubility of the polymer changes, so do the interactions with the loaded compound. This feature article focuses on the synthetic methods, properties and applications of soft PNVCL particles.",

Structures of these compounds were determined by spectroscopic techniques (FTIR, H NMR, and mass spectrometry). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy were used to evaluate their transition temperatures and mesophase properties (POM) throughout heating and cooling scans. The thermal data indicate that the compounds B5-B10 have mesomorphic properties with thermal stabilities; the data also reveal that the compounds B6-B10 are monotropic, whereas B5 is enantiotropic. B6, B7, and B9 only have a nematic phase, but B8 and B10 have a smectic phase followed by a nematic phase, and B5 only has a smectic phase. In addition, the study reveals that the inclusion of an acyl group as a terminal chain had the opposite effect on isotropization temperatures for compounds B6, B8, and B10, resulting in an increase in transition temperatures and a decrease in mesophase stability. The lack of a smectic phase in B7 and B9 compounds could be attributed to the narrow phase temperature range, which makes examination difficult, or to the molecules' lack of lateral attraction.",

The reaction rate within a heterogeneous liquid-liquid system incorporates a chemical kinetics term as well as mass transfer between both phases. Chemical rate constant was obtained from experiments within a homogeneous medium, whilst the mass-transfer coefficient was determined separately. The measured thermal profiles were then the bases for determining the overall reaction-rate. This study presents the development of an extended kinetic model for considering mass transfer regarding the saponification of ethyl benzoate with sodium hydroxide within a heterogeneous reaction medium. The time-dependences are presented for the mass transfer coefficient and the interfacial areas at different heterogeneous stages and temperatures.

It was demonstrated that iPMA chains with α(N) somewhat above the solubility limit of iPMA in aqueous solutions (in the present case at α(N) ≈ 0.27) are strongly aggregated. The size of the aggregates increases with increasing c(s), whereas the shape parameter, ρ, is approximately constant (ρ ≈ 0.6), irrespective of c(s). The low ρ value suggests that the aggregates have characteristics of microgel particles with a dense core surrounded by a less dense corona. The diffusion of iPMA chains was investigated also at higher α(N), up to α(N) = 1. The polyion slow mode arising from electrostatic interactions between charged chains was observed for α(N) exceeding the value 0.27 even at the highest c(s) (= 0.20 M).

The results of a pilot plant experiment were used as a sound basis for scale-up prediction to 750 kW semi-industrial DFB plant. By an eightfold increase of mass and heat flows a rather simplified co-gasification process was predicted. Namely, the losses occurring in gasification plants are expected to be relatively smaller in larger plants. The effect of decreased losses was studied with an equilibrium model. Three different situations were simulated with the following fixed values of losses: 70 kW, 115 kW and 160 kW. The model showed an increase in fuel conversion when losses were reduced.",

In the case of octane isomers it is derived from the values of a set of their physicochemical properties, calculating for each isomer the average of the normalized values and these averages are defined as branching degrees of octane isomers. The sequence of these branching degrees of octane isomers does not differ much from the \"regular\" one defined earlier. 2,2-Dimethylhexane appears to be less branched than 3,4-dimethylhexane and 3-ethyl, 2-methylpentane, whereas 2,3,4-trimethylpentane appears to be less branched than 3-ethyl, 3-methylpentane. While the increasing number of branches gives rise to increasing branching degrees, the peripheral position of branches and the separation between branches decreases the value of the branching degree. The central position of branches increases it. A bigger branch increases it more than a smaller one. The quantification of these structural features and their correlations with few indices is given as well.",

A mechanism for the CL reaction has been proposed on the basis of UV-Vis, fluorescent and CL spectra.

It was found that there is no unique mathematical approach for the calculation of relaxation spectra that ensures a satisfactory approximation of the experimentally determined dynamic moduli for the selected types of polymeric materials. It is recommended to combine different numerical methods in parallel to achieve a reasonable approximation of the material functions.",

Ibuprofen concentrations ranged (30.62–111.40) ng/L and caffeine (305.94–375.97) ng/L. Low risk on aquatic organisms was determined for ibuprofen and potential sublethal effect for caffeine was obtained. The results indicated that ibuprofen was effectively separated from other substances in the samples under defined chromatographic conditions for short period of time (4 minutes). Applied HPLC method showed good repeatability, accuracy, selectivity and robustness.

Numerous genuine misconceptions within chemical kinetics were revealed among first-year chemistry undergraduates. Although many of the misconceptions found here concur with those results previously published using other instruments, some novel findings were uncovered. These misconceptions can be attributed to a variety of factors including mathematical weakness, carelessness and difficulty in interpreting and extracting information from diagrams, graphs and other non-textual information.

    "abstract": "Novel anthraquinone-based cyclic antioxidants containing amino, thio and oxo groups were synthesized and their antioxidant capacity was determined by using the cerium(IV)-reducing antioxidant capacity (CERAC) assay. 1H, 13C NMR, FTIR-spectroscopy and ESI (Electrospray Ionization) mass spectrometry were used for the characterization of anthraquinone derivatives exhibiting CERAC antioxidant capacity. This study is of great importance, because the antioxidant capacity of anthraquinone compounds was analyzed for the first time by the CERAC method and CERAC-Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values were higher than that for Trolox. It should also be noted that, since all synthesized anthraquinone derivatives have the potential to find applications in terms of their biological properties due to their sulfur and nitrogen content, they will make an important contribution to the literature.",

The phase composition and microstructure of cement-dolomite mortars were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy with X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS). The results showed that the alkalinity of the medium increased the dolomite reaction degree but did not affect the reaction products’ composition. The formation of the hydrotalcite-like phase with the general formula Mg4Al2(CO3)1−x(OH)12+2x·nH2O proved to be the predominant route of dolomite consumption in the presence of available aluminium in the hardened cement paste. Then, after three months of ageing, an interlayer anions replacement became noticeable: carbonate anions in the structure of hydrotalcite are gradually replaced by hydroxide ones.",

Resveratrol showed three main susceptible centers to chlorination, starting from the electrophilic addition to the double bond and continuing with the chlorination of the phenolic moieties. Several experiments conducted under different disinfection conditions (pool/sea water, addition of salts, irradiation) showed basically similar chlorination patters with some variations in terms of product formation. The results of toxicity assessment using different test organisms (Vibrio fischeri, microalgae, daphnids) have shown different sensitivity of testing organisms to the parent UV filters in comparison with chlorinated products as well as different toxicity for specific UV filter in comparison to the others. As the closing loop of all experiments in the laboratory, an up-scaling to the real human skin is presented.",

A disordered nanoporous medium was modelled as i) an equilibrium distribution of ions in a +1:-1 primitive model electrolyte; ii) a system of dipolar hard spheres; iii) a collection of chainlike molecules with alternating charge on the beads (polyampholyte); and iv) as a system of charged chainlike molecules (oligoelectrolyte) with the pertaining counterions. The confined electrolyte was assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the obstacles forming the nanoporous matrix and an external electrolyte of the same chemical composition. The solvent in all these cases was treated as a dielectric continuum. In the present study we were interested in effects of the distribution of charged obstacles on the mean activity coefficient of the confined electrolyte. The computer simulations were performed for a set of values of the model parameters such as the concentration of matrix ions and of the annealed electrolyte, pre-quenching conditions and the conditions of observation. The results confirmed our previous findings that the properties of an annealed electrolyte depend strongly on the conditions of observation (temperature and dielectric constant of solvent), as well as on the concentrations of all components. The effect of the matrix-charge distribution, investigated in this work, was found to be significant and more important for higher Coulomb couplings.",

At low passive potential, 0.2 V vs. SCE, impedance spectra typical for an active - passive transition were observed. The assumption has been made, that they are the result of the adsorption process, caused by bound water, which blocks the passive layer of steel and leads to corrosion rate reduction. The process is the most significant at the oil and the air-quenched, but less at the tempered steel. When more noble potentials are approached the impedance spectra become typical for passive metals and the value of resistance and capacitance differ from each other with respect to the heat treatment.",

At high water/surfactant mole ratios (W ≈ 100-120) small amts. of co-ions drastically change the shape of the dielec. spectra in the 5-500 MHz region whereas for W ≈ 20 almost no effect is obsd.

Low-temperature heat capacities of the compound were measured bya precision automated adiabatic calorimeter over the temperature range from 80 to 390 K. A polynomial equation ofheat capacities as a function of the temperature in the region of 80–390 K was fitted by least square method. Based onthe fitted polynomial equation, the smoothed heat capacities and thermodynamic functions of the compound relative tothe standard reference temperature 298.15 K were calculated with 5 K step. In addition, DSC technique was used to de-termine the melting process of the compound.

Recovery values for all analyzed pesticides were over 60% and the reproducibility expressed as relative standard deviation was in the range of 10%. The method is suitable for the determination of OCPs in meat products with high content of fat from low ppb concentration range onward.

The optimal pH value was found to be at 7.4. The presence of 0.1 M alkaline and alkaline earth metal ions decreased the enzyme activity for about 20%. In addition, a notable effect on the process of enzyme inhibition by pesticide paraoxon, which was chosen as a model organophosphate pesticide, was observed already when the concentrations of investigated ions were between 0.001 M and 0.01 M. For calibration purposes the standard solutions of paraoxon therefore need to be prepared with the addition of metal ions in concentrations corresponding to those present in investigated apple juice and the pH value of apple juice adjusted to 7.4 by the addition of Tris buffer.",

    "abstract": "The effect of direct transesterification methods on the omega-3/6 composition of extracts from Phaeodactylum tricornutum was studied. The aim of this work was to identify an extraction method which allowed to obtain the most suitable profile of fatty acids in terms of its potential benefits to health, particularly if further used in the food industry. Seven methods using acids, alkalis, and heterogeneous-catalysts, (namely methods from 1 to 7, abbreviated as M1-M7) were performed to determine α-linolenic (ALA), linoleic (LA), docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids. The composition of fatty acids was in all cases characterized by the major abundance of palmitic (23.95–34.08%), palmitoleic (30.94–35.56%), oleic acids (3.00–7.41%), and EPA (0.5–6.45%). Unsaturated fatty acids extraction yield was higher with a two-step transesterification process (M6, 63.65%). The total fatty acid methyl ester content (FAME) obtained with acid-transesterification (M1) reached about 21% wt, and 60% w/w total lipids. ALA higher relative content (ALA/LA ratio) was obtained when a lipid pre-extraction step was performed prior to acid-catalysis (M4). The transesterification method based on alkali-catalyst (M3, KOH catalyst) led to obtain higher DHA relative contents (DHA/EPA ratio up to 0.11), although its FAME content was 3.75-fold lower than that obtained with acid-transesterification (M1). Overall, this study shows that direct transesterification with alkali-catalyst (M3) improves the determination of PUFA content from the diatom through a more efficient transesterification-based extraction process, and thus allow to assess the value of the biomass more accurately for application in the food industry.",

The fast Fourier transform continuous cyclic voltammetry (FFTCV) at gold microelectrode in flowing solution system was used for determination of flunixin in its pharmaceutical formulations. The developed technique is very simple, precise, accurate, time saving and economical, compared to all of the previously reported methods. The effects of various parameters on the sensitivity of the method were investigated. The best performance was obtained with the pH value of 2, scan rate value of 30V s –1 , accumulation potential of –100 mV and accumulation time of 0.4 s. The proposed method has some advantages over other reported methods such as, no need for the removal of oxygen from the test solution, a picomolar detection limit, and finally the method is fast enough for the determination of any such compound, in a wide variety of chromatographic methods. The method was linear over the concentration range of 14–266400 pg/ml (r = 0.9975) with a limit of detection and quantitation 4 and 14 pg/ml, respectively. We used this method to determination of flunixin in tablets.",

These would range from the nonlinear (NLP) dynamic optimization of a stand-alone batch reactor up to the mixed-integer nonlinear (MINLP) synthesis of a complex reactor network in overall process schemes. Different schemes for the Orthogonal Collocation on Finite Element (OCFE) and various model formulations, in the case of MINLP model, were studied in order to increase the robustness and efficiency of the model. A deterministic model for known kinetics was obtained for batch and PFR reactors and extended for uncertainties in process parameters and reaction kinetics when the kinetics is unknown. Different variations of the developed model were applied to certain problems, as examples. The first motivating example was the dynamic optimization of batch reactor and the second the MINLP synthesis of a process scheme for the production of allyl chloride. The NLP version of the model with moving finite elements was found to be the most efficient for representing a batch reactor in the dynamic optimization example, and PFR trains in the process synthesis example.",

The systems were studied at different ionic strengths of the annealed electrolyte mixture and at different matrix concentrations. The results show similar trends as for electrolyte mixture adsorption in charged cylindrical micropores. At low matrix and annealed electrolyte mixture concentration the sorption of the ions is observed while at high concentrations the electrolytes get excluded from the matrix. As expected, the exclusion is stronger for the HCl solutions as a result of a weaker electrostatic attraction between H + and matrix ions.",

The total protein in the methanolic extract was 36% lower and showed 10% fewer sulphydryl groups than that from the water extract. However, the radical scavenging activity of the water extract was four-fold greater than for the methanolic extract. The proteins of both of these extracts were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and selected proteins were identified using mass spectrometry. The majority of these identified proteins were intracellular proteins, such as those involved in oxidative stress responses and osmotic stress responses, and proteins with hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities.

The visualized events during boiling were analyzed in terms of the bubble frequencies and boiling front oscillations in microchannels. A digital image sequence analysis algorithm was composed to determine the time dependence of bubble and meniscus locations. The results show (i) the dynamic characteristics of boiling in microchannels, (ii) the increase of fundamental oscillation frequencies with increasing heat flux and temperature of the microchannel bottom, (iii) the amplitudes of the flow boiling oscillations are inversely proportional to the fundamental frequencies. The outcomes of the study are important as the oscillations during boiling in single microchannels are experimentally confirmed to be predictable in terms of oscillation frequencies and amplitudes trends and dependencies. This knowledge is especially significant at constructing efficient two-phase micro heat exchangers, micro mixers or micro reactors, as the cross section and the length of the channel become exceedingly important design parameters in micro devices with boiling.",

The linearity range, limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.1-10 µg/mL, 0.03 µg/mL and 0.11 µg/mL respectively. Moreover, the accuracy, precision and recovery remained within the acceptable limits. The assay was effectively applied for determining the concentration of ceftiofur in plasma samples collected from ceftiofur-treated buffalo calves.",

In aPMA solutions, aggregation and phase separation take place with increasing T . The onset of aPMA aggregation (heating) and re-dissolution of the aggregates (cooling) is shifted to lower T s with increasing ionic strength of the solutions. iPMA associates partly decompose upon heating, but stable nano-sized particles are present at all T s. Structural characterization of the aggregates was carried out by dynamic and static light scattering measurements at 25 °C. Results revealed that aggregates of both PMAs with Mg 2+ ions involve a lot of water and have a rather even mass distribution. This is attributed to strong hydration of Mg 2+ ions and their preference towards monodentate binding to carboxylate groups. Differently, Ca 2+ ions bind more strongly and in a bidentate manner, they lose the hydration water and form aggregates with several structural elements, depending on chain tacticity.",

Then, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple hot water technique and composited with the nanofiber. The study focuses on applying the modified PVA nanofibers to remove malachite green (MG) from water using different pH, contact times, and dye initial concentrations. The surface morphology of the nanofiber was determined using SEM, FTIR, and XRD techniques. SEM showed that the crosslinking was increased, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles appeared as agglomerates on the surface of the nanofiber. The removal percentages at optimal pH and contact time were 99.76%, and 99.5%, respectively. Thereafter, kinetics was studied by the linear pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich equation, and Intraparticle diffusion models. Results demonstrated that the adsorption kinetics follow the pseudo-second order. Moreover, the adsorption isotherm was discussed using Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The Langmuir equation best described the adsorption with R2 value of 0.9771, and the maximum removal was 128.205 mg/g. As a result, the MG dye molecules covered the PVA nanofiber/Fe3O4 nanoparticles in a monolayer and homogenous coverage. The results of this study are significant for industries’ wastewater treatment as they provide a potential solution for the removal of MG dye from textile, paper, cosmetics, food, and aquaculture industries’ wastewater.",

Due to the biomedical importance of 3-aminopropionitrile a full investigation of structural, vibrational, and other associated properties of all possible conformers was performed. The geometrical structures, relative stability, and vibrational frequencies of the gauche and trans 3-aminopropionitrile conformers have been studied using ab initio (CCSD/6-311+G(d,p)) and DFT (B3LYP and M06 functionals at 6-311+G(d,p) and aug-cc-pVDZ basis set) calculations. The conformational and vibrational studies of 3-aminopropionitrile molecule were presented here are in very good interpretation of the calculated data compared with very poor interpretation in previous studies. The results showed that the gauche 2 conformer is more stable by 0.19 kcal/mol than gauche 1, outlined as enthalpy change ΔH between the conformers, at CCSD/6-311+G(d,p). Additionally, the population analysis shows that the gauche conformers are more prevalent than the trans conformers in the gas phase, present at 72.8%, with gauche 2 being the dominating gauche conformer at 40.1%. These results are in good agreement with earlier experimental and theoretical conclusions. All minima conformers’ thermodynamic characteristics have also been studied. The relevant bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles were calculated at a different level of theory for all possible conformers. The geometrical outcomes of the conformers agree very well with the previous experimental results. Electrostatic potential surface (ESP) has been used to interpret the structure-activity relationship. The atomic charges are examined, together with the energy difference between HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital). Additionally, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap and other relevant molecular properties are computed. The most stable conformers’ stabilization energy has been determined by the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis.",

This study explored BVR’s role in mediating these protective effects under normoxic and hypoxia-reoxygenation conditions. Pharmacological inhibition of BVR reduced the protective effects of BV and BR, as evidenced by the decreased cell viability, cellular antioxidant activity, and intracellular bilirubin levels. Activation of ERK1/2 reduced BVR’s protective function, while its inhibition enhanced it.

The strong affinity of SLC to sephadex allowed accumulation of SLC at the surface of electrode and thus higher electrochemical sensitivity to SLC. The influence of sephadex loading, the pH of the solution and the scan rate on the peak current was studied. A linear calibration curve covering the concentration range from 0.005 to 1 mM was obtained using SWV.

Moreover, the effect of the detected variant in the described patient was evaluated on the RNA level in nasal epithelial cells. The variant was shown to result in aberrant splicing introducing a frameshift and a premature termination codon while normal transcript was not detected. Alternative spliced mutant transcripts in other tissues or the presence of spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing could explain the mild clinical presentation of patients with this variant in homozygous state.",

In the nucleation phase, the ketone group in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) will preferentially bind to Ce3+ to form complexes and provide heterogeneous nucleation sites for the system, prompting the nucleation of cerium carbonate crystals. In the growth stage, due to the adsorption of PVP, the probability of (120) crystal plane appearing in the equilibrium state is the greatest, resulting in the formation of hexagonal flake cerium carbonate crystals with (120) crystal plane as the oblique edge. Experimentally, hexagonal sheet cerium carbonate crystals were successfully prepared using PVP as a template agent. Therefore, DFT can be used to predict the morphology of cerium carbonate crystals, which not only elucidates the growth mechanism of cerium carbonate crystals, but also greatly reduces the experimental cost.",

The tool aims to increase representational competence related to submicroscopic representations. Students who used the software for the first time, were instructed to create molecular models using the model building/editing tools in three activities with varying levels of difficulty: 1) building a simple model (butanoic acid), 2) converting one model (hexane) into two models, 3) converting from a non-cyclic to a cyclic structure (glucose). It took students from two up to 15 minutes to accomplish each of the activities. Several types of help were available in the 3DChemMol molecular editor toolbar to assist students during their activities, including a video tutorial, button hovering, action status display, and a help menu. Undo/redo and restart options were also available. Students’ completion level, difficulties, and use of the help features were investigated using student self-evaluation questionnaires. The 3DChemMol molecular editor proved to be a useful support for students in completing simple chemistry activities. Students were successful in model building, although they encountered some specific difficulties, especially in steps that involved spatial operations, such as rotating the selected part of molecule around the bond. In students’ perception, the video tutorials were the preferred and most frequently used type of help, and the undo function was considered essential. The results suggest that the 3DChemMol molecular editor can be used effectively in introductory chemistry courses at the tertiary level, whether for direct instruction, self-study, or other forms of support in the pedagogical process. The results and new findings of this study will be used to further optimize the interface in future versions of the evaluated tool.",

In the course of quinone derivatives, the new N(H)-substituted-5-nitro-1,4-naphthoquinones (NQ) as regioisomers were synthesized by reactions of 2,3-dichloro-5-nitro-1,4-naphthoquinone with some heterocyclic ring substituted nucleophiles such as anilines, piperazines, or morpholines, according to a Michael 1,4-addition mechanism. Five NQ regioisomer couples having different functional group (2-chloro-isomers 3, 5, 7, 9 and 13; 3-chloro-isomers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12) are reported here. All new synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic methods and two-dimensional NMR techniques 1H-1H correlated spectroscopy (COSY).The synthesized NQ regioisomers were evaluated for catalase enzyme inhibitory activities and antioxidant efficiency. The synthesized regioisomers were screened for their antioxidant capacity using the cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) method. 2-Chloro-3-((2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)amino)-5-nitronaphthalene-1,4-dione (5) showed the highest antioxidant capacity with a 1.80±0.06 CUPRAC-trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) coefficient. Compound 5 also showed strongest catalase enzyme inhibitory activity. The antioxidant capacity results of all 2-chloro regioisomers are higher than the 3-chloro regioisomers. Likewise, also catalase enzyme inhibitory activities results were determined in the same way, except for one regioisomer pair. The catalase was effectively inhibited by the newly synthesized compounds, with % inhibition values in the range of 0.71-0.86%. Some of these NQ compounds also showed remarkable antioxidant capacities.",

Herein, an amino-silica nanospheres/polypyrrole (ASNS/PPy) nanocomposite sorbent was synthesized and used as the fiber coating for headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) of aldehydes in edible oils, followed by gas chromatography (GC) separation and determination. Amino-silica nanoparticles were prepared by an amended Stöber method and composited with polypyrrole during its electropolymerization on the surface of a platinized stainless-steel fiber. The synergy between in-situ electropolymerization and rough surface of the platinized metal substrate created a durable fiber coating with unique uniformity, cohesiveness, and adsorption properties. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The performance of the prepared fiber was optimized by investigating the affecting variables including extraction temperature and time, stirring rate, and desorption conditions. The obtained limits of detection for hexanal and heptanal in sunflower oil were 0.005-0.009 µg mL-1. The prepared fiber exhibited excellent repeatability and reproducibility with the intra-fiber and inter-fiber relative standard deviations in the ranges of 3.9-8.8% and 7.3-15.1%, respectively.

Preparation of fully protected N- and C- terminal aziridine containing dipeptides was found to be straightforward and high yielding for the majority of compounds, whereas their full deprotection was possible only for C-terminal analogs. Deprotection of N-terminal derivatives using standard procedures of peptide chemistry was found difficult providing only mixtures of unidentifiable products. The described molecules have potential as building blocks in synthetic chemistry, in the chemical biology arena, as covalent modifiers, and as biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Chemical composition and crystal structure are central to defining the functional properties of materials. But when a material is prepared in the form of nanoparticles, the structure and, as a consequence, the composition will also frequently change. Understanding these changes in the crystal structure at the nanoscale is therefore essential not only for expanding fundamental knowledge, but also for designing novel nanostructures for diverse technological and medical applications. The changes can originate from two thermodynamically driven phenomena: (i) a crystal structure will adapt to the restricted size of the nanoparticles, and (ii) metastable structural polymorphs that form during the synthesis due to a lower nucleation barrier (compared to the equilibrium phase) can be stabilized at the nanoscale. The changes to the crystal structure at the nanoscale are especially pronounced for inorganic materials with a complex structure and composition, such as mixed oxides with a structure built from alternating layers of several structural blocks. In this article the complex structure of nanoparticles will be presented based on two examples of well-known and technologically important materials with layered structures: magnetic hexaferrites (BaFe12O19 and SrFe12O19) and ferroelectric Aurivillius layered-perovskite bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12).",

Therefore, present work reported the sulfur and nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots from bone meal functionalized with boronic acid (Boro-S/N-dGQDs) nanoprobe for sialic acid sensing applications. Briefly, S/N-dGQDs were functionalized with 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid to improve performance of fluorescent sensors for detection of sialic acid. The boronic acid surface decorating on S/N-dGQD was confirmed by several spectral characterizations. Addition of varying quantities of sialic acid results in a directly proportionate correlation to fluorescence quenching. As a result, it has a broad linear range of 50 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 6.04 ng/mL. It also displayed remarkable selectivity, likely due to interaction of sialic acid-containing 1,2-diol with hydroxyl group of Boro-S/N-dGQDs nanoprobe.

To improve the relevance of the textbook sets for students, the currently rare presence of history of chemistry, environmental orientation, and technology and industry orientation and the lack of the use of socio-scientific orientation should be overcome. It would be valuable if further studies in textbook sets would also address the intended chemistry curriculum from a more holistic perspective.",

It was found that diazotized 2-amino-6-nitrobenzo[d]thiazol reacts with the ring nitrogen atom of variously substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole derivatives to yield tetrazine nucleus. The benzene ring of benzothiazole bearing electron donor group and annulated to the tetrazine was further substituted in situ by other (6-nitrobenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)diazinyl to yield the final product. The structure of the prepared compounds was elucidated using their physical data, elemental analyses, and spectroscopic data. The synthesized compounds were tested for their antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria. Two of the synthesis tetrazine derivatives exhibited interesting antibiofilm potential.",

The optimized method resulted in a linear calibration curve ranging from 1.70–130 μg mL–1 for all three phytosterols. Analyses of external phytosterol standards showed good linearity (R2 of 0.998 to 0.999); LOD and LOQ were determined to be 0.32–9.30 μg mL–1 and 0.98–28.1 μg mL–1, respectively. Repeatability and reproducibility precision analyses showed acceptable values of %RSD. β-sitosterol was the predominant phytosterol (51.53–81.03% of total) among all samples.

In alkaline solutions, dichromate ions changed to chromate ions which were not adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent. Thus, experiments were carried out in acidic and neutral water solution. Under these conditions, adsorption sites of adsorbent were protonated by primary and ternary amine groups of adsorbent shown as –NH3+ and –NHR2+ respectively that adsorbed dichromate ions through electrostatic interactions. Adsorption isotherms of dichromate on graphene oxide/polyamidoamine G4 were obtained under various ionic strengths, pHs and temperatures. Isotherms were analyzed by the adsorption isotherm regional analysis (ARIAN) model. The highest observed adsorption capacity of this process was 246.7 mg g–1 at pH = 0 and 318 K. Tests at pH = 2 showed that this process was endothermic. Adsorption kinetic experiments were carried out under various initial dichromate concentrations, pHs, temperatures, shaking rates and ionic strengths and were analyzed by the kinetics of adsorption study in the regions with constant adsorption acceleration (KASRA) model and intraparticle diffusion, ideal-second-order (ISO) and non-ideal process of adsorption kinetics (NIPPON) equations. The four-region ARIAN and KASRA models using a series of equations can interpret thermodynamics and kinetics of interactions of adsorbent and adsorbate under different conditions, respectively. Pb2+, Cd2+, Cr3+ and tannic acid were separated by graphene oxide/polyamidoamine G4 from dichromate ions and the graphene oxide/polyamidoamine G4 was recycled by using an alkaline solution.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer cell growth is often dependent on the presence of steroidal hormones. The 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 isoform (17βHSD1) catalyzes NADPH-dependent conversion of estrone to estradiol, a more potent estrogen, and represents potential drug target for breast cancer treatment. To provide active enzyme for inhibitor screening, 17βHSD1 is usually expressed in insect or mammalian cells, or isolated from human placenta. In the present study we describe a simple protocol for expression and purification of active human 17βHSD1 from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Soluble human 17βHSD1 was expressed using a pET28a(+)-based plasmid, which encodes a hexahistidine tag fused to the N-terminus of the protein, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The enzyme activity of purified 17βHSD1 was verified by three methods: thin-layer chromatography, an alkali assay and a spectroscopic assay. These non-radioactive enzyme assays require only standard laboratory equipment, and can be used for screening compounds that modulate 17βHSD1 activity.",

Through modification of the polymer structure by adjustment of DVB concentration（the ratio of DVB concentration to VIC concentration was x: 1 (x = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) and the product was named PVIC-x (x = 2, 3, 4, 5)), the optimal PVIC-4 pore structure was obtained, with a specific surface area and total pore volume of 192.5 m2 g–1 and 0.192 cm3 g–1, respectively. A toluene adsorption test verified the adsorption capacity. The adsorption behavior for VOCs, based on toluene, was investigated using adsorption breakthrough curves, adsorption kinetics, and isotherms.

The effect of surfactant types, pH, and scan rate on the voltammetric response of leuprolide acetate were evaluated. Using square wave voltammetry, two anodic peaks were observed at 0.81V and 1.26 V for the glassy carbon electrodes at pH 3.70 (acetate buffer solution). The oxidation peak currents of leuprolide acetate were enhanced in the presence of 8.0 × 10–2 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate.

    "abstract": "Janez Vajkard Valvasor je svoje uradno šolanje opravil v Ljubljani. Kmalu po zaključenem pouku je mladi Valvasor skupaj z že uveljavljenim kemikom Joannesom de Monte Snydersom eksperimentiral na Dunaju. V naslednjih letih je nadgradil svoje poznavanje kemijskih lastnosti kovin za izdelavo tankostenskega kipa ob Dolenjski cesti v Ljubljani iz posebej v ta namen izumljene zlitine podobne tistim, ki so jih Japonci uporabljali za svoje zvonove. Iz svojih knjig in potovanj je zvedel podrobnosti o tedanjih japonskih zlitinah s katerimi si je pomagal pri lastnem postopku vlivanja kipa. Valvasor je v Ljubljani končal le nižje študije, saj so visokošolski pouk razvili komaj desetletje po njegovi smrti. Kdo so bili njegovi učitelji kemije, morebiti celo alkimije, in kje so Valvasorjevi profesorji pridobili potrebna znanja? Na voljo je pravzaprav le ena sama zanesljiva notica o njegovem ljubljanskem študiju datirana 15. 8. 1659, vendar je tudi iz nje mogoče spoznati učitelje, ki so ga utegnili navdušiti s svojim poznavanjem strukture snovi. Abstract Valvasor’s Contributions to Chemical Technology The Polymath Joannes Weikhard Valvasor (* 1641) conducted all his formal training in Ljubljana. Shortly after completing his schooling the young Valvasor experimented with the established chemist Joannes de Monte Snyders in Vienna. In the following years Valvasor developed his knowledge of the chemical properties of metals for the manufacture of thin-walled statue at Dolenjska Street in Ljubljana. He used the specially designed alloy similar to those endorsed by the Japanese for their bells. From his books and travels Valvasor learned the details of the Japanese alloys and used the data for his own process. According to the only available note about studies in Ljubljana College on August 15, 1659 Valvasor passed from the lower Latin Mary’s congregation to the higher Latin Mary’s congregation which means that he just finished the study of Syntax (higher Grammar) and was about to began his studies of poetics. He probably enrolled as the student-beginner in 1655/56 and graduated as the student of rhetoric in 1660/61. In this paper we will name Janez Vajkard Valvasor’s teachers of chemistry in his teenage years. Valvasor eventually finished just few years of his lower studies because as impetuous young man he decided not to continue his studies in any of the higher education institutions available outside Ljubljana. The leaders of Ljubljana lower courses who enabled and supported the work Valvasor’s formal teachers will be focused. The other important locals who helped Valvasor’s formal teachers to manage his teenage aspirations will be described. And last, but not least, the professor of Valvasor’s teachers will be named. Keywords: Johan Weikhard Valvasor, Athanasius Kircher, Joannes de Monte Snyders, History of Chemistry, History of Schools, chemisemiotics.",

    "abstract": "Opisani sta dve stoletji jezuitskih predavanj kemijskih vsebin v Ljubljani s poudarkom na 17. stoletju. Prvič so podani dosežki vodilnih začetnikov kemije, ki so tedaj delovali v Ljubljani. Prikazan je statistični prerez njihovega porekla, študija in ohranjenih del kot ilustracija presenetljivo močnega jezuitskega vpliva v med tedanjimi ljubljanskimi poznavalci kemijskih lastnosti snovi.Posebej so izpostavljeni tisti, ki jih je v kranjsko prestolnico zaneslo že kot uveljavljene učenjake. Z analizo primerjamo zapisana dela prvega med njimi, Goričana Luke Vintana, in stoletje mlajšega Gradčana Francisca Reinzera. Razlika v njunem poznavanju kemije oziroma filozofije narave orisuje napredek pri dojemanju snovi skozi sholastične spore okoli kartezijancev do Newtona in Valvasorja, čeravno še vedno v formalno zapovedanih Aristotelovih okvirjih. Rojstni in študijski kraji ter ohranjena kemijska dela ljubljanskih jezuitov orisujejo način kadrovanja in urne načrtne izmenjave strokovnjakov med kolegiji avstrijske province je predstavljen kot dobrodošel opis začetkov kemije v tedanji Ljubljani.Bistvena poteza jezuitskega uspeha pri pouku kemije in sorodnih ved je izšla iz zgledne hierarhične organiziranosti. Mednarodna razprostranjenost in izpiljen občutek za sprejemljive domače šege sta bila srž znanstvenih in pedagoških uspehov jezuitov povsod po svetu. Med Kranjci se je godilo ravno tako potem ko so si jezuiti znali pridobiti redovnike iz vrst lokalnih velikašev.****Two centuries of Jesuits’ lecturing related to chemistry in Ljubljana is discussed. The focus is put on the 17th century. The achievements of distinguished early expert for chemistry employed in Ljubljana in 17th century are put in the limelight for the first time. The statistics of their pedigrees, studies, and preserved works is focused to illustrate the intellectual background of their surprisingly overhelming influence in contemporary Ljubljana circles interested in early chemistry.The special concern is put on Jesuits who arrived to Ljubljana as established scholars. The written chemistry-related works of the first among them, Luka Vintana of Gorizia, were compared to a century younger Ljubljana Jesuit Francisco Reinzer from Graz. The difference in their perception of chemistry, physics, or philosophy of nature outlines progress in the perception of matter which took place through the scholastic conflicts about Cartesians chemistry all the way to Newton and Valvasor. In spite of profound changes all Jesuits’ output of those times still formally prescribed Aristotle frames. A statistical cross-section of native places of Ljubljana Jesuits, their Alma Mater, and written works related to chemistry were discussed. The method of staffing and quick carefully planned exchange of professors between colleges of Austrian Jesuit province is presented as a welcome illustration of surprisingly strong Jesuits’ impact on the intellectuals of Ljubljana.The essential feature of Jesuit success in teaching of chemistry and related disciplines was connected to their exemplary hierarchical organization. The international distribution and sophisticated sense for acceptable domestic rituals were the keys to scientific and pedagogical success of Jesuits around the world. The Carniola Jesuits followed the same path with numerous Jesuits belonging to the local nobles.",

After electrochemical and chemical lithiation, ionic conductivities of the lithiated LiF-Ti composite films are increased to be 10 -3 and 10 -4 S/cm separately. This phenomenon indicates that the phase boundary between LiF and Ti should be the ionic conducting channels for external lithium in the LiF-Ti nanocomposite.

    "abstract": "One of the most important Mid-European professor with more than six thousand academic descendants was the leading Slovenian erudite Jurij Vega. In broader sense, Vega's and other applied sciences of the south of Holy Roman Empire of German Nationality were connected with the mercury mine of Idrija during the last half of millennia. The Idrija Mine used to be one of the two top European producers of mercury, the basic substance of atomistic alchemists. Idrija Mine contributions to the history of techniques, their examinations and approbations is comparable to the other Mid-European achievements. The peculiarities of Idrija mining environment where people valued mostly the applicative knowhow is put into the limelight. The applicative abilities of Idrija employers affected the broader surroundings including Vega's Jesuit teachers in nearby Ljubljana and the phenomena of comparatively many China-Based Jesuits connected with the area of modern Slovenia. The Jesuits' Mid-European education and networks are put into the limelight, as well as their adopted Chinese networks used for their bridging between Eastern and Western Sciences. The Western origin of the scientific-technologic-industrial revolution(s) with causes for their apparent nonexistence in Chinese frames is discussed as another Eurocentric rhetorical racist question which presumes the scientific-technologic-industrial revolution(s) as something good, positive, and therefore predominantly European. The Chinese ways into progress without those troublemaking revolutions is focused for the first time in historiography from combined scientific, moral, religious, and economic viewpoints. The Chinese contributions to particular areas of research in chemistry and physics is focused to find out the preferences and most frequent stages of (European) paradigms involved in the Chinese networks. Some predictions of future interests of Chinese chemistry and physics are provided. The Chinese Holistic Confucian distrust in atoms is discussed as possible new paradigm which could rename the destructible divisible entities of future physics, and with more difficulties also of chemistry. The word atom meaning indivisible not compound entity is basically in contradiction with the characteristics of item it is supposed to describe. The suffix \"a\" provides a negation in Ancient Greek language. The suffix should be omitted to use tom (τομος) to manage the actual situation of a-toms (=Toms) as compound of elementary particles. In late 19th century after the European Spring of Nations actually two basically different concepts of atoms of chemists and physicists accomplished a kind of symbioses. The suggestion is put forward that while indivisible atoms soon became contradictions in physics, they still retain some value in chemistry which should be taken into account in the attempt to hange the name of atom. The research of human genome as the atom of genetics is similar in broader sense, while there is no basic problem with the nomenclature of genome. The genome manipulations are far less obstructed with Chinese traditions compared to Christian beliefs.",

H 2 O 2 and UV advanced oxidation processes (H 2 O 2 /UV AOPs) were combined with hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) to assess the effects on the removal of selected organic pollutants. Water samples containing humic acid, methylene blue dye and micropollutants (metaldehyde, diatrizoic acid, iohexol) were treated first by H 2 O 2 (dosages from 1 to 12 mg L -1 ) and UV (dosages from 300 to 2800 mJ cm -2 ) AOPs alone and later in combination with HC, generated by nozzles and orifice plates (4, 8, 18 orifices).

Under favouring conditions, i.e. high UV absorbance of the matrix (more than 0.050 cm -1 at a wavelength of 254 nm) and a high pollutant to oxidants ratio, HC was found to improve the hydrodynamic conditions in the photolytic reactor, to improve the subjection of the H 2 O 2 to the UV fluence rate distribution and to enhance the removal of the tested organic pollutants, thus showing promising potential of further research in this field.",

We aimed to study the apoptosis-stimulating effect of homobrassinin and thiazino[6,5-b]indol in human ovarian adenocarcinoma A2780 and A2780cis cells via flow cytometric analysis of annexin V/PI, caspase 3 and 9 activity, cytochrome C release, and smac-diablo accumulation. Using the western blot technique, we also monitored the effect of both indoles on the response of heat shock proteins in these cells. Thiazino[6,5-b]indol showed more pronounced sensitizing and/or pro-apoptotic effect compared to homobrassinin accompanied by increased smac-diablo accumulation at earlier time intervals and pronounced externalization of phosphatidylserine at 72 h in A2780cis compared to A2780 cells. The apoptosis stimulating effect of thiazino[6,5-b]indol in A2780cis cells was associated with significant irreversible downregulation of HSP70 and HSP90 and partly with a decrease of HSP40. On the other hand, cisplatin-induced the apoptosis of sensitive A2780 cells with reversible downregulation of HSP40 and HSP57. In conclusion, the effect of thiazino[6,5-b]indol on resistant A2780cis cells could have a great utility in both the potential prevention and the treatment of other cisplatin-resistant tumor cells.",

The results revealed that the reversion behavior of NR/BR vulcanizate is affected by SS-Calix. The data obtained from curing characteristics and thermal stability of test pieces indicate that, SS-Calix acts as an anti-reversion for rubbery materials that are exposed to thermal shock in the early stages of temperature rise. It’s predicted that these results are due to the interaction between the OH groups present in the SS-Calix surface and the carbon of the polymer chains. The broad peak observed in the IR spectrum around 1824 cm−1 which is referred to C=O bond, confirms this prediction. In addition, the presence of SS-Calix in compound causes to increase modulus and hardness but reduce elongation and resilience.",

In this phenomenographic research, interviews were conducted with 30 prospective teachers enrolled in the Science Education Program, Education Faculty, Firat University in the spring semester of the 2018–2019 academic year. In the first stage of the two-stage interview, the participants were asked to rank some chemical compounds according to their increasing acidity strength, while in the second stage, they were asked to rank some chemical compounds according to their increasing basicity strength. In the interviews, participants were also asked to explain in detail the reasons for their ranking. From the answers given by the participants to the questions, six different answer patterns were obtained for acidity strength, while five different answer patterns were obtained for basicity strength. It was determined that all ten heuristics affect the reasoning of the participants, and because of the effects of heuristics, students generally use shortcut strategies instead of scientific reasoning. In addition, this study revealed that although it was not included in the model proposed by Talanquer, periodic trends heuristic also affected the reasoning of the participants on the “chemical structure – acidity/basicity relationship”.",

To study chemical changes in aged membranes, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis in the attenuated total reflection mode (ATR) was used. Finally, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) were performed simultaneously to study thermal degradation. The results show obvious changes in the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of membranes caused by plasticizer loss. Surface microstructure becomes stiffer, which leads to contractions and the prevalence of voids. In cross-sectional area, average thickness values decrease. Due to the degradation of the plasticized waterproofing membranes, the roofing area had to be completely replaced.",

In this work, the mineral composition was determined in medicinal species of the genus Seseli using inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Two multivariate statistic methods –principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to distinguish samples regarding their mineral composition.

We have synthesized a naked-eye coloured chemosensor with carbazole. As a model genetic material, DNA of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was hybridized to ssDNA and immobilized over nitrocellulose membrane. The prepared adenine-chemosensor, by passing through the nitrocellulose-ssDNA membrane caused the formation of ssDNA nitrocellulose-ssDNA-adenine-chemosensor. FTIR results of the immobilized ssDNAs showed that the matching of same ssDNA releases the adenine-chemosensor from the surface of nitrocellulose-ssDNA that results in formation of the double stranded DNA. The selectivity of chemosensor was also confirmed with different bacterial DNA (Bacillus subtilis) as control.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a GC-FID approach involving pre-column silylation and quantification via the effective carbon number approach. Four hydroperoxides of α-pinene were synthesized in the liquid phase with singlet oxygen and identified using literature data on isomer yield distribution, MS spectra, estimated boiling temperatures of each isomer (retention time), their thermal stability and derivatisation rate. The developed procedure was used for the determination of hydroperoxides in bottled and autooxidised turpentine. We anticipate that this method could also be applied in atmospheric chemistry, where the reactivity of singlet oxygen could help explain the high formation rates of secondary organic aerosols.",

The influence of amino group/pH, an excess of silanes and re-soaking with water on binding with cellulose was examined. The results obtained confirm that both selected silanes can effectively modify MCC. However, the treatment with 3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane occurred more effective than with Methyltrimethoxysilane due to the presence of amino groups. Among the three tested solvents, the most effective was pure water. In contrast, the use of ethanol and a mixture of ethanol and water gave significantly worse results.

Recently, a passive sampling device - Chemcatcher ® has been developed for the measurement of a broad range of priority organic and inorganic pollutants. The device uses a common design with interchangeable receiving phases and membranes, depending upon application. There are two designs of housing available for the Chemcatcher ® . The samplers were deployed at two sites in Portsmouth Harbour (Portsmouth, UK) for several 14-day periods. Three replicates of the Chemcatcher ® sampler were deployed at each site. Two different designs of sampler housing were used and compared in the trial. During the who le exposure time the water chemistry was carefully monitored. Spot samples were collected re gularly during the deployment period and the uptake of selected organic priority pollutants in the passive samplers was compared to the levels found in the spot samples. The samplers prov ided time-weighted average concentrations of the bioavailable (truly dissolved ) fraction of monitored pollutants. Sampling rates at Site 1 (outside the harbour basin) were ar e almost three times higher than those at Site 2, which was probably caused by the more intense tu rbulence of water. In comparison with",

Our simulations predicted the uniform distribution of solvent molecules over and under the plane of oxo-quinoline skeleton for all four model molecules solvated in dimethylsulfoxide. Although theoretical electronic energies of the transitions are underestimated, the shapes of the simulated absorption spectra are in good accordance with the experimental UV/Vis data.

It is found that the s-trans conformer is more stable than the s-cis conformer by ∼0.69 kcal/mol. The vibrationally averaged bond lengths and bond angles, both for the cis and trans conformers, are within 0.005 A and 0.14°, respectively, of the equilibrium geometry. The ab initio and DFT based anharmonic vibrational analysis using second-order perturbation theory provides reliable frequencies (r.m.s. deviation ±20 cm –1 ) and assignments to the vibrational bands. DFT calculations using the same method and basis function for the harmonic frequencies and anharmonic corrections give frequencies in better agreement with the experimental values than those in which the harmonic frequencies from a high level quantum mechanical method (B97-1/aug-cc-pVTZ) are coupled with anharmonic corrections from a cheap model (B3LYP/6-31+G**); the r.m.s. deviation in the latter case is ±47 cm –1 . The errors in the calculation of the fundamental modes are reflected in the overtones and combination bands. Some spectroscopic constants namely, the anharmonic constants, rotational constants and rotation-vibration coupling constants of the two conformers have been calculated by density functional theory and compared with literature, where available.",

Membrane bioreactor with submerged membrane (HF MBR)is complex multiphase physico-chemico-biological system with internal interactions between process variables and dynamic changes within gas-liquid-solids phases.A study of hydrodynamics in an operating laboratory bioreactor at realistic working conditions is crucial for design and scale up of a bioreactor for wastewater treatment processes.Accumulation of high concentrations of biomass causes the occurrence of heterogeneous regions in a bioreactor. This paper focuses on the effects of activated sludge on average residence time, which is often quite different from the ideally designed hydraulic residence time (HRT)in a submerged hollow fiber membrane bioreactor. In this work, tracer experiments using Dirac δ impulse of the saturated NaCl solution and monitoring electrical conductivity in the outflow with a flow-through conductivity cell were performed. From experiments at liquid flow rate range of 7.2 – 16.5 L/h , air flow rate range of 1.7 – 5.1 m3/h , and activated sludge concentrations MLSS 4.5 – 7.4 g/L probability density of residence time distribution (RTD)functions for hollow fiber membrane bioreactor and average residence times τ MBR were calculated The relative residence time defined as the ratio of HF MBR τ MBR and CSTR τ id were evaluated as function of MLSS concentration.Proposed is a linear regression model of the relative residence time with MLSS concentration.The model has negative proportionality coefficient k =– 0.0814 g/L of MLSS due to decrease of the relative residence time with increase of active sludge concentration. Statistical evaluation of the model gives the correlation coefficient of R2 =0.8374.Decrease of the mean residence time with increase of MLSS is discussed inview of non-uniform membrane fouling.",

Under conditions of an excess of hydroxyurea over iron(III), mono- and bis(hydoxyureato)iron(III) complexes are formed. The complexes quickly decompose in aqueous solutions, but are relatively stable in dimethylformamide. Equilibrium quotients for the formation of the mono- and bis- complexes in acidic aqueous solution at 25 °C and I = 2.0 mol dm -3 (maintained by NaClO 4 ) are found to be 0.91 and 0.15, respectively. The kinetic results suggest that the formation of bis complex is much faster process. The cyclic voltammogram exhibits one well-defined quasi-reversible cathodic peak at +0.29 V in dimethylformamide. The redox potential was shifted to less positive values by 140 mV compared to the solvated iron(III) ion due to electron donating effect of ligand molecule.

The Donnan exclusion coefficient and mean activity coefficient of an electrolyte confined in a microcapillary were calculated as functions of the electrolyte concentration and the dielectric constant of the solvent. The exclusion coefficient was found to decrease with increasing electrolyte concentration and with decreasing dielectric constant of the solvent. In other words, the desalination mechanism becomes very inefficient in solvents with dielectric constant lower than that of water. In comparison with Monte Carlo simulations the Poisson-Boltzmann theory was able to predict correct trends for the Donnan exclusion coefficient, but it grossly overestimated Monte Carlo results. The microscopic picture which emerged on the basis of the distributions of small ions in the microcapillary was helpful in explaining these results.",

General rules that allow us to stipulate the factors that direct the main steps of the energy hypersurface of reactions as well as the products were established. Direction of the reaction flow is determined by direction of intramolecular skeletal isomerisation of cyclic-bridged halogenium cation and isomerisation takes place to create a more stable skeletal structure. Stability of resultant skeletal structure is determined by the number of σ bonds between isolated double bonds of the alkene and bonding-type of double bonds (N- and U-type). When the number of σ bonds between double bonds of the alkene is three (m=3), the reaction takes place to predominantly give an N-type product, and when four(m=4), N- and U-type products are formed.

The coordination of DTIC with these metal ions results in several complexes emerging in solution. The aim of this work is to determine the protonation constants of the DTIC and to show the extent of its coordination with (Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Co2+), in other words, establish the stability of the complexes formed between the DTIC and these metal ions by the determination of their stability constants. Experimental environments were organized to attain the coordination and measurements in aqueous solutions at 25±0.1 ºC and an ionic background of 0.1 mol dm–3 NaCl. The HYPERQUAD computer program was used to determine both the protonation and stability constants for the ligand and metal-ligand complexes respectively. DTIC has five protonation constants that can be obtained under experimental conditions used; 10.54, 20.15, 26.99, 32.02 and 36.01. The results are interpreted in terms of the basicity of the donor atoms and structuralcomposition of the ligand. All the complexes produced in the solution are exhibited in speciation diagrams.",

It was intended to investigate the protective effects of MMSC on amiodarone induced brain damage. Rats were divided to four groups as follows, control (given corn oil), MMSC (50 mg/kg per day), AMD (100 mg/kg per day), AMD (100 mg/kg per day) + MMSC (50 mg/kg per day). The brain glutathione and total antioxidant levels, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, paraoxonase, and Na+/K+-ATPase activities were decreased, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl, total oxidant status, oxidative stress index and reactive oxygen species levels, myeloperoxidase, acetylcholine esterase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were increased after AMD treatment. Administration of MMSC reversed these results. We can conclude that MMSC ameliorated AMD induced brain injury probably due to its antioxidant and cell protective effect.",

Biodegradability, COD (chemical oxygen demand) and TOC (total organic carbon) were measured before and after applying oxidative process. It was confirmed that significantly smaller molar dose of ozone (1.1 mgO3 / mgatb) against the hydrogen peroxide (17 mgH2O2 / mgatb), deliver comparable improvements of biodegradability; Tiamulin biodegraded up to 60 %, levofloxacin close to 100 %. Ozonation removed more TOC (10%, 29% and 8% for tiamulin, levofloxacin and amoxicillin, respectively) than Fenton process. This is confirming mineralization of antibiotics, not only biodegradable intermediates formation. In terms of costs, ozonation is more feasible in oxidizing complex antibiotics in water, as it targets functional groups which carry antimicrobial properties. This brings not only improved biodegradability needed for a conventional biological treatment plant, but also reduces long-term impacts of the antibiotics in the environment.",

A least-squares fit produced a regression equation y = 0.128x + 1.449, R = 0.997. This was used to predict lithium concentrations in both artificially prepared lithium/saliva test solutions and in hospitalized patients treated with lithium.

They examined the extracts to identify specific amino acids with antioxidant properties and assessed their impact on liver function and tissue structure. The results showed that the plant extracts had positive effects on the histological section of the TAA-treated group. Additionally, the group of male rats treated with TAA and a chemotherapy drug called MMC displayed positive effects. Similarly, the group of male rats treated with TAA, flower plant extract, and MMC also showed positive effects.

    "abstract": "It is well known that the guanidinium group in Arginine plays an important role in noncovalent interactions. However, its role is not well documented since the selection of its global minimum structure is still controversial. The main difficulties on obtaining accurate results lie on: neutral Arginine can occur in 3 forms, two of which are canonical and one is zwitterion; each form has degenerate enantiomers D- and L-; its numerous degrees of freedom make it challenging to perform a thorough study; the short-range interactions require higher levels of theory to correctly describe them. Thus, we have performed a meticulous global minimum search. We performed optimizations of the systems at the PBE0 /Def2TZVP level of theory and single point calculations at the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/Def2TZVP level with zero-point corrections at PBE0 /Def2TZVP. We also analyzed Thermal Populations and IR Spectra of the systems to fully understand Arginine's behavior. The results show the energy minima structures strongly rely on its internal nitrogen-rich groups.",

The elemental composition of polythioamides was confirmed through CHN microanalysis. The structure and properties of thiourea monomers and polythioamides were determined through proton NMR, UV-Vis, FT-IR spectroscopy, fluorescence, TGA/DTA and SEM. The polythioamides indicated high thermal stabilities which were assessed from their Tmax (temperature indicating highest rate of weight loss) values (670 °C and 346 °C) observed in their DTG graphs. The thioureas and polythioamides were fluorescent and showed multicolor (violet, green, yellow, orange and red) emissions at different excitation wavelengths. All the synthesized compounds were also tested for their antifungal and antibacterial functions and showed antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans.",

The solutions were irradiated with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, with pulse energy varied from 180 to 760 mJ. Optodynamic sources were formed at different distances from the liquid - air boundary inside the liquid and in the air. The propagating optodynamic waves were detected with a laser beam deflection probe inside the liquid. The possibility of identification of different optodynamic excitation mechanisms was investigated. Spatial nonhomogenity of the laser beam profile influences the absorption process at and near the liquid - air boundary. As a consequence of this influence the shape and characteristics of the optodynamic source were considered. It was found out that optodynamic amplitude analysis can be used to assess the light power density at which the transition from linear to nonlinear excitation regime occurs.",

The polyamides were obtained in high yields and possess inherent viscosities in the range of 0.55–0.75 dl/g.

This study showed that a γ turn structure centered on the central residue is the native structure of the chemotactic peptide fMLP analogs, where both CO(formyl) and NH(central residue) groups are available and ready to interact with the receptor. The inactive analog fML S P-OMe prefers instead a γ turn structure centered on the Met residue, where the two groups cited above are not available for this interaction. Our results and those of literature enable us to propose the “induced fit” model of Burgen for the molecular recognition process. Consequently, the activity of fMLP analogs chemotactic peptides would not be related to a specific secondary structure (β turn, γ turn or extended….) but rather to the freedom and the availability of the CO(formyl) and the NH group at position 2.",

There are a lot of ways to reduce this parameter both in construction improvement of the tire and changing in rubber compound formulation especially in tire tread formulation. Rubber scientists have been trying to introduce new processing aid agents beyond the traditional tire components for reducing the rolling resistance. In this study, a unique structure of silica-supported calix[4]arene (SS-CSC[4]A) has been synthesized and applied as a processing aid agent in tire tread formulation. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1HNMR and 13CNMR), 29Si CP/MAS spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), elemental analysis, and acid-base titration were used to characterize its structure. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) use to investigate the effect of prepared material on qualification of filler dispersion in the rubber matrix. The viscoelastic properties of the prepared rubber compound were measured by Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) which showed the great decrease in rolling resistance of rubber compound based on SS-CSC[4]A as a processing aid agent. The mechanical and rheological properties of obtained tread rubber compound measured by tensometer and MDR rheometer showed no sensible changes in these properties.",

Signal detection was performed at 280 nm; fluoroquinolones were additionally quantified by fluorescence detection. Validation parameters such as linearity, recovery and precision were evaluated. The limits of detection (LOD) in river waters were in the range 0.1–1.3 μg/L for antibiotics detected by UV, and 0.039 and 0.073 μg/L for fluoroquinolones detected by FLD.

Six different answer patterns for each question were obtained from the answers. The findings of this study showed that students generally used shortcut strategies instead of analytical/scientific reasoning, as all ten heuristics affected participants’ reasoning.

    "abstract": "The binary adsorption isotherms of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and water vapor from the air have been the focus of much research in recent years. The content of adsorbed VOCs in the presence of water vapor can be determined by the volumetric or gravimetric method, in a static or dynamic mode. This study focuses on the adsorption technique in a static mode for isotherm measurement of the co-adsorption of VOCs and water vapor from the air using the gravimetric method. The content of VOCs is determined using a total organic carbon analyzer, while the amount of the adsorbed water was calculated from the difference between total adsorption (VOCs and water) and the adsorbed VOCs. This paper presents several adsorption isotherms with different VOCs (toluene, benzene, methanol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol) and adsorbents (ZSM-5 zeolite, silica gel and Na-Form mordernite) in the presence of water vapor. The well-known adsorption isotherm models (Langmuir, extended Langmuir, Freundlich, extended Freundlich and Hill) were used to treat experimental results. The adjusted R-Squared (adj. R2) values obtained for those non-linear models for isotherms (total adsorpton (qe,tot) as a function of equilibrium concentration of VOC (Ce) and the adsorbed VOC (qe) as a function of equilibrium concentration of VOC (Ce) are used to determine the best-fit isotherm model. The modeling results showed that the 3-parameter models could fit the data better than the 2-parameter model, with relatively higher adj. R2. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented adsorption technique can be used for isotherm measurement of the co-adsorption of VOCs and water vapor from the air.",

A Mutually Optimized Contribution of the Structural Numbers (MOCSN) was used to calculate which parts of information regarding branching contribute the tested Structural Numbers. Besides the known Structural Numbers, two Asymmetry Numbers were developed in order to quantify the asymmetry of the octane isomers, one regarding the asymmetry along the main chain of the molecule and the other one regarding the asymmetry perpendicular to the main chain of the molecule. Their correlation to the values of 29 tested physicochemical properties of octanes was low, |R| &lt; 0.6. After optimization of the Mutually Optimized Contribution of the Structural Numbers, the Information Content of the Mutually Optimized Contribution of the Structural Numbers ranged from 34.3% to 89.0% of the information contained in the physicochemical properties. The Structural Numbers enable the first step of the structural interpretation of physicochemical properties of octane isomers. In 17 out of 29 cases the most of information contained in the physicochemical properties is presented among the Structural Numbers by the Number of Branches, in 8 cases by the Peripheral Number, in 3 cases by an Asymmetry Number and in 1 case by the Distance Number.",

Maximum adsorption capacity (13.7 mg/g) was observed for SA at 298 K, pH = 7.0, adsorbent dose = 0.3 g and time = 70 min which was 1.4 times higher than that of SB. Adsorption data modelled into Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics. Mass transfer coefficients decreased with increase in As(III) concentration. Film diffusion significantly dominated the adsorption of As(III) ions irrespective of the initial concentration. Dimensionless Sherwood number (Sh) interrelated As(III) concentration (Co) as: Sh = 2.97(Co)–0.376, Sh = 4.12(Co)–0.215, Sh = 4.83(Co)–0.588 for H2SO4 modified, NaOH modified and native slag respectively.

First, the CaCO3 crystals were prepared and analyzed using XRD, FTIR, SEM, BET, AFM, and zeta potential analysis. Based on the characterization results, the shape of the CaCO3 crystals changed from smooth cubic calcite crystals to porous irregular spherical-like vaterite crystals with increasing tryptophan concentration. Meanwhile, the kinetic results showed that the thermal degradation of CaCO3 followed the shrinkage geometrical spherical mechanism, R3 and the average activation energy was 224.6 kJ/mol. According to the results of the experimental design, the tryptophan concentration was the most influential variable affecting the relative fraction of vaterite in the produced crystals. It can be concluded that tryptophan is important for better understanding and controlling the polymorph, size, and morphology of CaCO3 crystals.",

However, Krajnc’s life ended abruptly. He was arrested on October 17, 1947 and sentenced to death on April 26, 1948 in the mounted Dachau Trial in Ljubljana. He was reportedly shot on May 12, 1948, at the age of 34. The life story of Boris Krajnc is closely linked to the work of several Slovenian chemists who were selected as prisoners at Dachau Concentration Camp to provide technical assistance in human experiments or in the clinical laboratory of the camp hospital. In the post-war period Dachau Trials in Ljubljana, a total of 8 chemists were convicted, 5 of whom were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad. In later evaluations of Dachau Trials it turned out that the charges were constructed and the confessions were obtained by cruel interrogation methods, therefore all judgements were annulled. After the emigration of the enzymologist Richard Klemen (1942) and the expulsion of Maks Samec and Marta Blinc from the university (1945), Boris Krajnc was to supervise biochemistry at the Technical Faculty. After his death, the lecturer of biochemistry was Dušan Stucin from the Medical Faculty. Later, biochemistry was absent from the chemistry curriculum for several years.",

Experiments were performed in batch technique at different pH values, temperatures, sorbent dosage, contact time and initial aluminium concentration. The thermodynamic studies on the adsorption process of aluminium onto hydroxyapatite indicated that the process is spontaneous and endothermic. The Langmuir, Freundlich, Flory-Huggins, Dubinin-Radushkevich and Temkin equilibrium models were applied to the description of experimental data. The adsorption of aluminium follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The kinetics of adsorption was evaluated using the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models. The rate of aluminium adsorption was successfully described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The obtained results indicated that hydroxyapatite treated with Pluronic P123 surfactant has a higher sorption capacity toward aluminium ions (117.65 mg g-1) than hydroxyapatite treated with Pluronic F127 surfactant (109.89 mg g-1) while untreated hydroxyapatite exhibited the lowest one (104.17 mg g-1).",
