    "abstract": "Abstract The transition metal dichalcogenides are about 60 in number. Two-thirds of these assume layer structures. Crystals of such materials can be cleaved down to less than 1000 Å and are then transparent in the region of direct band-to-band transitions. The transmission spectra of the family have been correlated group by group with the wide range of electrical and structural data available to yield useful working band models that are in accord with a molecular orbital approach. Several special topics have arisen; these include exciton screening, d-band formation, and the metal/insulator transition; also magnetism and superconductivity in such compounds. High pressure work seems to offer the possibility for testing the recent theory of excitonic insulators.",

    "abstract": "We review the recent rapid progress in the statistical physics of evolving networks. Interest has focused mainly on the structural properties of complex networks in communications, biology, social sciences and economics. A number of giant artificial networks of this kind have recently been created, which opens a wide field for the study of their topology, evolution, and the complex processes which occur in them. Such networks possess a rich set of scaling properties. A number of them are scale-free and show striking resilience against random breakdowns. In spite of the large sizes of these networks, the distances between most of their vertices are short - a feature known as the 'small-world' effect. We discuss how growing networks self-organize into scale-free structures, and investigate the role of the mechanism of preferential linking. We consider the topological and structural properties of evolving networks, and percolation and disease spread on these networks. We present a number of models demonstrating the main features of evolving networks and discuss current approaches for their simulation and analytical study. Applications of the general results to particular networks in nature are discussed. We demonstrate the generic connections of the network growth processes with the general problems of non-equilibrium physics, econophysics, evolutionary biology, and so on.",

In particular, the form of pairwise intermolecular correlations in the liquid surface and the capillary wave treatment of the interface are examined in some detail. It is argued that conventional capillary wave theory, which leads to divergences in the width of the density profile, is unsatisfactory for describing all the equilibrium aspects of the interface. The density functional formalism which has been developed to study the liquid-vapour interface can also be profitably applied to other problems in the statistical mechanics of non-uniform fluids; here a new generalization of the 'linear' theory of spinodal decomposition is formulated and by considering a 'nearly uniform' fluid, some useful results for the long-wavelength behaviour of the liquid structure factor of various monatomic liquids are obtained. Some other topics of current interest in this area are briefly discussed.",

In particular, several dimensional invariants are examined which make it possible to unify much of the available information, and to extend the insights of percolation theory to processes which have not yet received numerical study. The compilation of the results of percolation theory, both exact and numerical, is believed to be complete through 1970. A selective bibliography is given.

    "abstract": "Abstract Each complex network (or class of networks) presents specific topological features which characterize its connectivity and highly influence the dynamics of processes executed on the network. The analysis, discrimination, and synthesis of complex networks therefore rely on the use of measurements capable of expressing the most relevant topological features. This article presents a survey of such measurements. It includes general considerations about complex network characterization, a brief review of the principal models, and the presentation of the main existing measurements. Important related issues covered in this work comprise the representation of the evolution of complex networks in terms of trajectories in several measurement spaces, the analysis of the correlations between some of the most traditional measurements, perturbation analysis, as well as the use of multivariate statistics for feature selection and network classification. Depending on the network and the analysis task one has in mind, a specific set of features may be chosen. It is hoped that the present survey will help the proper application and interpretation of measurements. Acknowledgements We are grateful to Lucas Antiqueira, Carlos A.-A.

More recent work on thin films has revealed new phenomena, including colossal magnetoresistance near the Curie temperature, dense granular magnetoresistance and optically-induced magnetic phase transitions. This review gives an account of the literature on mixed-valence manganites, placing new results in the context of established knowledge of these materials, and other magnetic semiconductors. Issues addressed include the nature of the electronic ground states, the metal-insulator transition as a function of temperature, pressure and applied magnetic field, the electronic transport mechanisms, dielectric and magnetic polaron formation, magnetic localization, the role of cation disorder and the Jahn-Teller effect. Sample preparation, and the properties of related ferromagnetic oxides are also discussed.",

Attention is given to the theory of those properties of long-wavelength lattice vibrations in both cubic and uniaxial crystals which can be studied by Raman scattering. In particular the phenomena observed in the Raman scattering from crystals which lack a centre of inversion are related to the theory. The angular variations of the scattering by any type of lattice vibration in a crystal having any symmetry can be easily calculated using a complete tabulation of the Raman tensor. Recent measurements of first-order lattice vibration spectra are listed. A discussion of Brillouin scattering is included. The relation of second-order Raman spectra to critical points in the lattice vibration density of states is discussed, and measurements of the second-order spectra of diamond and the alkali halides are reviewed. The theory and experimental results for Raman scattering by electronic levels of ions in crystals are examined, and proposals for Raman scattering by spin waves, electronic excitations across the superconductive gap and by plasmons are collected together. Finally, the prospects for applying lasers as sources for Raman spectroscopy are discussed, and progress in the new technique of stimulated Raman scattering is reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The d1 layer metals TaS2, TaSe2, NbSe2, in all their various polytypic modifications, acquire, below some appropriate temperature, phase conditions that their electromagnetic properties have previously revealed as ‘anomalous’. Our present electron-microscope studies indicate that this anomalous behaviour usually includes the adoption, at some stage, of a superlattice. The size of superlattice adopted often is forecast in the pattern of satellite spotting and strong diffuse scattering found above the transition. Our conclusions are that charge-density waves and their concomitant periodic structural distortions occur in all these 4d1/5d1 dichalcogenides. We have related the observed periodicities of these CDW states to the theoretical form of the parent Fermi surfaces. Particularly for the 1T octahedrally coordinated polytypes the Fermi surface is very simple and markedly two-dimensional in character, with large near-parallel walls. Such a situation is known theoretically to favour the formation of charge and spin-density waves. When they first appear, the CDW's in the 1T (and 4Hb) polytypes are incommensurate with the lattice. This condition produces a fair amount of gapping in the density of states at the Fermi level. For the simplest case of 1T-TaSe2, the room temperature superlattice is realized when this existing CDW rotates into an orientation for which it then becomes commensurate. At this first-order transition the Fermi surface energy gapping increases beyond that generated by the incommensurate CDW, as is clearly evident in the electromagnetic properties. For the trigonal prismatically coordinated polytypes, CDW formation is withheld to low temperatures, probably because of the more complex band structures. This CDW state (in the cases measured) would seem at once commensurate, even though the transition is, from a wide variety of experiments, apparently second order. A wide range of doped and intercalated materials have been used to substantiate the presence of CDW's in these compounds, and to clarify the effect that their occurrence has on the physical properties. The observations further demonstrate the distinctiveness of the transition metal dichalcogenide layer compounds, and of the group VA metals in particular.",

A large number of magnetic compounds which, according to the available experimental information, meet the requirements set by one or the other of the various models are considered and their properties discussed.

Such systems are nearly perfect realisations of various kinds of Hubbard models, and as such may very well serve to mimic condensed matter phenomena.

After a short presentation of the models and the methods of treatment of such systems, we discuss in detail, which challenges of condensed matter physics can be addressed with (i) disordered ultracold lattice gases, (ii) frustrated ultracold gases, (iii) spinor lattice gases, (iv) lattice gases in “artificial” magnetic fields, and, last but not least, (v) quantum information processing in lattice gases.

Since the application of percolation theory, the main advances in the understanding of these processes have come from fractal theory. Scaling theories and numerical simulations are important tools to describe diffusion processes (random walks: the ‘ant in the labyrinth’) on percolation systems and fractals. Different types of disordered systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion are presented (the incipient infinite percolation cluster, diffusion-limited aggregation clusters, lattice animals, and random combs), and scaling theories as well as numerical simulations of greater sophistication are described. Also, diffusion in the presence of singular distributions of transition rates is discussed and related to anomalous diffusion on disordered structures.",

    "abstract": "Publisher Summary The van der Waals forces refer to the attractive forces acting between any two neutral atoms or molecules that are separated by distance large compared to their own dimensions. These forces are of a long-range nature, which decrease with distance according to a power law. The basic idea of the theory is that the interaction between the bodies is considered to take place through a fluctuating electromagnetic field. This field is always present in the interior of a material medium and it also extends beyond its boundaries because of the thermodynamic fluctuations. Any change in the electrical proper ties of the medium in a certain region will, by Maxwell's equations, lead to a change in the fluctuation field that extends beyond that region. Therefore, the part of the free energy that is related to electromagnetic fluctuations is not determined by the properties of the substance solely at the point considered.",

Focusing on phase transitions from fluctuating phases into absorbing states, the universality class of directed percolation is investigated in detail. The survey gives a general introduction to various lattice models of directed percolation and studies their scaling properties, field-theoretic aspects, numerical techniques, as well as possible experimental realizations. In addition, several examples of absorbing-state transitions which do not belong to the directed percolation universality class will be discussed. As a closely related technique, we investigate the concept of damage spreading. It is shown that this technique is ambiguous to some extent, making it impossible to define chaotic and regular phases in stochastic nonequilibrium systems. Finally, we discuss various classes of depinning transitions in models for interface growth which are related to phase transitions into absorbing states.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vesicles consisting of a bilayer membrane of amphiphilic lipid molecules are remarkably flexible surfaces that show an amazing variety of shapes of different symmetry and topology. Owing to the fluidity of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions, vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate. This article describes the systematic physical theory developed to understand the static and dynamic aspects of membrane and vesicle configurations. The preferred shapes arise from a competition between curvature energy, which derives from the bending elasticity of the membrane, geometrical constraints such as fixed surface area and fixed enclosed volume, and a signature of the bilayer aspect. These shapes of lowest energy are arranged into phase diagrams, which separate regions of different symmetry by continuous or discontinuous transitions. The geometrical constraints affect the fluctuations around these shapes by creating an effective tension. For vesicles of non-spherical topology, the conformal invariance of the curvature energy leads to conformal diffusion, which signifies a one-fold degeneracy of the ground state. Unbinding and adhesion transitions arise from the balance between attractive interactions and entropic repulsion or a cost in bending energy, respectively. Both the dynamics of equilibrium fluctuations and the dynamics of shape transformations are governed not only by viscous damping in the surrounding liquid but also by internal friction if the two monolayers slip over each other. More complex membranes such as that of the red blood cell exhibit a variety of new phenomena because of coupling between internal degrees of freedom and external geometry.",

The equilibrium properties of the vortex lattice are described and the generalized driving force in gradients of temperature and field is derived using irreversible thermodynamics. This leads to expressions for thermal cross effects which can include pinning forces. The field distributions which occur in a range of situations are derived and a number of useful solutions of the critical state given. In particular, the distribution in a longitudinal field is obtained, and the conditions under which force-free configurations can break down by the cutting of vortices discussed. The effects of lattice rigidity on the summation of pinning forces is considered and it is shown that a summation based on statistical arguments uses the same approximations and leads to the same results as a dissipation argument. Theoretical expressions are derived for the vortex pinning interaction to a number of different metallurgical defects. The theoretical models are compared critically with experimental measurements of pinning forces and other related phenomena, such as flux creep, low amplitude vortex oscillations and vortex lattice defect effects. Finally, the implications for technological materials are assessed.",

How can one determine the growth laws that describe the time dependence of characteristic length scales, and what can be said about the form of the associated scaling functions?

The coexistence of several order parameters in multiferroics brings out novel physical phenomena and offers possibilities for new device functions. The revival of research activities on multiferroics is evidenced by some novel discoveries and concepts, both experimentally and theoretically. In this review, we outline some of the progressive milestones in this stimulating field, especially for those single-phase multiferroics where magnetism and ferroelectricity coexist. First, we highlight the physical concepts of multiferroicity and the current challenges to integrate the magnetism and ferroelectricity into a single-phase system. Subsequently, we summarize various strategies used to combine the two types of order. Special attention is paid to three novel mechanisms for multiferroicity generation: (1) the ferroelectricity induced by the spin orders such as spiral and E-phase antiferromagnetic spin orders, which break the spatial inversion symmetry; (2) the ferroelectricity originating from the charge-ordered states; and (3) the ferrotoroidic system. Then, we address the elementary excitations such as electromagnons, and the application potentials of multiferroics. Finally, open questions and future research opportunities are proposed.",

It is shown that the parameters which determine the lattice vibrations of a diatomic ionic crystal may be chosen in such a way that the crystal will exhibit ferroelectric properties, and that ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric transitions may be regarded as the result of an instability of the crystal for a certain normal mode of vibration. The theory is extended to apply to other cubic crystals, including barium titanate, and the concepts of ‘ionic polarizability’ and ‘a polarizability catastrophe’ are discussed in terms of lattice dynamics. Certain of the parameters which appear in Devonshire's phenomenological theory of ferroelectricity are found to be expressible in terms of atomic parameters. Values for the latter which are physically reasonable are found to account quite well for the dielectric properties of barium titanate and for the relative movements of the atoms which occur at the cubic-tetragonal transition. The lowest dielectric dispersion frequency is calculated to be about 3 × 1011 c.p.s. for barium titanate, and to be a function of temperature in the cubic phase. Other predictions of the theory are discussed.",

First, key theorems and central concepts in non-Hermitian linear algebra, including Jordan normal form, biorthogonality, exceptional points, pseudo-Hermiticity, and parity-time symmetry, are delineated in a pedagogical and mathematically coherent manner. Building on these, we provide an overview of how diverse classical systems, ranging from photonics, mechanics, electrical circuits, and acoustics to active matter, can be used to simulate non-Hermitian wave physics. In particular, we discuss rich and unique phenomena found therein, such as unidirectional invisibility, enhanced sensitivity, topological energy transfer, coherent perfect absorption, single-mode lasing, and robust biological transport. We then explain in detail how non-Hermitian operators emerge as an effective description of open quantum systems on the basis of the Feshbach projection approach and the quantum trajectory approach. We discuss their applications to physical systems relevant to a variety of fields, including atomic, molecular and optical physics, mesoscopic physics, and nuclear physics with emphasis on prominent phenomena and subjects in quantum regimes, such as quantum resonances, superradiance, the continuous quantum Zeno effect, quantum critical phenomena, Dirac spectra in quantum chromodynamics, and nonunitary conformal field theories. Finally, we introduce the notion of band topology in complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems and present their classifications by providing the proof, first given by this review in a complete manner, as well as a number of instructive examples. Other topics related to non-Hermitian physics, including nonreciprocal transport, speed limits, nonunitary quantum walk, are also reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Granular metal films (50–200,000 Å thick) were prepared by co-sputtering metals (Ni, Pt, Au) and insulators (SiO2, Al2O3), where the volume fraction of metal, x, was varied from x = 1 to x = 0.05. The materials were characterized by electron micrography, electron and X-ray diffraction, and measurements of composition, density and electrical resistivity at electric fields ε up to 106 V/cm and temperatures T in the range of 1.3 to 291 K. In the metallic regime (isolated insulator particles in a metal continuum) and in the transition regime (metal and insulator particles in a metal continuum) and in the transition regime (metal and insulator labyrinth structure) the conduction is due to percolation with a percolation threshold at x⋍0.5. Tunnelling measurements on superconductor-insulator-granular metal junctions reveals that the transition from the metallic regime to the dielectric regime (10–50 Å size isolated metal particles in an insulator continuum) is associated with the breaking up of a metal continuum into isolated metal particles. In the dielectric regime the temperature dependence of the low-field resistivity is given by ρL = ρo exp [2√(C/kT)], and the field dependence of the high-field, low-temperature resistivity is given by ρH = ρ∞ exp (εo/ε), where ρo, ρ∞, C, and εo are material constants. A simple theory based on the assumption that the ratio s/d (d-metal particle size and s-separation between particles) is a function only of composition yields expressions for ρ(ε, T) in excellent agreement with experiment. Furthermore, the theory predicts the experimental finding that the resistivity can be expressed in terms of a universal function of the reduced variables kT/C and ε/εo. The inter-relationship between all the important physical properties of granular metals and their structure is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "This review seeks to extend the scope of both the experimental and theoreticalwork carried out since I completed my 1993 review on the electronic, optical, andto a lesser extent, the transport properties of a variety of semiconductor quantumdots (QDs). In addition to the many advances that have been made on topics suchas quantum confinement effects (QCE), optical and luminescence properties,energy levels, and theoretical models that were dealt with in outline then, anumber of new themes have emerged. These include detailed studies on singleQDs such as InAs, InP, CuCl, etc, and this became possible due to thedevelopment of several microtechniques such as scanning near field opticalmicroscopy, SNOM or NSOM, as well as the use of improved growth proceduressuch as those involving MBE and the Stranski-Krastanow (SK) growth method, orby better chemical processing. By concentrating on single dots, it has provedpossible to limit the extent of the line broadening for the optical absorption andluminescence peaks due to the variation in dot sizes in the more usual types of films used. Line half widths (FWHM) in the microvolt region have now been recorded, and this has helped in the identification and resolution of excitons, biexcitons, higher excited states, and both positive and negative charged excitons, when these lie close together in energy. Quantum dots such as CdSe and CuCl which can be considered as the model systems have been the most extensively investigated, and in the case of CdSe dots, reasonable theoretical models have been developed to predict energy levels and optical properties as a function of dot size even for the difficult case of strong confinement, when R ≤ αB, the bulk exciton Bohr radius. Although problems still exist in relating predictions to all the experimental data, they have helped to identify exciton features near to and above the first main absorption peak and other optoelectronic features. A good deal of effort has now gone into the study of the III-V systems such as InP, InAs, GaAs, and GaN QDs, as well as on porous Si (PS) and Si and Ge dots. This has been largely driven by the possibility that devices such as lasers, LEDs and devices depending on single electron transport and tunnelling might be developed, an area where there is significant technological potential. For dots such as InAs etc prepared by the SK method, where there is a mismatch in lattice parameters between the InAs and the substrate such as GaAs, the dots tend to have a roughly pyramidal shaped profile, and the dot also sits on a thin InAs wetting layer. Both 2d and 3d ordered arrays of QDs can be formed using this procedure. The photoluminescence (PL) efficiency for such systems can be unexpectedly high, and there have been attempts to explain this effect as being due to the avoidance of the so-called 'phonon bottleneck' by Auger type transitions, but this is still a controversial matter. Other phenomena that are discussed include: (1) exciton- phonon coupling interactions, particularly as applied to QDs such as those formed from CuCl, CuBr, PbS, etc.; (2) coupled QDs for which dot- dot interactions need to be considered; (3) porous Si (PS), a system of considerable interest since the observation of strong PL emission features in the PL spectra by Canham in 1990, even though Si has an indirect gap, and on the practical side there has been much effort in the development of devices such as lasers, LEDs and other electroluminescence (EL) devices, and more recently for biological and medical applications, where PS, because of its porous structure, can be a host lattice for biochemical compounds in a manner similar to some zeolites. However the structure of PS is rather complex, and filaments, embryonic Si dots, as well as well formed dots, oxide interfaces of uncertain composition, and compounds containing hydrogen may all be present, and this makes it difficult to make reasonable assignments to some of the optical features present in the spectra. (4) Type II QDs that concern spatially indirect systems, and this can refer to both space and wave vector k. Instead of the electron e and hole h for an e- h pair (exciton) both residing in dot, for most of the Type II systems the h resides in the dot while the e is in the matrix in which the dots are distributed or at the interfaces. The systems considered depend on the band of sets, and include combinations such as GaAs- AlAs and CdTe- HgTe etc. (5) Hydrogenic-type donors in semiconductor QDs. (6) Excitons, biexcitons, charged excitons (both positive and negative), or trions. (7) Quantum dot- quantum well (QD-QW) combinations, also described as thin film-QD or core- shell composites, for example CdS QDs coated with a thin layer of the smaller band gap semiconductor HgS acting as a QW followed by a further CdS coating or 'clad' or 'shell'. (8) QD- conjugated organic polymer composites, a topic developed by Alivisatos, Greenham and Bawendi and their colleagues in the mid nineties, where the polymer acts as a hole conductor in an EL or LED type of device, where the wavelength of the emitted light due to e- h recombination that occurs preferably near the interface, can be varied by altering the QD radius. The possible formation of hybrid Mott-Wannier and Frenkel excitons is also briefly considered. (9) The variation of the QD dielectric constant with QD size E 2(R), has been considered by several investigators, their calculations suggest that the dielectric constant decreases substantially as R is reduced. This effect has been ignored in many contributions even though E 2 enters into the equations dealing with QSE or quantum size effects, a B, E b, and oscillator strengths (OS), and its omission will influence the calculated estimates for these quantities. (10) Finally, single electron transport and tunnelling in single and coupled QDs, and the Coulomb blockade (CB) are considered, but only in outline since this is a large problem, but it is clearly an important topic particularly in connection with the development of computing and information processing systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This review is concerned with quantum confinement effects in low-dimensional semiconductor systems. The emphasis is on the optical properties, including luminescence, of nanometre-sized microcrystallites, also referred to as zerodimensional systems. There is some discussion on certain of the two-dimensional systems, such as thin films and layer structures. The increase in energy of excitation peaks (blue shift) as the radius R of a microcrystallite is reduced is treated theoretically, and experimental data when they are available are used to assess the reliability of the different models that have been used. These experiments normally make use of microcrystallites dispersed in a large-bandgap matrix such as glass, rocksalt, polymers, zeolites or liquids. Exciton binding energies E b are larger than for bulk semiconductors, and oscillator strengths are higher for the microcrystallites. The regimes of direct interest are as follows. Firstly there is the so-called weak-confinement regime where R is greater than the bulk exciton Bohr radius a B. Experimentally, semiconductors such as CuCl with a B ≈ 7 Å, are suitable for study in this case. Secondly there is the moderate-confinement regime, where R ≈ a B, and a h < R < a h, a h and a e being the hole and electron Bohr radii respectively. Finally there is the strong-confinement regime, with R < a B, and R < a h, a e. For this case we are concerned with a ladder of discrete energy levels, as in molecular systems, rather than energy bands. The electrons and holes are treated as independent particles, and for excited states we refer to electron-hole pairs rather than excitons. Suitable materials for investigation in this regime are the II–VI semiconductors, and also GaAs and Ge, for which a B is relatively large. Although a number of different theoretical models have been used, none can be described as completely first-principles calculations, and there is room for improvement on this aspect. However, useful expressions have been developed by Brus and by Lippens and Lannoo, giving the energy of excited states as a function of R, in terms of the bulk energy gap, kinetic energy, Coulomb energy and correlation energy. Other phenomena discussed are firstly biexciton formation by the use of high intensity laser beams and secondly nonlinear optical effects. Strong nonlinearities and short decay times for excited states have been predicted, and the models developed cover both the resonant and the non-resonant cases. The possibility of using microcrystallites embedded at reasonable concentrations in a glass matrix in the field of optical communications and optical switching is also considered.",

In all setups considered, we discuss both the infinite-frequency limit and the leading finite-frequency corrections to the Floquet Hamiltonian. We provide a short overview of Floquet theory focusing on the gauge structure associated with the choice of stroboscopic frame and the differences between stroboscopic and non-stroboscopic dynamics. In the latter case, one has to work with dressed operators representing observables and a dressed density matrix. We also comment on the application of Floquet Theory to systems described by static Hamiltonians with well-separated energy scales and, in particular, discuss parallels between the inverse-frequency expansion and the Schrieffer–Wolff transformation extending the latter to driven systems.",

The thermodynamic properties of a magnetic impurity in a non-magnetic metal host obtained by the Bethe method are considered in detail. Mainly attention is paid to the analysis of singularities associated with the formation of a localized moment, Kondo effect and mixedvalence phenomenon, which can be treated analytically. In the introductory part of the article we discuss the applicability of the models which we study in the paper to the real alloys and consider some modern experimental data which give the evidence of the many-body effects in dilute magnetic alloys. A brief review of some theoretical results which have been obtained using alternative approaches is given. We think that these results illustrate some features of the exact solution.

In particular §§ 3–16 are on ferrimagnetism, §§ 17–35 on single domain particles and §§ 36–57 on large multi-domain particles. Theoretical studies are made of the following aspects of the subject and compared with the experimental results: remanent magnetization (§ 38), initial susceptibility (§ 39), variation with applied field of thermoremanent magnetization (abbreviated to T.R.M.) (§§ 40, 41, 57), the ratio Qk of T.R.M. acquired in a given field to the induced magnetization in the same field (§ 42), the additivity of partial T.R.M.'s in the case both of small grains (§ 28) and large grains (§ 57). Considerable space is devoted to the magnetic 'viscosity' due to thermal agitation in small grains (§§ 24–27) and in larger ones (§§ 49–56). Expressions are given for magnetic 'viscosity' in the range of Rayleigh's relations (§ 51) particularly with a demagnetizing field present (§ 54). The theoretical and experimental results on the irreversible decrease in isothermal remanent magnetization are briefly quoted both for small (§ 30) and large (§ 55) grains. Different reversing mechanisms are reviewed which could cause a negative T.R.M., that is one directed in the opposite sense to the field applied during cooling. Some are related to negative Weiss-Heisenberg exchange forces: reversal by diffusion involving ionic exchange between the two sub-lattices in a ferrimagnetic (§ 7), reversal by anomalous thermal variation is spontaneous magnetization (§§ 11, 12), reversal by diffusion with complete change of composition (§ 16). The others are effects of the demagnetizing field: reversal in mixtures of two constituents with different Curie Points (§§ 31–34), reversal by segregation, allotropy and chemical alteration (§ 35). The actual examples so far known are recalled.",

The phenomenological theory is justified by the use of microscopic theory, and a new approach, based on the Gor'kov method, is described. The results of this approach, which is of more general validity than the tunnelling Hamiltonian method, are shown to be expressible in terms of Feynman diagrams.

The following three sections, which comprise the bulk of the article, develop the theory of kinetic surface roughening in a comprehensive manner. The two large classes of kinetic roughening processes, characterized by non-conserved (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang) and conserved (ideal molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)) surface relaxation, respectively, are treated separately. For the former case, which has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, the focus is on recent developments.

In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.",

Familiar examples are dendrites, as seen in snowflake growth, and fluid fingers often formed in immiscible displacement. Such processes are characterized by a morphological instability which renders planar or circular shapes unstable, and by the competing stabilizing effect of surface tension. We survey recent theoretical work which elucidates how such systems arrive at their observed patterns. Emphasis is placed upon dendritic solidification, simple local models thereof, and the Saffman-Taylor finger in two-dimensional fluid flow, and relate these systems to their more complicated variants. We review the arguments that a general procedure for the analysis of such problems is to first find finger solutions of the governing equations without surface tension, then to incorporate surface tension in a non-perturbative manner, and lastly to examine possible secondary instabilities and the effects of noise.",

This emergent behavior of Dirac fermions in condensed matter systems defines the unifying framework for a class of materials we call \"Dirac materials.\" In order to establish this class of materials, we illustrate how Dirac fermions emerge in multiple entirely different condensed matter systems and we discuss how Dirac fermions have been identified experimentally using electron spectroscopy techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy). As a consequence of their common low-energy excitations, this diverse set of materials shares a significant number of universal properties in the low-energy (infrared) limit. We review these common properties including nodal points in the excitation spectrum, density of states, specific heat, transport, thermodynamic properties, impurity resonances, and magnetic field responses, as well as discuss many-body interaction effects. We further review how the emergence of Dirac excitations is controlled by specific symmetries of the material, such as time-reversal, gauge, and spin–orbit symmetries, and how by breaking these symmetries a finite Dirac mass is generated. We give examples of how the interaction of Dirac fermions with their distinct real material background leads to rich novel physics with common fingerprints such as the suppression of back scattering and impurity-induced resonant states.PACS:: 73.20.-r Electron states at surfaces and interfaces73.25.+i Surface conductivity and carrier phenomena73.50.-h Electronic transport phenomena in thin films74.20.-z Theories and models of superconducting state73.22.Pr Electronic structure of graphene75.76.+j Spin transport effects71.55.-i Impurity and defect levelsKeywords: Dirac materialsd-wave superconductorsgraphenetopological insulatorschiralityback scatteringimpurity resonance AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to D.

The subject falls naturally into three divisions—electrification of metals by metals; of insulators by metals; and of insulators by insulators. The first of these is well understood; charge transfer between metals is such as to bring the two Fermi levels into coincidence. The second division, electrification of insulators by metals, has been much studied recently and takes up the main part of our review; our understanding remains imperfect, chiefly because of lack of knowledge about the relevant electron states in insulators. Electrification of insulators by insulators has not been studied so extensively, but there is evidence that an understanding of the metal/insulator case will lead to an understanding of the insulator/insulator case as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract (by translator) A detailed report is given here of the general investigations carried out by the authors in the field of relativistic cosmology during the past years. The paper consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to a study of the singularities of the cosmological solutions of the gravitational equations. An attempt is made to provide an answer to one of the principal questions of modern cosmology: ‘does the general solution of the gravitational equations have a singularity?’ The authors give a negative answer to this question. The study carried out leads, in fact, to the general conclusion that the presence of a singularity with respect to time is not a necessary property of cosmological models of the general theory of relativity, and that the general case of an arbitrary distribution of matter and gravitational field does not lead to the appearance of a singularity. This result, however, does not exclude the possibility of the existence of more restricted classes of cosmological solutions of the gravitational equations which possess a true singularity. The search for such solutions, carried out by the authors, gives them reasons to believe that the possible types of such solutions are exhausted by those to which one is naturally led by the arguments given in §§ 3, 4 and Appendices C, G. As far as the solution corresponding to the real universe is concerned, its choice is connected with some deep physical requirements, which cannot be established on the basis of only the existing theory of gravitation. Only after establishing these requirements could it be determined whether or not the solution which satisfies them possesses a singularity. The second part of the paper contains an investigation of the gravitational stability of the isotropic model. There are grounds to believe that this model gives an adequate description of the present-day state of the universe considered on a large scale. The behaviour in time of various kinds of small perturbations to the isotropic model is studied. It is shown that perturbations which do not disturb the uniformity of the distribution of matter are either damped with time or remain constant. Perturbations which involve changes in the density of matter behave differently in expanding and contracting universes. In an expanding universe the changes in the density of matter grow slowly with time for long wavelength perturbations and decrease, with time for short wavelength perturbations. The contracting universe, however, is essentially unstable against such perturbations. The entire study is carried out on the basis of the Einstein equations in their classical form, without the ‘cosmological term’, in which form they follow logically from the general foundations of the theory of relativity.",

    "abstract": "The question of how reversible microscopic equations of motion can lead to irreversible macroscopic behaviour has been one of the central issues in statistical mechanics for more than a century. The basic issues were known to Gibbs. Boltzmann conducted a very public debate with Loschmidt and others without a satisfactory resolution. In recent decades there has been no real change in the situation. In 1993 we discovered a relation, subsequently known as the Fluctuation Theorem (FT), which gives an analytical expression for the probability of observing Second Law violating dynamical fluctuations in thermostatted dissipative non-equilibrium systems. The relation was derived heuristically and applied to the special case of dissipative non-equilibrium systems subject to constant energy 'thermostatting'. These restrictions meant that the full importance of the Theorem was not immediately apparent. Within a few years, derivations of the Theorem were improved but it has only been in the last few of years that the generality of the Theorem has been appreciated. We now know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics can be derived assuming ergodicity at equilibrium, and causality. We take the assumption of causality to be axiomatic. It is causality which ultimately is responsible for breaking time reversal symmetry and which leads to the possibility of irreversible macroscopic behaviour. The Fluctuation Theorem does much more than merely prove that in large systems observed for long periods of time, the Second Law is overwhelmingly likely to be valid. The Fluctuation Theorem quantifies the probability of observing Second Law violations in small systems observed for a short time. Unlike the Boltzmann equation, the FT is completely consistent with Loschmidt's observation that for time reversible dynamics, every dynamical phase space trajectory and its conjugate time reversed 'anti-trajectory', are both solutions of the underlying equations of motion. Indeed the standard proofs of the FT explicitly consider conjugate pairs of phase space trajectories. Quantitative predictions made by the Fluctuation Theorem regarding the probability of Second Law violations have been confirmed experimentally, both using molecular dynamics computer simulation and very recently in laboratory experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The current state of the art in relativistic calculation of atomic structures is surveyed. The theory is modelled on the practice in non-relativistic calculations, using many-particle wave functions built from Dirac central field spinors. The Hamiltonian includes quantum electrodynamic effects in the form of the Breit approximation for the interaction energy of two electrons. Within the limits for which this is valid, it is possible to construct matrices for one- and two-particle operators and hence to perform atomic structure calculations which automatically include the major relativistic effects. The theory can be greatly simplified by using Racah's tensor operators. Major applications have utilized the Hartree or Hartree-Fock methods, and the relevant equations are formulated in detail. Numerical Hartree-Fock solutions for the average of the ground configuration have now been obtained for most elements with atomic number less than 103, and some solutions have also been obtained for ions. The same methods have been used to investigate the likely configurations of superheavy elements with atomic numbers as high as 168. A few calculations have also been done using a relativistic analogue of Roothaan's method. Methods of solution and numerical results are described for both types of calculation. No attempt has been made to describe the perturbation techniques due to Layzer and Bahcall, since an adequate review of recent work in this area has been given by Doyle. A brief description is also given of some problems in which it has been necessary to take relativistic effects into account including, in particular, elastic scattering of low and medium energy electrons from heavy elements, the calculation of x-ray scattering factors, and the probability of electron shake-off following sudden perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We review some of the recent surprising theoretical and experimental results obtained on the transport properties of small disordered metal samples. Even in the presence of disorder, the quantum mechanical interference of electron wavefunctions can still be observed. The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a particularly clear demonstration of this. In doubly connected structures (such as loops of wire) threaded by a magnetic flux, the electrical conductance oscillates because of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. In fact, because the electron trajectories are diffusive (i.e. random walks), even a lone wire (a singly connected structure) will exhibit a random pattern of conductance fluctuations as a function of the magnetic field because of the same interference effects. All that is required for the observation of these interferences is that the electrons retain 'phase memory' duing the period of transit through the sample. The length over which memory is maintained (the phase coherence length) can be much larger than the random walk step length (the mean free path). We focus mainly on effects observed in the limit where the phase coherence length of the electrons is comparable to or larger than the sample size. We explain how the interferences are averaged as the system size grows larger than the phase coherence length. We also remark on surprising aspects of the fluctuations such as those resulting from the non-local character of the wavefunction; some of the results are forbidden classically.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe study of open quantum systems – microscopic systems exhibiting quantum coherence that are coupled to their environment – has become increasingly important in the past years, as the ability to control quantum coherence on a single particle level has been developed in a wide variety of physical systems. In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.PACS: 03.65.Yz Decoherenceopen systemsquantum statistical methods42.50.-p Quantum optics37.10.-x Atommoleculeand ion cooling methods67.85.-d Ultracold gasestrapped gasesKeywords: open quantum systemsquantum trajectoriesquantum opticstime-dependent dynamicstime-dependent density matrix renormalisation groupdecoherence Notes1. In a many-body context, a \"small\" quantum system might be relatively large and complex – it should just be very substantially smaller, e.g. in the scale of total energy, or total number of degrees of freedom, when compared with the environment to which it is coupling2. See, e.g. Ref. [Citation202] for a general discussion of random number generators. For typical calculations, only a few tens of thousands of random numbers must be generated, and good quality pseudorandom number generators suffice. See Ref. [Citation203] for a recent discussion of improvements to that are possible using quantum random number generators.3. We can't completely take the limit physically, as we have made important approximations regarding the fact that we consider dynamics over long timescales compared with . However, we can take the limit of vanishing δ t from the point of view of numerical implementations after the other approximations have been implemented. See Appendix A for a more detailed discussion.4. For a more detailed review of these methods, see, e.g. Ref. [Citation226].5. Although atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, a tightly bound atom at low energy can be assumed to maintain bosonic or fermionic character provided short-distance physics can be eliminated, and the typical separation of atoms is much larger than their size.6. Note that this transfer can also be interpreted as measurement of the position of the atom within the lattice site.",

A preliminary chapter outlines the theory of the annihilation process, establishes the importance of the two photon mode of decay and describes how the observable results depend on the initial positron and electron states of the system. A brief account of the principal experimental techniques is included. An adequate description of the initial particle states can demand consideration of the chemical, electronic and structural properties of the material. A brief discussion of the complex nature of positron behaviour in molecular substances suggests the particular value of investigations directed at the two photon pick-off mode of decay of the orthopositronium atoms that are formed in these materials. The possibility of positronium formation in ionic and metallic materials is also considered. The important many electron aspects of positron annihilation in metals are dealt with at length. The latter and larger part of this article is concerned with applications. The independent particle approach to the analysis of two photon angular distributions is discussed and illustrated. A survey of electronic structure investigations includes studies of polycrystalline and single crystal specimens. The relevance of angular correlation measurements in investigations of the Fermi surfaces of metals and alloys is discussed. A final chapter deals with more recently developed applications to the study of defected and disordered systems. A preliminary account of the interpretation of multicomponent lifetime spectra in terms of varying numbers of distinguishable positron states provides the basis for a discussion of studies of positron trapping by defects, voids, and surfaces in ionic and metallic solids, liquids and powders.",

This can result in profound changes in the electronic properties of the host lattice, and these changes can be understood in terms of charge transfer and increased interlayer separation. The phenomena discussed include optical properties, transport properties, super-conductivity, order-disorder phenomena and phase changes, staging, magnetic properties, metal-insulator transitions, Anderson localization, and fast-ion conduction. Some possible practical applications are also considered.",

We discuss the physical properties of graphene in an external magnetic field, reflecting the chiral nature of the quasiparticles near the Dirac point with a Landau level at zero energy. We address the unique integer quantum Hall effects, the role of electron correlations, and the recent observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in the monolayer graphene. The quantum Hall effect in bilayer graphene is fundamentally different from that of a monolayer, reflecting the unique band structure of this system. The theory of transport in the absence of an external magnetic field is discussed in detail, along with the role of disorder studied in various theoretical models. We highlight the differences and similarities between monolayer and bilayer graphene, and focus on thermodynamic properties such as the compressibility, the plasmon spectra, the weak localization correction, quantum Hall effect, and optical properties. Confinement of electrons in graphene is nontrivial due to Klein tunneling. We review various theoretical and experimental studies of quantum confined structures made from graphene. The band structure of graphene nanoribbons and the role of the sublattice symmetry, edge geometry and the size of the nanoribbon on the electronic and magnetic properties are very active areas of research, and a detailed review of these topics is presented. Also, the effects of substrate interactions, adsorbed atoms, lattice defects and doping on the band structure of finite-sized graphene systems are discussed. We also include a brief description of graphane -- gapped material obtained from graphene by attaching hydrogen atoms to each carbon atom in the lattice.",

The frequency-dependent (AC) response of a general binary model is then studied by means of various approaches, including the effective-medium approximation, a scaling theory of the critical region, numerical computations using the transfer-matrix algorithm, and several exactly solvable deterministic fractal models. Transient regimes, related to singularities in the complex-frequency plane, are also investigated. Theoretical predictions are made more explicit in two specific cases, namely R-C and RL-C networks, and compared with a broad variety of experimental results, concerning, for example, granular composites, thin films, powders, microemulsions, cermets, porous ceramics and the viscoelastic properties of gels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Starting from a master-equation description of dense gases, binary mixtures, etc., we derive theories for nucleation, coagulation and droplet growth by reformulating the dynamics in terms of ‘clusters’. This treatment is shown to agree quantitatively with computer simulations of the nucleation kinetics in the lattice gas model, and also gives a much better account of recent nucleation experiments on CO2 than previous approaches. The possible definitions of clusters, the appropriate coordinates for their description and their relation to bulk equilibrium properties of the system are outlined, and the effects of fluctuations on the properties of the clusters are investigated. Near the critical point the crossover between ‘classical’ and ‘non-classical’ expressions for the droplet formation energy is described in terms of ‘scaling laws’. In contrast to the Cahn-Hilliard-Langer theories of nucleation based on the concept of a coarse-grained free energy, no significant changes of static or dynamic behaviour at a spinodal curve are found, and it is concluded that the latter does not have a physical significance. Our derivations include the use of many cluster coordinates, and they are suitable for a straightforward application to many component mixtures (‘hetero-molecular nucleation’). We find that steady-state nucleation is formally equivalent to the problem of the electric current of a point unit voltage in a conducting medium, the conductivity tensor being given by the product of the equilibrium cluster distribution and the cluster reaction tensor. The nucleation rate is then related to the electric current at great distances from the origin in the space of the cluster coordinates. Non-stationary nucleation kinetics is treated also, general ‘time-lag’-estimates are given, and a special case is solved exactly, which justifies usual steady-state assumptions. Including terms which are non-linear in the cluster concentration we find that in general there is no clear distinction between nucleation and coagulation, and—particularly at high supersaturations—both mechanisms are important at the same time. This fact is also clearly borne out by the computer experiments.",

In some circumstances it is found that the observed parameters can usefully be analysed into superposed contributions from the neighbouring ions in the crystal.

A new kinetic treatment which accounts for the heating of the growing clusters due to the latent heat of condensation is presented, and the irreversible thermodynamics of non-isothermal nucleation discussed. It is found that growing clusters are generally colder than the surrounding vapour during their sub-critical growth period. Time dependent nucleation is discussed and a simple estimate for the time-lag in establishing the steady state is given. The nucleation in cloud chambers expanding with constant speed is discussed in detail, and the number of droplets formed and their final mean size is calculated as a function of the terminal expansion ratio. Re-evaporation of nucleated clusters is discussed. Numerical results are given for a number of typical situations in experiments on water-vapour. These results for the nucleation rate as corrected by Lothe and Pound predict much lower 'critical' expansion ratios than indicated by the limited experimental data available, even when the non-isothermal theory is used. To restore agreement between theory and experiments the surface tension for small droplets (≃100 molecules) could be increased some 15% above that of the bulk liquid, or the pre-exponential in the nucleation rate could be decreased by some 10−15. This latter expedient roughly corresponds to use of the 'classical' instead of the Lothe-Pound nucleation rate. These two alterations would, however, affect the theoretical curves in different manners and careful experiments could possibly distinguish between them.",

    "abstract": "In nature, microorganisms must often cope with hostile environmental conditions. To do so they have developed sophisticated cooperative behaviour and intricate communication capabilities, such as: direct cell-cell physical interactions via extra-membrane polymers, collective production of extracellular 'wetting' fluid for movement on hard surfaces, long range chemical signalling such as quorum sensing and chemotactic (bias of movement according to gradient of chemical agent) signalling, collective activation and deactivation of genes and even exchange of genetic material. Utilizing these capabilities, the colonies develop complex spatio-temporal patterns in response to adverse growth conditions. We present a wealth of beautiful patterns formed during colony development of various microorganisms and for different environmental conditions. Invoking ideas from pattern formation in non-living systems and using 'generic' modelling we are able to reveal novel survival strategies which account for the salient features of the evolved patterns. Using the models, we demonstrate how communication leads to self-organization via cooperative behaviour of the cells. In this regard, pattern formation in microorganisms can be viewed as the result of the exchange of information between the micro-level (the individual cells) and the macro-level (the colony). As such, a full understanding of bacterial behaviour must focus simultaneously on individual cell responses and overall colony organization.",

For free charge carriers, d.c. conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and Hall effect are considered. Effects arising from inhomogeneous conduction and impurity conduction are discussed. Impurity conduction appears to have a strong influence on transport properties in the case of α-Fe2O3, less so in NiO, whereas no influence of this effect has been found in CoO and MnO. It is shown that NiO and CoO do not exhibit the features characteristic of small-polaron conductors but rather can be consistently conceived of as large-polaron band semiconductors. It is suggested that magnetic resistance due to exchange coupling between charge-carrier spin and cation spins plays an important role. The anomalous behaviour of the Hall effect in NiO and α-Fe2O3 is extensively discussed. In contradistinction to NiO, CoO and n-type MnO, free charge carriers in p-type MnO seem to have small-polaron character. For charge carriers bound to centres, dielectric loss, high-frequency conduction and optical absorption are considered. The dielectric loss data relate to Li or Na centres in NiO, CoO and MnO and to Ti, Zr, Sn, Ta, Nb and presumably oxygen vacancy centres in α-Fe2O3. It is concluded from the dependence of dielectric loss on frequency and temperature that bound charge carriers are small polarons. It is shown for the cases of NiO and α-Fe2O3 that apart from small-polaron effects, disorder due to locally varying electric fields determines the nature of dielectric loss. The small-polaron character of bound charge carriers in NiO is corroborated by the behaviour of high-frequency conduction and optical absorption due to centres and also by the magnitude of impurity conduction.",

The mathematical equivalence of the two theoretical approaches based on the formalisms of continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) and generalized multiple-trapping is demonstrated. Several transport mechanisms are discussed, viz. extended state motion with multiple trapping, hopping and trap-controlled hopping. Experimental studies on the chalcogenide glasses a-Se and a-As2Se3 are emphasized but results for organic solids and a-SiO2 are included. There is independent evidence that transport occurs by a hopping process for the organic systems, but not such clear evidence exists for the inorganic solids. Nevertheless, on the basis of the temperature behaviour of the transit time dispersion and the values of parameters obtained from numerical analysis, we argue that hopping is also the microscopic transport mechanism in the inorganic solids. For a-As2Se3 and a-SiO2 the hopping time distribution function assumes the algebraic form ω(t) ∼ t −(1+α) where 0 < α < 1 and α ∼ const. For the organic systems and a-Se, more complicated time and temperature dependences of the distribution function are necessary to fit the data at all temperatures. In this context the observation of a transition from dispersive to non-dispersive transport as a function of increasing temperature in a-Se and poly-(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is of particular interest. The subtle role played by local morphology in generating a transit time dispersion is demonstrated by comparing PVK and its brominated derivative 3Br-PVK. A special section will be devoted to time-dependent electrical phenomena of metal semiconductor surfaces. That discussion will include a description of the experimental procedures necessary to identify the nature of contacts and their influence on the interpretation of steady-state conductivity data.",

This model has provided a paradigm for understanding many phenomena of strongly correlated electronic materials, ranging from the formation of heavyfermion Fermi liquids to the mapping of a one-band model in the cuprate superconductors. The simplest extension of this ordinary Kondo model in metals which yields exotic non-Fermi-liquid physics is the multichannel Kondo impurity model in which the conduction electrons are given an extra quantum label known as the channel or flavour index. In the overcompensated regime of this model, nonFermi-liquid physics is possible, in contrast with the single-channel model. We overview here the multichannel Kondo impurity model candidates most extensively studied for explaining real materials, specifically the two-level system Kondo model relevant for metallic glasses, nanoscale devices and some doped semiconductors, and the quadrupolar and magnetic two-channel Kondo models developed for rare-earth and actinide ions with crystal-field splittings in metals. We provide an extensive justification for the derivation of the theoretical models, noting that, whenever the local impurity degree of freedom is non-magnetic, a two-channel Kondo model must follow by virtue of the magnetic spin degeneracy of the conduction electrons. We carefully delineate all energy and symmetry restrictions on the applicability of these models. We describe the various methods used to study these models along with their results and limitations (multiplicative renormalization group, numerical renormalization group, non-crossing approximation, conformal field theory and Abelian bosonization), all of which provide differing and useful views of the physics. We pay particular attention to the role that scale invariance plays in all these theoretical approaches. We point out in each case how various perturbing fields (magnetic, crystalline electric, electric field gradients and uniaxial stress) may destabilize the non-Fermi-liquid fixed point. We then provide an extensive discussion of the experimental evidence for the relevance of the two-level system Kondo model to metallic glasses and nanoscale devices, and of the quadrupolar and magnetic two-channel models to a number of heavyfermion-based alloys and compounds. We close with a discussion of the extension of the single-impurity models which comprise the main focus of this review to other systems (Coulomb blockade), multiple impurities and lattice models. In the latter case, we provide an overview of the relevance of the two-channel Kondo lattice model to non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and exotic superconductivity in heavy-fermion compounds and to the theoretical possibility of odd-frequency superconductivity, which is realized (for the first time) in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions for this model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, we review developments in the theory of rapidly rotating degenerate atomic gases. The main focus is on the equilibrium properties of a single-component atomic Bose gas, which (at least at rest) forms a Bose–Einstein condensate. Rotation leads to the formation of quantized vortices which order into a vortex array, in close analogy with the behaviour of superfluid helium. Under conditions of rapid rotation, when the vortex density becomes large, atomic Bose gases offer the possibility to explore the physics of quantized vortices in novel parameter regimes. First, there is an interesting regime in which the vortices become sufficiently dense that their cores, as set by the healing length, start to overlap. In this regime, the theoretical description simplifies, allowing a reduction to single-particle states in the lowest Landau level. Second, one can envisage entering a regime of very high vortex density, when the number of vortices becomes comparable to the number of particles in the gas. In this regime, theory predicts the appearance of a series of strongly correlated phases, which can be viewed as bosonic versions of fractional quantum Hall states. In this article, we describe the equilibrium properties of rapidly rotating atomic Bose gases in both the mean-field and the strongly correlated regimes, and related theoretical developments for Bose gases in lattices, for multi-component Bose gases and for atomic Fermi gases. The current experimental situation and outlook for the future are discussed in light of these theoretical developments.

Finally, I am grateful to Sandy Fetter, Gunnar Möller and Kareljan Schoutens for helpful comments on a draft version of this manuscript. Notes Notes 1. The connection between a rotating neutral fluid and a charged fluid in a magnetic field is clarified later. 2. Bose–Einstein condensation has been measured by neutron scattering, yielding a condensate fraction at low temperatures of about 9% (see Citation5). 3. For the strong inequalities in (Equation20) to hold, the factor of two in this expression is clearly unimportant. We leave this factor in this formula merely as a reminder that the lowest-energy single-particle excitation out of the lowest Landau level (LLL) has energy 2ℏω⊥. In practice, one expects the physics derived by theoretical studies in the regime (Equation20) to be at least qualitatively accurate even in experiments in which these inequalities are not well satisfied. 4. The validity of the restriction of single-particle states to the two-dimensional LLL has been explored in Citation37. The numerical results are interpreted to indicate disagreement with the condition (Equation20) for restriction to the LLL, for the case of incompressible states at fixed filling factor ν = N/N v, Equation (Equation66). However, the criterion applied, the shift of the rotation frequency Ω, appears to overlook the dependence of Ω on N v, e.g. (Equation92) for N v ≫ 1. An analysis based on (Equation92) together with the assumption that with a correction due to Landau-level mixing that is small (δμ ≪ μ) leads to the conclusion that the quantity g max defined in Citation37 should vary as g max∼N v²/N. Thus, g max ∝ 1/N at fixed N v and g max ∝ N at fixed ν, in rough agreement with the numerical results Citation37. 5. When the exact groundstate is known (as for the Laughlin state at L = N(N − 1)), discussions reduce to considerations of the properties of this state. 6. This is easily checked by constructing the Euler–Lagrange equations for (Equation70). 7. These are the guiding-centre coordinates of a particle in a single Landau level. 8. The exact relation N v = 2N − 2 should be interpreted as N v = N/ν − 𝒮 where 𝒮 is the 'shift' of the state on the sphere, see Appendix B. 9. As written the states (Equation79) are not eigenstates of total angular momentum. They form an over-complete basis for the zero-energy states with L > N(N − 1). 10. See Note 2.1 regarding the units in Citation100,Citation101. 11. Such geometries have been studied in the groups of E. Cornell and J. Dalibard. 12. Within mean-field theory the results are identical for the quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional LLL regimes. 13. The more general form is ν = 2k/(2kq + 3) with q an even/odd integer for bosons/fermions Citation182. 14. Since the components are different hyperfine states of the same atomic species, the mass M is the same for all components. 15. The more general forms are ν = 3k/(3kq + 4) for SU(4)| k and ν = k/(kq + 1) for SO(5)| k with q an even/odd integer for bosons/fermions Citation197. 16. One exception is the trivial statement that ν = 1 is a fully filled Landau level. 17. Note that, in the BCS limit, this is a much lower rotation rate than that required to put one flux quantum through one Cooper pair, which would be ℏΩ≳Δ. 18. This transition cannot be captured within the theory in the narrow resonance limit Citation220, as the bosonic molecules are non-interacting so the Laughlin state does not appear. 19. The relation νm = νa/4 follows from the fact that there are half as many molecules as atoms, and the vortex density for a molecule is twice that for an atom Citation119. 20. The lowest-energy gap is proportional to V 0 in the two-dimensional LLL, V 0 ≪ ℏω⊥. For V 0 ≫ ℏω⊥, there will be mixing of Landau levels and the lowest-energy gap will not grow beyond the cyclotron gap 2ℏω⊥.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The breakdown of ergodic behaviour is discussed as a general phenomenon in condensed matter physics. Broken symmetry is a particular case of this broken ergodicity. In a system that is non-ergodic on physical timescales the phase point is effectively confined in one subregion or component of phase space. Theoretical treatments of such systems should compute thermal averages over one component at a time. The probability distribution of physical properties can then be obtained from occurrence probabilities for different components, and moments of these distributions may be used for predicting the results of typical measurements. A two-level statistical mechanics is therefore proposed. Various aspects of the breakdown of ergodicity are discussed, including: the definition of components; mechanisms for the confinement of components; methods for computing the properties of one component; the choice of occurrence probabilities for different components; and average thermodynamic properties of broken ergodicity systems. The theory is illustrated by application to well-understood systems. It is also applied to the spin glass, which is reviewed in some detail. The broken ergodicity viewpoint is combined with a suggested characterization of the components in a spin glass, involving a bifurcation cascade. Together these provide a qualitative explanation for the irreversibility signature, the long time decays, the apparent failure of linear response theory and Maxwell relations, and blocking.

    "abstract": "Abstract We take familiar inorganic oxide glasses and non-oxide glasses and the liquids from which they derive to review the current understanding of their atomic structure, ranging from the local environments of individual atoms to the long-range order which can cover many interatomic distances. The structural characteristics of important glasses and melts, like silicates, borates, alumino-silicates, halides and chalcogenides, are drawn from the results of recent spectroscopy and scattering experiments. The techniques include Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS), Neutron Scattering (NS) and Small- and Wide-angle X-ray Scattering measurements (SAXS/WAXS), and are often combined with computer simulation experiments in order to obtain detailed images of structure and diffusion in the glassy as well as in the molten state. We then review the current understanding of relaxation in glasses, liquids and polyamorphic states. This includes phenomenological models and theories of relaxation in different dynamical regimes, spectroscopic studies of atomic-scale mechanisms of viscous flow in inorganic glass-formers and the signatures of relaxational behaviour embedded in the low-frequency vibrational dynamics of glasses including the Boson peak and the Two-Level Systems (TLS) that control conformational transformation. We conclude this review by extending concepts of the dynamics of the glass transition from the supercooled liquid in order to understand the solid-state amorphization of crystals under temperature and pressure and to determine the thermodynamic limits of the crystalline and glassy state.

Most of these are classical systems, but some quantum-mechanical work is also reported. Much of the work has been on lattice models corresponding to phononic systems, and some on hard-particle and hard-disc systems. A recently developed approach, using generalized Langevin equations and phonon Green's functions, is explained and several applications to harmonic systems are given. For interacting systems, various analytic approaches based on the Green–Kubo formula are described, and their predictions are compared with the latest results from simulation. These results indicate that for momentum-conserving systems, transport is anomalous in one and two dimensions, and the thermal conductivity κ diverges with system size L as κ ∼ L α. For one-dimensional interacting systems there is strong numerical evidence for a universal exponent α = 1/3, but there is no exact proof for this so far. A brief discussion of some of the experiments on heat conduction in nanowires and nanotubes is also given.",

Several exact and approximate methods have been developed to compute the persistence of such non-Markov processes over the last two decades, as reviewed in this article. We also discuss various generalisations of the local site persistence probability. Persistence in systems with quenched disorder is discussed briefly.

    "abstract": "We present the full analysis of the normal state properties of the spin-fermion model near the antiferromagnetic instability in two dimensions. The model describes low-energy fermions interacting with their own collective spin fluctuations, which soften at the antiferromagnetic transition. We argue that in 2D, the system has two typical energies—an effective spin-fermion interaction g¯ and an energy ωsf below which the system behaves as a Fermi liquid. The ratio of the two determines the dimensionless coupling constant for spin-fermion interaction λ2 ∝ g¯/ωsf. We show that λ scales with the spin correlation length and diverges at criticality. This divergence implies that the conventional perturbative expansion breaks down. We develop a novel approach to the problem—the expansion in either the inverse number of hot spots in the Brillouin zone, or the inverse number of fermionic flavours—which allows us to explicitly account for all terms which diverge as powers of λ, and treat the remaining, O(log λ) terms in the RG formalism. We apply this technique to study the properties of the spin-fermion model in various frequency and temperature regimes. We present the results for the fermionic spectral function, spin susceptibility, optical conductivity and other observables. We compare our results in detail with the normal state data for the cuprates, and argue that the spin-fermion model is capable of explaining the anomalous normal state properties of the high T c materials. We also show that the conventional {4 theory of the quantum-critical behaviour is inapplicable in 2D due to the singularity of the {4 vertex.",

We begin with a brief survey of the experimental techniques that have been employed for the measurement of the surface diffusion coefficients. This is followed by a section on the basic concepts involved in this field. In particular, we wish to clarify the relation between jump or exchange motion on microscopic length scales, and the diffusion coefficients which can be defined properly only in the long length and time scales. The central role in this is played by the memory effects. We also discuss the concept of diffusion under nonequilibrium conditions. In the third section, a variety of different theoretical approaches that have been employed in studying surface diffusion such as first principles calculations, transition state theory, the Langevin equation, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, and path integral formalism are presented. These first three sections form an introduction to the field of surface diffusion. Section 4 contains subsections that discuss surface diffusion for various systems which have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The focus here is not so much on specific systems but rather on important issues concerning diffusion measurements or calculations. Examples include the influence of steps, diffusion in systems undergoing phase transitions, and the role of correlation and memory effects. Obviously, the choice of topics here reflects the interest and expertise of the authors and is by no means exhaustive. Nevertheless, these topics form a collection of issues that are under active investigation, with many important open questions remaining.",

Francisco de Quevedo The physics of granular materials in ambient gases is governed by interparticle forces, gas–particle interaction, geometry of particle positions and geometry of particle contacts. At low consolidations these are strongly dependent on the external forces, boundary conditions and on the assembling procedure. For dry fine powders of micron and sub-micron particle size interparticle attractive forces are typically much higher than particle weight, and particles tend to aggregate. Because of this, cohesive powders fracture before breaking, flow and avalanche in coherent blocks much larger than the particle size. Similarly the drag force for micron sized particles is large compared to their weight for velocities as low as 1 mm/s. Due to this extreme sensitivity to interstitial gas flow, powders transit directly from plastic dense flows to fluidization without passing through collisional regimes with negligible gas interaction. These two features, strong attractive forces and strong gas interaction make powder behaviour differ qualitatively from the behaviour of large, noncohesive grains. In this paper we investigate the implications of these two features on the bulk powder behaviour. More in particular, the aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between attractive interparticle forces at grain level, with solid bulk properties at low consolidations (solid fraction, stresses), fluidization (aggregation, settling) and flow regime boundaries (plastic flow, inertial flow, fluidization and suspension). Many of the experimental results reported here are for dry and uncharged fine powders made of polymer particles of the order of 10 microns in diameter. However, the basic concepts and methodology are of general applicability. The relationship between attractive interparticle forces and bulk behaviour in dry and uncharged fine powdersAll authorsA.

    "abstract": "Abstract The potential energy surfaces for clusters of some three to sixty atoms under Lennard-Jones forces have been systematically explored using numerical optimization techniques. In searching for minimum-energy configurations three particularly compact non-lattice growth schemes emerge showing tetrahedral, pentagonal (D5 h ) and icosahedral symmetry respectively. All these systems were found to be appreciably more stable than microcrystallites based on the face-centred cubic structure while certain lattice elements were shown to be metastable for small numbers of atoms. Some qualitative conclusions are then drawn concerning the occurrence of saddle-points for delocalized motion and the contribution of these to the generation of configurational entropy in small clusters. A crucial feature of the energy surfaces examined is the breakdown of strict local symmetry in compact clusters of more than two 'shells' of atoms and the possibility of delocalized motion of surface atoms around a solid-like core. These and other qualitative thresholds are pointed out as possible manifestations of entropy which could contribute to the existence of a 'critical nucleus' for discrete clusters with a role similar to that played in liquid-drop theories.",

    "abstract": "Thermoelectric generators, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, hold great promise for tackling the ever-increasing energy sustainability issue. The thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency is heavily dependent upon the materials' performance that is quantified by the dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT). Therefore, the central issue in the research of thermoelectric materials lies in continuously boosting the ZT value. Although thermoelectric effects were discovered in the nineteenth century, it was only until the 1950s when classic materials like Bi2Te3 and PbTe were developed and basic science of thermoelectrics was established. However, the research of thermoelectrics did not take a smooth path but a rather tortuous one with ups and downs. After hiatus in the 1970s and 1980s, relentless efforts starting from the 1990s were devoted to understanding the transport and coupling of electrons and phonons, identifying strategies for improving the thermoelectric performance of existing materials, and discovering new promising compounds. Rewardingly, substantial improvements in materials' performance have been achieved that broke the ZT limit of unity. Meanwhile, advancements in fundamental understanding related to thermoelectrics have also been made. In this Review, recent advances in the research of thermoelectric materials are overviewed. Herein, strategies for improving and decoupling the individual thermoelectric parameters are first reviewed, together with a discussion on open questions and distinctly different opinions. Recent advancements on a number of good thermoelectric materials are highlighted and several newly discovered promising compounds are discussed. Existing challenges in the research of thermoelectric materials are outlined and an outlook for the future thermoelectrics research is presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of topics in other fields but related to thermoelectricity.",

This is in large part because of a lack of understanding of the state of matter out of which the superconductivity arises. In optimally and underdoped materials, this state exhibits a pseudogap at temperatures large compared to the superconducting transition temperature 2 Warren, WW Jr., Walstedt, RE, Brennert, GF, Cava, RJ, Tycko, R, Bell, R and Dabbagh, G. 1989.

    "abstract": "We review the use of kinetically constrained models (KCMs) for the study of dynamics in glassy systems. The characteristic feature of KCMs is that they have trivial, often non-interacting, equilibrium behaviour but interesting slow dynamics due to restrictions on the allowed transitions between configurations. The basic question which KCMs ask is therefore how much glassy physics can be understood without an underlying ``equilibrium glass transition''. After a brief review of glassy phenomenology, we describe the main model classes, which include spin-facilitated (Ising) models, constrained lattice gases, models inspired by cellular structures such as soap froths, models obtained via mappings from interacting systems without constraints, and finally related models such as urn, oscillator, tiling and needle models. We then describe the broad range of techniques that have been applied to KCMs, including exact solutions, adiabatic approximations, projection and mode-coupling techniques, diagrammatic approaches and mappings to quantum systems or effective models. Finally, we give a survey of the known results for the dynamics of KCMs both in and out of equilibrium, including topics such as relaxation time divergences and dynamical transitions, nonlinear relaxation, aging and effective temperatures, cooperativity and dynamical heterogeneities, and finally non-equilibrium stationary states generated by external driving. We conclude with a discussion of open questions and possibilities for future work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This review considers the experimental and theoretical studies of concentrated Kondo systems (CKS), Kondo lattices, substitutional solid solutions and their transition from Kondo impurity to Kondo lattice, and 'intermediate valence compounds' which are, in fact, high T K CKS (T K is the Kondo temperature). The anomalous low temperature properties of CKS are related to the formation of the narrow (∼k B T K) high-amplitude Abrikosov-Suhl resonance E R in the vicinity of the Fermi level E F. This resonance is situated exactly at E F in low T K CKS with T K < ΔCF and near E F in high T K CKS with T K > ΔCF (ΔCF is the crystal field splitting). In low T K 'j=1/2' CKS the condition E R=E F leads to an increase of the density of states at E F, which is large enough to induce heavy fermion superconductivity in CeCu2Si2, UBe13. We demonstrate that the transition from low T K (E R=E F) to high T K CKS (E R≠E F) might be what was formerly considered as a 'Kondo-lattice-intermediate valence state' transition. It appears that in many cases the essentially non-integer valence state of the rare-earth elements in metallic compounds is thermodynamically unstable with respect to a transition to an almost integer valence state, because it realizes the maximum gain in free energy from the Kondo condensation.",

    "abstract": "Over a long period of exploration, the successful observation of quantized version of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in thin film of magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) completed a quantum Hall trio—quantum Hall effect (QHE), quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). On the theoretical front, it was understood that the intrinsic AHE is related to Berry curvature and U(1) gauge field in momentum space. This understanding established connection between the QAHE and the topological properties of electronic structures characterized by the Chern number. With the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken by magnetization, a QAHE system carries dissipationless charge current at edges, similar to the QHE where an external magnetic field is necessary. The QAHE and corresponding Chern insulators are also closely related to other topological electronic states, such as TIs and topological semimetals, which have been extensively studied recently and have been known to exist in various compounds. First-principles electronic structure calculations play important roles not only for the understanding of fundamental physics in this field, but also towards the prediction and realization of realistic compounds. In this article, a theoretical review on the Berry phase mechanism and related topological electronic states in terms of various topological invariants will be given with focus on the QAHE and Chern insulators. We will introduce the Wilson loop method and the band inversion mechanism for the selection and design of topological materials, and discuss the predictive power of first-principles calculations. Finally, remaining issues, challenges and possible applications for future investigations in the field will be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Oxides have become a key ingredient for new concepts of electronic devices. To a large extent, this is due to the profusion of new physics and novel functionalities arising from ultrathin oxide films and at oxide interfaces. We present here a perspective on selected topics within this vast field and focus on two main issues. The first part of this review is dedicated to the use of ultrathin films of insulating oxides as barriers for tunnel junctions. In addition to dielectric non-magnetic epitaxial barriers, which can produce tunneling magnetoresistances in excess of a few hundred percent, we pay special attention to the possibility of exploiting the multifunctional character of some oxides in order to realize ‘active’ tunnel barriers. In these, the conductance across the barrier is not only controlled by the bias voltage and/or the electrodes magnetic state, but also depends on the barrier ferroic state. Some examples include spin-filtering effects using ferro- and ferrimagnetic oxides, and the possibility of realizing hysteretic, multi-state junctions using ferroelectric barriers. The second part of this review is devoted to novel states appearing at oxide interfaces. Often completely different from those of the corresponding bulk materials, they bring about novel functionalities to be exploited in spintronics and electronics architectures. We review the main mechanisms responsible for these new properties (such as magnetic coupling, charge transfer and proximity effects) and summarize some of the most paradigmatic phenomena. These include the formation of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases at the interface between insulators, the emergence of superconductivity (or ferromagnetism) at the interface between non-superconducting (or non-ferromagnetic) materials, the observation of magnetoelectric effects at magnetic/ferroelectric interfaces or the effects of the interplay and competing interactions at all-oxide ferromagnetic/superconducting interfaces. Finally, we link up the two reviewed research fields and emphasize that the tunneling geometry is particularly suited to probe novel interface effects at oxide barrier/electrode interfaces. We close by giving some directions toward tunneling devices exploiting novel oxide interfacial phenomena.",

All quantum numbers of an electronic state can be determined. In particular, energy and momentum of electrons in a solid are probed by measuring energy and momentum of photoelectrons. Thus, energy versus momentum band dispersions can be measured. Since photoelectrons have a small but tunable escape depth, it is possible to see surface and adsorbate states as well as bulk states. A completely different application of angle-resolved photoemission concerns the atomic positions and bond orientations at surfaces. Photoelectrons from a well-defined atom serve as source for an electron diffraction experiment which is localized to a surface. Another type of experiment uses the emission pattern from adsorbed molecules to determine their orientation.",

Landau theory coupled with the ‘soft mode’ concept provides a simple picture of many structural phase transitions in terms of relatively few phenomenological constants. A review is given of the application of this type of theory to the wide variety of different phenomena which can occur at structural phase transitions. In particular, emphasis is placed on the nature of the fluctuations within Landau-Ginzburg theory and on the role of secondary order parameters. The nature of incommensurate phases and of lock-in phase transitions are discussed using both the conventional lattice dynamical approach and the soft soliton theories. The parameters of the Landau theory can, in principle, be obtained from a microscopic model. We critically discuss the attempts that have been made to develop models for anharmonic crystals, order-disorder systems and various electronic instabilities.",

    "abstract": "The calculation of the electronic properties of materials is an important task of solid-state theory, albeit particularly difficult if electronic correlations are strong, e.g., in transition metals, their oxides and in f-electron systems. The standard approach to material calculations, the density functional theory in its local density approximation (LDA), incorporates electronic correlations only very rudimentarily and fails if the correlations are strong. Encouraged by the success of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) in dealing with strongly correlated model Hamiltonians, physicists from the bandstructure and the many-body communities have joined forces and developed a combined LDA + DMFT method recently. Depending on the strength of electronic correlations, this new approach yields a weakly correlated metal as in the LDA, a strongly correlated metal or a Mott insulator. This approach is widely regarded as a breakthrough for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. We review this LDA + DMFT method and also discuss alternative approaches to employ DMFT in electronic structure calculations, e.g., by replacing the LDA part with the so-called GW approximation. Different methods to solve the DMFT equations are introduced with a focus on those that are suitable for realistic calculations with many orbitals. An overview of the successful application of LDA + DMFT to a wide variety of materials, ranging from Pu and Ce, to Fe and Ni, to numerous transition metal oxides, is given.",

    "abstract": "Relaxor ferroelectrics were discovered in the 1950s but many of their properties are not understood. In this review, we shall concentrate on materials such as PMN (PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3), which crystallize in the cubic perovskite structure but with the Mg ion, charge 2+, and the Nb ion, charge 5+, randomly distributed over the B site of the perovskite structure. The peak of the dielectric susceptibility for relaxors is much broader in temperature than that of conventional ferroelectrics, while below the maximum of the susceptibility most relaxors remain cubic and show no electric polarization, unlike that observed for conventional ferroelectrics. Because of the large width of the susceptibility, relaxors are often used as capacitors. Recently, there have been many X-ray and neutron scattering studies of relaxors and the results have enabled a more detailed picture to be obtained. An important conclusion is that relaxors can exist in a random field state, as initially proposed by Westphal, Kleemann and Glinchuk, similar to that which has been studied for diluted antiferromagnets. If a relaxor is cooled from a high temperature, then the Burns temperature is a measure of when slow fluctuations become evident. These fluctuations are connected with the disorder and are known as nano-domains. The Burns temperature is not a well-defined transition temperature. At a lower temperature, there is a well-defined boundary to a so-called random field state when the nano-domains become static but there is no long-range periodic order. This phase may have both history-dependent properties and a skin effect in which the surface of the sample is different from that of the bulk material, as also found in experiments on magnetic systems. Section 1 is an introduction to the review, to ferroelectricity and to relaxors. Section 2 gives a description of the results obtained by dielectric, optical, specific heat and other macroscopic properties. These long-wavelength properties give a variety of different characteristic temperatures and do not directly probe the random field state. In Section 3, we describe the results of neutron and X-ray scattering and show that they strongly support the interpretation that relaxors have a random field state. In Section 4, we briefly describe the results for other relaxor systems such as (PMN)1−x (PT) x for which PMN is mixed with different amounts of the ferroelectric lead titanate (PT), and we show that the existence of a random field state enables us also to describe the experimental results for these mixed materials. We hope that this review will inspire further theoretical and experimental work to understand the nature of the random field states and to compare the experimental results more satisfactorily with theory.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mott insulators are identified here with ordinary magnetic insulators. The insulating gap, local moment, and effective spin hamiltonian aspects are qualitatively explained by means of a novel set of solutions of the Hartree-Fock equations. The apparent conflict between Bloch's theorem and localized-electron phenomenology is thereby resolved in an elementary manner. This Hartree-Fock approach also sheds considerable light on the physical mechanisms responsible for the associated metal-insulator (Mott) and other related phase transitions, as observed in V2O3 and several other materials. With some generalizations and refinements, this theoretical picture is shown to also account semiquantitatively for a number of detailed properties of NiO and CoO, two of the most extensively studied Mott insulator materials. A wide variety of experimental data for NiO is surveyed in order to determine reasonable values for its effective Hubbard hamiltonian parameters, suitably generalized for the 3d electrons. The problems of formally deriving effective spin hamiltonians for macroscopic magnetic insulator systems are also carefully examined. The old non-orthogonality catastrophe is fully resolved by means of a degenerate (open-shell) analogue of the linked cluster perturbation expansion of Brueckner and Goldstone. Although many quantitative issues remain, these results indicate that there is now a reasonably adequate conceptual understanding of the Mott insulating state.",

A more detailed example is the anisotropic response of a polycrystalline sample under elastic and plastic strain; this is illustrated by measurements on many different Bragg reflections from a plastically strained mild steel bar.",

    "abstract": "Multiferroics are those materials with more than one ferroic order, and magnetoelectricity refers to the mutual coupling between magnetism (spins and/or magnetic field) and electricity (electric dipoles and/or electric field). In spite of the long research history in the whole twentieth century, the discipline of multiferroicity has never been so highly active as that in the first decade of the twenty-first century, and it has become one of the hottest disciplines of condensed matter physics and materials science. A series of milestones and steady progress in the past decade have enabled our understanding of multiferroic physics substantially comprehensive and profound, which is further pushing forward the research frontier of this exciting area. The availability of more multiferroic materials and improved magnetoelectric performance are approaching to make the applications within reach. While seminal review articles covering the major progress before 2010 are available, an updated review addressing the new achievements since that time becomes imperative. In this review, following a concise outline of the basic knowledge of multiferroicity and magnetoelectricity, we summarize the important research activities on multiferroics, especially magnetoelectricity and related physics in the last six years. We consider not only single-phase multiferroics but also multiferroic heterostructures. We address the physical mechanisms regarding magnetoelectric coupling so that the backbone of this divergent discipline can be highlighted. A series of issues on lattice symmetry, magnetic ordering, ferroelectricity generation, electromagnon excitations, multiferroic domain structure and domain wall dynamics, and interfacial coupling in multiferroic heterostructures, will be revisited in an updated framework of physics. In addition, several emergent phenomena and related physics, including magnetic skyrmions and generic topological structures associated with magnetoelectricity will be discussed. The review is ended with a set of prospectives and forward-looking conclusions, which may inevitably reflect the authors' biased opinions but are certainly critical.",

Statistical descriptions are applied to the pore-space geometry and to the transport processes involving pore fluids. Fractals are used to quantify the pore geometry at length scales shorter than grain size. Percolation theory is applied to fluid flow. The permeability can be expressed in terms of a single effective pore diameter measured from mercury injection capillary pressure. This permeability relation is valid for essentially all porous rock and for a broad class of porous media. Mercury injection provides a powerful caliper of the geometry of a percolation cluster in a pore-space and supplies new information about pore space correlations and dynamics of fluid displacements. The statistical description of fluid transport in porous media has analogues in disordered electronic and magnetic materials. Future work may make substantial use of such analogues to solve more complex problems of direct relevance to petroleum exploration and production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Triboluminescence (TL)—defined here as the light emitted when a material is stressed to the point of fracture—has been known since the sixteenth century, although serious investigations of the phenomenon were only begun in this century. As a rough guide, some 50% of all crystals exhibit TL. This review, partly historical in approach, seeks to correlate the TL properties of a material, as characterized by the TL spectrum, with other known luminescent properties of the material (for example, its photoluminescent spectrum) and to elucidate the mechanism whereby the TL is excited. In many materials (for example, sugar) the TL originates from dielectric breakdown of the surrounding air. If the material can be excited to photoluminescence by the ultra-violet content of the gas discharge (as, for example, uranyl nitrate can be) the TL spectrum will also contain the material's photoluminescent spectrum. In several cases (for example, sugar and uranyl nitrate) piezoelectrically generated fields are able to account for the gas discharge observed at fracture. Electroluminescent materials, such as the doped zinc sulphides, which are also piezoelectric have a TL spectrum which is the same as the electroluminescent spectrum. Less well understood are the materials whose TL spectrum approximates to the photoluminescent spectrum but where no nitrogen discharge spectrum is evident (as in hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane). Even more puzzling are coumarin (and other large organic molecules) whose TL spectra contain features not seen in their photoluminescent spectra. It is suggested that these features may arise through changes in the Franck-Condon factors brought about by the high stresses existing at the tips of growing cracks. Besides exhibiting TL at fracture, γ or X-ray irradiated alkali halide crystals luminesce when deformed elastically or plastically. Two processes are involved: the release of electrons when moving dislocations interact with F-centres and the recombination of these free electrons with luminescent centres. Unirradiated, or merely additively coloured, alkali halides only emit light at fracture. Although this light emission is largely attributable to a gas discharge, resonance radiation from the alkali metal atoms can be produced under certain conditions (for example, when NaCl crystals are fractured in an argon atmosphere). The review also discusses the light sometimes emitted when materials crystallize from aqueous solutions and when phase transitions occur in solids. In some cases this light has a TL origin. Other topics discussed include the phenomenon of temporary triboluminescence and the relationship between TL and thermoluminescence. The main experimental techniques used in TL studies—notably fracturing techniques and the measurement of TL spectra—are described in some detail.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An extensive calculation of the optical-phonon-assisted transition rates for non-adiabatic electronic hopping motion in a solid is presented. Holstein's Molecular Crystal Model is used as a basis for study and the computation involves no restrictions on either the magnitude of the electron-lattice coupling strength, the temperature, or the difference between the electronic energies of the initial and final sites. In the strong-coupling small-polaron régime, the jump rates, associated d.c. conductivity, a.c. conductivity, and electric-field dependence of the d.c. conductivity, for a crystal are all calculated. These transport properties manifest qualitatively distinct behaviours corresponding to whether the temperature is above or well below the optical-phonon temperature. In the low-temperature régime the energy-conserving processes which involve the absorption of the minimum amount of vibrational energy provide the dominant contribution to the thermally activated jump rates. At sufficiently high temperatures multiphonon processes dominate the transition rate; the high-temperature jump rates are also activated, albeit with a different activation energy than that which characterizes the low-temperature régime. In the complementary weak-coupling régime, the jump rate is characterized by the dominance of those processes which involve the absorption or emission of the minimum number of phonons consistent with the requirements of energy conservation. Once again two distinct temperature domains manifest themselves: a low-temperature, thermally activated, régime and a high-temperature non-activated régime. Finally, it is shown that, while optical-phonon-assisted transition rates are well defined for a three-dimensional model, divergences will occur for a linear chain (at ω = 0) and for a planar model (at the optical phonon frequency). The calculations in this article bring together many of the results previously obtained for special cases into a single framework and reveal a number of new considerations. The article is the first of two, the second dealing with acoustic-phonon-assisted hopping.",

The cornerstone in this respect has been lattice models of the fracture in which a network of elastic beams, bonds or electrical fuses with random failure thresholds are subject to an increasing external load. These models describe on a qualitative level the failure processes of real, brittle or quasi-brittle materials. This has been particularly important in solving the classical engineering problems of material strength: the size dependence of maximum stress and its sample to sample statistical fluctuations. At the same time, lattice models pose many new fundamental questions in statistical physics, such as the relation between fracture and phase transitions. Experimental results point out to the existence of an intriguing crackling noise in the acoustic emission and of self-affine fractals in the crack surface morphology. Recent advances in computer power have enabled considerable progress in the understanding of such models. Among these partly still controversial issues, are the scaling and size effects in material strength and accumulated damage, the statistics of avalanches or bursts of microfailures, and the morphology of the crack surface. Here we present an overview of the results obtained with lattice models for fracture, highlighting the relations with statistical physics theories and more conventional fracture mechanics approaches.",

In this article, we show how progress has been made to extend this formalism to include thermal and quantum fluctuations in order to describe recent experimental developments in nanoscale magnetism. For experimental systems with constrained dimensions such as nanodots, atomic chains, nanowires, and thin films, topological defects such as solitons, vortices, skyrmions, and monopoles start to play an increasingly important role, all forming novel types of quasiparticles in patterned low-dimensional magnetic systems. We discuss in detail how soliton–antisoliton pairs of opposite chirality form non-uniform energy barriers against thermal fluctuations in nanowires or pillars. As a consequence of their low barrier energy compared to uniform reversal, they limit the thermal stability of perpendicular recording media. For sufficiently short samples, the non-uniform energy barrier continuously merges into the conventional uniform Néel–Brown barrier. Partial formation of chiral domain walls also determines the magnetic properties of granular nanostructured magnets and exchange spring systems. For a long time, the reconciliation between micromagnetics and quantum mechanics has remained an unresolved challenge. Here it is demonstrated how inclusion of Berry's phase in a micromagnetic action allows for a semiclassical quantization of spin systems, a method that is demonstrated by the simple example of an easy-plane spin. This powerful method allows for a description of quantum dynamics of solitons and breathers which in the latter case agrees with the anisotropic spin-½ XYZ-model. The domain wall or soliton chirality plays an important role as it is coupled to the wavevector of the quasiparticle dispersion. We show how this quantum soliton chirality is detected by polarized neutron scattering in one-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets.",

These families are dominated by their singularities, i.e. by caustics, where the density of trajectories is infinite. Thom's theorem on singularities of mappings can be rigorously applied and shows that structurally stable caustics—that is those whose topology is unaltered by 'generic' perturbation—can be classified as 'elementary catastrophes'. Accurate asymptotic approximations to wave functions can be built up using the catastrophes as skeletons: to each catastrophe there corresponds a canonical diffraction function. Structurally unstable caustics can be produced by special symmetries, and the detailed form of the caustic that results from symmetry-breaking can often be determined by identifying the structurally unstable caustic as the special section of a higher-dimensional catastrophe. Sometimes it is clear that the unstable caustic is a special section of a catastrophe of infinite co-dimension; these fall outside the scope of Thom's theorem and suggest new directions for mathematical investigation. The discussion is illustrated with numerous examples from optics and quantum mechanics.",

The discussion starts with basic theorems of the theory and derivation of the Kohn-Sham equation for a noncollinear magnet. Special features of solving this equation are illustrated using the augmented-spherical-wave method generalized to the noncollinear magnetic structures as an example. Particular attention is devoted to the symmetry of the problem. It is shown that a traditional approach of the space group theory fails in the case of a noncollinear magnetic state. A generalized approach based on the notion of the spin space groups is presented which allows a consequent treatment of the symmetry properties of both nonrelativistic and relativistic problems. This approach allows the development of an exact procedure for a first-principles calculation of an incommensurate spiral structure and gives a sound basis for the calculation and physical interpretation of the noncollinear magnetic structures caused by the effects of relativity. Application of the theory to the first-principles determination of the complex noncollinear magnetic structures of various systems are discussed. Applications include the spiral structure of fcc Fe, the uncompensated magnetic structure in U3X4 and compensated magnetic structure in U2P2Sn, and two different types of weak ferromagnetism in Fe2O3 and Mn3Sn. It is shown how the calculation technique can be applied to studies of unenhanced and enhanced non-uniform magnetic susceptibilities as well as susceptibilities in fields noncollinear to the atomic moments. Illustrating results of the calculation of the susceptibility of various systems are presented. The last part of the review is devoted to applications of the theory of noncollinear magnetism to studies of temperature effects in the electronic properties of itinerant magnets.",

We first analyze in detail the behavior of friction at interfaces between macroscopic hard rough solids, whose main dynamical features are well described by the Rice–Ruina rate and state-dependent constitutive law. We show that it results from two combined effects: (i) the threshold rheology of nanometer-thick junctions jammed under confinement into a soft glassy structure and (ii) the geometric aging, i.e. slow growth of the real area of contact via asperity creep interrupted by sliding. Closer analysis leads to identifying a second aging-rejuvenation process, at work within the junctions themselves. We compare the effects of structural aging at such multicontact, very highly confined, interfaces with those met under different confinement levels, namely boundary lubricated contacts and extended adhesive interfaces involving soft materials (hydrogels, elastomers). This leads us to propose a classification of frictional junctions in terms of the relative importance of jamming and adsorption-induced metastability.

A survey of the various experimental techniques which can be used for structural studies on thin films is given, but the main evidence presented is based upon electron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The mode of nucleation of the layers is described, and the evidence for the way in which the nuclei develop into a continuous deposit film is outlined. This includes the evidence obtained from growing films inside the electron microscope, which reveals two important processes. These are the 'liquid-like' coalescence of nuclei and islands, and recrystallization of islands. The various imperfection structures observed in thin films are described, and an attempt is made to explain the mechanisms by which these imperfections are formed during the growth of the film.

Recent experimental work is surveyed with emphasis on studies of non-radiative transitions from highly-excited self-trapped excitons, of F-centre formation and of the photochemical processes associated with impurities and with the surfaces of alkali halides. Brief descriptions are given of the photochemical process in silver halides and of recombination-induced defect migration in compound semiconductors. Finally a critical assessment is made of our understanding of the dominant mechanisms for defect formation in alkali halides with particular attention paid to the identification of the precursor state, the excited state of the self-trapped exciton from which an F-H pair is evolved, the potential energy surface and the reaction dynamics. Problems which might be of interest in future are suggested.",

For the insulating compound CeO2, detailed analyses of the 3d core photoemission (3d-XPS) and the 2p core photoabsorption (L3-XAS) are presented by using the impurity Anderson model with a filled valence band. In order to give a consistent interpretation for 3d-XPS and L3-XAS, it is shown to be essential to take account of the Coulomb interactions U fd (between a 4f electron and a photoexcited 5d electron in the L3-XAS) and -U dc (between the 5d electron and a core hole), in addition to -U fc (between the 4f electron and the core hole).

    "abstract": "Abstract Second-order elliptic differential equations (such as the time-independent single particle Schrödinger equation) may be solved in a finite closed disjoint region of space independently of the rest of space. The solution in all space may then be determined by solving the equations in the exterior region together with boundary conditions at the junction of the two regions. These boundary conditions are determined by the previously found interior solution. This means that such regions may be taken as 'black boxes' whose exact details do not matter. The simplest example of this is phase-shift scattering theory from a single scatterer where all the scattering properties are described by the phase shifts, and the exact details of the scattering potential are unimportant. In a macroscopic condensed system, however, there are many core regions and one is really concerned with the multiple scattering which takes place between these different scattering centres. Much of this article is devoted to investigating the formal properties of scattering theory when there are many non-overlapping spherical regions of radius R M, each of which is described by its own scattering matrix, or, equivalently for a spherically symmetric potential, by its phase shifts. Non-spherically symmetric and spin-dependent potentials are permitted, but for simplicity we assume initially that the interstitial region between each disjoint scattering region has zero potential. The generalization of the multiple scattering formalism for non-zero interstitial potential is also given at a later stage. It is shown that in such a system a generalized T-matrix may be defined which describes the radiation from one of the core regions when another one has been excited. It is then a many channel T-matrix in which the channels are the different disjoint scattering regions. It is shown that the formal properties of this T matrix are the same as for a normal T matrix. In § 2 we review the properties of ordinary scattering theory, and then in § 3 we show that analogous properties for the generalized T matrix hold. An exact expression for the density of particle eigenstates is derived in terms of the positions and scattering matrices of the individual scattering centres. This expression reduces to the standard KKR band structure equation for the infinite regular lattice. We also consider how to construct the density of eigenstates and the charge density for such a system. These latter quantities may be approached in two different ways: the usual way is to consider the scattering material to occupy all space, but from a multiple scattering viewpoint one must consider the total volume of condensed material to be small compared with all space, even if both limit to infinity. It is not obvious that the latter method leads to the same results as the former (formally the density of eigenvalues is identical to the free electron density of eigenvalues in the latter method) and it is shown how the differences in the two approaches are resolved. We also discuss the expansion of some of these results for a perfect lattice. While the usual expansions are pseudo-potential expansions, a manifestly 'on-energy shell' expansion is derived which does not contain the arbitrary parameters of the pseudo-potential expansions. Finally, in § 4, we review the most significant contributions of other authors to the theory of multiple scattering.",

Recent theoretical and experimental investigations, however, demonstrate that crystal plasticity is characterized by large intrinsic spatio-temporal fluctuations with scale-invariant characteristics: In time, deformation proceeds through intermittent bursts with power-law size distributions; in space, deformation patterns and deformation-induced surface morphology are characterized by long-range correlations, self-similarity and/or self-affine roughness. We discuss this scale-invariant behaviour in terms of robust scaling associated with a non-equilibrium critical point ('yielding transition').

Accordingly the review is divided into two parts. The first part revolves around a quantum version of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism including also phenomena that go beyond this simple paradigm. What they have in common is that excitation of a gapless many-body system scales with a power of the driving rate. The second part attempts a systematic presentation of recent results and conjectures on apparent relaxation of a pure state of an isolated quantum many-body system after its excitation by a sudden quench. This research is motivated in part by recent experimental developments in the physics of ultracold atoms with potential applications in the adiabatic quantum state preparation and quantum computation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract New experiments of Molenaar and Aarts, Blewitt and others seem to confirm the view of the author, previously based only on the experiments of Gyulai and Hartly and Stepanow on sodium chloride, that vacant lattice sites, and possibly interstitial atoms, are generated during plastic flow in ductile crystals, particularly in metals. It is pointed out that the average temperatures near a moving dislocation are probably not sufficiently high to evaporate vacant lattice sites or interstitial atoms as a result of thermal effects alone. Instead, one apparently must conclude that the imperfections are generated either by purely geometrical means during the looping of dislocations about appropriate obstacles, as the result of dynamical instability in the motion of a dislocation, possibly near a jog, or in the very high thermal pulses or 'spikes' which are generated either in the zone where two dislocations of opposite sign annihilate one another or near impediments where dislocations are strongly curved. It is pointed out that a pair of vacancies is probably stable near room temperature and may diffuse more rapidly than a single vacancy. It is also proposed that vacancies retained during quenching of Al-Cu alloys and those generated by cold-work play an important role in the precipitation process. The origin of work hardening in single crystals is discussed and several alternative interpretations, which involve the impediment of Frank-Read generators either directly or indirectly as a consequence of the generation of vacancies, are presented. The importance of prismatic dislocations formed by condensation of vacancies is restated. The role that vacancies formed by cold-work may play in determining the stored energy and decrease in density and in affecting processes such as creep and the hardening of latent slip planes is also discussed. Finally a few experiments are proposed, typical of those which could prove decisive in isolating the influence of vacancies.",

    "abstract": "Many systems in nature and the synthetic world involve ordered arrangements of units on two-dimensional surfaces. We review here the fundamental role payed by both the topology of the underlying surface and its detailed curvature. Topology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground state but curvature-driven energetics controls the detailed structured of ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of structures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at zero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain boundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical crystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal crystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not depend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the first place. These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental soft and hard matter systems that lead to curved ordered structures such as colloidal particles self-assembling on droplets of one liquid in a second liquid. The defects themselves may be functionalized to create ligands with directional bonding. Thus nano to meso scale superatoms may be designed with specific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel bulk materials. Parameters such as particle number, geometrical aspect ratios and anisotropy of elastic moduli permit the tuning of the precise architecture of the superatoms and associated supermolecules. Thus the field has tremendous potential from both a fundamental and materials science/supramolecular chemistry viewpoint.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Laboratory experiments on thermal convection in a fluid which rotates about a vertical axis and is subject to a horizontal temperature gradient show that when the rotation rate Ω exceeds a certain critical value ΩR (which depends on the acceleration of gravity, the shape and dimensions of the apparatus, the physical properties of the fluid and the distribution and intensity of the applied differential heating) Coriolis forces inhibit overturning motion in meridian planes and promote a completely different type of flow which has been termed 'sloping convection' or 'baroclinic waves'. The motion is then non-axisymmetric and largely confined to meandering 'jet streams', with trajectories of individual fluid elements inclined at only very small (though essentially non-zero) angles to the horizontal. The kinetic energy of the waves derives from the interaction of slight vertical motions with the potential energy field maintained by differential heating, and it is dissipated by friction arising largely in boundary layers on the walls of the apparatus. Provided that Ω, though greater than ΩR, does not exceed a second critical value ΩI, the waves are characterized by great regularity; they are either steady or undergo periodic 'vacillation' in their amplitude, shape and other properties. The azimuthal wavelength decreases with increasing Ω until at Ω=ΩI it reaches a sufficiently low value, ∼1.5 times the radial dimension of the wave, for nonlinear processes to overcome various constraints associated with the anisotropy of the flow, thereby rendering the main baroclinic wave barotropically unstable by transferring kinetic energy to larger as well as smaller scales of motions. Theoretical investigations of sloping convection have their origin in ideas concerning the large-scale mid-latitude circulation of the Earth's atmosphere, modern work on which includes important studies based on numerical models. Conditions favouring sloping convection should be fairly common in natural systems and the process is expected to underlie various phenomena of interest to oceanographers, geophysicists, planetary scientists and astronomers.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems consist of many interacting elements which participate in some dynamical process. The activity of various elements is often different and the fluctuation in the activity of an element grows monotonically with the average activity. This relationship is often of the form 'fluctuations ≈ constant × averageα', where the exponent α is predominantly in the range [1/2, 1]. This power law has been observed in a very wide range of disciplines, ranging from population dynamics through the Internet to the stock market and it is often treated under the names Taylor's law or fluctuation scaling. This review attempts to show how general the above scaling relationship is by surveying the literature, as well as by reporting some new empirical data and model calculations. We also show some basic principles that can underlie the generality of the phenomenon. This is followed by a mean-field framework based on sums of random variables. In this context the emergence of fluctuation scaling is equivalent to some corresponding limit theorems. In certain physical systems fluctuation scaling can be related to finite size scaling.",

Theoretical analysis of ferromagnetic materials which are type II superconductors near the superconducting transition point T cl shows that they become type I near the magnetic transition point T M. The proposed theory constructed for the case T M « T cl predicts the formation of a transverse domain-like (DS phase) magnetic structure below T M. The electronic spectrum appears to be gapless in the DS phase of clean compounds with a re-entrant transition. The change from type II to type I behaviour as the sample is cooled to T M has been observed in ErRh4B4. Experimental data for HoMo6S8, HoMo6Se8 and ErRh4B4 give evidence for the coexistence of super-conductivity and non-uniform magnetic ordering below T M.

Toute la discussion est faite dans l'approximation de Hartree-Fock en utilisant le formalisme d'Anderson. On trouve soit des solutions non magnétiques, soit des solutions magnétiques de spin avec le moment orbital bloqué, soit des solutions magnétiques de spin et d'orbite; dans ce dernier cas, la transition du cas non magnétique au cas magnétique de spin et d'orbite est généralement une transition du premier ordre analogue aux transitions rencontrées dans le diagramme de Clapeyron pour l'équilibre liquide-vapeur. La discussion générale dépend des valeurs respectives des intégrales de Coulomb et d'échange par rapport `a la largeur de l'état lié virtuel. Ce traitement peut ˆetre étendu `a température finie: la température n'a en fait une grande influence que dans le cas o`u la largeur de l'état lié virtuel est de l'ordre de kT pour les températures usuelles, c'est-`a-dire dans le cas des métaux de terres rares. Ce mod`ele s'applique aux trois cas physiques suivants: 1. (1) Il permet de clarifier le concept de niveau lié virtuel p et d : les états liés virtuels p ne sont pas magnétiques 7`a cause de leur grande largeur et les états liés virtuels d peuvent ˆetre magnétiques de spin avec le moment orbital bloqué `a cause de l'importance des intégrales d'échange.2. (2) Il permet de retrouver que le mod`ele ionique est valable pour les métaux de terres rares, `a l'exception du cérium et de l'ytterbium.3. (3) Il permet d'expliquer le comportement anormal du cérium et de l'ytterbium. On peut obtenir théoriquement un diagramme de phase avec un point critique qui rend correctement compte du diagramme de phase anormal du cérium : la transition est du premier ordre en dessous de la température critique et du second ordre au dessus. On peut aussi expliquer les principales propriétés des deux phases cubiques faces centrées α et γ du cérium. Enfin, on donne une interprétation qualitative du diagramme de phase et des expériences de résistivité sous pression de l'ytterbium. Abstract The case of a spin and orbitally degenerate virtual bound state is studied here and the effect of the orbital degeneracy first on the appearance of spin and orbital magnetism and secondly on the order of magnetic transitions is discussed. The whole discussion is done within the Hartree-Fock approximation by use of Anderson's formalism. One finds either non-magnetic solutions, or spin magnetic solutions with a quenched orbital momentum, or spin and orbital magnetic solutions; in the last case, the transition from a non-magnetic case to a spin and orbital magnetic case is generally a first-order transition similar to those found in the Clapeyron diagrams for liquid-vapour equilibrium. The general discussion depends on the values of the Coulomb and exchange integrals relative to the width of the virtual bound state. This treatment can be extended to finite temperatures. The effect of temperature is not important unless the width of the virtual bound state is of the order of kT at normal temperatures, which corresponds to the case of rare-earth metals. This model is applied to three physical cases, as follows: 1. (1)It allows clarification of the concept of p and d virtual bound states. The p virtual bound states are not magnetic because of their great width and the d virtual bound states can be spin magnetic with quenched orbital momentum because of the importance of the exchange integrals.2. (2)It verifies that the ionic model is valid for the rare-earth metals, except for cerium and ytterbium.3. (3)It provides an explanation for the anomalous behaviour of cerium and ytterbium. From the model one can obtain a phase diagram with a critical point which accounts correctly for the anomalous phase diagram of cerium: the transition is first order below the critical temperature and second order above it. One can also explain the main properties of the two face-centred (α and γ) phases of cerium. Finally, a qualitative interpretation of the phase diagram and of the experiments on resistivity under pressure in ytterbium is given.

Such colloidal particles play an important part in fields which range from catalysis to radiation damage in compound solids, and also have an intrinsic interest since in some respects they can be regarded as a state of matter intermediate between that of a molecule and a solid. In ionic crystals colloids can be produced either by irradiation or by the introduction of a stoichiometric excess of the metal constituent. In either case the colloids form as a result of the aggregation of fundamental point defects, but it is only fairly recently that a reasonably coherent picture of these processes has emerged and the properties of the colloids have been related to those of small metallic particles studied for other reasons. This review discusses the progress which has been made through the use of a large number of different techniques to study the properties of colloids in ionic crystals and related media such as glasses. Particular emphasis is placed on the optical, magnetic resonance and kinetic properties of colloids, and on the discussion of results in the wider context of the physics of small particles.",

General theoretical framework is compared with real conduction bands in the materials of interest.

We develop a theory of d.c. transport phenomena and free-carrier optics based on a linear Boltzmann equation solved for an ellipsoidal band of arbitrary nonparabolicity.

The underlying model is based on the assumption that the dominant attractive interaction between the protons in the metal is of an elastic nature. In the first part of the paper we review some general properties of the elastic interaction. We then discuss the importance of boundary conditions for the form of the elastic interaction, which turns out to be of the Curie-Weiss type with macroscopic range. In the second part we investigate the a-a' ('gas-liquid') phase transition in the hydrogen lattice fluid. The long-range part of the elastic interaction is treated in mean field approximation. In the canonical ensemble as opposed to the grand canonical ensemble one finds no co-existing phases near the critical point. Instead there is a continuous transition which changes into a first-order transition at tricritical points. In the temperature-density region which normally corresponds to the two-phase co-existence region the hydrogen density is inhomogeneous and varies on a macroscopic scale. The peculiar nature of the a-a' phase transition is due to the long-range character of the elastic interaction, which ultimately results from the requirement of coherency of the host crystal.

The review is mainly focused on the theoretical achievements although a summary of the most relevant experimental results is also given. A large part of the discussion is devoted to the single level Anderson type models generalized to include superconductivity in the leads, which already contains most of the interesting physical phenomena. Particular attention is paid to the competition between pairing and Kondo correlations, the emergence of \\pi-junction behavior, the interplay of Andreev and resonant tunneling, and the important role of Andreev bound states which characterized the spectral properties of most of these systems. We give technical details on the several different analytical and numerical methods which have been developed for describing these properties. We further discuss the recent theoretical efforts devoted to extend this analysis to more complex situations like multidot, multilevel or multiterminal configurations in which novel phenomena is expected to emerge. These include control of the localized spin states by a Josephson current and also the possibility of creating entangled electron pairs by means of non-local Andreev processes.",

The essential truth of this theory is confirmed by the growth of crystals in polyhedra, which would otherwise be incomprehensible. But on this theory, by itself, the growth rate of such crystals would be virtually zero. This is not usually the case (though the necessary conditions have apparently been realized in Hawards experiments). The discrepancy is removed by considering that a real crystal contains dislocations and may therefore consist of only one layer of atoms perpetually overlapping itself. Such a crystal can grow to an unlimited size without any nucleation of new layers. The rate of growth of such a crystal can be calculated; it is proportional to the square of the supersaturation for low values and to the first power of the supersaturation for higher values in satisfactory quantitative agreement with the experimental results of Volmer and Schultze. The theory indicates that an almost flat crystal surface will show spiral growth steps, ending on dislocations. These are observed in many different cristals, confirming that this mode of growth is very common. Finally, some discussion is given to the way in which dislocations are produced in the growth process.",

For such problems, the central scientific questions are: Under what conditions is the information contained in the measurements sufficient for a satisfactory inference to be possible? What are the most efficient algorithms for this task? A growing body of work has shown that often we can understand and locate these fundamental barriers by thinking of them as phase transitions in the sense of statistical physics.

The connection between inference and statistical physics is currently witnessing an impressive renaissance and we review here the current state-of-the-art, with a pedagogical focus on the Ising model which, formulated as an inference problem, we call the planted spin glass. In terms of applications we review two classes of problems: (i) inference of clusters on graphs and networks, with community detection as a special case and (ii) estimating a signal from its noisy linear measurements, with compressed sensing as a case of sparse estimation.

    "abstract": "We present a review of the recently developed landscape and flux theory for non-equilibrium dynamical systems. We point out that the global natures of the associated dynamics for non-equilibrium system are determined by two key factors: the underlying landscape and, importantly, a curl probability flux. The landscape (U) reflects the probability of states (P) () and provides a global characterization and a stability measure of the system. The curl flux term measures how much detailed balance is broken and is one of the two main driving forces for the non-equilibrium dynamics in addition to the landscape gradient. Equilibrium dynamics resembles electron motion in an electric field, while non-equilibrium dynamics resembles electron motion in both electric and magnetic fields. The landscape and flux theory has many interesting consequences including (1) the fact that irreversible kinetic paths do not necessarily pass through the landscape saddles; (2) non-equilibrium transition state theory at the new saddle on the optimal paths for small but finite fluctuations; (3) a generalized fluctuation–dissipation relationship for non-equilibrium dynamical systems where the response function is not just equal to the fluctuations at the steady state alone as in the equilibrium case but there is an additional contribution from the curl flux in maintaining the steady state; (4) non-equilibrium thermodynamics where the free energy change is not just equal to the entropy production alone, as in the equilibrium case, but also there is an additional house-keeping contribution from the non-zero curl flux in maintaining the steady state; (5) gauge theory and a geometrical connection where the flux is found to be the origin of the gauge field curvature and the topological phase in analogy to the Berry phase in quantum mechanics; (6) coupled landscapes where non-adiabaticity of multiple landscapes in non-equilibrium dynamics can be analyzed using the landscape and flux theory and an eddy current emerges from the non-zero curl flux; (7) stochastic spatial dynamics where landscape and flux theory can be generalized for non-equilibrium field theory. We provide concrete examples of biological systems to demonstrate the new insights from the landscape and flux theory. These include models of (1) the cell cycle where the landscape attracts the system down to an oscillation attractor while the flux drives the coherent motion on the oscillation ring, the different phases of the cell cycle are identified as local basins on the cycle path and biological checkpoints are identified as local barriers or transition states between the local basins on the cell-cycle path; (2) stem cell differentiation where the Waddington landscape for development as well as the differentiation and reprogramming paths can be quantified; (3) cancer biology where cancer can be described as a disease of having multiple cellular states and the cancer state as well as the normal state can be quantified as basins of attractions on the underlying landscape while the transitions between normal and cancer states can be quantified as the transitions between the two attractors; (4) evolution where more general evolution dynamics beyond Wright and Fisher can be quantified using the specific example of allele frequency-dependent selection; (5) ecology where the landscape and flux as well as the global stability of predator–prey, cooperation and competition are quantified; (6) neural networks where general asymmetrical connections are considered for learning and memory, gene self-regulators where non-adiabatic dynamics of gene expression can be described with the landscape and flux in expanded dimensions and analytically treated; (7) chaotic strange attractor where the flux is crucial for the chaotic dynamics; (8) development in space where spatial landscape can be used to describe the process and pattern formation. We also give the philosophical implications of the theory and the outlook for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Point defects may exist in a crystal on a set of crystallographically equivalent orientations or sites. The response of a crystal containing point defects to an externally applied stress takes the form of 'stress-induced ordering', or preferential alignment of the defects. Recent experiments have used optical and spin resonance techniques to observe this stress-induced ordering directly. This same process also gives rise to anelasticity, e.g. to an internal friction peak. In describing such behaviour, the concept of a point defect as an 'elastic dipole', introduced by Kröner and others, is very useful. The elastic dipole is here defined as a second-rank tensor, the 'λ-tensor', equal to the average strain per mole fraction of defects all aligned in a particular orientation. This definition is then used to develop a thermodynamic theory of stress-induced ordering, which includes the interaction among defects and the possibility of a 'reaction' or interconversion between two species of defects. Applications of the theory are made to defects of various point symmetries in cubic crystals, and a number of specific examples are discussed to illustrate each type of defect symmetry. The usefulness of the theory is that it enables one to calculate the values of the components of the λ-tensor from experimental information and the defect symmetry. Typical values of these λ-parameters range from 10-2 unity.",

In this paper we enquire whether such an electronic structure is quantitatively consistent with the observed transport coefficients. The mathematical model is quite simple; the shape of the Fermi surface is made to depend on a single parameter which can be interpreted as the pseudo-potential of the {111} atomic planes acting on an orthogonalized plane wave, giving rise to an energy gap of 5–10 ev at the zone boundaries. Various integrals over the Fermi surface can then be evaluated by elementary methods, and compared with the corresponding experimental quantities. The electronic specific heat and optical mass in the pure metals are consistent with the model. The galvanomagnetic effects are shown to depend a great deal on the anisotropy of the electron relaxation time, whose variation with energy is also probably the electron relaxation time, whose variation with energy is also probably the main determinant of the sign of the thermoelectric power. A better theory of electron-phonon interaction is needed before this, and the electrical and thermal conductivities, can be calculated accurately. Generally speaking there is no evidence which directly contradicts the rigid band model, except perhaps the effect of alloying on the optical absorption edges and on the electronic specific heat, but there are still many experimental and theoretical gaps in our knowledge.",

    "abstract": "In the last two decades non-equilibrium spectroscopies have evolved from avant-garde studies to crucial tools for expanding our understanding of the physics of strongly correlated materials. The possibility of obtaining simultaneously spectroscopic and temporal information has led to insights that are complementary to (and in several cases beyond) those attainable by studying the matter at equilibrium. From this perspective, multiple phase transitions and new orders arising from competing interactions are benchmark examples where the interplay among electrons, lattice and spin dynamics can be disentangled because of the different timescales that characterize the recovery of the initial ground state. For example, the nature of the broken-symmetry phases and of the bosonic excitations that mediate the electronic interactions, eventually leading to superconductivity or other exotic states, can be revealed by observing the sub-picosecond dynamics of impulsively excited states. Furthermore, recent experimental and theoretical developments have made it possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the single-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as those arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation. These developments are opening the way for new, non-equilibrium phenomena that can eventually be induced and manipulated by short laser pulses. Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and theoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and magnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the prototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional superconductivity or other exotic phases. The discussion will also extend to other topical systems, such as iron-based and organic superconductors, and charge-transfer insulators. With this review, the dramatically growing demand for novel experimental tools and theoretical methods, models and concepts, will clearly emerge. In particular, the necessity of extending the actual experimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to microscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple phenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontiers in physics.",

    "abstract": "'Conventional' superconductivity, as used in this review, refers to electron–phonon-coupled superconducting electron pairs described by BCS theory. Unconventional superconductivity refers to superconductors where the Cooper pairs are not bound together by phonon exchange but instead by exchange of some other kind, e.g. spin fluctuations in a superconductor with magnetic order either coexistent or nearby in the phase diagram. Such unconventional superconductivity has been known experimentally since heavy fermion CeCu2Si2, with its strongly correlated 4f electrons, was discovered to superconduct below 0.6 K in 1979. Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in the layered cuprates in 1986, the study of these materials saw Tc jump to 164 K by 1994. Further progress in high-temperature superconductivity would be aided by understanding the cause of such unconventional pairing. This review compares the fundamental properties of 9 unconventional superconducting classes of materials – from 4f-electron heavy fermions to organic superconductors to classes where only three known members exist to the cuprates with over 200 examples – with the hope that common features will emerge to help theory explain (and predict!) these phenomena. In addition, three new emerging classes of superconductors (topological, interfacial – e.g. FeSe on SrTiO3, and H2S under high pressure) are briefly covered, even though their 'conventionality' is not yet fully determined.",

    "abstract": "The structure of our material world is characterized by a large hierarchy of length scales that determines material properties and functions. Increasing spatial resolution in optical imaging and spectroscopy has been a long standing desire, to provide access, in particular, to mesoscopic phenomena associated with phase separation, order, and intrinsic and extrinsic structural inhomogeneities. A general concept for the combination of optical spectroscopy with scanning probe microscopy emerged recently, extending the spatial resolution of optical imaging far beyond the diffraction limit. The optical antenna properties of a scanning probe tip and the local near-field coupling between its apex and a sample provide few-nanometer optical spatial resolution. With imaging mechanisms largely independent of wavelength, this concept is compatible with essentially any form of optical spectroscopy, including nonlinear and ultrafast techniques, over a wide frequency range from the terahertz to the extreme ultraviolet. The past 10 years have seen a rapid development of this nano-optical imaging technique, known as tip-enhanced or scattering-scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). Its applicability has been demonstrated for the nano-scale investigation of a wide range of materials including biomolecular, polymer, plasmonic, semiconductor, and dielectric systems. We provide a general review of the development, fundamental imaging mechanisms, and different implementations of s-SNOM, and discuss its potential for providing nanoscale spectroscopic including femtosecond spatio-temporal information. We discuss possible near-field spectroscopic implementations, with contrast based on the metallic infrared Drude response, nano-scale impedance, infrared and Raman vibrational spectroscopy, phonon Raman nano-crystallography, and nonlinear optics to identify nanoscale phase separation (PS), strain, and ferroic order. With regard to applications, we focus on correlated and low-dimensional materials as examples that benefit, in particular, from the unique applicability of s-SNOM under variable and cryogenic temperatures, nearly arbitrary atmospheric conditions, controlled sample strain, and large electric and magnetic fields and currents. For example, in transition metal oxides, topological insulators, and graphene, unusual electronic, optical, magnetic, or mechanical properties emerge, such as colossal magneto-resistance (CMR), metal–insulator transitions (MITs), high-T C superconductivity, multiferroicity, and plasmon and phonon polaritons, with associated rich phase diagrams that are typically very sensitive to the above conditions. The interaction of charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in correlated electron materials leads to frustration and degenerate ground states, with spatial PS over many orders of length scale. We discuss how the optical near-field response in s-SNOM allows for the systematic real space probing of multiple order parameters simultaneously under a wide range of internal and external stimuli (strain, magnetic field, photo-doping, etc.) by coupling directly to electronic, spin, phonon, optical, and polariton resonances in materials. In conclusion, we provide a perspective on the future extension of s-SNOM for multi-modal imaging with simultaneous nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution.",

The extensive amounts of frequently interacting cellular building blocks and their inherent multifunctionality permits highly adaptive behavior and obstructs a purely reductionist approach.

This review aims at introducing the physics of the cytoskeleton ranging from single biopolymer filaments to multicellular organisms.

    "abstract": "This review addresses resistive switching devices operating according to the bipolar valence change mechanism (VCM), which has become a major trend in electronic materials and devices over the last decade due to its high potential for non-volatile memories and future neuromorphic computing. We will provide detailed insights into the status of understanding of these devices as a fundament for their use in the different fields of application. The review covers the microscopic physics of memristive states and the switching kinetics of VCM devices. It is shown that the switching of all variants of VCM cells relies on the movement of mobile donor ions, which are typically oxygen vacancies or cation interstitials. VCM cells consist of three parts: an electronically active electrode (AE), often a metal with a high work function, in front of which the switching occurs, a mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) layer consisting of a nanometer-scale metal oxide or a stack of different metal oxides, and an ohmic counter electrode (OE). After an introduction to definitions and classification, the fundamentals of solid-state physics and chemistry associated with VCM cells are described, including redox processes and the role of electrodes. The microscopic changes induced by electroforming, a process often required prior to resistive switching, are described in terms of electronic initialization and subsequent changes in chemistry, structure, and conductivity. The switching process is discussed in terms of switching polarity, geometry of the switching region, and spectroscopic detection of the valence changes. Emphasis is placed on the extreme nonlinearity of switching kinetics described by physics-based multiscale modeling, ranging from ab initio methods to kinetic Monte Carlo and finite element models to compact models that can be used in circuit simulators. The review concludes with a treatment of the highly relevant reliability issues and a description of the failure mechanisms, including mutual trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Theory of spin fluctuations for itinerant magnetism and its application to high temperature superconductivity are reviewed. After a brief introduction to the whole subject the developments of the self-consistent renormalization theory of spin fluctuations are summarized with particular emphasis on critical properties at the quantum phase transitions. Most of the anomalous properties in the normal state of high-Tc cuprates are understood as due to the critical behaviours for the two dimensional antiferromagnetic metals. By analysing the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate and the T-linear term of resistivity, the set of parameters to specify the spin fluctuations are determined. It is shown that by using the parameters thus obtained one can describe other quantities as well, e.g. optical conductivity. Then we proceed to the theory of superconductivity by the spin fluctuation mechanism. After some discussion on the weak coupling treatments, the strong coupling theory is reviewed. It is shown that the set of parameters determined by the normal state properties of the high-T c cuprates just give a transition temperature of the right order of magnitude. Among the parameters, the most sensitive one for T c is the frequency spread of the spin fluctuations. This fact enables us to present a possible unified picture of the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation-induced superconductors, including heavy fermion superconductors and organic superconductors. This point of view may be confirmed to a certain extent by microscopic calculations based on the fluctuation exchange approximation for the two-dimensional Hubbard models representing not only the cuprates but also organic and trellis lattice compounds. The review is concluded with some discussions on future problems, e.g. the pseudo spin-gap in the under-doped region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The electronic properties of a large number of icosahedral-crystal systems have been studied experimentally. These systems include alloys of the simple metals and those that contain transition metals. Some of the icosahedral phases (i-phases) are thermally stable while others are metastable; and their degree of structural order varies within each of the stability classes. The importance of sample quality to the exposition of intrinsic properties is emphasized, particularly for systems with high resistivities. As a result, experiments on single-phase samples from the diversity of systems studied have shed light on the physics of quasicrystalline alloys. Comparison made with the approximant and amorphous phases have provided important insights to the understanding of quasicrystallinity, randomness, and atomic-potential effects on electronic properties. Reduction in the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level relative to the free-electronic value is observed in the stable i-phase systems studied to date. Examples are the GaMgZn, AlCuLi, AlCuFe, and AlCuRu systems. Although the simple-metal i-alloys such as AlCu (Mg, Li) and (Al, Ga)MgZn within their metastable phase fields are found to have nearly free-electron DOS, the anomalies in their transport behaviour and compositional dependence of electronic properties have revealed the important role of the Fermi-surface-Jones-zone boundaries (FS-JZB) interaction in these measurements. Also, central to the FS-JZB interaction criterion of phase stability is the existence of a pseudogap in the DOS which is most evident in the stable i-phases. Unusual transport behaviour has been reported for the structurally ordered i-phases that contain transition metals. These materials exhibit semi-metallic transport behaviour characterized by a high resistivity (∼4000–30000 μΩcm), a large resistivity ratio ρ(4·2 K)/ρ(300 K) ranging from 1·5 to 4 as well as a low carrier concentration of 10−2 to 10−3 electron per atom. Adding to the anomalous electron transport are the strong temperature dependences of the Hall coefficient and thermopower leading to a change of sign. Further understanding of the ordered i-phases has been advanced through studies of amorphous phases and crystalline counterparts of i-phases known as rational approximants. Based on these studies, the key findings are reported: (i) even for simple-metal systems in the weak scattering regime, differences in the electronic properties between the structural phases begin to emerge as the FS-JZB interaction increases in strength, (ii) semi-metallic conductivity and other anomalous transport properties are also observed in the approximant-crystals that contain transition metals (e.g. AlMnSi, AlFeCu), (iii) on the other hand, disordered i-phases and amorphous phases containing transition metals are found to possess metallic-glass-like properties. Experimental results reported indicate that the electronic properties of an ordered icosahedral quasicrystal are similar to those of a crystal in the presence of a strong FS-JZB interaction. Quite surprisingly, the elastic scattering time of electrons in the sp-d band ordered phases is found to be much longer than that in the nearly-free-electron i-phases. The propensity towards electron localization is ascribed to the realization of a potentially strong FS-JZB interaction in an ordered structure, particularly that with the icosahedral point group symmetry. The data have also provided evidence for the existence of rapidly varying electronic structures within the pseudogap of a semi-metallic i-crystal and its crystal analogue, despite the short electronic mean free path. The electron transport at low temperature can be described by the weak localization and electron-electron interaction effects. Contact with theories on quasiperiodic systems is also made. Finally, results from the stable decagonal crystals are discussed.",

For obvious reasons most of the paper deals with C60 but the materials reviewed also include C70, simple derivatives of C60, carbon nanotubes, and intercalation compounds of C60 with both acceptors and donors, mainly alkali metals. After a brief overview of high-pressure techniques and the structures and properties of C60 at atmospheric pressure, the structural phase diagram of C60 from atmospheric pressure to above 40GPa (400kbar) is reviewed. The evolution with pressure of the orientational and translational structure of 'normal' molecular C60 in the range up to 1-5GPa (depending on temperature) is discussed in some detail, as is the appearance of a large number of polymeric phases at higher pressures and temperatures, some of them known to have extreme mechanical properties. At very high static (or shock) pressures or temperatures, C60 transforms into ordered or disordered forms of diamond or graphite. The phase diagram is reasonably well investigated up to near 10GPa, but at higher pressures there are still large gaps in our knowledge. Available experimental data for the physical properties of both monomeric and polymeric C60 under high pressures are reviewed as far as possible. The compression behaviour of C60 has been well investigated and is discussed in detail because of its basic importance, but optical, electrical and lattice properties have also been studied for several of the many structural phases of C60. Whenever possible, experimental data are compared with the results of theoretical calculations. The phase diagram and properties of C70 are much less known because of the larger complexity caused by the anisotropy of the molecule, and very little is known about most compounds of C60. However, noble-gas intercalation in C60 has been reasonably well investigated. Finally, the high-pressure properties of superconducting alkali-metalintercalated C60 are briefly reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract I review the principal theories that have been proposed for the superconducting phases of UPt3. The detailed H-T phase diagram places constraints on any theory for the multiple superconducting phases. Much attention has been given to the Ginzberg-Landau region of the phase diagram where the phase boundaries of three phases appear to meet at a tetracritical point. It has been argued that the existence of a tetracritical point for all field orientations eliminates the two-dimensional (2D) orbital representations coupled to a symmetry-breaking field (SBF) as a viable theory of these phases and favours either a theory based on two primary order parameters belonging to different irreducible representations that are accidentally degenerate, as described by Chen and Garg 1993, or a spin-triplet, orbital one-dimensional representation with non spin-orbit coupling in the pairing channel, as described by Machida and Ozaki 1991. I comment on the limitations of the models proposed so far for the superconducting phases of UPt3. I also find that a theory in which the order parameter belongs to an orbital 2D representation coupled to a SBF is a viable model for the phases of UPt3, based on the existing body of experimental data. Specifically, I show that the existing phase diagram (including an apparent tetracritical point for all field orientations), the anisotropy of the upper critical field over the full temperature range, the correlation between superconductivity and basal plane antiferromagnetism and the low-temperature power laws in the transport and thermodynamic properties can be explained qualitatively, and in many respects quantitatively, by an odd-parity E2u order parameter with a pair spin projection of zero along the ˆc axis. The coupling of an antiferromagnetic moment to the superconducting order parameter acts as a SBF which is responsible for the apparent tetracritical point, in addition to the zero-field double transition. The new results presented here for the E2u representation are based on an analysis of the material parameters calculated within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory for the 2D representations, and a refinement of the SBF model given by Hess et al. (1989). I also discuss possible experiments to test the symmetry of the order parameter.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+ is one of the most important messengers. It transmits signals inside living cells and takes part in intercellular coordination. The dynamics of the Ca2+ concentration shows a transition from elemental, stochastic events to global events like waves and oscillations. This transition renders it an ideal tool for studying basic concepts of pattern formation, especially since access to the most important experimental parameters is given. Ca2+ dynamics in living cells has been a major topic of biophysical modelling in the last 15 years. Modelling has reached the level of predictive power. The theoretical analysis of waves provided new insight into the mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling and led to new concepts of analysis of wave equations with concentration dependent diffusion and novel wave bifurcations. Modelling of oscillations provided understanding especially of complex oscillations and allowed to extract information about the underlying cellular parameters and mechanisms. The investigation of the stochastic aspects of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics demonstrated the fundamental role of fluctuations arising from the control of the release channel by Ca2+ and IP3. This review presents an overview of current theoretical research on Ca2+ dynamics in living cells driven by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channel.",

Simplifications of mathematical equations are based on the assumption that anisotropies of surface energy and kinetic effects are small. Selection rules for growth velocity and instability increments are derived at arbitrary Peclet numbers. For a dendrite growing in a channel, a double-valued velocity versus undercooling dependence is obtained. The upper branch of the solution is stable and changes into a free dendrite with increased channel width. Interplay between surface energy and kinetic effects results in morphological transition from surface energy dendrite to dense branching morphology and then to kinetic dendrite. In the framework of the boundary-layer model it is shown that at deep undercooling parabolic dendrite turns into angular dendrite and then into planar front.",

Very recently some odd nylons (nylons with an odd number of carbon atoms in the monomer unit) were recognized to be ferroelectric, and ferroelectric liquid-crystalline polymers have been prepared by attaching ferroelectric liquid-crystal molecules as side chains to polymer backbones.

A very limited discussion is provided on interatomic potential functions, numerical integration schemes, and general simulation procedures for modelling different physical situations and for circumventing excessive computational burdens. The simulation methods are then illustrated using a variety of physical problems studied over the last several years at our laboratory. They include spinodal decomposition of a two-dimensional (2D) fluid, the melting of 2D and quasi-2D films, the structure and energetics of an incommensurate physisorbed film, and the roughening of a silicon solid-melt interface.

A separate section describes lateral diffusion. The properties of photodoped semiconductors (electrical, optical, photoelectric, etc.) are presented. The results in the literature are analysed, giving answers to such fundamental questions as the following. Where is the actinic light which is efficient for the photodissolution absorbed? Which is the diffusion-limiting step? What is the state of the diffusing species (neutral atoms or ions)? The dissolution of silver induced by electron or ion beams and the photodissolution of group II metals are mentioned. The experimental results are followed by a section on models for the photodissolution process with a detailed consideration of the processes at the metal-semiconductor boundary, the transport of the metal through the doped layer and the penetration of the metal species into the undoped semiconductor. Electronic processes at the doped-undoped chalcogenide interface are considered. The review is concluded by a section devoted to practical applications of the photodissolution process.",

An up-to-date compilation of diffusion data as a function of temperature and isotope mass has been made, and a clear distinction in general diffusion behaviour in f.c.c. and b.c.c. metals is noted. Subsequently, the results obtained from the Gorsky effect, nuclear magnetic resonance and quasi-elastic neutron scattering that provide information on elementary jump processes are discussed. A conceptual framework of the quantum diffusion of light interstitials in metals is given, including the recent Kondo theory that emphasizes the crucial importance of particle-conduction electron interactions in the diffusion process, especially at low temperatures. It is shown with the help of recent estimates of the tunneling matrix element that the overall feature of diffusion of hydrogen isotopes in b.c.c. metals as well as μ + in f.c.c. metals can be explained consistently within the frame presented here. Finally, recent advances in the diffusion studies on hydrogen in b.c.c. metals are described. They include a re-analysis of quench-recovery experiments that manifested nearly athermal diffusion of H, D and T in Ta at low temperatures, and an enormous enhancement of the diffusivity under stress (superdiffusion) observed for H and D in V.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The unusual electrical and optical properties of three important types of semiconductor superlattices are reviewed. The artificial structures which were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) consist of a periodic sequence of ultrathin crystalline layers of alternating composition (Al x Ga1-x As/GaAs or Ga x In1-x As/GaAs y Sb1-y ) or of alternating doping (n-GaAs/p-GaAs). The electronic energy bands in these superlattives are split into quasi-two-dimensional subbands whose spacing and width can be tailored by appropriate choice of the design parameters of the structure. After a brief outline of the electronic properties of compositional superlattices, we discuss the unique properties of GaAs doping superlattices in detail. The space charge induced band edge modulation in doping superlattices leads to an indirect energy gap in real space. As a consequence, the electrons and holes are spatially separated and their recombination lifetimes are strongly enhanced, i.e. non-equilibrium free-carrier distributions can be metastable. This implies the unique possibility of tuning the carrier concentration in a given superlattice sample over a wide range. Tuning the carrier concentration, in turn, is associated with a strong variation of the effective energy gap, of the absorption coefficient, and of the two-dimensional subband structure. Experimental results on GaAs doping superlattices demonstrate the tunability of electron and hole conduction by selective electrodes and by photoexcitation, the optical tunability of the absorption coefficient, and the electrical and optical tunability of the luminescence. The two-dimensional subband structure and its tunability was observed by resonant Raman scattering and by Shubnikov-de-Haas measurements.",

It is this simultaneous occurrence of one-ion and one-electron features which makes the investigation of this class of materials fascinating but also frustrating, because at this point there is no unified theoretical approach available that would allow one to describe the electronic properties of these systems coherently.",

A special case in which a detector moves with constant acceleration through a quantum vacuum is examined to clarify the fact that such a detector becomes thermally excited, with a temperature proportional to its acceleration. An elementary physical explanation of this fundamental result is provided. The uniformly accelerated observer finds his space-time manifold bounded by an event horizon and so realizes a 'model' black hole. Real black holes also have thermal properties when quantum effects are taken into account; these are described and the correspondences with the accelerated case are pointed out. In particular, an elementary account is given of the thermal Hawking radiation emitted by the black holes formed by collapsed stars.",

The first four sections give an account of previous work. §5 discusses briefly the scaling theory, and §6 deduces from the Kubo-Greenwood formula that when the Fermi energy of a 'metal' lies at a small energy ΔE above a mobility edge, the conductivity is of the form 0.03 e 2 ħL, where L is the size of the specimen, the inelastic diffusion length, or, in a magnetic field, LH = (cħ/eH)½, or the localization length at an energy ΔE below the transition, whichever is the smaller. Mott's 'σmin' is observed in doped semiconductors in a magnetic field such that LH < a, a being the distance between donors, and in some liquid systems. The solved and unsolved problems of long-range Coulomb interaction are described, both for metallic conduction and for hopping. Applications to amorphous metals, to metal-rare gas deposited films and to liquids are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the work of Thomas and co-workers on doped silicon and the divergence of the dielectric constant. A major theme is that to understand many of the phenomena near an Anderson transition it is essential to take into account explicitly the change in the density of states produced by disorder.",

First we briefly summarize our present understanding of anomalous normal-state properties of cuprates, and present the electronic phase diagram, phenomenological scenarios and models proposed in this connection. The numerical method is then described in more detail. The following sections are devoted to various static and dynamical properties of the t-J model. Among the thermodynamic properties the chemical potential, entropy and the specific heat are evaluated. Discussing electrical properties the emphasis is on the planar optical conductivity and the d.c. resistivity. Magnetic properties involve the static and dynamical spin structure factor, as measured via the susceptibility measurements, the NMR relaxation and the neutron scattering, as well as the orbital current contribution. The analysis of electron spectral functions, studied by photoemission experiments, and their relation to the c-axis conductivity, follows. Finally we discuss density fluctuations, the electronic Raman scattering and the thermoelectric power. Whenever feasible a comparison with experimental data is performed. A general conclusion is that the t-J model captures well the main features of anomalous normal-state properties of cuprates, for a number of quantities the agreement is even a quantitative one. It is shown that several dynamical quantities exhibit at intermediate doping a novel universal behaviour consistent with a marginal Fermi-liquid concept, which seems to emerge from a large degeneracy of states and a frustration induced by doping the antiferro magnet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper is meant to be a report on the experimental work on dilute Pd-based alloys with Co, Fe and Mn. These alloys exhibit the phenomenon of giant moments. The importance of measurements on paramagnetic alloys is emphasized. From these measurements the conclusion can be drawn that Co and Fe dissolved in Pd does not behave like a normal paramagnet, i.e. according to a Brillouin function. This result makes it possible to explain the existing discrepancy in the interpretations of magnetic measurements on one hand and of specific-heat experiments on the other. The main conclusions of this paper are: The giant moment should be accounted for by 'normal' values of the magnetic quantum number (3/2 for Co, 2 for Fe and 5/2 for Mn) and a large value of geff. Paramagnetic alloys of Mn in Pd behave according to Brillouin functions, but alloys of Co or Fe in Pd do not. Hence, a number of interpretations of magnetic measurements should be considered as incorrect. The localized model for ferromagnetism can well account for the magnetic ordering of dilute Pd-based alloys (certainly if c < 1 at.%). A straightforward generalization of the Weiss molecular-field model may be applied. The transition temperature of Pd-Mn alloys is not proportional to the concentration, but after scaling the behaviour is similar to what has been found for Pd-Co and Pd-Fe alloys. The concentration dependence can be explained from a calculation of the strength of the interaction between two impurity atoms as a function of the distance. Comparison between alloys with equal concentrations shows that the magnetic ordering in Pd-Mn is not at all exceptional, but analogous to that in Pd-Co and in Pd-Fe. It should be mentioned, however, that Pd-Mn at c > 3 at.% is a so-called spin glass. Addition of Ag or Rh to Pd alloys with Co, Fe and Mn has important influences on their properties. Unfortunately these effects are not completely understood.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sonoluminescence (SL) is the name given to the light emitted when a liquid is cavitated in a particular (rather violent) manner. The appropriate cavitation conditions can be realized by using high intensity ultrasound, a spark discharge, a laser pulse, or by flowing the liquid through a Venturi tube. SL occurs in a wide variety of liquids, its intensity and spectrum depending on the nature of the solvent and the solute (including dissolved gas). The intensity, but apparently not the spectrum, also depends on the frequency of the sound and on the temperature and hydrostatic pressure of the liquid. In a standing wave sound field the SL originates from bubbles attracted to the pressure antinodes and has its maximum intensity when the bubble volume is a minimum. The phase of the sound cycle at which this occurs depends on the amplitude and frequency of the sound field. Spectral measurements show that SL originates mainly from the recombination of free radicals created within the high temperature and high pressure environment of a bubble undergoing an adiabatic compression, as may happen either during transient cavitation or during highly non-linear, but stable, cavitation. In discussing these, and other, attributes of SL this review emphasizes developments over the past 20 years. Because of the importance of the dynamical theory of bubbles to a full understanding of SL, it includes an account of bubble dynamics. In addition, it describes the various experimental techniques employed in the creation and analysis of SL. Although the review lays particular stress on the SL produced via acoustic cavitation, it also examines the characteristics of the SL produced using other methods of cavitation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract All defects which are dominated by short-range forces belong to the family of 'deep' impurities and exhibit distinctly different properties from the familiar shallow donors and acceptors, where the decisive term is the Coulomb potential. Whereas formation of the shallow states relates to a small part of the Brillouin zone and can be described within the effective mass theory, the opposite is true of the deep states. However, it has recently been shown that the formation of deep localized states in semiconductors can be described with speed and accuracy, and in a self-consistent manner, by exploiting the localized character of the main part of the defect potential. It is possible to project the interaction between the localized potential and the rest of the crystal upon a limited number of localized functions, spanning the range of the potential, with an uncertainty which is small compared to the magnitude of the forbidden gap. This is achieved without truncating proper characterization of the electronic structure of the host or the chemical identity of the imperfection. An important step forward has also recently been made in devising novel spectroscopic tools tailored to the problem of detection of deep levels. With the advent of deep level transient spectroscopy, combined with optical and electron-microscope techniques, the defect signature can be established in an interactive manner, instead of relying on a single-event data. New phenomena were brought to light (e.g. multiphonon capture and recombination) and the gap separating theory and experiment narrowed. It is the purpose of this article to review this development, with a view of focusing upon quantitative guidelines resulting from computer modelling of deep level systems in semiconductors, e.g. GaP:N, GaP:O, vacancies and vacancy-related defects in Si and GaAs, Si:Co, etc. Although a truly quantitative comparison with experiment is not yet possible because of the remaining uncertainties in the form of the potential in a reconstructed lattice and incompleteness of the experimental data, the way is open for a comprehensive examination of the problem of deep levels.",

It is known that in the critical region the 2D Ising Model is equivalent to the model of free fermions. We show that the effect of impurities is to add a four-fermion interaction with the corresponding charge proportional to the concentration of impurities. The resulting fermion model is simple enough and can be studied exactly by renormalization group methods. We show that for any small concentration of impurity bonds a new critical regime is established if we go sufficiently close to the phase-transition point. In particular we find that the specific heat singularity changes from C ˜ ln 1/|τ|(τ=(Τ − Τc/Τc to C ˜ ln ln 1/|τ| for τ≪τi ˜ exp(−const/c i), c i being the concentration of impurities, while the spin-spin correlation function in the critical point changes more seriously: from <σ R σΟ> ˜ 1/R1/4 to <σ R σΟ> ˜ exp { − (const/c i)(ln ln R2 )} for R≫R i˜ exp (const/c i), which corresponds to a change of the critical exponent η from 1/4 to 0.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A variational calculation of the eigenstates of the three-dimensional analogue of Holstein's Molecular Crystal Model is utilized as a basis for determining the conditions under which carrier self-trapping does or does not occur in this system. It is found that below a temperature-dependent critical value of the electron-lattice coupling strength self-trapping does not occur; the eigenstates then correspond to an excess electron being only weakly coupled to the vibratory motion. Above a larger temperature-dependent critical value of the electron-lattice coupling strength only self-trapped (small-polaron) eigenstates exist. Between these two (temperature-dependent) critical values of the electron-lattice coupling strength both types of solutions are found. The condition for the existence of the weakly coupled situation, as well as that for the self-trapped circumstance, is shown to be derivable from arguments which are independent of the detailed variational calculation. These ancillary derivations provide a physical basis for understanding the two existence conditions. In addition, the results of the variational calculation are shown to agree with results obtained by non-variational means in the appropriate limits. The temperature-dependent appearance or disappearance of states from the energy spectrum of the coupled system manifests itself through an abrupt change in the electrical transport properties of the material. The conductivity, Hall mobility, and thermoelectric power on both sides of such a transition are calculated by an ad hoc application of previously obtained results. The essential feature of the occurrence of this transition is that the carriers on the low-conductivity side of the transition are self-trapped; they possess the low thermally activated mobility that is associated with small-polaron hopping motion. On the high-conductivity side of the transition the mobility of the carriers is considerably higher, it being that which is generally associated with electronic motion in rigid-lattice bands. The possible relevance of the present theory to the so-called insulator-to-metal and insulator-to-insulator transitions is discussed.

Colloidal systems appear to be particularly suited for tackling the general problem of dynamic arrest, since they show a larger flexibility compared to atomic and molecular glasses because of their size and the possibility of manipulating the physical and chemical properties of the samples. Indeed, a wealth of new effects, not easily observable in molecular liquids, have been predicted and measured in colloidal systems. The slow dynamic behavior of three classes of colloidal suspension is reviewed – hard colloids, short-range attractive colloids and soft colloidal systems – selecting the model systems among the most prominent candidates for grasping the essential features of dynamic arrest. Emphasis is on the possibility of performing a detailed comparison between experimental data and theoretical predictions based on the mode coupling theory of the glass transition. Finally, the importance of understanding the system's kinetic arrest phase diagram, i.e. the regions in phase space where disordered arrested states can be expected, is stressed. When and how these states are kinetically stabilized with respect to the ordered lowest free energy phases is then examined in order to provide a framework for interpreting and developing new ideas in the study of new materials.

    "abstract": "Abstract The new class of phenomena described in this review is based on the interaction between spatially separated, but closely located ferromagnets and superconductors, the so-called ferromagnet–superconductor hybrids (FSH). Typical FSH are: coupled uniform and textured ferromagnetic and superconducting films, magnetic dots over a superconducting film, magnetic nanowires in a superconducting matrix, etc. The interaction is provided by the magnetic field generated by magnetic textures and supercurrents. The magnetic flux from magnetic structures or topological defects can pin vortices or create them, changing the transport properties and transition temperature of the superconductor. On the other hand, the magnetic field from supercurrents (vortices) strongly interacts with the magnetic subsystem, leading to formation of coupled magnetic–superconducting topological defects. Each time the Nambu and spin matrices are written together we mean the direct product. The proximity of ferromagnetic layer dramatically changes the properties of the superconducting film. The exchange field in ferromagnets not only suppresses the Cooper-pair wavefunction, but also leads to its oscillations, which in turn leads to oscillations of observable values: the transition temperature and Josephson current. In particular, in the ground state of the Josephson junction the relative phase of two superconductors separated by a layer of ferromagnetic metal is equal to π instead of the usual zero (the so-called π-junction). Such a junction carries a spontaneous supercurrent and possesses other unusual properties. Theory predicts that rotation of magnetization transforms s-pairing into p-pairing. The latter is not suppressed by the exchange field and serves as a carrier of long-range interaction between superconductors.

Giant micelles are typically flexible, and can become highly entangled even at modest concentrations. The resulting viscoelastic solutions show fascinating flow behaviour (rheology) which we address theoretically in this article at two levels. First, we summarize advances in understanding linear viscoelastic spectra and steady-state nonlinear flows, based on microscopic constitutive models that combine the physics of polymer entanglement with the reversible kinetics of self-assembly. Such models were first introduced two decades ago, and since then have been shown to explain robustly several distinctive features of the rheology in the strongly entangled regime, including extreme shear thinning. We then turn to more complex rheological phenomena, particularly involving spatial heterogeneity, spontaneous oscillation, instability and chaos. Recent understanding of these complex flows is based largely on grossly simplified models which capture in outline just a few pertinent microscopic features, such as coupling between stresses and other order parameters such as concentration. The role of 'structural memory' (the dependence of structural parameters such as the micellar length distribution on the flow history) in explaining these highly nonlinear phenomena is addressed. Structural memory also plays an intriguing role in the little-understood shear thickening regime, which occurs in a concentration regime close to but below the onset of strong entanglement, and which is marked by a shear-induced transformation from an inviscid to a gelatinous state.

    "abstract": "This review is concerned with quantum confinement effects in low-dimensional semiconductor systems. The emphasis is on the optical properties, including luminescence, of nanometre-sized microcrystallites, also referred to as zerodimensional systems. There is some discussion on certain of the two-dimensional systems, such as thin films and layer structures. The increase in energy of excitation peaks (blue shift) as the radius R of a microcrystallite is reduced is treated theoretically, and experimental data when they are available are used to assess the reliability of the different models that have been used. These experiments normally make use of microcrystallites dispersed in a large-bandgap matrix such as glass, rocksalt, polymers, zeolites or liquids. Exciton binding energies E b are larger than for bulk semiconductors, and oscillator strengths are higher for the microcrystallites. The regimes of direct interest are as follows. Firstly there is the so-called weak-confinement regime where R is greater than the bulk exciton Bohr radius a B . Experimentally, semiconductors such as CuCl with a B , 7 Å, are suitable for study in this case. Secondly there is the moderate-confinement regime, where R , a B , and a h < R < a e , a h and a e being the hole and electron Bohr radii, respectively. Finally there is the strong-confinement regime, with R < a B , and R < a h , a e . For this case we are concerned with a ladder of discrete energy levels, as in molecular systems, rather than energy bands. The electrons and holes are treated as independent particles, and for excited states we refer to electron-hole pairs rather than excitons. Suitable materials for investigation in this regime are the II-VI semiconductors, and also GaAs and Ge, for which a B is relatively large. Although a number of different theoretical models have been used, none can be described as completely first-principles calculations, and there is room for improvement on this aspect. However, useful expressions have been developed by Brus and by Lippens and Lannoo, giving the energy of excited states as a function of R , in terms of the bulk energy gap, kinetic energy, Coulomb energy and correlation energy. Other phenomena discussed are firstly biexciton formation by the use of high intensity laser beams and secondly nonlinear optical effects. Strong nonlinearities and short decay times for excited states have been predicted, and the models developed cover both the resonant and the non-resonant cases. The possibility of using microcrystallites embedded at reasonable concentrations in a glass matrix in the field of optical communications and optical switching is also considered.",

While some theories attempt to model this freezing into a phase with randomly oriented quadrupole moments in terms of a bond-disorder concept analogous to the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses, other theories attribute the freezing to random field-like terms in the Hamiltonian. While models of the latter type have been studied primarily by microscopic molecular field-type treatments, the former models have been treated both in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick-Parisi infinite-range limit, and in the short-range case. Among the surprising findings of these treatments we emphasize the first-order glass transition (though lacking a latent heat) of the infinite-range Potts glass, the suggestion that the short-range Potts glass in d = 3 is at its lower critical dimension, and the fact that Potts glasses at zero temperature have a non-zero entropy even for continuous distribution of the interactions. Combining the theoretical results with pertinent experimental findings, it is shown that no definite conclusions on what is the best model for orientational glasses can as yet be drawn, and probably the different classes of models should rather be considered as simple limiting cases of a very complex behaviour.",

These closely-related techniques are based on the fact that outgoing Auger and photoelectrons from single-crystal specimens undergo elastic scattering and interference from near-neighbour atoms in the vicinity of the emitter. Such coherent diffraction leads to large intensity modulations as the detected emission direction is varied with respect to the crystal axes of the specimen. The measured modulations are readily interpreted by means of model quantum mechanical scattering calculation in which atomic coordinates in the epitaxial film are systematically varied. Such analyses provide several kinds of useful information, including growth modes accompanying heteroepitaxy, structural details of alloy and compound formation, and quantitative determination of tetragonal distortion at lattice-mismatched heterointerfaces. After a discussion of experimental design and theoretical modelling, we present several case studies of heteroepitaxial growth involving dissimilar materials. In addition, we review the new subfield of Auger and photoelectron holography, and discuss the current state-of-art in both data acquisition and Fourier inversion of experimental data for directly obtaining structural parameters.",

With relatively few exceptions it can be used to advantage for any material whether it be in the solid, liquid or gaseous state. In the past few years the importance of applying multiple-scattering corrections has come to be recognized, particularly in the case of liquids and gases for which one is interested in mapping the complete scattering function. The present article presents a review and extension of the theoretical basis for such corrections from the point of view of the Vineyard theory of multiple scattering. The theory is formulated for a sample of arbitrary size and shape and a general expression is obtained for the effective scattering function as an expansion in terms of orders of scattering (single, double, etc.). The general properties of this expansion are investigated with particular emphasis on the question of convergence and on ways of improving the rate of convergence by, e.g., the use of absorbing spacers. Exact results are obtained for the multiple scattering in an infinite plane slab. An approximate, semianalytic theory of multiple scattering is developed as an alternative to the Monte Carlo approach. The theory is applied to plane slab, spherical and cylindrical geometries. Finally, a detailed discussion is given of the multiple-scattering correction for recent experiments on liquid neon.",

Coarse-grained equations of motion have been recently presented in the literature. These contain terms that take into account the pertinent features of imbibition: non-locality and the quenched noise that arises from the random environment, fluctuations of the fluid flow and capillary forces. The theoretical progress has highlighted the presence of intrinsic length-scales that invalidate scale invariance often assumed to be present in kinetic roughening processes such as that of a two-phase boundary in liquid penetration. Another important fact is that the macroscopic fluid flow, the kinetic roughening properties, and the effective noise in the problem are all coupled. Many possible deviations from simple scaling behaviour exist, and we outline the experimental evidence. Finally, prospects for further work, both theoretical and experimental, are discussed.",

Certain chemical modifications employing sulphur and gold compounds are used to maximize the response, and organic dyes are adsorbed to provide sensitivity throughout the visible spectrum. Absorption of a few photons results in the reductive formation of one or more clusters of silver or gold atoms on the surface. These clusters act as catalysts to promote further reduction of the host crystallites during photographic development. The success of the system depends upon the particular physical properties of the silver halides, such as their bonding and electron structure, the dielectric properties, the point defect structure, and the electronic transport characteristics. These are all reviewed, and the ways in which they interact to lead to the favourable photodecomposition are followed in some detail. A nucleation-and-growth mechanism operates to provide several of the favourable features of the process, and the chemical treatments used optimize the competition between these desirable steps and the unwanted recombination of electronic carriers.",

This method, based upon the Born-von Kármán model of a lattice, uses the zero frequency limit of the phonon Green function which gives the static response of the lattice to an applied force. The method is quite general and is applicable to most kind of defects but the attention in this review is restricted to point defects in cubic Bravais lattices. The Green-function method is shown to be formally equivalent to the Kanzaki method but is more powerful and computationally more convenient. For the purpose of illustration the Green-function method has been applied to a vacancy in the Rosenstock-Newell model of a solid. Although the model is physically unrealistic, it has the advantage of yielding results in closed analytic forms which are very useful for qualitative discussions. The applications of the Green-function method to some real systems—vacancies and interstitials in f.c.c. and b.c.c. lattices—have also been described. Finally the Green-function method is generalized to account for a regular array of point defects and its application to super lattices of voids and gas interstitials in certain metals is discussed.",

The following sections are concerned with the effect of n and p-type impurities on the electronic transport properties of a-Si and a-Ge. The discussion is based on results from conductivity, drift mobility, Hall effect and thermoelectric power measurements and leads to the main conclusion that the donors introduce a new hopping path through the system which begins to dominate over tail-state hopping when their density exceeds about 1018 cm-3. Recent photo-conductivity and luminescence results on doped a-Si are then discussed; they give information on recombination and also demonstrate the pronounced effect of doping on these properties.

Differences in the radial distribution function (RDF) of films of different T s have been determined by an accurate differential scattering technique. The small angle scattering (SAS) of the films is less than 100 electron units for k < 1 Å−1. From a combination of SAS, RDF and scanning electron microscope studies, it is concluded that an observed increase in film density with increasing T s occurs through a reduction in the number of voids about 7 Å or less in diameter. No variation of bond length with T s is found. With increasing T s, there is an increase in first and second-neighbour coordination and a reduction in bond angle distortion. The rate of change of coordination, C, with density, ρ0, is found to be d ln C/d ln ρ0 = 0·6±0·2. Using a new, general theory of the dependence of the RDF on the dihedral angle distribution, P(θ), it is shown that with increasing T s there is an increased probability of dihedral angles corresponding to the staggered configuration. For all films, the experimental RDF between r = 4·5 and 6·2 Å agrees with a nearly random P(θ) distribution. Comparison of experimental RDF's of crystalline and amorphous Ge indicates the static distortion of the first-neighbour bond length has a standard deviation of only about 0·04 Å.",

The technique has undergone a remarkable development since the mid-1980s, when intense fluxes of epithermal neutrons were made available from pulsed neutron sources. These types of measurements provide a probe of the short-time dynamics of the recoiling atoms or molecules as well as information on the local structure of the materials. The paper introduces both the theoretical framework for the interpretation of deep inelastic neutron scattering experiments and thoroughly illustrates the physical principles underlying the impulse approximation from light atoms and molecules. The most relevant experimental studies performed on a variety of condensed matter systems in the last 20 years are reviewed. The experimental technique is critically presented in the context of a full list of published work. It is shown how, in some cases, these measurements can be used to extract directly the effective Born–Oppenheimer potential. A summary of the progress made to date in instrument development is also provided. Current data analysis and the interpretation of the results for a variety of physical systems is chosen to illustrate the scope and power of the method.

Thus, the rare earth ions may be impurities dissolved in a metallic matrix or they may form a regular lattice. In the former case we distinguish between the cases of a normal conducting and a superconducting matrix. The influence of the crystalline field splitting on the properties of the conduction electrons is calculated. In the case of a normal matrix anomalous behaviour of the thermoelectric power is found due to the impurity levels. If the matrix is superconducting large deviations result from the theory of Abrikosov and Gorkov which describes the influence of non-split magnetic impurities on superconductivity. A comparison of the theory with available experiments is presented. For the case that the rare earth ions form a regular lattice we discuss various aspects of the collective excitations in the paramagnetic state. Special attention is paid to the soft mode problem of exchange induced ferromagnets. Furthermore we discuss the influence of impurities on the excitation spectrum (localized modes, resonant modes etc.) and on the magnetic ordering temperature.",

When the spatial direction of the polarisation changes, in a domain structure, the electrons must somehow accommodate the necessary change in direction of their spin angular momentum as they pass through the wall. Reflection, scattering, or a transfer of angular momentum onto the lattice are all possible outcomes, depending on the circumstances. This gives rise to a variety of different physical effects, most importantly a contribution to the electrical resistance caused by the wall, and a motion of the wall driven by the spin-polarised current.

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract A broad review of the physics of point defects, i.e. electrically active and neutral impurities and impurity complexes is given. Basic material science which is crucial for understanding the physics is summarized in an introductory section. It is followed by the detailed description of the novel measurement techniques—photothermal ionization spectroscopy, high-Q electron paramagnetic resonance and deep level spectroscopy. These spectroscopic techniques have had a profound impact on the investigations of ultra-pure germanium. The major part of this work deals with the physics of point defects in ultra-pure germanium. The high purity of this semiconductor allows the undisturbed observation of highly excited bound states of shallow donors and acceptors. Many new previously unknown acceptor and donor centres have been discovered in ultra-pure germanium. The nature of several of these centres can be understood in terms of a complex consisting of two impurities—a light interstitial atom (for example, hydrogen or lithium) tunnelling between four identical real space positions in the vicinity of a substitutional impurity (for example, carbon, silicon, oxygen or copper), or a defect (for example, divacancy). The motion of the tunnelling impurity is shown to influence the electronic structure of the complex leading to a symmetry of higher order than tetrahedral. Experimental results are presented which are fully consistent with the tunnelling model. Besides the review of recently published results, new findings on the solubility of substitional copper in ultra-pure crystals grown under a variety of conditions and on the two donors lithium D(Li) and lithium-oxygen D(Li, O) are presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We have used scanning tunnelling microscopes (STMs) operating at liquid helium and liquid nitrogen temperatures to image the charge-density waves (CDWs) in transition metal chalcogenides. The layer structure dichalcogenides TaSe2, TaS2, NbSe2, VSe2, TiSe2 and TiS2 have been studied including representative polytype phases such as 1T, 2H and 4Hb. Experimental results are presented for the complete range of CDW amplitudes and structures observed in these materials. In most cases both the CDW and the surface atomic structure have been simultaneously imaged. Results on the trichalcogenide NbSe3 are also included. The formation of the CDW along with the associated periodic lattice distortion gaps the Fermi surface (FS) and modifies the local density-of-states (LDOS) detected by the tunnelling process. The tunnelling microscopes have been operated mostly in the constant current mode which maps the LDOS at the position of the tunnelling tip. The relative amplitudes and profiles of the CDW superlattice and the atomic lattice have been measured and confirm on an atomic scale the CDW structures predicted by X-ray, electron and neutron diffraction. The absolute STM deflections are larger than expected for the CDW induced modifications of the LDOS above the surface and possible enhancement mechanisms are reviewed. In the 2H trigonal prismatic coordination phases the CDWs involve a relatively small charge transfer and the atomic structure dominates the STM images. In the 1T octahedral coordination phases the charge transfer is large and the CDW structure dominates the STM image with an anomalously large enhancement of the STM profile. Systematic comparison of the STM profiles with band structure and FS information is included. In the case of the 4Hb mixed coordination phases at the lowest temperatures two nearly independent CDWs form in alternate sandwiches. STM studies on 4Hb crystals with both octahedral and trigonal prismatic surface sandwiches have been carried out. The STM scans detect the relative strengths of the two CDWs as well as the interactions between the two types of CDW structure. The STM scans are also able to detect defects and domain structure in the CDW image. Several examples will be given demonstrating the potential of the STM to detect these local variations in LDOS on an atomic scale. In contrast to the layer structure crystals the linear chain compound NbSe3 shows a complex surface atomic structure as well as the formation of two CDWs. The surface atomic structure is resolved in the STM scans and profiles have detected the presence of the CDW modulation at 77K and 4.2K. These results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting CDW structure in the presence of complex atomic structure and using materials where dynamical CDW effects can also be studied by STM. The range of STM results presented here show that the STM scans are extremely sensitive to the detail of the CDW structure and its effect on the LDOS. Although much of this structure has been deduced from diffraction studies, the ability to examine the CDW structure on an atomic scale with the STM is new. The sensitivity of the STM method suggests potential applications to a wide range of electronic structures in materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present review summarizes experimental and theoretical work dealing with self-organized solitary localized structures (LSs) that are observed in spatially extended nonlinear dissipative systems otherwise exhibiting translational and rotational symmetry. Thereby we focus on those LSs that essentially behave like particles and that we call dissipative solitons (DSs). Such objects are also solutions of corresponding nonlinear evolution equations and it turns out that they are rather robust with respect to interaction with each other, with impurities, and with the boundary; alternatively they are generated or annihilated as a whole. By reviewing the experimental results it turns out that the richest variety of DS phenomena has been observed in electrical transport systems and optical devices. Nevertheless, DSs show up also in many other systems, among which nerve pulses in living beings are of uppermost importance in practice. In most of these systems DSs behave very similarly. The experimental results strongly suggest that phenomenon of DSs is universal. On the background of the experimental findings models for a theoretical understanding are discussed. It turns out that in a limited number of cases a straightforward quantitative description of DS patterns can be carried out. However, for the overwhelming number of systems only a qualitative approach has been successful so far. In the present review particular emphasis is laid on reaction-diffusion systems for which a kind of 'normal form' can be written down that defines a relatively large universality class comprising e.g. important electrical transport, chemical, and biological systems. For the other large class of DS carrying systems, namely optical devices, the variety of model equations is much larger and one is far away, even from a universal qualitative description. Because of this, and due to the existence of several extensive reviews on optical systems, their theoretical treatment has been mentioned only shortly. Finally, it is demonstrated that in terms of a singular perturbation approach the interaction of DSs and important aspects of their bifurcation behaviour, under certain conditions, can be described by rather simple equations. This is also true when deriving from the underlying field equations a set of ordinary differential equations containing the position coordinates of the individual DSs. Such equations represent a theoretical foundation of the experimentally observed particle-like behaviour of DSs. Though at present there is little real practical application of DSs and related patterns in an outlook we point out in which respects this might change in future. A systematic summary of a large amount of experimental and theoretical results on reaction-diffusion systems, being rather close to the subject of the present review, can also be found on the website http://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.AP/Purwins/Research-Summary.

    "abstract": "This review is devoted to the description of recent experimental results concerning the nonlinear optical properties of semiconductor-doped glasses SDGs with particular emphasis on the regime in which the energy of the incident photon is smaller than the energy gap. A considerable theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted in the last 10years to the fundamental aspects of quantumconfined structures, which have properties somewhat intermediate between the bulk crystals and atoms or molecules. From this point of view, SDGs represent an easily available test system, and optical techniques have been a major diagnostic tool. Luminescence and absorption spectroscopy were extensively used to characterize the electronic states. The experiments aimed at the measurement of the real and imaginary parts of the third-order optical susceptibility of SDGs below the bandgap are described in some detail, and the results obtained with different techniques are compared. Besides the intrinsic fast nonlinearity due to bound electrons, SDGs may present a larger but much slower nonlinearity due to the free carriers generated by two-photon absorption. This implies that experiments have to be properly designed for separation of the two effects. In this article we stress the importance of a detailed structural characterization of the samples. Knowledge of the volume fraction occupied by the nanocrystals is necessary in order to derive from the experimental data the intrinsic nonlinearity and to compare it with the bulk nonlinearity. We discuss recent experiments in which the dependence of the intrinsic nonlinearity on the crystal size is derived by performing, on the samples, measurements of the real part and imaginary part of the nonlinear optical susceptibility and measurements of crystal size and volume fraction. Structural characterization is of interest also for a better understanding of the physical processes underlying the growth of crystallites in SDGs. The average size of nanocrystals can be tailored by controlling the temperature or time of the treatment. The major problem is the size dispersion of the crystallites, which is intrinsic to the diffusion process. At present, this is the major source of the undesired inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transition lines of the SDGs. Efforts are at present being made to fabricate materials, SDGs included, which embed nanocrystals with a reduced spread of sizes. The interest in the nonlinear optical properties is due not only to fundamental reasons but also to possible applications for optical devices. Generally speaking, resonant nonlinearities are much larger than non-resonant nonlinearities, but they are not necessarily the most interesting for applications because materials at resonance absorb the incident radiation and also present long response times. The studies below the bandgap seem to indicate that the values of the intrinsic nonlinearities of nanocrystals in the structures which are at present available are similar to those of the bulk. New and better controlled structures are now under development and have to be tested from the viewpoint of optical nonlinearities. In several situations SDGs cannot be modelled as an ensemble of freely standing nanocrystals, with the glass matrix playing the role of an inert support. Phenomena such as trapping and darkening, which are very probably connected with electronic states at the glasssemiconductor interface, may play a role in determining the optical response. They might give rise to an extrinsic optical nonlinearity which can be even larger than the intrinsic nonlinearity. The physical processes which are involved in these extrinsic nonlinearities are poorly understood and at present being investigated.",

    "abstract": "Phase-field modelling is still a young discipline in condensed-matter physics, which established itself for the class of systems that can be characterised by domains of different phases separated by a distinct interface. Driven out of equilibrium, their dynamics result in the evolution of those interfaces which might develop into well defined-structures with characteristic length scales at the nano-, micro- or meso-scale. Since the material properties of such systems are to a large extent determined by those small-scale structures, acquiring a precise understanding of the mechanisms that drive the interfacial dynamics is a great challenge for scientists in this field. Phase-field modelling is an approach that allows this challenge to be tackled in a simulation-based manner. This review provides a critical overview of the conceptual background of the phase-field method, the most relevant fields of condensed-matter physics that have been approached using phase-field modelling, as well as the respective model formulations and the insight gained so far via their simulation and analysis. Moreover, we discuss directions of further development and the quality of the scientific contributions to be expected from those.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A general framework for the description of the physical properties of condensed matter by irreducible tensors is presented. Irreducible tensors have been widely used in atomic and molecular physics but, surprisingly, less so in solid-state physics. In elasticity studies the strain and stress tensors are commonly decomposed into scalar (spherical) and deviatoric parts and more recently irreducible tensors have been introduced into discussion of non-linear optics and optical activity, but the approach is powerful and applicable to the analysis of the physical properties of condensed matter in general. The article aims to demonstrate this and to identify the kinds of argument about the properties of solids that can be best formulated in this way. The decomposition of a cartesian tensor into irreducible parts is considered for polar and axial tensors of rank n and the decompositions are given explicitly up to n = 4. Transformations of irreducible cartesian tensors into their spherical forms, and vice versa, are examined and the norm or magnitude is defined for reducible and irreducible tensors and applications are presented. Tensor index permutations are discussed with respect to their bearing on the decomposition of a tensor into irreducible points.",

This theory provides a microscopic description of the low energy states of the strongly correlated electrons in the FQHE regime in terms of weakly interacting composite fermions, where a composite fermion is an electron bound to an even number of vortices. In the simplest cases, the FQHE can be construed as a manifestation of the integer quantum Hall effect of the composite fermions. Based on these ideas, simple Jastrow-Slater trial wavefunctions are written for the incompressible FQHE states as well as their low energy excitations. Extensive numerical work has been performed to confirm their validity. In particular, these have essentially 100% overlap with the true Coulomb states for few particle systems. Various consequences of the theory are in excellent agreement with experiments. Notably, it provides a unified framework for the fractional and integer quantum Hall effects, consistent with the experimental fact that there is no qualitative distinction between the observation of various plateaus. Also, the prominent fractions are clearly identified and compare well with the experimentally observed fractions.",

Theoretical ideas on the band structure of bismuth and the dispersion relation for electrons near the bottom of the conduction band are briefly outlined. The experiments considered are those which give the most precise information on the Fermi surface (quantum effects in conductivity, cyclotron resonance, size effects, magnetoplasma waves, etc.) and on the electron energy spectrum near the bottom of the conduction band (studies in the quantum limit, infra-red magneto-reflection). The validity of the Cohen model as a first approximation to the electron spectrum in bismuth is established, and deviations from this model are described. Experiments are proposed which may give additional information on electrons in bismuth.",

It allows for a very precise calculation of static, dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Its field of applicability has now extended beyond condensed matter, and is successfully used in quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, quantum information theory, and nuclear and high-energy physics as well. In this article, we briefly review the main aspects of the method and present some of the most relevant applications so as to give an overview of the scope and possibilities of DMRG. We focus on the most important extensions of the method such as the calculation of dynamical properties, the application to classical systems, finite-temperature simulations, phonons and disorder, field theory, time-dependent properties and the ab initio calculation of electronic states in molecules. The recent quantum information interpretation, the development of highly accurate time-dependent algorithms and the possibility of using the DMRG as the impurity-solver of the dynamical mean field method (DMFT) give new insights into its present and potential uses. We review the numerous very recent applications of these techniques where the DMRG has shown to be one of the most reliable and versatile methods in modern computational physics.",

The properties considered are electric-dipole active two-magnon absorption in the infra-red, and magnon sidebands on sharp-line exciton transitions in the visible. The discussion is based on a thorough treatment of the properties of excitons and magnons in the antiferromagnetically ordered state. The site-group and space-group symmetries of the magnetic excitations are derived and the selection rules for electric and magnetic dipole transitions are determined. The occurrence of magnetic Davydov splittings of the excitons is investigated, and their symmetry properties throughout the Brillouin zone are derived. The functional dependences of exciton energy on wave vector are calculated. Applications of the theory are made to experimental results on excitons and magnons in MnF2, FeF2 and CoF2. The possible mechanisms for two-magnon and magnon-sideband absorption are discussed, and the influence of crystal symmetry on these mechanisms is described. The two-magnon state responsible for electric-dipole absorption is identified and selection rules for electric-dipole activity are presented. A spin Hamiltonian for the two-magnon process is set up and used to derive expressions for absorption coefficients for electric vector parallel and perpendicular to the crystal c-axis. Comparison with experiment for MnF2 yields numerical values for the parameters of the basic coupling mechanism. The exciton-magnon states which give rise to magnon-sideband absorption are explicitly constructed and electric-dipole selection rules are derived for all possible types of sideband. Spin Hamiltonians for the various magnonsideband absorption processes are presented and used to derive expressions for sideband shapes. The results are applied to the experimental spectra for MnF2 and FeF2 and the sideband shapes in MnF2 are calculated numerically. The sideband shapes observable in emission spectra are also briefly discussed.",

Since the early 1990s, engineers and scientists working in all length scales, from the atomistic, the structural, all the way up to the scale of the earth's deformation processes, have undertaken joint efforts to study this unexplored area of fracture mechanics. The analysis in the present article emphasizes the cooperative and complementary manner in which experimental observations and analytical and numerical developments have proceeded. The article first reviews early contributions to the theoretical literature of dynamic subsonic and intersonic fracture and highlights the significant differences between tensile and shear cracks. The article then uses direct laboratory observations as a framework for discussing the physics of intersonic shear rupture occurring in constitutively homogeneous (isotropic and anisotropic) as well as in inhomogeneous systems, all containing preferable crack paths or faults. Experiments, models, and field evidence at a variety of length scales (from the atomistic, the continuum, and up to the scale of geological ruptures) are used to discuss processes such as (1) shock wave formation, (2) large-scale frictional contact and sliding at the rupture faces, and (3) maximum attainable rupture speeds and rupture speed stability. Particular emphasis is given to geophysical field evidence and to the exploration of the possibility of intersonic fault rupture during shallow crustal earthquake events.",

Since the donor centres are distributed at random in space, the combined effects of correlation and Anderson localization have to be considered. As an introduction, in § 1 we give an outline of our present understanding of the transition in some crystalline materials, particularly V2O3. For this the metallic phase, a highly correlated electron gas, is discussed, as is also the question of a discontinuous change in the number of current carriers. In § 2 we discuss Si : P and similar materials. For uncompensated samples, the material near the transition is to be described by overlapping Hubbard bands, and the metal-insulator transition occurs when the states at the Fermi energy show Anderson localization. Just on the insulator side of the transition conduction is by variable-range hopping for uncompensated as for compensated materials, and a variation of log (resistivity) as T −1/4 is observed. The existence or otherwise of moments in the metallic phase is discussed, as is also the magnetoresistance, Hall effect and Knight shift. In § 3 the transition is described for narrow-band semiconductors, particularly La1−x Sr x VO3. In § 4 some compounds of rare earths are treated, including Sm1−x Nd x Se.",

The most direct information regarding vortex structures and dynamics is obtained through local measurement of the magnetic field within or at the surface of a superconducting sample. A detailed review of such local magnetic probes is presented here including Lorentz microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, Bitter decoration, scanning Hall probe microscopy, magneto-optical imaging, and scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy. In each case the principles underpinning the technique are described together with the factors that limit the magnetic field and the spatial and temporal resolution.

    "abstract": "Abstract A theory is developed which describes the linear, reversible, time-dependent response of a crystal containing point defects to stress or electric fields, respectively known as anelastic and dielectric relaxation. Such relaxation occurs because of the redistribution of the defects among sites which are initially equivalent, but which becomes inequivalent in the presence of the external field. The macroscopic behaviour of such a crystal is found to be describable in terms of the symmetry which can be assigned to the defect. This defect symmetry determines whether or not the crystal will undergo dielectric or anelastic relaxation and, if relaxation can occur, which specific coefficients of elastic compliance or electric susceptibility show the relaxation effect. The latter information, called the 'selection rules' tells, in effect, which combination of stress or electric field components is capable of redistributing the defects. Tables are given for these selection rules for all possible defect symmetries in each of the 32 crystal classes. It is also shown that a hitherto unobserved phenomenon of piezoelectric relaxation may occur; the selection rules for this effect are also given. Aside from its symmetry, the defect can be described as an electric dipole in terms of a suitable dipole moment vector μ, and as an 'elastic dipole' in terms of a tensor λ. It is shown that the defect symmetry determines the number of independent components of μ and λ. Finally, a thermodynamic theory is developed which permits calculation of the relaxation strengths for those compliance, susceptibility, and piezoelectric coefficients which undergo relaxation, in terms of the independent components of μ and λ. Applications of the theory to specific cases are then reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we review the radiative recombination processes occurring in semiconductor quantum wells and superlattices under different excitation conditions. We consider processes whose radiative efficiency depends on the photogenerated density of elementary excitations and on the frequency of the exciting field, including luminescence induced by multiphoton absorption, exciton and biexciton radiative decay, luminescence arising from inelastic excitonic scattering, and electron-hole plasma recombination. Semiconductor quantum wells are ideal systems for the investigation of radiative recombination processes at different carrier densities owing to the peculiar wavefunction confinement which enhances the optical non-linearities and the bistable behaviour of the crystal. Radiative recombination processes induced by multi-photon absorption processes can be studied by exciting the crystal in the transparency region under an intense photon flux. The application of this non-linear spectroscopy gives direct access to the excited excitonic states in the quantum wells owing to the symmetry properties and the selection rules for artificially layered semiconductor heterostructures. Different radiative recombination processes can be selectively tuned at exciting photon energies resonant with real states or in the continuum of the conduction band depending on the actual density of photogenerated carriers. We define three density regimes in which different quasi-particles are responsible for the dominant radiative recombination mechanisms of the crystal: (i) The dilute boson gas regime, in which exciton density is lower than 1010 cm-2. Under this condition the decay of free and bound excitons is the main radiative recombination channel in the crystal. (ii) The intermediate density range (n < 1011 cm-2) at which excitonic molecules (biexcitons) and inelastic excitonic scattering processes contribute with additional decay mechanisms to the characteristic luminescence spectra. (iii) The high density range (n ≇1012 cm-2) where screening of the Coulomb interaction leads to exciton ionization. The optical transitions hence originate from the radiative decay of free-carriers in a dense electron-hole plasma. The fundamental theoretical and experimental aspects of the radiative recombination processes are discussed with special attention to the GaAs/Al x Ga1-x As and Ga x In1-x As/Al y In1-y As materials systems. The experimental investigations of these effects are performed in the limit of intense exciting fields by tuning the density of photogenerated quasi-particles and the frequency of the exciting photons. Under these conditions the optical response of the quantum well strongly deviates from the well-known linear excitonic behaviour. The optical properties of the crystal are then no longer controlled by the transverse dielectric constant or by the first-order dielectric susceptibility. They are strongly affected by many-body interactions between the different species of photogenerated quasi-particles, resulting in dramatic changes of the emission properties of the semiconductor. The systematic investigation of these radiative recombination processes allows us to selectively monitor the many-body induced changes in the linear and non-linear optical transitions involving quantized states of the quantum wells. The importance of these effects, belonging to the physics of highly excited semiconductors, lies in the possibility of achieving population inversion of states associated with different radiative recombination channels and strong optical non-linearities causing laser action and bistable behaviour of two-dimensional heterostructures, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Technological progress in material synthesis, as well as artificial realization of condensed matter scenarios via ultra-cold atomic gases in optical lattices or epitaxial growth of thin films, is opening the gate to investigate a plethora of unprecedented strongly correlated electron systems. In a large subclass thereof, a metallic state of layered electrons undergoes an ordering transition below some temperature into unconventional states of matter driven by electronic correlations, such as magnetism, superconductivity, or other Fermi surface instabilities. While this type of phenomena has been a well-established direction of research in condensed matter for decades, the variety of today's accessible scenarios pose fundamental new challenges to describe them. A core complication is the multi-orbital nature of the low-energy electronic structure of these systems, such as the multi-d orbital nature of electrons in iron pnictides and transition-metal oxides in general, but also electronic states of matter on lattices with multiple sites per unit cell such as the honeycomb or kagome lattice. In this review, we propagate the functional renormalization group (FRG) as a suited approach to investigate multi-orbital Fermi surface instabilities. The primary goal of the review is to describe the FRG in explicit detail and render it accessible to everyone both at a technical and intuitive level. Summarizing recent progress in the field of multi-orbital Fermi surface instabilities, we illustrate how the unbiased fashion by which the FRG treats all kinds of ordering tendencies guarantees an adequate description of electronic phase diagrams and often allows to obtain parameter trends of sufficient accuracy to make qualitative predictions for experiments. This review includes detailed and illustrative illustrations of magnetism and, in particular, superconductivity for the iron pnictides from the viewpoint of FRG. Furthermore, it discusses candidate scenarios for topological bulk singlet superconductivity and exotic particle-hole condensates on hexagonal lattices such as sodium-doped cobaltates, graphene doped to van Hove Filling, and the kagome Hubbard model. In total, the FRG promises to be one of the most versatile and revealing numerical approaches to address unconventional Fermi surface instabilities in future fields of condensed matter research.",

We compare results obtained from these methods with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM).

As shown by Zhang and Rice Citation25 this situation corresponds to a half-filled band in an effective single-band model. The superconducting phase is often divided into an optimal doped (doping level with highest T c), an overdoped (doping level higher than optimal doped) and an underdoped (doping level lower than optimal doped) regime. The weak coupling BCS ratio for s-wave superconductors, 2Δ / (k B T c)≈3.5. When speaking about (the magnitude of) the superconducting gap Δ in a d-wave state without specifying the momentum k, we mean the size of the gap at Henceforth we refer to the one-band Hubbard model by the phrase 'Hubbard model' For more details we refer the interested reader to the review articles by Moriya and Ueda Citation58, Yanase et al. Citation59 and Chubukov et al. Citation60. Long before the discovery of HTSCs Anderson and Fazekas Citation13, Citation14 proposed the RVB liquid as a possible ground state for the Heisenberg model on a 2D triangular lattice. The single hole problem together with the corresponding literature is discussed in Citation19 in more detail. A possible ansatz for finite temperatures was recently proposed by Anderson Citation113. He suggests a spin-charge locking mechanism within the Gutzwiller–RVB theory to describe the pseudogap phase in the underdoped cuprates as a vortex liquid state. For a real space representation of equation (Equation11) we refer to section 5.1.1. To avoid confusion, in this section we denote density operators with a 'hat' and write, e.g., Strictly speaking, we violate this rule by neglecting decouplings which include on-site pairing, . However, we work in the fully projected limit, i.e. |Ψ⟩ does not allow for on-site pairing. It is thus reasonable to prohibit on-site pairing in as well and to set The BCS states are defined by and , where and (s-wave, ; d-wave, ) We note that the inclusion of t\" = − t' / 2 into the bare dispersion is sometimes used to get a better fit with band-structure calculations and ARPES data. Nevertheless VMC calculations Citation171 for a non-magnetic impurity report some minor discrepancies to the corresponding RMFT study Citation110. The Pfaffian is the analogue of a determinant which is defined only for antisymmetric matrices. For an antisymmetric matrix A, the square of the Pfaffian is equivalent to its determinant, namely, P f (A)² = |A|. Owing to the fixed particle number, the chemical potential μ becomes an additional free parameter. However, this parameter was fixed in Citation17 by setting the chemical potential μ to those of the unprojected wave function. For a more detailed reasoning leading to this step, we refer the reader to Citation206. Marshall Citation241 showed that the ground state of the spin- Heisenberg Hamiltonian on any bipartite lattice will be a singlet. Furthermore, the ground state wave function picks up a sign whenever two antiparallel spins from different sublattices are interchanged. This is the Marshall sign rule.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We extend previous computations of mechanical stability of atomic microclusters to the realm of statistical thermodynamics, obtaining thermodynamic functions for small, solid-like Van der Waals clusters of less than some 100 atoms possessing non-crystalline structures of ‘polytetrahedral’ type. These are shown to be almost invariably at a thermodynamic advantage over alternative lattice structures of the same number of atoms, at least for the Lennard-Jones potential in the harmonic-oscillator/rigid-rotor approximation. The dependence of thermodynamic functions upon cluster size appears to be essentially monotonic in the number of internal degrees of freedom; although there are certain exceptional structures, particularly with icosahedral symmetry, there proves to be little evidence for the occurrence of ‘magic numbers’ for stability at any temperature and within the size-range considered. Particular attention is given to the heat capacity of model systems in relation to their vibrational spectra. The Debye T 3 law appears reasonably well obeyed at low temperatures with no evidence for the existence of either ‘soft modes’ or distinct surface contributions. The results for the free energy of formation of minimal clusters ΔG f are then applied to the computation of nucleation rates in terms of the Becker-Döring-Volmer-Zeldovitch quasi-equilibrium theory. Gibbsian behaviour in the form of a maximum in the curve of ΔG f versus size is observed with a critical nuclear size at realistic temperatures and pressures of the order of that predicted by macroscopic liquid-drop theories. These figures and those derived for nucleation rate and critical supersaturation appear remarkably insensitive to the details of the model used, in particular to the distinction between ‘microcrystalline’ and ‘amorphous’ atomistic models. The general status of atomistic nucleation theory is critically examined in the light of these and similar results.",

It has long been recognized that high pressure plays a crucial role in the polymorphic phase transitions of graphite, notably in the graphite-diamond transformation. More recent studies have revealed a wealth of pressure-induced phases associated with the unusual layer-stacking (‘staging’) mechanism in the intercalation compounds of graphite. The high degree of structural anisotropy associated with staging is strongly reflected in the electronic band structure and transport properties, and in the remarkable pressure dependence of the superconducting states of some of the graphite intercalation compounds. High pressure is shown to be a valuable means not only to realize new structural phases but also to improve our understanding of the fundamental behaviour of these important materials.",

After an initial discussion of Landau's Fermi liquid theory and its application to metals the concept of renormalized band structure calculation is introduced. The fundamental ideas are considered and explicit prescriptions are derived which allow a phenomenological account to be made of the strong local correlations. A comparison is made between the calculated quasiparticle bands and the detailed information now available from Fermi surface studies. Next, the interaction among the quasiparticles is discussed with particular reference to its influence on the electronic compressibility and the spin susceptibility. The correlation-related contribution to the quasiparticle-phonon coupling is derived. The question of quasiparticle collisions is also briefly discussed. Finally, a brief review is given of ideas and theoretical models which are used to describe superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds; in this context, a concept for constructing realistic order parameters is explored which accounts for the lattice structure and the anisotropy of the Fermi surface.",

After a brief account of the basic nearly-free-electron diffraction formula, the quantitative comparison of this formula with experiment is discussed. For the alkali metals, the agreement is adequate, given the uncertainty of the pseudopotentials, although there is controversy about the calculation of the temperature coefficient of ρ L. To explain the observed volume dependence of ρ L, and the thermoelectric power, it also seems necessary to allow for the variation of the pseudopotential with the positions of the Fermi level and the core levels relative to the bottom of the conduction band. Quantitative results for the noble and polyvalent metals are meagre, and although calculations of ρ L for Al and Zn are in excellent agreement with experiment there may be other cases where the basic formula is not adequate. The general question of the structure and convergence of the perturbation series for ρ L is discussed, and it is suggested that corrections for higher order terms can be minimized by making the pseudopotential as near as possible to the t-matrix of an ion. The anomalous properties of Hg are then discussed, in the light of the work of Mott (1966). In this connection it is shown that Edwards' formula (1962) for ρ L, in which the Fermi velocity, v F, is taken to be that of a free electron, ħk F/m, despite deviations from the free-electron curve for ϵ(k), can be derived by using the expectation value of the current operator in place of e v F in the Boltzmann equation. This modification of the elementary theory allows the Hall constant of a liquid metal to deviate from 1/nec, as found experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this review is to present aperiodic crystals from a unifying point of view, showing why it is justified to call them crystals, despite the lack of a three-dimensional lattice periodicity, and to discuss in what sense they differ from periodic crystals in structure, symmetry and other physical properties. The extension of the concept of crystal has been based, during the last two decades, on investigation of incommensurate crystal phases. Among these, the most important ones are the modulated crystals. Their crystallographic nature, already apparent in the diffraction pattern, could be made explicit on the symmetry level by embedding in a higher-dimensional Euclidean space. The recent discovery of quasicrystal phases (representing a fairly different class of aperiodic crystals than the modulated ones) can also be approached in a similar way. Furthermore, it now appears that another class of incommensurate crystals, the so-called composite structures, represents a kind of intermediate case between the other two. In § 1 basic concepts are presented, together with a number of compounds given as illustration for typical incommensurate crystal phases. In § 2 we deal with the general formalism allowing a crystallographic symmetry characterization. It is intended as a first approach to crystal-structure determination, which justifies the emphasis on the diffraction pattern and on the modulated-crystal case. The appropriate generalization to the quasicrystal case is considered in § 3. The crystallographic nature of the incommensurate phases is apparent in their growth forms. It has been known for centuries that crystal morphology is essentially based on lattice periodicity. It is therefore fascinating to discover how nature solves the problem in the incommensurate crystal case; we discuss this in § 4. The origin of incommensurability is the subject of § 5 (on a phenomenological level) and of § 6 (on a microscopic level). In § 7 the basic concepts needed in crystal-structure determination are discussed in more detail than was appropriate in § 2. In § 8 we discuss those physical properties which are more closely related to incommensurability, fitting nevertheless into the general frame of crystal physics. In § 9 we deal with defects, again in particular with the additional ones due to the more complex structure of aperiodic crystals, making clear at the same time why defects play an even more important role than in periodic crystals.",

    "abstract": "Inverse problems in statistical physics are motivated by the challenges of `big data' in different fields, in particular high-throughput experiments in biology. In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs to be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model parameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In this review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related problems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given observed spin correlations, magnetisations, or other data. We review applications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of neural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene regulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of controlled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the statistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method, pseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising problem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be reconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.",

    "abstract": "In this review we summarize and amplify recent investigations of coupled quantum dynamical systems with few degrees of freedom in the short-wavelength, semiclassical limit. Focusing on the correspondence between quantum and classical physics, we mathematically formulate and attempt to answer three fundamental questions. (i) How can one drive a small dynamical quantum system to behave classically? (ii) What determines the rate at which two single-particle quantum-mechanical subsystems become entangled when they interact? (iii) How does irreversibility occur in quantum systems with few degrees of freedom? These three questions are posed in the context of the quantum-classical correspondence for dynamical systems with few degrees of freedom, and we accordingly rely on two short-wavelength approximations to quantum mechanics to answer them: the trajectory-based semiclassical approach on the one hand, and random matrix theory on the other hand. We construct novel investigative procedures towards decoherence and the emergence of classicality out of quantumness in dynamical systems coupled to external degrees of freedom. In particular, we show how dynamical properties of chaotic classical systems, such as local exponential instability in phase space, also affects their quantum counterparts. For instance, it is often the case that the fidelity with which a quantum state is reconstructed after an imperfect time-reversal operation decays with the Lyapunov exponent of the corresponding classical dynamics. For related reasons, but perhaps more surprisingly, the rate at which two interacting quantum subsystems become entangled can also be governed by the subsystem's Lyapunov exponents. Our method allows us to differentiate quantum coherent effects (those related to phase interferences) from classical ones (those related to the necessarily extended envelope of quantal wavefunctions) at each stage in our investigations. This makes it clear that all occurrences of Lyapunov exponents we witness have a classical origin, although they require rather strong decoherence effects to be observed. We extensively rely on numerical experiments to illustrate our findings and briefly comment on possible extensions to more complex problems involving environments with many interacting dynamical systems, going beyond the uncoupled harmonic oscillators model of Caldeira and Leggett.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Interstellar dust is suggested to be one of the most thoroughly studied of all small-particle systems, whose characteristics have in some ways not been duplicated in our laboratories. The particles are maintained in complete isolation from one another, in ultra-high vacuum and at low temperature, and have been studied spectroscopically from far infra-red to far ultra-violet. Optical properties of the interstellar dust which are surveyed include effects interpreted as due to surface plasmon bands in the ultra-violet, surface phonon bands and other vibrational absorption bands in the infra-red, linear and circular polarization caused by aligned particles, impurity absorption, and defect absorption possibly caused by radiation damage. A discussion of the possible origins for interstellar grains leads to speculation on their relationship to certain meteorites. Absorption and scattering effects from small particles in general are surveyed by way of Mie calculations for a representative insulator, MgO, and a representative metal, Mg. Spectral features revealed by the calculations from far infra-red to far ultra-violet are discussed briefly. Methods of measuring optical constants, necessary for small-particle calculations, are surveyed, and results for several solids of possible importance in astronomy are discussed. Collective resonances associated with plasmons and phonons in small particles are treated, and the effect of particle shape is illustrated with several experimental examples. Various non-collective resonance effects in small particles are presented and situations in which bulk optical constants may not be appropriate are reviewed. Applications are made of all these effects to observed features from interstellar grains. Special emphasis is given to a discussion of the 39 unidentified interstellar bands in the visible spectral region, which comprise the longest-standing spectroscopic mystery in astronomy.",

TPS arises at temperatures higher than the bulk critical temperature of a single crystal, and has a localized character. This phenomenon is caused by Cooper-pairing enhancement near the twinning plane. TPS is characterized by anomalously strong diamagnetism above the critical point. The phase (H, T) diagram of TPS is very specific and differs noticeably for type-I and type-II superconductors (e.g. tin and niobium). The interaction of closely spaced twinning planes is discussed, as well as the case of TPS in microscopic particles. The proximity effect is shown to be reduced under these conditions, and the critical temperature noticeably increased (by a factor of two to three times for tin). The prospects for further investigations of TPS are considered.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of solid-state qubits with environmental degrees of freedom strongly affects the qubit dynamics, and leads to decoherence. In quantum information processing with solid-state qubits, decoherence significantly limits the performances of such devices. Therefore, it is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms that lead to decoherence. In this review, we discuss how decoherence affects two of the most successful realizations of solid-state qubits, namely, spin qubits and superconducting qubits. In the former, the qubit is encoded in the spin 1/2 of the electron, and it is implemented by confining the electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. Superconducting devices show quantum behaviour at low temperatures, and the qubit is encoded in the two lowest energy levels of a superconducting circuit. The electron spin in a quantum dot has two main decoherence channels, a (Markovian) phonon-assisted relaxation channel, due to the presence of a spin–orbit interaction, and a (non-Markovian) spin bath constituted by the spins of the nuclei in the quantum dot that interact with the electron spin via the hyperfine interaction. In a superconducting qubit, decoherence takes place as a result of fluctuations in the control parameters, such as bias currents, applied flux and bias voltages, and via losses in the dissipative circuit elements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The microscopic theory of dielectric response and its application to elementary excitations is discussed with particular emphasis on periodic solids for which the free-electron description is not valid. The discussion is based on a solution of Maxwell's equations which is achieved in a local wavefunction representation. Many-body effects are included within the self-consistent field approximation. The resulting dielectric-response function presents a practical scheme for a microscopic calculation of elementary excitations and their interaction in conducting as well as non-conducting crystals. As an example, the linear response of crystal electrons to a perturbing photon field is studied in detail. Results of a calculation of the optical absorption in diamond establish the importance of including both local-field and continuum excition effects. These effects are important for the identification of structures in the experimental optical spectrum with electronic inter-band transitions, and quite generally for calculating dielectric response in covalent crystals. Other examples deal with phonons and the electron-phonon interaction in transition metals and their compounds. Various results of the theory such as phonon renormalization due to local-field and exchange-correlation effects are discussed and compared with experiment. A microscopic explanation for phonon softening and its interrelation with high-T c superconductivity is given in terms of incipient lattice instabilities which are driven by dielectric response.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The structural properties (radial distribution function, small angle scattering, density), optical properties (complex dielectric function versus energy), and other characterizing parameters (scanning electron microscope examination, chemical analysis, recrystallization behaviour, transport phenomena), have been determined for a series of amorphous Ge films sputtered at different substrate temperatures. Various of these properties (e.g. refractive index, density, room temperature conductivity) show only slowly varying values for low and high substrate temperatures, with a rapid changeover in a critical temperature range. A model has been developed which relates this behaviour to the probability that an adatom configuration be able to change to a configuration of lower local free energy in the time for the deposition of a monolayer, and it is suggested that such behaviour may be a general feature of disordered films prepared by any deposition method. The structural and optical properties at a given deposition temperature, their differences from the properties of the FC-2 crystal, and the small changes in them as the deposition temperature is increased, are examined in terms of the Phillips spectroscopic theory of bonding. It is found that the changes in the gross optical properties from crystal to disordered film and among disordered films may be very satisfactorily explained in terms of changes in the bond length and the coordination number or density. The changes in these parameters are quantitatively related to the changes in the void density by the structural measurements. The special importance of the coordination number—and so of the void density distribution—both for the basic theory and for attempted extrapolation to the properties of the fully coordinated continuous random network without impurities is emphasized. The complex dielectric function is used, along with published data on the conduction band density of states and arguments concerning the dependence of the transition matrix element on energy, to derive densities of states for the valence band and in the pseudogap, and their changes with deposition temperature. These state densities are then used to calculate the conductivity due to transport in the delocalized valence band states using the random phase approximation and also the conductivity due to hopping near the Fermi level, and the results compared with preliminary data on conductivity. Finally, a review is given of pertinent earlier work on structure and its dependence on preparatory method and annealing treatment, the relation of the experimental structure measurements to atomic models, calculations of the electronic band structure, and earlier measurements of optical properties derived from photoemission, reflectivity and absorption edge data. An attempt is made to correlate the new data with earlier measurements, and to assess to what extent the properties reported here approach those of the hypothetical chemically pure, perfectly coordinated continuous random network.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the monovalent metals the electronic band structure is strongly affected by the size of the band gap E s-E p at the Brillouin zone faces, a large gap implying a large distortion of the Fermi surface. Here E s and E p are the energies of the purely s-like and p-like states on the zone faces. We have made crude estimates of E s-E p for the alkali and noble metals, in terms of the s-p excitation energy Δsp of the free atoms. These suggest a single model which correlates most of the experimental information about the band structures of these metals. In particular the Fermi surface of lithium appears to make considerable contact with the zone faces. In the α-phase alloys of the noble metals, the solute always has a larger value of Δsp than the solvent, which raises the energy E p relative to E s. The Fermi surface becomes more nearly spherical in copper alloys than in copper, since E p<E s, whereas it distorts further in the gold alloys (E p>E s). This accounts for many Knight shift, electronic specific heat, magnetic susceptibility and other data on these alloys. Furthermore it provides the extension of Jones' explanation of the Hume-Rothery rule demanded by the non-spherical Fermi surface in pure copper and gold.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we discuss the statics of small assemblies of soft, rare-gas type atoms (N=4 to 13) interacting under simple two-body central forces such as the Lennard-Jones and Morse type. Our main concern is to characterize the problem of isomer multiplicity in small packed structures and to devise practical algorithms for the discovery of a representative majority, if not all, stable soft-packing structures for clusters of atoms in the above size-range. We illustrate one such possible ‘Aufbau algorithm’ by demonstrating the existence of no less than 988 distinct, stable minimum configurations for 13 Lennard-Jones atoms and of correspondingly smaller numbers in the range N=7 to 12. The minimal structures obtained may be classified broadly into ‘crystallographic’ and ‘non-crystallographic’ types, the latter predominating among those of greatest binding energy. A surprising result is that, when the softer (α=3) Morse potential is used, the great majority of the Lennard-Jones minima are not supported and only a much smaller class of distinct structures survive. Moreover, broadly speaking, crystallographic configurations are favoured by the softer potential, in confirmation of the intuitive view that relatively hard potentials dispose to amorphous structure. These results, representing the probable structures of free condensation nuclei near 0 K, provide an interesting statistical morphology for small nuclei, as well as being a necessary first step in the construction of a statistical thermodynamics valid at finite temperatures.",

Among the various forms of CNTs, single-walled and multi-walled, random and aligned, semiconducting and metallic, aligned CNTs are especially important since fundamental physics studies and many important applications will not be possible without alignment. Even though there have been significant endeavors on growing CNTs in an aligned configuration since their discovery, little success had been realized before our first report on growing individually aligned CNTs on various substrates by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) [Science 282 (1998) 1105–1108]. Our report spearheaded a new field on growth, characterization, physics, and applications of aligned CNTs. Up to now, there have been thousands of scientific publications on synthesizing, studying, and utilizing aligned CNTs in various aspects. In this communication, we review the current status of aligned CNTs, the physics for their alignment, their applications in field emission, optical antennas, subwavelength light transmission in CNT-based nanocoax structures, nanocoax arrays for novel solar cell structures, etc. The focus of this review is to examine various aligned CNT systems, either as an individual or as an array, either the orientation is vertical, parallel, or at other angles to the substrate horizon, either the CNT core structures are mostly hollow channels or are composed of complex compartments. Major fabrication methods are illustrated in detail, particularly the most widely used PECVD growth technique on which various device integration schemes are based, followed by applications whereas current limitations and challenges will also be discussed to lay down the foundation for future developments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this article is to examine current hypotheses about the optical and electrical properties of the amorphous chalcogenide semiconductors, and to examine whether they can be extended to explain some of the properties of amorphous silicon dioxide. For the selenides and tellurides we assume the validity of the model of ‘charged dangling bonds’ introduced by Street and Mott. Absorption of light by these defects leads to photoluminescence with a large Stokes shift; formation of an electron-hole pair far from a defect, on the other hand, leads to radiationless recombination. In enquiring why this is so, we examine the nature of excitons in non-crystalline systems, and the mechanism of self-trapping both of excitons and of free carriers in crystalline and non-crystalline materials. Self-trapping by the V K-type mechanism, if it occurs, takes place after a certain delay for a free hole or exciton, but not for one bound at a defect, so that free-exciton absorption bands are narrower than those from bound excitons at defects. The radiationless recombination of a free or bound exciton normally occurs through the mechanism first considered by Dexter et al., if more energy than ∼1 eV is emitted. In SiO2 electrons are exceptionally mobile, but on the basis of work by Hughes, we think that holes are self-trapped after a delay, and can then move by polaron-type hopping. We propose that the first absorption peak (at 10.2 eV) in the optical spectrum is due to an optically allowed exciton, which recombines by the Dexter mechanism, but only after a delay of a type proposed here. The delay allows a comparatively narrow absorption peak, of width given by that of the exciton band. The absorption peak due to a Na+ ion linked to a non-bridging oxygen atom is considerably broader because it is due to a bound exciton. We estimate the band-gap in SiO2 to be about 10.6 eV and also the position of the centre of gravity of the level due to a Na+ ion with a non-bridging oxygen atom to be ∼1.5 eV above the valence band of SiO2, less than usually supposed. Finally, we examine the nature of the positive and negative charges which occur in SiO2 grown thermally on silicon; these are responsible for Anderson localization of electrons in the inversion layer, and for the ‘slow states’ of silicon technology. We tentatively conclude that they are non-bridging oxygen atoms and that these, like dangling bonds in chalcogenides, are normally positively and negatively charged. We examine their positions in the gap and the activation energies of charging and discharging.",

    "abstract": "Abstract By comparing measured and calculated versions of the generalized magnetic response function of nickel over a wide range of temperatures it is shown that the much-discussed simple model of an itinerant-electron ferromagnet based on a random-phase-approximation treatment of the Hubbard Hamiltonian accounts, in its essentials, for the magnetism of that substance. Thermal neutron inelastic scattering techniques were used to explore the whole Brillouin zone of wave vectors K in nickel up to energies ▄ω of some 2k B T C over the range of temperatures up to 2T C; the computations were based on direct evaluation of the Lindhard expression for the generalized susceptibility, using a tight-binding band structure, followed by exchange enhancement of the spin part as per Izuyama, Kim and Kubo. The contribution to the neutron scattering from orbital motion of the electrons was estimated to be small, and in a special experimental investigation a satisfactorily low upper limit on this quantity for our present purposes was observed. In the course of the article we attempt to illuminate with our computational results the theoretical content of the random-phase approximation, and to show how it accounts for spin waves, paramagnons and a variety of other phenomena. For instance at low temperatures, where the collective or spin-wave mode is the most prominent feature, the Stoner-mode states are so strongly mixed with the spin-wave states by the electron-electron interaction that little trace is left of the ‘band of Stoner modes’ often referred to in elementary accounts of this phenomenon. With increase of temperature, the severe broadening of the spin wave and the characteristic style of evolution of the magnetic response function through the critical temperature are correctly predicted, outside a narrow range of conditions about the critical point. The dramatic divergence of the susceptibility characteristic of the phase transition is confined much more closely towards the origin of K,ω space than could be accounted for by free-electron gas theory, and this is explained. On the other hand what appears to be a case of breakdown of the random-phase approximation is detected in the ferromagnetic state, where in a certain set of conditions at large K and small ω an excess of longitudinal spin correlation was measured over that expected theoretically. Aside from the aforementioned aberrant region, however, absolute agreement between experiment and theory essentially within the statistical error is obtainable by assuming that the effective Coulomb interaction parameter I eff(K) falls off gently between K=0 and K max in a manner consistent with the predictions of Singwi et al. ; with increase of temperature, I eff(0) declines gently and the amount of fall-off with K increases. It is shown that the theory of the Heisenberg ferromagnet fails entirely to account for the observations—indeed, fails to correlate any of the data on nickel—and that at least three-quarters of the known magnetic stiffness of nickel must be due to band-theory effects rather than to Heisenberg-type exchange integrals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The macroscopic and local properties of 3d transition metal impurities in normal metals are reviewed and compared with the theoretical situation in this field. The parameters of the Anderson and s-d exchange models are derived from direct and indirect experimental data using as a guide the Hartree-Fock approximation of the non-degenerate Anderson model. The basic observations about the magnetic-non-magnetic transition, and the behaviour of the magnetic, thermal and transport properties when going through the transition region are demonstrated for specific examples. A detailed comparison between the present status of theory and experiment is performed by inspecting the large body of experimental data of two typical alloys, which served as testing materials for the development of the existing theories. CuFe is often regarded as a typical ‘yes moment’ system, and the experiments are therefore compared with the predictions based on the s-d exchange model; in the case of AlMn, the spin-fluctuation concept was chosen as a theoretical basis. It is shown that various approaches of the models fail to describe the fine experimental details. Evidence is presented which calls for a unified theory with no distinction between magnetic (Kondo-type) and non-magnetic (spin-fluctuation) alloys. It is suggested that the range of applicability of a model depends not only on the basic parameters of the dilute alloy but on the temperature, too, and the question of the relevance of the models to the actual state of affairs is to be answered by inspecting the temperature regions where the various approximations of the models are expected to work; the T≥TK properties are compared with the Kondo approach, the Tˇ-TK properties with the spin fluctuation model, although in the latter case the analysis is based on the concept of a narrow resonance level, which is not a feature of the spin-fluctuation concept only. Finally, the basic experimental facts and indications are absorbed into a phenomenological model, which describes both the single-particle resonances and the many-body effects involved in resonance formation in classical dilute alloys.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of heavy particles suspended in turbulent flows is of fundamental importance for a wide range of questions in astrophysics, atmospheric physics, oceanography, and technology. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have demonstrated that heavy particles respond in intricate ways to turbulent fluctuations of the carrying fluid: non-interacting particles may cluster together and form spatial patterns even though the fluid is incompressible, and the relative speeds of nearby particles can fluctuate strongly. Both phenomena depend sensitively on the parameters of the system. This parameter dependence is difficult to model from first principles since turbulence plays an essential role. Laboratory experiments are also very difficult, precisely since they must refer to a turbulent environment. But in recent years it has become clear that important aspects of the dynamics of heavy particles in turbulence can be understood in terms of statistical models where the turbulent fluctuations are approximated by Gaussian random functions with appropriate correlation functions. In this review, we summarise how such statistical-model calculations have led to a detailed understanding of the factors that determine heavy-particle dynamics in turbulence. We concentrate on spatial clustering of heavy particles in turbulence. This is an important question because spatial clustering affects the collision rate between the particles and thus the long-term fate of the system.",

Values for the pressure dependence of the elementary effective exchange interaction between a magnetic impurity spin and the conduction electron sea are extracted from the data and tabulated for a number of extremely dilute alloys containing both transition metal and rare earth impurities. Results of experiments on host alloy series employing 'lattice pressure' are compared to the present 'external pressure' results and critically analysed; it is shown how such a comparison can be used to give information about the extent of the electronic screening around an impurity potential. The effect of pressure on impurity-impurity interactions in spin glasses is also examined; a comparison of the pressure studies on extremely dilute alloys to those on spin glasses allows an estimate of the nature of the interaction mechanisms important in the latter case. Evidence for a pressure-induced spin glass to Kondo transition in LaCe is also presented. It is suggested that the present results fit into a larger picture that magnetism, when present, tends to be weakened when high pressure is applied.",

Other limitations and defects of the Stueckelberg treatment are examined in detail and most are eliminated. New formulae for the general non-crossing case are presented. They describe perturbed symmetric resonance, reducing in an exactly correct manner for the Rosen-Zener model and also for exact resonance. Within a dynamical adiabatic treatment they also describe perturbed united-atom degeneracy, giving rise to strong rotational coupling in σ-π transitions.

Methods for the evaluation of the integrals involved are described, and in particular a discussion is given of two different 'zero-range' approximations, one involving an assumption that the heaviest projectile has zero extent, the other assuming the interaction to have zero range. These two approaches are compared. The main emphasis, however, is directed towards extracting from experimental two-nucleon transfer reactions, reliable spectroscopic information, and to this end, shell model expressions for the spectroscopic amplitude have been derived, together with closed formulae for two-particle coefficients of fractional parentage (cfp). The JT representation is used principally throughout, but expressions are given for the LSJT representation as well as for the separate treatment of neutrons and protons. Examples illustrating (i) excitation of analogue states; (ii) comparison of (p, t) and (p, 3He) reactions to mirror states; and (iii) coherence effects between different shell model orbitals, indicate the usefulness of two-nucleon transfer reactions in determining nuclear structure information such as spins, parities, two-body matrix elements, etc. As a further aid to the analysis of experimental data, numerical tables of two-particle cfp's in the isospin formalism for j = 1/2, 3/2 and 5/2 are given for states of low seniority, and in the non-isospin formalism for j = 3/2, 5/2, 7/2 and 9/2 shells.

The thermal gap changes from 1.2 to 3 ev between pure tellurium and the alloy with 70 at. % selenium. There is a large increase in hole mobility with atomic % selenium.

It has been shown by the studies of Maisch (1956) and Ockman (1957) that it is not possible to obtain a unique solution to the structure problem of ice by measuring its polarized vibration spectrum. However, Maisch's observation of the constancy of the depolarization ratio across each of the bands in the hydrogen stretching region is a strong argument for a disordered structure. Satisfactory assignments have only been made for the three bands originating in the fundamental modes of the water molecule and for the six strong bands which can be correlated with the overtone and combination modes of the liquid and vapour spectra. An explicit characterization of the low frequency bands in terms of lattice motions must await a solution to the lattice-dynamical problem as well as a careful study of the low frequency, polarized spectra of single crystals. The solution to the dynamical problem of the ice lattice should make possible a determination of the crystal anharmonicities. This would then enable one to assign the overtone and combination bands.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In part I (1965, Adv. Phys., 14, 101), a theory was developed which treated the thermodynamics of dielectric and anelastic relaxation due to point defects in crystals from the viewpoint of the point symmetry of the defect as well as of the crystal. In the present paper this theory is extended to treat the kinetics of relaxation. Equations are derived which express the relaxation times of electrically and stress active modes of relaxation in terms of the rates of reorientation between one particular defect orientation and all of the other equivalent configurations. Explicit expressions are then given for these relaxation times for commonly occurring crystal and defect symmetries. The reorientation frequencies which appear in these expressions may be converted into the appropriate atom or ion jump rates; this final step can generally be carried out merely by inspection of the crystal model. The possibility that two or more relaxations due to a given point defect may be widely separated on a frequency or temperature scale (a situation which is called a 'frozen-free split'), and the anomalies connected with such behaviour, are discussed. Finally, various examples which have been studied in the literature, of relaxations due to point defects, are reviewed in the framework of the present theory.

    "abstract": "Domain boundaries typically constitute only a minute fraction of the total volume of a crystal. However, a special (but not unusual) situation can occur in which the domain boundary energy becomes very small. Specifically, the domain size is miniaturized to near-atomic scales and the domain boundary density becomes extremely high. In such cases, the properties of the crystal become dominated by a combination of both the domains and the domain boundaries. This phenomenon differs from most ferromagnetic or ferroelectric materials wherein the motion of the domain boundaries dominates the response. As reported herein, novel emergent phenomena that differ from the properties of either the domains or the domain boundaries may be expected. In this article, we focus on one specific state found in ferroic materials – namely, the adaptive ferroic state. This state can be found, for example, in tweed-like structures in morphotropic phase boundary piezoelectric crystals, ferromagnetic shape memory alloys, and pre-martensitic states. In these materials, the properties of the twin boundaries represent the principal contributors to the functionality of a given system. In fact, further investigations of domain boundary-dominated phenomena could result in novel potential for tailoring functional properties for a desired outcome. It should also be noted that new properties can be designed into twin boundaries that are not the properties of the domains. In this paper, adaptive structures and functional twin boundaries are reviewed, and examples of various observed functionalities (e.g. superconductivity, polarity, and ferroelectricity) and corresponding twin boundary structures are provided. In addition, this review confirms that various theoretically predicted, structurally bridging low-symmetry phases do, in fact, exist. Moreover, the values of the lattice constants of the adaptive state are adjustable parameters that are determined by combinations of cubic, rhombohedral/tetragonal phases, and geometrical invariant conditions. Finally, we show that, in such cases, macroscopic properties are controlled by the unique functionality of the twin walls. Looking forward, domain boundary-dominated phenomena offer an important approach for enhancing the properties of the bulk, and to unique local properties where the \"twin is the device\". We encourage the community to rethink their approaches to materials by design that have treated the structure as homogeneous and to consider the alternative paradigm where the local structure is different from the apparent average symmetry.",

    "abstract": "An algebraic theory of dualities is developed based on the notion of bond algebras. It deals with classical and quantum dualities in a unified fashion explaining the precise connection between quantum dualities and the low temperature (strong-coupling)/high temperature (weak-coupling) dualities of classical statistical mechanics (or (Euclidean) path integrals). Its range of applications includes discrete lattice, continuum field and gauge theories. Dualities are revealed to be local, structure-preserving mappings between model-specific bond algebras that can be implemented as unitary transformations, or partial isometries if gauge symmetries are involved. This characterization permits us to search systematically for dualities and self-dualities in quantum models of arbitrary system size, dimensionality and complexity, and any classical model admitting a transfer matrix or operator representation. In particular, special dualities such as exact dimensional reduction, emergent and gauge-reducing dualities that solve gauge constraints can be easily understood in terms of mappings of bond algebras. As a new example, we show that the ℤ2 Higgs model is dual to the extended toric code model in any number of dimensions. Non-local transformations such as dual variables and Jordan–Wigner dictionaries are algorithmically derived from the local mappings of bond algebras. This permits us to establish a precise connection between quantum dual and classical disorder variables. Our bond-algebraic approach goes beyond the standard approach to classical dualities, and could help resolve the long-standing problem of obtaining duality transformations for lattice non-Abelian models. As an illustration, we present new dualities in any spatial dimension for the quantum Heisenberg model. Finally, we discuss various applications including location of phase boundaries, spectral behavior and, notably, we show how bond-algebraic dualities help constrain and realize fermionization in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions.",

    "abstract": "This is an introductory review of the physics of topological quantum matter with cold atoms. Topological quantum phases, originally discovered and investigated in condensed matter physics, have recently been explored in a range of different systems, which produced both fascinating physics findings and exciting opportunities for applications. Among the physical systems that have been considered to realize and probe these intriguing phases, ultracold atoms become promising platforms due to their high flexibility and controllability. Quantum simulation of topological phases with cold atomic gases is a rapidly evolving field, and recent theoretical and experimental developments reveal that some toy models originally proposed in condensed matter physics have been realized with this artificial quantum system. The purpose of this article is to introduce these developments. The article begins with a tutorial review of topological invariants and the methods to control parameters in the Hamiltonians of neutral atoms. Next, topological quantum phases in optical lattices are introduced in some detail, especially several celebrated models, such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the Hofstadter-Harper model, the Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model. The theoretical proposals and experimental implementations of these models are discussed. Notably, many of these models cannot be directly realized in conventional solid-state experiments. The newly developed methods for probing the intrinsic properties of the topological phases in cold atom systems are also reviewed. Finally, some topological phases with cold atoms in the continuum and in the presence of interactions are discussed, and an outlook on future work is given.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent developments in the theory of nucleation of vapour deposits on crystalline substrates are reviewed. To facilitate comparison, the theories are formulated in a common dimensionless notation, and an examination of the major underlying assumptions reveals the basic similarity of many of them. The capture and dissociation rates are expressed in terms of the cluster geometry and the pertinent energy parameters, and from these the ‘chemical’ rate equations are set up. The following types of approximate solutions are discussed: (a) long-time asymptotic solutions, from which the conditions for saturation in the cluster concentration may be deduced, (b) a generalization of the type of approximate solution used by Logan (1969), and (c) numerical solutions employing a minimum number of simplifying assumptions. Based on a simple model, agreement between the latter two seems reasonably good. For any given set of fixed parameters (energies, geometrical constants, and arrival rate from the vapour) several temperature ranges may be distinguished. The main division is between ‘initially complete condensation’ at low temperatures and ‘initially incomplete condensation’ at high temperatures. Within each of the latter cases there are further transitions (a) between different values of the ‘critical size’ i*, and (b) from negligible growth to rapid growth of the supercritical clusters. The influence of all of these factors on the final cluster concentration is described. The distributions of the clusters in size and spacing are discussed briefly and qualitatively, as are the types of effects that can be induced by defects or other ‘special sites’ on the substrate. Comparisons are made with some recent experimental studies. In many of these, defects in the substrate seem to play a dominant role, and no detailed comparison with theory seems possible. One notable exception is the nucleation of rare gas crystals on graphite substrates (Venables and Ball 1970), and here, for at least two of the three gases studied, excellent quantitative agreement is obtained.",

Emphasis is given to the inter-relation between the electronic properties and the atomic structures of the solutions. The material is organized according to concentration regions characterized by differing electronic and ionic structures. In the very dilute concentration range, 0–10−3 mole per cent metal (MPM), the solutions behave as ideal electrolytes with solvated electrons and solvated positive ions as the ionic species. Association of these species occurs in the dilute region, 10−3–10−1 MPM. We propose that growth of associated complexes into large, metallic clusters occurs in the intermediate region, 10−1—3 MPM. A metal-non-metal transition or, at lower temperatures, a phase separation takes place in the 3–7 MPM concentration range. We give a simplified theory of the Mott transition for these solutions and explore the inter-relation of the Mott transition, the observed metal-non-metal transition, and the phase separation. The metallic range extends from 7 MPM to saturation at 15 or 20 MPM in the concentrated solutions; we propose a fused-salt-like structure for this region. Suggestions are made for future research.",

It is found that from the ordinary transport properties, and in particular from analyses of the Hall effect and deviations from Mattheissen's rule, the assembled conclusions do not present a coherent picture, at least with regard to electron-impurity scattering. The results for scattering by phonons are more consistent. The advent recently of rather precise (∼ 0·1%) specifications of the noble metal Fermi surfaces together with the knowledge of certain derivative properties over them makes possible more direct measurements of electron scattering. The application of experimental techniques which are more commonly associated with the field of 'Fermiology', and in particular the de Haas-van Alphen effect, to study conduction electron scattering more directly is an important theme of the present paper. Such direct experiments, which can yield local values of the electronic lifetime, τ (k), make possible a comparison between theory and experiment prior to the stage where the Boltzmann equation or its equivalent needs to be solved.",

The theory exploits the isomorphism between quantum energy flow in Fock space, that is, vibrational state space, and single-particle quantum transport in disordered solid-state systems. The quantum ergodicity transition in molecules is thereby analogous to the Anderson transition in disordered solids. The theory reviewed here, local random matrix theory (LRMT), describes the nature of the quantum ergodicity transition, statistical properties of vibrational eigenstates, and quantum energy flow through the vibrational states of molecules. Predictions of LRMT have been observed in computational studies of coupled nonlinear oscillator systems, which are summarized here. We also review applications of LRMT to molecular spectroscopy and chemical reaction rate theory, including adoption of LRMT in theories that predict rates of conformational change of molecules taking place at energies corresponding to those below and above the quantum ergodicity transition. A number of specific examples are reviewed, including the application of LRMT to predict (1) dilution factors of IR spectra of organic molecules, (2) rates of conformational change in chemical and photochemical reactions, (3) conformational dynamics of biological molecules in molecular beams, (4) rates of hydrogen bond breaking and rearrangement in clusters of biological molecules and water, and (5) excited state proton transfer reactions in proteins.",

    "abstract": "Transparent conductors (TCs) are materials, which are characterized by high transmission of light and simultaneously very high electrical DC conductivity. These materials play a crucial role, and made possible numerous applications in the fields of electro-optics, plasmonics, biosensing, medicine, and \"green energy\". Modern applications, for example in the field of touchscreen and flexible displays, require that TCs are also mechanically strong and flexible. TC can be broadly classified into two categories: uniform and non-uniform TC. The uniform TC can be viewed as conventional metals (or electron plasmas) with plasma frequency located in the infrared frequency range (e.g. transparent conducting oxides), or ultra-thin metals with large plasma frequency (e.g. graphen). The physics of the nonuniform TC is much more complex, and could involve transmission enhancement due to refraction (including plasmonic), and exotic effects of electron transport, including percolation and fractal effects. This review ties the TC performance to the underlying physical phenomena. We begin with the theoretical basis for studying the various phenomena encountered in TC. Next, we consider the uniform TC, and discuss first the conventional conducting oxides (such as indium tin oxide), reviewing advantages and limitations of these classic uniform electron plasmas. Next, we discuss the potential of single- and multiple-layer graphene as uniform TC. In the part of the paper dealing with non-uniform metallic films, we begin with the review of random metallic networks. The transparency of these networks could be enhanced beyond the classical shading limit by the plasmonic refractive effects. The electrical conduction strongly depends on the network type, and we review first networks made of individual metallic nanowires, where conductivity depends on the inter-wire contact, and the percolation effects. Next, we review the uniform metallic film networks, which are free of the percolation effects and contact problems. In applications that require high-quality electric contact of a TC to an active substrate (such as LED or solar cells), the network performance can be optimized by employing a quasi-fractal structure of the network. We also consider the periodic metallic networks, where active plasmonic refraction leads to the phenomenon of the extraordinary optical transmission. We review the relevant literature on this topic, and demonstrate networks, which take advantage of this strategy (the bio-inspired leaf venation (LV) network, hybrid networks, etc.). Finally, we review \"smart\" TCs, with an added functionality, such as light interference, metamaterial effects, built-in semiconductors, and their junctions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper is concerned with a survey of the experimental data for the thermoelectric power† The thermoelectric power is hereinafter referred to as TEP of transition metals and with their discussion. For the first time a critical review of the main data, which are given in the literature and proved to be rather incomplete, is presented. When necessary, the author has conducted the TEP measurements within the temperature range of 80° to 1800°k, wherever it was possible. For the first time TEP data have been obtained for scandium, osmium and, effectively, for hafnium; erroneous data for thorium and ruthenium have been corrected; the temperature measuring range for many other metals has been substantially extended. Finally, from the data found in the literature and the new results, a fairly complete notion has been formed of the high-temperature behaviour of TEP for all transition metals (except technetium) in the 3d, 4d, and 5d series of the periodic system, as well as for uranium and thorium. Some empirical regularities in the behaviour of TEP have been detected, the main one of which is that the TEP's of transition metals, which belong to a given column of the periodic table and are in a magnetically disordered state, vary with the temperature above 80°k in a similar way. The paper demonstrates that the TEP of transition metals is characterized by a complex, non-linear temperature dependence. Consequently, the value and sign of the TEP at room temperature cannot serve as a sufficient criterion for characterizing the TEP. The general shape ('type') of the TEP temperature curve should be used as the above-mentioned criterion.",

    "abstract": "This work provides an up-to-date account of the use of electron-volt neutron spectroscopy in materials research. This is a growing area of neutron science, capitalising upon the unique insights provided by epithermal neutrons on the behaviour and properties of an increasing number of complex materials. As such, the present work builds upon the aims and scope of a previous contribution to this journal back in 2005, whose primary focus was on a detailed description of the theoretical foundations of the technique and their application to fundamental systems [see Andreani et al., Adv. Phys. 54 (2005) p.377] A lot has happened since then, and this review intends to capture such progress in the field. With both expert and novice in mind, we start by presenting the general principles underpinning the technique and discuss recent conceptual and methodological developments. We emphasise the increasing use of the technique as a non-invasive spectroscopic probe with intrinsic mass selectivity, as well as the concurrent use of neutron diffraction and first-principles computational materials modelling to guide and interpret experiments. To illustrate the state of the art, we discuss in detail a number of recent exemplars, chosen to highlight the use of electron-volt neutron spectroscopy across physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. These include: hydrides and proton conductors for energy applications; protons, deuterons, and oxygen atoms in bulk water; aqueous protons confined in nanoporous silicas, carbon nanotubes, and graphene-related materials; hydrated water in proteins and DNA; and the uptake of molecular hydrogen by soft nanostructured media, promising materials for energy-storage applications. For the primary benefit of the novice, this last case study is presented in a pedagogical and question-driven fashion, in the hope that it will stimulate further work into uncharted territory by newcomers to the field. All along, we emphasise the increasing (and much-needed) synergy between experiments using electron-volt neutrons and contemporary condensed matter theory and materials modelling to compute and ultimately understand neutron-scattering observables, as well as their relation to materials properties not amenable to scrutiny using other experimental probes.",

    "abstract": "Résumé In rare earth metals, one can neglect interactions between 4f shells centred on neighbouring sites. The conduction band is occupied by three sd electrons (eventually two in europium and ytterbium). These sd electrons are coupled to the f electrons through an interaction of the form where s e is the spin of a conduction electron and Sf i the spin of the ith f electron of a given ion. It is therefore possible to consider two groups of properties: 1. The ones, related to the nature of the conduction electrons, change very little through the series: this is the case of the crystalline structure, of the atomic volume. 2. The others, such as the magnetic properties, are related to the internal shells and vary with the filling of the 4f shell. Experiment shows a correlation between those two groups of properties. De Gennes formalism, essentially valid in the hypothesis of tightly bound 4f electrons, gives a satisfactory picture of the properties of the metals in the second half of the series, but it does not give as good a picture for the first rare earth metals, especially for cerium. In the cerium free atom, the 4f, 5d, 6s states have comparable energies and one might think that, in the trivalent metal, the 4f states are broadened in energy by resonances with the extended sd states, but still do not overlap from one atom to the other. They would then occupy virtual bound states analogous to the virtual bound states described by Blandin and Friedel for the transition impurities in noble metals. An identical situation seems to occur in ytterbium under pressure: one observes a huge increase of the electrical resistivity which goes back to low values at very high pressures. This might also be the case of the actinide metals, especially of Plutonium, in which the 5f states begin to stabilize. So we have to consider two cases: 1. The 4f electrons occupy bound states. 2. The 4f electrons occupy virtual bound states. In the first part (§ 2), we use de Gennes formalism for 4f bound states. The energy related to magnetic interactions is computed making the assumption of a spherical Fermi surface. A correlation between the crystalline structure and the magnetic properties shows up. In the second half of the series, one can neglect the crystalline field effects and the total energy is the sum of the magnetic term and of the elastic term due to the contribution of the conduction electrons. For every state of magnetic order, the crystalline structure is well defined, corresponding to the minimum of the total energy, and conversely. It is possible to explain in this manner: 1. The b.c.c. structure of europium, which is unusual for a divalent transition metal. 2. The variation of the c/a ratio of the h.c.p. structure both through the series and with temperature. 3. The anomalies in the thermal expansion coefficient observed below the magnetic order-disorder transitions. 4. The helix pitch of the magnetic configurations of this type. The anomalies of the thermoelectric power observed at the transition points are related to the different dependences of the spin correlations above and below the transition temperatures. The agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory. Some discrepancy can be attributed to the rather crude approximation of a spherical Fermi surface. In the second part (§ 3), we deal with a situation where the 4f electrons occupy virtual bound states. These levels are very narrow, about 10−2 ev wide, and separated in energy by the correlations between electrons. Using Blandin's formalism we calculate the electrical and magnetic properties associated with such a situation. Calculations lead to very strong magnetic coupling; the indirect interaction between magnetic ions is antiferromagnetic for first nearest neighbours, whereas in the case of 4f bound states it is ferromagnetic. Finally, it is possible to explain the properties of cerium and ytterbium. 1. In Cerium, the two first levels overlap at the Fermi level, in such a way that the f electron be almost entirely distributed in the first level. 2. In ytterbium, under pressure, the fourteenth level comes across and above the Fermi level. The maximum resistivity is obtained for a half filling of this level. In the third part (§ 4), we attempt to apply this model of virtual bound states to plutonium, although in this metal, the 5f shells have a larger spatial extension than the 4f orbitals in rare earths. Anomalies in several physical properties of plutonium seem to indicate a magnetic transition at about 65° K, but no anomaly shows up in the magnetic susceptibility. Using a virtual bound state model associated with a very small polarization of the 5f states, it is possible to explain all the physical properties of plutonium. This model leads to a very small magnetic moment, that cannot be detected by experiment.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic field can influence photoluminescence, electroluminescence, photocurrent, injection current, and dielectric constant in organic materials, organic–inorganic hybrids, and nanoparticles at room temperature by re-distributing spin populations, generating emerging phenomena including magneto-photoluminescence, magneto-electroluminescence, magneto-photocurrent, magneto-electrical current, and magneto-dielectrics. These so-called intrinsic magnetic field effects (MFEs) can be observed in linear and non-linear regimes under one-photon and two-photon excitations in both low- and high-orbital materials. On the other hand, spin injection can be realized to influence spin-dependent excited states and electrical conduction via organic/ferromagnetic hybrid interface, leading to extrinsic MFEs. In last decades, MFEs have been serving as a unique experimental tool to reveal spin-dependent processes in excited states, electrical transport, and polarization in light-emitting diodes, solar cells, memories, field-effect transistors, and lasing devices. Very recently, they provide critical understanding on the operating mechanisms in advanced organic optoelectronic materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence light-emitting materials, non-fullerene photovoltaic bulk-heterojunctions, and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. While MFEs were initially realized by operating spin states in organic semiconducting materials with delocalized π electrons under negligible orbital momentum, recent studies indicate that MFEs can also be achieved under strong orbital momentum and Rashba effect in light emission, photovoltaics, and dielectric polarization. The transition of MFEs from the spin regime to the orbital regime creates new opportunities to versatilely control light-emitting, photovoltaic, lasing, and dielectric properties by using long-range Coulomb and short-range spin–spin interactions between orbitals. This article reviews recent progress on MFEs with the focus on elucidating fundamental mechanisms to control optical, electrical, optoelectronic, and polarization behaviors via spin-dependent excited states, electrical transport, and dielectric polarization. In this article both representative experimental results and mainstream theoretical models are presented to understand MFEs in the spin and orbital regimes for organic materials, nanoparticles, and organic–inorganic hybrids under linear and non-linear excitation regimes with emphasis on underlying spin-dependent processes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the electron pairing in hole-doped cuprate superconductors has been a challenge, in particular because the \"normal\" state from which it evolves is unprecedented. Now, after three and a half decades of research, involving a wide range of experimental characterizations, it is possible to delineate a clear and consistent cuprate story. It starts with doping holes into a charge-transfer insulator, resulting in in-gap states. These states exhibit a pseudogap resulting from the competition between antiferromagnetic superexchange J between nearest-neighbor Cu atoms (a real-space interaction) and the kinetic energy of the doped holes, which, in the absence of interactions, would lead to extended Bloch-wave states whose occupancy is characterized in reciprocal space. To develop some degree of coherence on cooling, the spin and charge correlations must self-organize in a cooperative fashion. A specific example of resulting emergent order is that of spin and charge stripes, as observed in La2−xBaxCuO4. While stripe order frustrates bulk superconductivity, it nevertheless develops pairing and superconducting order of an unusual character. The antiphase order of the spin stripes decouples them from the charge stripes, which can be viewed as hole-doped, two-leg, spin-12 ladders. Established theory tells us that the pairing scale is comparable to the singlet-triplet excitation energy, ∼J/2, on the ladders. To achieve superconducting order, the pair correlations in neighboring ladders must develop phase order. In the presence of spin stripe order, antiphase Josephson coupling can lead to pair-density-wave superconductivity. Alternatively, in-phase superconductivity requires that the spin stripes have an energy gap, which empirically limits the coherent superconducting gap. Hence, superconducting order in the cuprates involves a compromise between the pairing scale, which is maximized at x∼18, and phase coherence, which is optimized at x∼0.2. To understand further experimental details, it is necessary to take account of the local variation in hole density resulting from dopant disorder and poor screening of long-range Coulomb interactions. At large hole doping, kinetic energy wins out over J, the regions of intertwined spin and charge correlations become sparse, and the superconductivity disappears. While there are a few experimental mysteries that remain to be resolved, I believe that this story captures the essence of the cuprates.",

We begin with a brief discussion of the effects of thermal fluctuations on the spontaneously broken U(1) and translation symmetries, on the global phase diagram and on the critical behaviour. Introducing disorder we restrict ourselves to the experimentally most relevant case of weak uncorrelated randomness which is known to destroy the long-ranged translational order of the Abrikosov lattice in three dimensions. Elucidating possible residual glassy ordered phases, we distinguish betwee positional and phase-coherent vortex glasses. The discussion of elastic vortex glasses, in two and three dimensions occupy the main part of our review. In particular, in three dimensions there exists an elastic vortex-glass phase which still shows quasi-long-range translational order: the `Bragg glass'. It is shown that this phase is stable with respect to the formation of dislocations for intermediate fields. Preliminary results suggest that the Bragg-glass phase may not show phase-coherent vortex-glass order. The latter is expected to occur in systems with weak disorder only in higher dimensions. We further demonstrate that the linear resistivity vanishes in the vortex-glass phase. The vortex-glass transition is studied in detail for a superconducting film in a parallel field. Finally, we review some recent developments concerning driven vortex-line lattices moving in a random environment.",

We start with a historical perspective, as the need for understanding the metallurgy of uranium so that its use as a nuclear fuel in the late 1940s could be optimized led to an increasing number of experiments aimed at exploring the solid-state properties. This was further accelerated when single crystals became available in the 1950s and when the superconductivity of the low-temperature α phase became the subject of controversy in the 1960s. The late 1960s and 1970s saw a considerable effort towards understanding the nature of the 5f electrons around the uranium nucleus. The increasing availability of sophisticated methods in computational physics first showed in the 1970s that the 5f electrons should be treated as itinerant, and the decade ended with the observation (by neutron diffraction) of a subtle periodic lattice distortion at 43 K in the α phase. The observation of this distortion, which is ascribed to a charge-density wave, leads to an explanation for many of the anomalies seen in over 30 years' work on the α phase. The review ends with a description of our current understanding and the problems still outstanding.",

    "abstract": "The d1 layer metals TaS 2 , TaSe 2 , NbSe 2 , in all their various polytypic modifications, acquire, below some appropriate temperature, phase conditions that their electromagnetic properties have previously revealed as 'anomalous'. Our present electron-microscopic studies indicate that this anomalous behaviour usually included the adoption, at some stage, of a superlattice. The size of superlattice adopted often is forecast in the pattern of satellite spotting and strong diffuse scattering found above the transition. Our conclusions are that charge-density waves and their concomitant periodic structural distortions occur in all these 4d 1 /5d 1 dichalcogenides. We have related the observed periodicities of these CDW states to the theoretical form of the parent Fermi surfaces. Particularly for the 1T octahedrally coordinated polytypes the Fermi surface is very simple and markedly two-dimensional in character, with large near-parallel walls. Such a situation is known theoretically to favour the formation of charge and spin-density waves. When they first appear, the CDWs in the 1T (and 4Hb) polytypes are incommensurate with the lattice. This condition produes a fair amount of gapping in the density of states at the Fermi level. For the simplest case of 1T-TaSe 2 , the room temperature superlattice is realized when this existing CDW rotates into an orientation for which it then become commensurate. At this first-order transition the Fermi surface energy gapping increases beyond that generated by the incommensurate CDW, as is clearly evident in the electromagnetic properties. For the trigonal prismatically coordinated polytypes, CDW formation is withheld to low temperatures, probably because of the more complex band structures. This CDW state (in the cases measured) would seem at once commensurate, even though the transition is, from a wide variety of experiments, apparently second order. A wide range of doped and intercalated materials have been used to substantiate the presence of CDWs in these compounds, and to clarify the effect that their occurrence has on the physical properties. The observations further demonstrate the distinctiveness of the transition metal dichalcogenide layer compounds, and of the group VA metals in particular.",

Although the emphasis is put on charge and spin density waves and magnetic domain walls, the theory has also applications to flux lines and lattices thereof, dislocation lines, adsorbed mono-layers and related systems. In the first part we focus on the theory of the collective pinning which includes the equilibrium properties of elastic systems with frozen-in disorder as well as the features close to the dynamic depinning transition enforced by an external driving force and at finite temperatures. Thermal fluctuations smear out this transition and allow for a creep motion of the elastic objects even at small forces. An ac-driving force also destroys the sharp transition which is replaced by a velocity hysteresis. The second part is devoted to the local pinning picture and its applications. Inclusion of plastic deformations results in a rich cross-over behavior of the force-velocity relation as well as of the frequency dependence of the dynamic response. The local pinning recovers and exploits new elements of the energy landscape such as termination points of metastable branches or irreversibility of other ones related to generation of topological defects in the course of sliding. It also gives access to the quantum creep described as a tunneling between retarded and advanced configurations.",

Interest in these systems and Fe/GaAs(001) in particular has increased significantly over the last two decades, largely due to the emergence of the field of magnetoelectronics. Since then numerous studies of molecular beam epitaxy of Fe on GaAs(001) have been carried out, making it by far the best researched Fe/semiconductor(001) system. Issues such as magnetic anisotropy in the ultrathin regime, however, remain controversial with contradictory reports in the literature giving rise to considerable controversy within the field. By carefully scrutinizing the enormous amount of literature published on Fe/GaAs(001) so far and analysing these results within the wider context of Fe/semiconductor(001) systems, this article tries to settle some of these controversial issues, hence providing a long overdue 'common denominator' for research in this area.

Our starting point is the situation in the mid-1980s, characterized by the development of a ‘Kondo scenario’ for the thermodynamic and spectral properties, as described in the review by Allen et al. (1986, Adv. Phys., 35, 275). That picture, based on room-temperature results and on a T = 0 approach to the impurity Anderson Hamiltonian, has been generally confirmed and better defined over the past decade by a number of more elaborate experiments, and by new calculational schemes. The use of high-energy resolution and cryogenic temperatures has led to the direct observation of the characteristic low-energy excitations and has opened the way to stringent tests of the most fundamental aspect of model, namely its scaling properties. Despite the success of the Kondo approach, more work remains to be done. The improved quality of the data has revealed some quantitative discrepancies with the predictions of the model, stressing the need for more realistic theoretical schemes. Moreover, some recent experiments questioning the validity of the model have stirred a fierce controversy within the spectroscopic community. We review those conflicting results and discuss the possible reasons for the discrepancies, and how new experiments could solve the present difficulties.",

We report results for the critical dimensions separating different 'universality classes' and discuss the behaviour of physical quantities such as the momentum distribution function, the single-particle propagator and low-energy response functions in each class. The renormalization group for Fermi systems will be reviewed and applied as a link between microscopic models and effective lowenergy theories. Particular attention is paid to conservation laws, which constrain any effective low-energy theory of interacting Fermi systems. In scattering processes with small momentum transfers the velocity of each scattering particle is (almost) conserved. This asymptotic conservation law leads to non-trivial cancellations of Feynman diagrams and other simplifications, making thus possible a non-perturbative treatment of forward scattering via Ward identities or bosonization techniques.",

The loop algorithm is a Quantum Monte Carlo procedure which employs nonlocal changes of worldline configurations, determined by local stochastic decisions. It is based on a formulation of quantum models of any dimension in an extended ensemble of worldlines and graphs, and is related to Swendsen-Wang algorithms. It can be represented directly on an operator level, both with a continuous imaginary time path integral and with the stochastic series expansion (SSE). It overcomes many of the difficulties of traditional worldline simulations. Autocorrelations are reduced by orders of magnitude. Grand-canonical ensembles, off-diagonal operators, and variance reduced estimators are accessible. In some cases, infinite systems can be simulated. For a restricted class of models, the fermion sign problem can be overcome. Transverse magnetic fields are handled efficiently, in contrast to strong diagonal ones. The method has been applied successfully to a variety of models for spin and charge degrees of freedom, including Heisenberg and XYZ spin models, hard-core bosons, Hubbard, and tJ-models. Due to the improved efficiency, precise calculations of asymptotic behavior and of quantum critical exponents have been possible.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The physics of granular matter is one of the big questions in science. Granular matter serves as a prototype of collective systems far from equilibrium and fundamental questions remain. At the same time, an understanding of granular matter has tremendous practical importance. Among practical problems, granular mixing and its interplay with segregation is arguably at the top of the list in terms of impact. Granular mixing in three-dimensional systems is complicated, as flow induces segregation by particle size or density. Several approaches and points of view for analysis are possible in principle, ranging from continuum to discrete. Flow and segregation in three-dimensional systems is seemingly complicated; however, to a reasonable approximation, all of the dynamics takes place in a thin flowing surface layer. This observation, coupled with key experimental results, leads to a simple, compact and extensible continuum-based dynamical systems framework applicable to time-periodic flow in quasi-two-dimensional tumblers and three-dimensional systems (such as spheres and cubes) rotated about one or more axes of rotation. The case of time-periodic systems, in its simplest version, can be viewed as a mapping of a domain into itself. The placement of periodic points can be investigated using symmetry concepts; the character of the periodic points and associated manifolds provides a skeleton for the flow and a template for segregation processes occurring in the flow.

We begin with a discussion of surface curvature and focus on the role of special surfaces of curvature to show how such surfaces can be defined to eliminate either the coupling of the compressibility and bending terms (neutral surface) or the saddle-splay (Gaussian curvature) modulus. Next, we consider phenomenological models for curvature elasticity and discuss the coupling of the curvature degrees of freedom with other properties of the system such as the packing area and the number of molecules at the interface. The pressure distribution in the film is related to the bending moduli. We then connect the elastic moduli to the physical properties of both solid and liquid thin films with a detailed discussion of the role of solid elasticity (including defects), electrostatic interactions (applicable to polar head groups and chain packing (using a block copolymer model of amphiphilic molecules). Finally, we demonstrate the effects of fluctuations and inhomogeneities in these systems in a discussion of the role of thermal undulations in renormalizing the bending moduli and of mixtures of amphiphiles of different chain lengths in fluid films. The article is concluded with a brief review of experimental characterizations of curvature elasticity in self-assembling systems.",

Particular emphasis is placed on the static magnetization and on the magnetic excitations. The review demonstrates that for a single REAl2 compound a cubic crystalline field (CF) provides an excellent basis for a quantitative description of the magnetization, including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy by using molecular-field theory. This approach is also appropriate in many cases for the magnetic part of the molar specific heat in a temperature range where contributions from spin waves can be neglected. Taking into account the magnetic interactions of different ions within the random-phase approximation, it is also possible in most cases to describe the low-temperature behaviour of the magnetic excitations. In general a consistent description of various other important magnetic properties can also be given. However, it is obvious from the results discussed here that in order to remove the remaining discrepancies between experiment and theory, it is not enough to include, for example, magnetostriction, anisotropic exchange and higher multiplets by retaining at the same time the basic theory. Instead, it is believed that new, and so far undetermined, concepts are needed. By comparing different REAl2 compounds, it is possible to define reduced crystal-field parameters that all have the same sign and order of magnitude. To a lesser degree, such systematic behaviour is also observed for the exchange parameters. But this comparison also clearly shows that more sophisticated treatments than those mentioned above are necessary to obtain a substantial improvement of the systematic description within the isostructural series of REAl2 compounds.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade a lot of efforts have been undertaken to explain the unusual normal state properties of high temperature superconductors (HTS) in the framework of unconventional theories based on strongly interacting electrons, pre-formed Cooper pairs, polaron mechanism of super conductivity etc. A different approach to this problem would be to develop the perturbation theory for interacting electrons in the normal phase of strongly anisotropic superconductors without specifying the origin of this interaction. The Cooper channel of interelectron interaction is equivalent to the superconducting fluctuations which are unusually strong in HTS. We show that the peculiarities of such systems not only lead to the increase of the magnitude but are also frequently responsible for the change of the hierarchy of different fluctuation effects and even of the sign of the total corrections. As a result the fluctuation contributions can manifest themselves in very unusual forms. The first and well known result is that that now one has the 'pre-formed Cooper pairs' automatically, from ab initio calculations: taking into account thermal fluctuations leads to the appearance of a non-zero density of fluctuating Cooper pairs (with finite lifetime) within layers without the establishment of long range order in the system. The fluctuation Cooper pair density decreases with temperature very slowly(∼ln T c/(T - T c) in the 2D case). The formation of these pairs of normal electrons leads to the decrease of the density of one-electron states (DOS renormalization) at the Fermi level, and this turns out to be the key effect in our discussion. The DOS contribution to the most of characteristics is negligible for traditional superconducting materials. However, it becomes dominant when highly anisotropic materials are discussed, and therefore is very important in HTS, especially when transport along the c-axis is considered. We analyse the role of the DOS fluctuations in the properties of HTS and show how, taking into account this effect, many puzzling and long debated properties of HTS materials (such as the steep increase of the electrical resistivity along the c-axis just above T c, the anomalous magnetoresistance, effects of the magnetic field on the resistive transition along the c-axis, the c-axis far infrared absorption spectrum, NMR characteristics around the critical temperature etc.) can be understood leading to a simple, consistent description in terms of the fluctuation theory.",

Measurements of the low-temperature specific heat, thermal conductivity, microwave conductivity, penetration depth and scanning tunnelling microscopy are described, both in the Meissner state and in the mixed state. These results are then compared with the predictions of quasi-classical theory of a d-wave BCS superconductor and the self-consistent T-matrix approximation for both a single impurity and a finite impurity concentration. Detailed inspection reveals that significant discrepancies still exist between experiment and theory, with important implications for the development of a coherent model, perhaps beyond standard perturbation theory.

    "abstract": "Abstract The introduction of 3d transition metals (M) into the van der Waals gaps between the weakly coupled layers of transition metal dichalcogenides TX2 (T:transition metal, X:chalcogen) produces an interesting family of intercalation compounds, M x TX2, the physical properties of which are different from those of the host TX2 matrix because of 'host-guest' interactions. In this article we shall review the salient features of the M x TiS2 family with the simple 1T-CdI2 type layered structure, which have been extensively studied by structural, transport, specific heat and lattice dynamic, magnetic and photoemission spectroscopic measurements. In contrast with the previously reported series of intercalation complexes of the Group V transition metal dichalcogenides, a characteristic of the M x TiS2 materials is strong hybridisation between the guest atom M 3d orbitals and the host Ti 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to changes in the Fermi energy E F of the conduction band, the density of states at E F and various types of magnetic orderings. These properties are understood in terms of an itinerant electron or band picture for the intercalant, rather than a rigid band or localised model. Additional informationNotes on contributorsA.D.

    "abstract": "Abstract Properties of thin superconducting filaments carrying a d.c. electric current are considered. We study first the stability of the normal state in the current-carrying filament. It is shown that the phase transition from the normal into the superconducting or into the resistive state in the presence of a current is a first-order transition. The mechanism of the transition changes when the filament has a non-uniform structure; the normal state of a filament becomes unstable in this case below some critical current dependent on the type of inhomogeneity. We study then the resistive state in thin superconducting filaments. As is well known the usual superconducting state becomes impossible when the current exceeds the so-called Ginzburg-Landau critical current. Instead, either the normal or the so-called resistive state appears in the superconductor. In the resistive state, the mean electric field is non-zero in the superconductor. Nevertheless superconductivity is destroyed only in some separate points in the filament and at some moments of time. These points are known as phase-slip centres. Different physical mechanisms of the resistive state are reviewed. The main attention is paid to the microscopic theory and the dynamics of the resistive state. The current-voltage characteristics of the current-carrying superconducting filaments are calculated on the basis of the non-stationary microscopic theory considered. The voltage steps in current-voltage characteristics due to formation of new phase-slip centres in the superconductor are discussed. The possibility of low-frequency oscillations in the resistive state is briefly discussed. Moreover, we consider a rather simple model which demonstrates that the principle of minimum entropy production can be applied to determine otherwise unknown parameters of the system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract An outline is given of the model for some high-temperature superconductors which assumes that the carriers are holes in the (hybridized) oxygen 2p band and form 'spin polarons' with the moments on the copper atoms. A comparison is made with observations of spin polarons in Gd3-x v x S4 and with the properties of La1-x Sr x VO3 in relation to those of La2-x Sr x CuO4. It is assumed, following several authors, that in the superconductors the polarons form bipolarons, which are bosons, and a comparison is made with some other treatments of this hypothesis. It is proposed that in many such superconductors the boson, essentially a pair of these holes, moves in an impurity band, and that normally all the polarons (fermions) form bipolarons; the fermions repel each other on the same site (positive Hubbard U) but attract when on adjacent sites; the critical temperature T c is then that at which the Bose gas becomes non-degenerate. In such materials a non-degenerate gas of bosons would carry the current above T c as first suggested by Alexandrov et al. (1986). The linear increase in the resistivity above T c is explained on this hypothesis. The effective mass of the bipolaron is, we believe, large (∼20–30m e). The copper 3d9 moments in the superconducting range resonate between their two orientations as a consequence of the motion of the carriers, as they do in the description by Brinkman and Rice (1970) of highly correlated metals. Spin polarons, we believe, form only when this is so, but not in the antiferromagnetic range of x. A discussion is given of the resistivity above T c, thermopower above T c, and of the nature of the superconducting gap as shown by tunnelling. We confine our discussion to the materials containing copper, excluding for instance cubic Ba1-x K x BiO3, and possibly any superconductor containing bismuth, where the bosons may be Bi3+.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent developments in statistical models for fragmentation of brittle material are reviewed. The generic objective of these models is understanding the origin of the fragment size distributions (FSDs) that result from fracturing brittle material. Brittle fragmentation can be divided into two categories: (1) Instantaneous fragmentation for which breakup generations are not distinguishable and (2) continuous fragmentation for which generations of chronological fragment breakups can be identified. This categorization becomes obvious in mining industry applications where instantaneous fragmentation refers to blasting of rock and continuous fragmentation to the consequent crushing and grinding of the blasted rock fragments. A model of unstable cracks and crack-branch merging contains both of the FSDs usually related to instantaneous fragmentation: the scale invariant FSD with the power exponent (2−1/D) and the double exponential FSD which relates to Poisson process fragmentation. The FSDs commonly related to continuous fragmentation are: the lognormal FSD originating from uncorrelated breakup and the power-law FSD which can be modeled as a cascade of breakups. Various solutions to the generic rate equation of continuous fragmentation are briefly listed. Simulations of crushing experiments reveal that both cascade and uncorrelated fragmentations are possible, but that also a mechanism of maximizing packing density related to Apollonian packing may be relevant for slow compressive crushing.

We start by showing how to connect different (spin-particle-gauge) {\\it languages} by means of exact mappings (isomorphisms) that we name {\\it dictionaries} and prove a fundamental theorem establishing when two arbitrary languages can be connected. These mappings serve to unravel symmetries which are hidden in one representation but become manifest in another. In addition, we establish a formal link between seemingly unrelated physical phenomena by changing the language of our model description. This link leads to the idea of {\\it universality} or equivalence. Moreover, we introduce the novel concept of {\\it emergent symmetry} as another symmetry guiding principle. By introducing the notion of {\\it hierarchical languages}, we determine the quantum phase diagram of lattice models (previously unsolved) and unveil hidden order parameters to explore new states of matter. Hierarchical languages also constitute an essential tool to provide a unified description of phases which compete and coexist. Overall, our framework provides a simple and systematic methodology to predict and discover new kinds of orders. Another aspect exploited by the present formalism is the relation between condensed matter and lattice gauge theories through quantum link models. We conclude discussing applications of these dictionaries to the area of quantum information and computation with emphasis in building new models of computation and quantum programming languages.",

The relationship between the observed plasmon energies, the average interband energy gap and the background dielectric constant of the solid is developed. The transmission energy loss spectra of a number of the layer-type transition metal dichalcogenides, MX2, where M=Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Mo and W and X=S and Se, have been measured in the range of 0–50 eV. In the experiments, a beam of 50 keV electrons is incident along the c-axis of the crystals and electrons inelastically scattered through an angle of 1 m radian are selected for energy analysis. This ensures that the momentum transfer and hence the electric vector for the excitations lies in the basal plane of the crystal (E⊥c). Kramers-Kronig analysis has been applied to the energy loss data to deduce the complex dielectric function of each material. From this function, all other ‘optical’ constants, such as the reflectivity, and the oscillator integral function and joint density of states function have been calculated. The results give substantial support to the existing band model for the family of materials and, in addition, provide the basis for a quantitative understanding of the band structure of individual compounds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract Carrier binding and recombination processes at transition metal (TM) and post-transition metal impurities in solids are reviewed. The presence of low-lying empty core orbitals in these impurities introduces novel binding and recombination phenomena and leads naturally to a classification of impurity centres as 'simple' or 'structured'. 'Simple' impurities, generally the main group elements, introduce only effective-mass-like states into the forbidden gap of the host lattice, whereas 'structured' impurities show localized atomic-like transitions below the lattice absorption edge. The fact that donor or acceptor centres generated by TM ions in semiconductors are usually deep is discussed with reference to a simple oxidationstate correlation diagram based on the variable chemical valency characteristic of these ions. Many metal ion impurities in solids generate iso-electronic centres however, and evidence is assembled to show how the normally accepted range of iso-electronic centres can be extended to include such impurities. It is emphasized that the formation of bound states at these 'structured' cationic iso-electronic centres is fairly common, in contrast to the situation normally found for anionic substituents in semiconductors. A possible explanation for this general property of structured iso-electronic centres is given in terms of the low-lying core levels which they may introduce in the band gap and their enhanced polarizability. Simple arguments then suggest that those centres showing electron ionization thresholds or atomic inter-configurational transitions just below E g should be hole-attractive, whereas those showing charge transfer transitions should be electron-attractive. It is shown that two kinds of defect Auger recombination (DAR) may be significant for excitons localized at structured impurities. The first involves hole ionization at a deep neutral acceptor, and the conditions which must be met to make this process significant at room temperature are reviewed. The second DAR process involves the transfer of carrier recombination energy to the core electrons of the structured impurity. A simple model developed for this energy transfer process predicts that the coupling between exciton and core states will be larger if the impurity shows strong, broad dipole-allowed transitions quasi-resonant with the lattice absorption edge. Throughout the paper we stress the importance of recombination processes at structured impurities to the problems of phosphor activation and of shunt recombination mechanisms in semiconductor LEDs. In the final sections this general framework of ideas is used to explain the relative cathodoluminescence efficiencies of different rare-earth activators in crystals of Y3Al5O12, with good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental observations. Possible evidence for the occurrence of bound exciton states at structured TM impurities is found in the appearance of anomalously weak zero-phonon lines in the near-edge luminescence of GaP crystals prepared under special conditions.",

The refractive index at 0·15 eV decreases monotonically with increasing T s, or equivalently, with increasing density, and is 4·13±0·05 eV in the highest density films. The absorption edge is approximately exponential (102⪅α⪅104 cm−1) but shifts monotonically to higher energy and increases in slope with increasing T s. Similarly, the peak in ε2 grows by about 10% and shifts by about 0·15 eV to higher energies, reaching a maximum of about 23 at 2·90±0·05 eV in the high density films. The peak in the transition strength ω2ε2 occurs at 4·2±0·2 eV in all films, but increases in magnitude with increasing T s. The sum rules for n eff(ω) and ε0,eff(ω) are evaluated for ▄ω⪅5 eV and vary monotonically with T s. These trends are neither compatible with Galeener's void resonance theory nor with changes in the oxygen content of the films, determined by the examination of absorption peaks at 0·053 eV and 0·09 eV.

Special emphasis is placed on the recently observed temperature and pressure induced gradual transition between the limiting cases of molecular insulators and ionic melts. At supercritical temperatures salts undergo a continuous transition from an insulating vapour to a highly conducting ionic fluid if the density is increased sufficiently. This transition is due to a shift of the ionization equilibrium between molecules and ions, in favour of the ions, with increasing density. Poorly conducting molten salts and polar substances like water and ammonia also become more ionic, and consequently better conductors, at very high pressures. Recent thermodynamic, magnetic and electrical measurements on liquid alloys which are composed of two metallic elements and which are non-metallic at definite stoichiometric compositions are discussed. Special emphasis is placed on the liquid Cs-Au system which resembles in many respects the molten alkalimetal halides.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermal neutron scattering experiments have provided detailed information on the distributions of magnetic moment in a number of disordered ferromagnet binary alloys. The general features of these distributions together with saturation magnetization data are discussed and compared with various simple theories. Attention is focused on dilute alloy systems. After an introduction the paper is divided into four sections, the first of which deals with alloys which tend to follow the Slater-Pauling curve. Here a simple Thomas-Fermi treatment due to Friedel suggests that magnetic moment changes, largely confined to the minor constituent (solute) sites, should occur with a sign dependent on the nature of the density of states at the Fermi level in the pure major constituent (solvent). Comparison with experiment shows qualitative agreement except in the case of Fe-based alloys containing transition element solutes from the right of Fe in the periodic table. This discrepancy is examined and an explanation put forward. The next section outlines a discussion of the electronic structure of alloys of transition elements with non-transition metal solutes. The view is taken that the electronic configuration of a solute atom is roughly similar to the configuration found in the pure non-transition metal: it follows that no partially filled d orbitals are expected at solute sites. Use of a simple Thomas-Fermi model based on this assumption indicates that some of the electric screening associated with a non-transition metal solute takes place in the surrounding transition metal slovent. Additional electrons introduced in this way into the solvent occupy mainly d states and cause a reduction in magnetic properties. This reduction together with the total loss of d-state effects from the solute sites themselves can account qualitatively for the changes observed in Ni, Pd and Fe-based alloys with non-transition elements. The fourth section deals with the transition metal alloys which show marked departures from Slater-Pauling behaviour, e.g. NiCr. An explanation for these alloys has been provided by Friedel's bound impurity state model and the mechanism suggested by Comly, Holden and Low to account for the similarity in shape of the magnetic disturbances observed in different systems. The final section discusses ferromagnetic alloys of PdFe and PdCo. The giant moments associated with the Fe and Co solutes result from a widespread polarization of the Pd solvent contiguous to the solute atoms. This polarization can be interpreted with the use of a non-local exchange-enhanced susceptibility function for the Pd host. With increasing solute content this function becomes modified to an extent dependent on the shift of d holes from one spin direction to the other, i.e. on the mean polarization of the Pd.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The damage produced by fast neutron irradiation of gallium arsenide has been studied by a number of techniques. The electrical resistivity, which increases with dose at low doses to semi-insulating values, shows a remarkable, specimen-independent decrease for doses greater than 1017 n cm-2 from values of ca. 109 Ω cm to 3 Ω cm for the highest dose of 1.5 × 1020 n cm-2. In this high dose region the temperature dependence of the resistivity at low temperatures is given by exp [b/T 1/4] and it is suggested that in this highly disordered state conduction occurs by tunnel-assisted hopping between defect levels in the band gap. The presence of such levels is indicated by the strong optical absorption tail which is produced from 0.1 eV to the crystalline edge at 1.5 eV. Although at the highest doses the samples contain a high degree of disorder, X-ray diffraction shows that they are basically crystalline. Lattice parameter determinations show that it increases with dose, linearly at first, then tending to saturation for doses above 2 × 1018 n cm-2. The dose dependence of the lattice parameter is the same as that of the integrated optical absorption and both effects may be expected to relate to the total defect concentrations. The existence of small-angle neutron scattering at the highest dose shows that the defects are not uniformly distributed. It is shown that this state is the high dose manifestation of the production of defects by each primary knock-on atom in fairly localized regions. The overlap of the wings of these regions for doses greater than 1017 n cm-2 provides a conducting path and a fairly constant b value with dose, while the resistivity decreases rapidly. The total defect concentration, which is heavily weighted to the central regions of the individually damaged volumes, does not show overlap until a higher dose, as observed for the optical absorption and lattice parameter. Estimates of the total defect concentration have been obtained by measuring the total diffuse neutron scattering as well as from the small-angle scattering results. It is shown that each primary knock-on produces ca. 103 atomic displacements. This means that the amount of damage in gallium arsenide is close to that predicted by radiation damage theory. Measurements of photoconductivity show that the sharp photoconductivity edge is eliminated at quite low doses. At high doses the photoconductivity becomes very small and is much less than in unirradiated samples of similar resistivity. It appears that the ionized state lifetime of photo-induced carriers is very small in the high dose state. The effects anneal more or less completely after heating to 700°C. The hopping conductivity effect anneals between room temperature and 400°C and the remaining electrical effects between 500 and 600°C. The optical effects anneal more or less continuously throughout the temperature range up to 700°C. It is shown that the doses at which the tunnel-assisted hopping sets in are consistent with similar effects recently observed in ion implantation. We suggest that a similar mechanism applies in implanted layers for ion doses greater than 1012–1013 ions cm-2. Density measurements show an expansion identical with the lattice parameter expansion and indicate an expansion of 2.93 Å3 per defect. This is relatively small and is consistent with the tentative conclusion from the neutron-scattering data that the main defect is the close interstitial-vacancy pair in which the strain is minimized by being of opposite sign around each component.",

Les liaisons chimiques et les structures cristallines sont plus complexes que dans les métaux; aussi, les dislocations ne sont pas encore bien décrites ni dans les oxydes binaires (NiO, Cu2O …) ni dans les oxydes ternaires (MgAl2O4…). Ces composés, meˆme purs, contiennent de grandes quantités de défauts ponctuels pouvant provoquer des écarts à la stoechiométrie; une bonne connaissance des concentrations et de la mobilité de défauts est indispensable pour expliquer les propriétés plastiques. Les essais mécaniques habituels sont la flexion et surtout la compression; ils présentent de nombreux inconvénients, en particulier ils conduisent à une déformation hétérogène des éprouvettes. Le but de ces tests est d'établir la loi qui relie la vitesse de déformation aux autres paramètres (contrainte, température …). Une grande quantité de résultats existe et est rassemblée aussi bien pour la déformation à vitesse constante que pour le fluage. Les modèles habituels décrivant la déformation plastique devraient être modifiés pour tenir compte des complications introduites dans les processus élémentaires comme la structure de coeur des dislocations et leur montée, la diffusion dans un composé …. La connaissance de la microstructure issue de la déformation plastique est nécessaire pour identifier le mécanisme déterminant la vitesse de déformation. Outre les techniques traditionnelles (optique, attaque chimique …), la microscopie électronique en transmission est utilisée; elle a permis de découvrir que les dislocations sont dissociées par montée dans les structures spinelles, phénomène qui pourrait se rencontrer dans d'autres oxydes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract According to the theory of Read, closely spaced acceptor sites occur at dangling bonds along dislocations in semiconductors and lead to the formation of space-charge tubes which scatter electrons. In order to test Read's theory, parallel arrays of dislocations have been introduced by plastic bending and extensive electrical and galvanomagnetic measurements have been made on n-type germanium crystals. The experimental results are not in agreement with Read's theory; however, it is shown that Read's basic model is applicable but it must be modified by the assumption of non-specular electron scattering at the edges of the space-charge tubes—the electrical and galvanomagnetic consequences of the theory plus modification are worked out and good agreement with experiments obtained. The following quantities are derived: conductivity (σ), Hall constant (R), and magnetoresistance (MR) for current both parallel (‖) and perpendicular (⊥) to the long axis of the tubes with magnetic field (H) at right angles to the current. The quantities R, σ‖ and σ⊥ were measured versus temperature from 78°K to 300°K and MR was measured at 78°K as a function of the angle between H and the normal to the neutral plane (N). It was found that the variation of the electrical properties in the sample, particularly along the N direction, is so great that to obtain valid data one must use small samples cut from bent crystals; data are presented for whole samples, as well as small samples, in order to illustrate this effect. The dislocation acceptor level in n-type germanium is found to lie at ∼0.50 ev below the conduction band edge. By using the above theory one can determine values of the dislocation density (N) from the result of electrical measurements on semiconductors; this was done in order to determine, on deformed n-type germanium, variations in N from region to region of bent samples as a function of temperature and time of deformation and annealing. In addition, other experiments were performed on plastically bent indium antimonide; it was found that the electrical effects of dislocations, although considerably different from those in germanium, can also be explained by the theory presented here.",

    "abstract": "Abstract New measurements of the surface impedance of superconducting tin and tin-indium alloys at 3 kMc/s, obtained by measuring the bandwidth and characteristic frequency of a resonator containing the specimen, are reported. The results are compared in detail with the microscopic theory, those on the low temperature surface reactance being reduced to values of d.c. penetration depth. At the lowest temperatures the penetration depth, λ, shows slight downward curvature when plotted against y(Τ/ΤC = (1 − ΤC 4)−½ for y<1·2, in contrast to the larger effect predicted by the theory. At higher temperatures the theory overestimates λ by about 5 × 10−7 cm. For samples containing more than 2% indium λ(y) appears to be linear at all temperatures. The slope, dλ/dy, agrees with the predicted values for large y. The low temperature surface resistance follows the usual empirical rule with A(θ) only weakly dependent on purity. A new method of obtaining λ at absolute zero, free from zero error, by analysis of the resistance and reactance data together is presented. The extension of the theory to anisotropic metals is discussed, and applied to the results for pure specimens. Good agreement is found, provided that allowance is made for a rather complex anisotropy of the energy gap, with a total range of about 30%; and a new method of measuring anisotropy of the energy gap is proposed. The simple relations between the Pippard parameters, G 1 and G 2, and the normal state skin depth discovered by Pippard and Fawcett is shown to be essentially accidental. In considering the surface impedance of pure specimens very near T c, it is shown that the coherence length is certainly finite at T c in tin, and a new interpretation is given for the results of Williams on pure aluminium near T c. Finally, the small disagreements between experiment and theory are analysed, and ascribed to a slightly wrong form for the energy gap as a function of temperature used by the theory; it is suggested that this itself may be explained if different pieces of the Fermi surface have different energy gaps in tin. The general conclusion is that, if modified to allow for the anisotropy of the Fermi surface and the energy gap, the theory is very successful when applied to the known data on tin at frequencies up to 40 kMc/s.",

A theory is proposed in which electronic breakdown is caused by local chance events, such as a succession of avalanches at one spot. Successive avalanches sustain the growth of space charges, the local cathode field, and the avalanche rate. When the cathode field becomes large enough to make continuation of avalanching a certainty, instability with current runaway arises, causing breakdown. According to theory, breakdowns occur over a range of fields, their chance increasing very strongly with field; the breakdowns occur randomly in space and in time; the time to instability on a breakdown event decreases as some exponential function of increasing field; the breakdown field can both increase and decrease with temperature; it may be electrode dependent, and it decreases first rapidly and then more slowly with increasing film thickness. Observations made in a number of insulating films support the proposed theory.",

    "abstract": "Summary Summary It is now accepted that the appearance of slip bands on the surface of a plastically deformed metal is evidence that the deformation is not homogeneous but is concentrated on relatively few atomic planes. Recent microscopical experiments have suggested that this conclusion is only valid in the later stages of deformation and that the first fractional per cent of strain is much more nearly homogeneous. Theories to account for both these stages of deformation are examined in the light of microscopical evidence. The validity of conclusions about internal processes based on experiments on the surface is discussed; it is shown that the surface finish affects not only the appearance of internal processes but also the processes themselves. In cases where the deformation is not homogeneous the balance of evidence is that it is also not continuous in time: instead, slip on an active slip plane tends to a limit which is reached either gradually or suddenly depending on the nature of the metal and the conditions of stress. The same processes which stop slip on the active planes produce general hardening of the metal. However, slip can restart on or near to former slip planes as a result of mechanisms activated by temperature and stress, and can, in favourable cases, continue until fracture. Therefore slip bands, the sources of hardening, are also places of weakness.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large-scale connectivity and synchronization are crucial to the structure, function and failure of many complex socio-technical networks. Thus, there is great interest in analyzing phase transitions to large-scale connectivity and to global synchronization, including how to enhance or delay the onset. These phenomena are traditionally studied as second-order phase transitions where, at the critical threshold, the order parameter increases rapidly but continuously. In 2009, an extremely abrupt transition was found for a network growth process where links compete for addition in attempt to delay percolation. This observation of \"explosive percolation\" was ultimately revealed to be a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit, yet with very atypical finite-size scaling, and it started a surge of work on explosive phenomena and their consequences. Many related models are now shown to yield discontinuous percolation transitions and even hybrid transitions. Explosive percolation enables many other features such as multiple giant components, modular structures, discrete scale invariance and non-self-averaging, relating to properties found in many real phenomena such as explosive epidemics, electric breakdowns and the emergence of molecular life. Models of explosive synchronization provide an analytic framework for the dynamics of abrupt transitions and reveal the interplay between the distribution in natural frequencies and the network structure, with applications ranging from epileptic seizures to waking from anesthesia. Here we review the vast literature on explosive phenomena and synthesize the fundamental connections between models and survey the application areas. We attempt to classify explosive phenomena based on underlying mechanisms and to provide a coherent overview and perspective for future research to address the many vital questions that remained unanswered.",

No doubt the remarkable development since the war of the airborne magnetometer or fluxgate and the use in consequence now made of magnetic surveys will soon need to draw upon the increasing knowledge of the fundamental magnetic properties of rocks. Also the permanent magnetization of rocks varying in direction and intensity between strata will be an important assistance in the work of the geologist. However this review is solely concerned with the application of rock magnetism to the extension of our knowledge of the physical properties of the earth throughout geological time. An important stage in the development of our understanding of rock magnetism was the publication by Koenigsberger (1938) of an extensive review of work done up to that date in the field. Recently Nagata (1953) has reviewed very fully many aspects of the subject, particularly the method by which igneous rocks become magnetized and the physical properties of the iron oxide minerals responsible for the magnetization. This review will therefore be restricted mainly to the discussion of developments since Nagata's important book.",

Since the first experimental demonstration of atomic self-ordering in a system composed of a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a quantized electromagnetic mode of a high-$Q$ optical cavity, the field has rapidly evolved over the past decade. The composite quantum-gas--cavity systems offer the opportunity to implement, simulate, and experimentally test fundamental solid-state Hamiltonians, as well as to realize non-equilibrium many-body phenomena beyond conventional condensed-matter scenarios. This hinges on the unique possibility to design and control in open quantum environments photon-induced tunable-range interaction potentials for the atoms using tailored pump lasers and dynamic cavity fields. Notable examples range from Hubbard-like models with long-range interactions exhibiting a lattice-supersolid phase, over emergent magnetic orderings and quasicrystalline symmetries, to the appearance of dynamic gauge potentials and non-equilibrium topological phases. Experiments have managed to load spin-polarized as well as spinful quantum gases into various cavity geometries and engineer versatile tunable-range atomic interactions. This led to the experimental observation of spontaneous discrete and continuous symmetry breaking with the appearance of soft-modes as well as supersolidity, density and spin self-ordering, dynamic spin-orbit coupling, and non-equilibrium dynamical self-ordered phases among others. In addition, quantum-gas--cavity setups offer new platforms for quantum-enhanced measurements. In this review, starting from an introduction to basic models, we pedagogically summarize a broad range of theoretical developments and put them in perspective with the current and near future state-of-art experiments.",

Numerous theoretical and empirical approaches are briefly described. Strong emphasis is placed on the accuracy and limitations of the thermodynamic information which are used as input to many of if not all these theories. It is shown that, by using accurate thermodynamic bulk properties for these liquids including polar polymers, one can use a simple corresponding states principle to describe the temperature and molecular weight dependences of the surface tension with no adjustable parameters to within a few per cent, even though the actual surface tensions may vary by a few hundred per cent. Any small inaccuracies in the predictions arise from conformational entropic effects or because one cannot accurately compute the 'real' cohesive energy density of a polymer liquid from thermodynamic properties alone. The results of recent measurements on high molecular weight polymers are compared with previous work on lower molecular weight liquids. We use the polyethylene and polytetrafluoroethylene oligomeric series to illustrate the uses and limitations of thermodynamicdata for the prediction of surfacetension. The temperature and molecular weightdependences of the surface tensions of these polymers are dominated by the dependence of the bulk thermodynamic properties on temperature and molecular weight. Limited discussion is also given to studies of copolymers and blends using surface tension and complementary techniques.",

Within each subgroup particular compounds are further characterized as donor-donor, donor-acceptor and acceptor-acceptor. The preparation methods used to synthesize the materials addressed are briefly discussed as are the relevant chemical properties. The emphasis of this review is on the physics of TGICs and in particular the consequences of low-dimensionality. We show that, unlike binary graphite intercalation compounds, TGICs can be prepared with a broad range of compositions at constant stage. This feature and the enhanced interplanar and intraplanar structural variety exhibited by TGICs have stimulated a host of investigations which have extended our understanding not only of GICs but also of low-dimensional physics in general.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The rapid advance in molecular biology and nanotechnology opens up the possibility to explore the interface between biology and electronics at the single-molecule level. We focus on the organization of molecular electronic circuits. Interconnecting an immense number of molecular devices into a functional circuit and constructing a framework for integrated molecular electronics requires new concepts. A promising avenue relies on bottom-up assembly where the information for the circuit connectivity and functionality is embedded in the molecular building blocks. Biology can provide concepts and mechanisms for advancing this approach, but there is no straightforward way to apply them to electronics since biological molecules are essentially electrically insulating. Bridging the chasm between biology and electronics therefore presents great challenges. Circuit organization on the molecular scale is considered and contrasted with the levels of organization presented by the living world. The discussion then focuses on our proposal to harness DNA and molecular biology to construct the scaffold for integrated molecular electronics. DNA metallization is used to convert the DNA scaffold into a conductive one. We present the framework of sequence-specific molecular lithography based on the biological mechanism of homologous genetic recombination and carried out by the bacterial protein RecA. Molecular lithography enables us to use the information encoded in the scaffold DNA molecules for directing the construction of an electronic circuit. We show that it can lead all the way from DNA molecules to working transistors in a test-tube. Carbon nanotubes are incorporated as the active electronic components in the DNA-templated transistors. Our approach can, in principle, be applied to the fabrication of larger-scale electronic circuits. The realization of complex DNA-based circuits will, however, require new concepts and additional biological machinery allowing, for example, feedback from the electronic functionality to direct the assembly process and adaptation mechanisms.

It is argued that the term T 2 in the resistivity arises from the Coulomb interaction of electrons. The BCS model gives a satisfactory description of superconductivity near T c but it seems to fail in the region T ≪ T c in high-T c compounds such as βH-(ET)2I3 and β-(ET)2AuI2.

    "abstract": "We review the present state of understanding of the Barkhausen effect in soft ferromagnetic materials. Barkhausen noise (BN) is generated by the discontinuous motion of magnetic domains as they interact with impurities and defects. BN is one of the many examples of crackling noise, arising in a variety of contexts with remarkably similar features, and occurring when a system responds in a jerky manner to a smooth external forcing. Among all crackling system, we focus on BN, where a complete and consistent picture emerges thanks to an exactly solvable model of avalanche dynamics, known as the ABBM model, which ultimately describes the system in terms of a Langevin equation for the velocity of the avalanche front. Despite its simplicity, the ABBM model is able to accurately reproduce the phenomenology observed in the experiments on a large class of magnetic materials, as long as universal properties are involved. To complete the picture and to understand the long-standing discrepancy between the ABBM theory and the experiments, which otherwise agree exceptionally well, consisting of the puzzling asymmetric shape of the noise pulses, microscopic details must be taken into account, namely the effects of eddy current retardation. These effects can be incorporated in the model, and result, to a first-order approximation, in a negative effective mass associated with the wall. The progress made in understanding BN is potentially relevant for other crackling systems: on the one hand, the ABBM model turns out to be a paradigmatic model for the universal behaviour of avalanche dynamics; on the other hand, the microscopic explanation of the asymmetry in the noise pulses suggests that inertial effects may also be at the origin of pulses asymmetry observed in other crackling systems.",

    "abstract": "For nearly half a century the supersolid phase of matter has remained mysterious, not only eluding experimental observation, but also generating a great deal of controversy among theorists. Recent discovery of what is interpreted as a non-classical moment of inertia at low temperature in solid He-4 has elicited much excitement as a possible first observation of a supersolid phase. In the two years following the discovery, however, more puzzles than answers have been provided to the fundamental issue of whether the supersolid phase exists, in helium or any other naturally occurring condensed matter system. Presently, there is no established theoretical framework to understand the body of experimental data on He-4. Different microscopic mechanisms that have been suggested to underlie superfluidity in a perfect quantum crystal do not seem viable for \\he4, for which a wealth of experimental and theoretical evidence points to an insulating crystalline ground state. This perspective addresses some of the outstanding problems with the interpretation of recent experimental observations of the apparent superfluid response in He-4 (seen now by several groups) and discusses various scenarios alternative to the homogeneous supersolid phase, such as superfluidity induced by extended defects of the crystalline structure which include grain boundaries, dislocations, anisotropic stresses, etc. Can a metastable superfluid \"glassy\" phase exist, and can it be relevant to some of the experimental observations ? One of the most interesting and unsolved fundamental questions is what interatomic potentials, given the freedom to design one, can support an ideal supersolid phase in continuous space, and can they be found in Nature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scattering of charged particles is accompanied by the emission of soft photons. Handel's theory of 1/f noise, based on the infrared quasi-divergent coupling of the system to the electromagnetic field, indicates that the current associated with a beam of scattered particles will exhibit 1/f noise. His derivation is valid in a vacuum. Here we extend his results and obtain the fluctuation spectrum for the fluctuations in cross-section and for the scattering rates w kk′ in k-space, using the Born approximation. Next we consider mobility fluctuations due to these scattering rates, employing the relaxation time solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation, valid in non-degenerate semiconductors. Explicit results are obtained for the mobility-fluctuation noise caused by ionized impurity scattering, acoustic phonon scattering, optical phonon scattering, polar optical phonon scattering, and intervalley scattering. We derive Hooge's law, and the Hooge parameters for the above-mentioned processes are obtained in detail. This is then applied to n-type silicon and n-type gallium arsenide; the overall Hooge parameter, which is a weighted average of the partial α-parameters, is computed as a function of temperature and compared with experiment. For silicon, good agreement is obtained with available data. As a byproduct we also find the mobilities as function of temperature for these materials. Excellent agreement with the well-known experimental data is observed. We still note that this is the first theoretical derivation of Hooge's law and that the magnitude of the noise is obtained in detail without adjustable parameters. We believe that quantum 1/f noise gives the limiting value of 1/f noise that can be observed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transport properties of electrons in energy band tails of disordered semiconductors are studied experimentally using a material system in which (i) the width and shape of the band-tail are approximately known and (ii) the Fermi energy is controllable. The material is heavily-doped, closely-compensated, crystalline n-GaAs whose compensation ratio can be made arbitrarily close to unity by the use of two techniques that are described in detail. This control of the Fermi level through compensation permits the measurement of the transport properties of electrons at various energies in the band-tail. Using band tails having a width of ∼50 meV, measurements have been made of the temperature dependence of the d.c. conductivity and Hall coefficient, the frequency dependence of the a.c. conductivity and the electric field dependence of the d.c. conductivity (the last two at low temperatures). The evidence demonstrates the progressively greater localization of states deeper in the tails. No sign is found of a sharp mobility edge. There is a number of close similarities to the properties of amorphous semiconductors but some significant differences. The frequency dependence of the a.c. conductivity at low temperatures is essentially identical with that of amorphous semiconductors in accord with the general interpretation that conductivity at low temperatures takes place by electron hopping among localized states near the Fermi energy. The detailed temperature dependence of the d.c. conductivity at low temperatures is log σ=σ 0 exp [−(T 0/T)1/2], thus disagreeing with a theoretical expectation that the exponent for low temperature hopping conduction should be 1/4. At low temperatures, the electric field dependence of the conductivity shows a variation as σ∼exp (bF/T) over a considerable range extending down to field strengths close to 1 V/cm. This closely resembles recent observations on amorphous semiconductors but the range of field strengths here is lower by several orders of magnitude.",

Its main aim is to trace the close relation between transport and localization. To this end the physical basis of three important localization models is discussed and the predicted transport mechanisms are reviewed in the light of the experimental information. After a brief summary of the experimental methods, the first subject is the localization arising from strong electron-phonon interaction. Here we consider in some detail the formation of a small polaron in a molecular crystal and its transport by phonon-assisted intermolecular hopping. The second part of the paper deals with the localization of an electron in a so-called electronic bubble, which occurs for example in simple liquids such as Ne or He. The stability and transport of this entity is discussed. The third section is devoted to non-crystalline solids. In these localization is associated with the lack of long-range order and does not depend on phonon interaction. The transport through the various parts of the density of states spectrum is summarized and the suggested models are reviewed on the basis of recent experimental work on amorphous silicon. Finally, the possibility of polaron formation and transport in some chalcogenide alloy glasses is briefly considered. The paper leads to the conclusion that available experimental evidence supports the general validity of the above three models, although it must be emphasized that this is based on an as yet limited range of experimental information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Significant evidence linking changes in the macroscopic properties of semiconductors with recombination processes associated with injection current components has accumulated during the past 15 years or so. These effects play a critical role in performance degradation for many semiconductor devices. In this paper we review the developments in understanding of this effect. We concentrate on some very recent detailed studies which provide convincing evidence that carrier capture or recombination processes at deep traps can induce or enhance dissociation and/or migration of the defect or impurity centres which produce them. Thus, the 'phonon-kick' mechanism invoked to explain the early macroscopic property changes has now received strong support. We show that the new findings provide a hierarchy of increasingly detailed information on the properties of traps which may show this effect, now termed a recombination enhanced (or induced) defect reaction (REDR). Carrier capture or recombination at these traps must be predominantly non-radiative, to provide the rapid, large evolution of localized vibrational energy necessary for the effect. Deep level transient capacitance spectroscopy has located such energy levels, particularly in irradiated GaAs and GaP, and has clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of the concentration of the relevant centres to electron-hole recombination processes. The resultant defect motility can improve the minority carrier lifetime, particularly adjacent to dislocations which act as sinks for these defects. The defect capture can also induce the type of dislocation climb which is a key feature in the degradation of semiconductor lamps. Direct evidence for these effects has been obtained very recently by electron microscopy, which has also shown the coalescence into small loops and precipitates of defects left behind climbing dislocations in degraded material without prior radiation damage. We show that luminescence spectroscopy has also recently provided evidence for the dissociation of complex radiative centres under REDR, for example the familiar Zn-O activator in red GaP LEDs and an H-related centre which is luminescent in several polytypes of H-implanted SiC. The dissociation and hence the luminescence can be largely restored by annealing in both examples. We discuss the properties of the H-related spectra which provide uniquely specific evidence for the vulnerability of this centre to dissociation under REDR, even at the lowest temperature. We also give recent evidence that a complex Zn-related luminescent centre can be formed by REDR in irradiated GaP. Finally, we review a recent theoretical description of REDR which assumes quasi-equilibrium for the energy liberated locally at the centre. We note that an adiabatic model may be more appropriate for those centres where the reactions are not enhanced thermal processes but rather are induced athermally.",

Using free boundaries the finite size scaling theory is tested and surface properties are derived, while the periodic boundary condition or the effective field-like 'self-consistent' boundary condition are used to derive bulk critical properties. Since Monte Carlo averages can be interpreted as time averages of a stochastic model, 'critical slowing down of convergence' occurs. The critical dynamics is investigated in the case of the single spin-flip kinetic Ising model. Also non-equilibrium relaxation processes are treated, e.g. switching on small negative fields the magnetization reversal and nucleation processes are studied.

It is noted that for Cu a contribution of additional terms besides that given by Eshelby appears in the angular dependence of dilatation for the triple double force but for Al the dilatation is in close agreement with Eshelby's result. The elastic interaction energies of two triple double force interstitials and of two single double force interstitials with no moment are calculated. The calculated stresses are accurate to about 15 and 8% of their value for Cu and Al, respectively. Fifteen terms for Cu and six terms for Al were used in the series for stresses. Better accuracy could be obtained by including higher order terms in the expansions.",

Diffraction data are used to demonstrate that a law of corresponding states exists, at the melting point, for simple liquids, metals and insulators. The molecular dynamic calculations of sodium are also used to demonstrate that some time dependent correlation functions may be more sensitive to the form of the pair potential than the structure factor is to the potential. Some analysis is also made of the role of structure in the electrical resistivity.

    "abstract": "The random first-order transition theory of the structural glass transition is reviewed in a pedagogical fashion. The rigidity that emerges in crystals and glassy liquids is of the same fundamental origin. In both cases, it corresponds with a breaking of the translational symmetry; analogies with freezing transitions in spin systems can also be made. The common aspect of these seemingly distinct phenomena is a spontaneous emergence of the molecular field, a venerable and well-understood concept. In crucial distinction from periodic crystallisation, the free energy landscape of a glassy liquid is vastly degenerate, which gives rise to new length and time scales while rendering the emergence of rigidity gradual. We obviate the standard notion that to be mechanically stable a structure must be essentially unique; instead, we show that bulk degeneracy is perfectly allowed but should not exceed a certain value. The present microscopic description thus explains both crystallisation and the emergence of the landscape regime followed by vitrification in a unified, thermodynamics-rooted fashion. The article contains a self-contained exposition of the basics of the classical density functional theory and liquid theory, which are subsequently used to quantitatively estimate, without using adjustable parameters, the key attributes of glassy liquids, viz., the relaxation barriers, glass transition temperature, and cooperativity size. These results are then used to quantitatively discuss many diverse glassy phenomena, including the intrinsic connection between the excess liquid entropy and relaxation rates, the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of α-relaxation, the dynamic heterogeneity, violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, glass ageing and rejuvenation, rheological and mechanical anomalies, super-stable glasses, enhanced crystallisation near the glass transition, the excess heat capacity and phonon scattering at cryogenic temperatures, the Boson peak and plateau in thermal conductivity, and the puzzling midgap electronic states in amorphous chalcogenides.",

Transitions from a normal to a condensed phase are characterized by the spontaneous appearance of long-range order and (in the presence of a suitable infinitesimal external field) broken symmetry. This is illustrated by the ferromagnetic, solid, superconducting and spindensity wave ground states. The phenomenon is explained qualitatively as caused by the creation of a long-range internal field, F, due to the interactions between particles. This field establishes long-range order in the system, and is in turn itself established by the long-range order, in a self-consistent fashion. The mechanism here is expressed quantitatively in terms of a self-consistent Dyson equation relating a generalized matrix propagator, G, to a proper self-energy matrix, Σ. The off-diagonal elements of G describe ‘anomalous’ propagation processes which are characteristic for the condensed phase, and they yield directly the long-range order parameters. The Σ-matrix is just the potential of the internal field. The method is illustrated by applying it to the ferromagnetic phase of a system with δ-function interaction between particles. Finally, the technique is used to derive the vertex part equation for the transition point.",

A robust, 'beyond local-density approximation' framework for obtaining wide-ranging properties of the cuprates via a GW-approximation based self-consistent self-energy correction for incorporating correlation effects is delineated. In this way, doping- and temperature-dependent spectra, from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metal, in the normal as well as the superconducting state, with features of both weak and strong coupling can be modeled in a material-specific manner with very few parameters. Efficacy of the model is shown by considering available spectroscopic data on electron- and hole-doped cuprates from angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, neutron scattering, inelastic light scattering, optical and other experiments. Generalizations to treat systems with multiple correlated bands such as the heavy-fermions, the ruthenates and the actinides are discussed.",

For a given solid, the independent thermal expansion coefficients α⊥ and α‖ are conveniently compared at low temperatures by plotting α⊥/T 3 and α‖/T 3 against T. The plots show clearly how contraction in one principal symmetry direction ensues from rapid expansion in the other direction. The Grüneisen functions γ⊥ and γ‖ are discussed for each solid using data from lattice-dynamical models and neutron-diffraction measurements. They show how features of the individual thermal expansions arise from a combination of vibrational, elastic and electronic effects. For these solids and for zirconium, titanium, yttrium and thallium the larger of γ⊥ and γ‖ at high temperatures is that referring to strains in the direction of the stronger forces (judged from the axial ratio). At lower temperatures the inequality reverses, except for tin, implying that the highest normal-mode frequencies depend most strongly on strain in the direction of the stronger forces. More experimental studies of thermal expansion at the lowest temperatures are desirable, as well as more second and third-order elastic constant data. Theoretical work is needed on realistic lattice models applicable to non-cubic metals.",

We then discuss the evidence from colloid experiments in favor of various theories of glass formation that has accumulated over the last two decades. In the next section, we expound on the recent paradigm shift in colloid experiments from an exploratory approach to a critical one aimed at distinguishing between predictions of competing frameworks. We demonstrate how this critical approach is aided by the discovery of novel dynamical crossovers within the range accessible to colloid experiments. We also highlight the impact of alternate routes to glass formation such as random pinning, trajectory space phase transitions and replica coupling on current and future research on the glass transition. We conclude our review by listing some key open challenges in glass physics such as the comparison of growing static length scales and the preparation of ultrastable glasses that can be addressed using colloid experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The evidence for vacancy-pair formation in alkali halide crystals is reviewed. Existing information on the dielectric properties and structure of thin films is discussed with a view to using the high defect concentrations in vacuum-deposited films to confirm vacancy-pair orientation effects. Experimental measurements of the dielectric constant and dissipation factor of evaporated films have been made at room temperature over a range of frequencies from 100 c.p.s. to 100 kc/s. Even under vacuum these films show pronounced losses at low frequencies which are attributed to excess vacancy concentrations. Such losses are contrary to the theory of ideal lattices and are not shown by single crystals. In spite of the excess defect concentrations no evidence of vacancy-pair orientation has been found. Ageing effects have been observed in all cases, the losses decreasing with time as the defect concentration decreases. In the alkali halides the magnitude of the losses depends on the cation mobility but they decrease at a rate determined by the anion mobility. This leads to a proposed dielectric relaxation mechanism in which individual crystallites form the polarizable units, becoming polarized by migration of the cation vacancies towards one end. The losses decrease as the defects are gradually eliminated by simultaneous condensation of positive and negative vacancies at grain boundaries. This is essential to maintain electrical neutrality and the rate is determined by the diffusion of the slower anion vacancies. The measured rates are in agreement with anion activation energies obtained by tracer methods. These results cannot be explained by vacancy-pair formation even if it is assumed that vacancy pairs can form but are incapable of orientation and hence we must conclude that there is little or no vacancy-pair formation. Measurements at atmospheric pressure show that moisture has a pronounced effect in all cases, producing dielectric losses which completely obscure the vacancy effects. The changes in dielectric properties during and after adsorption cannot be explained as conductivity effects and are in complete opposition to any modification of the Maxwell-Wagner theory. The ageing effects show that after the initial adsorption, the water molecules migrate over crystallite surfaces to positions where they are more strongly bound and contribute to the dielectric polarization by a form of hindered rotation closely analogous to mechanisms proposed for ice. At these equilibrium sites, H-bonds are frequently formed between the adsorbed molecules and the halide ions of the crystal lattice.",

In this review, we give a broad overview over classical DDFT. We explain its theoretical foundations and the ways in which it can be derived. The relations between the different forms of deterministic and stochastic DDFT as well as between DDFT and related theories, such as quantum-mechanical time-dependent DFT, mode coupling theory, and phase field crystal models, are clarified. Moreover, we discuss the wide spectrum of extensions of DDFT, which covers methods with additional order parameters (like extended DDFT), exact approaches (like power functional theory), and systems with more complex dynamics (like active matter). Finally, the large variety of applications, ranging from fluid mechanics and polymer physics to solidification, pattern formation, biophysics, and electrochemistry, is presented.",

The total heat transport through the metal, however, may be the sum of the heat carried by the electrons and the phonons; hence the total heat conductivity is the sum of the conductivities of the phonons and the electrons. The chapter limits to the methods that have been used satisfactorily in experiments. From the practical point of view it is not possible, in general, to measure the thermal conductivity of a specimen with accuracy greater than 1%. The exception to this occurs for a metal in the superconducting state where, as are described, nearly all the heat is carried by the phonons at very low temperatures. Hence, the heat transport that is measured is because of lattice conduction. Qualitatively, the thermal conductivity of pure annealed metals agrees with the theoretical description that has been outlined.",

We review several methods to obtain such equations, and discuss applications to the dynamics of order–disorder transitions, spinodal decomposition, and dendritic growth in the isothermal or chemical model. In the case of dendritic growth we show that the mean-field kinetic equations are equivalent to standard continuum equations for this problem and derive expressions for macroscopic quantities, e.g. the surface tension and kinetic coefficients, as functions of the microscopic order parameters. In spinodal decomposition, we focus our attention on the vacancy mechanism, which is a more faithful picture of diffusion in solids than the more widely examined exchange mechanism. We study the interfaces between an unstable mixture and a stable 'vapour' phase, and analyse surface modes that lead to specific surface patterns. For order–disorder transitions, studied in the framework of a repulsive two-sublattice model, we derive sets of coupled equations for the mean concentration (a conserved quantity) and for the occupational difference between the two sublattices emerging from the symmetry breaking due to ordering (non-conserved order parameter). These equations are applied to transport in the presence of ordered domains. Finally, we discuss the possibilities of improving the simple mean-field approximation by density functional theories and various forms of the dynamic pair approximation, including the path-probability method.",

Its role in studying many-body effects in metals is less familiar, even though the influence of such interactions is well known. We present a general field-theoretic approach to this problem which shows that the paradigm for understanding the influence of many-body interactions in the dHvA effect should be shifted from the intuitively reasonable but potentially misleading arguments based on the electron self-energy on the real energy axis to an analysis of the self-energy along the imaginary energy axis. When viewed in this way, the dHvA effect assumes the role of a many-body self-energy filter in which the real part of the self-energy renormalizes the dHvA frequency while the imaginary part renormalizes independently the dHvA amplitude. We obtain a general theory for the dHvA effect in an interacting system which preserves the structure of the original non-interacting theory of Lifshitz and Kosevich. We then apply this extended Lifshitz-Kosevich theory to the analysis of several problems of interest, including electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, heavy fermions and type II superconductors.",

The process is practically important and attracts much interest, in particular in two-dimensional (2D) polycrystals because of the growing technological importance of thin polycrystalline films. In the present paper we discuss various approaches to normal grain growth in 2D polycrystals. We stay mostly within the framework of the uniform boundary model. This model provides a reasonable simplification leading to the Von Neumann-Mullins relation that relates the rate of growth of an individual grain to its local topology. Comparing different approaches—relatively simple mean-field theories, more sophisticated models incorporating real topology, and computer simulations adequately reproducing local equations of motion—we identify the principal factors responsible for different features of the phenomenon.",

The equilibrium properties of the vortex lattice are described and the generalized driving force in gradients of temperature and field is derived using irreversible thermodynamics. This leads to expressions for thermal cross effects which can include pinning forces. The field distributions which occur in a range of situations are derived and a number of useful solutions of the critical state given. In particular, the distribution in a longitudinal field is obtained, and the conditions under which force-free configurations can break down by the cutting of vortices discussed. The effects of lattice rigidity on the summation of pinning forces is considered and it is shown that a summation based on statistical arguments uses the same approximations and leads to the same results as a dissipation argument. Theoretical expressions are derived for the vortex pinning interaction to a number of different metallurgical defects. The theoretical models are compared critically with experimental measurements of pinning forces and other related phenomena, such as flux creep, low amplitude vortex oscillations and vortex lattice defect effects. Finally, the implications for technological materials are assessed.",

For galaxies well described by our model, the dominant morphological feature, the presence of spiral arms, is a consequence of the proximity to the second-order phase transition associated with the percolation threshold. We present an introduction to the astrophysical problem we are investigating and an analysis of the directed percolation problem, called stochastic self-propagating star formation, that controls star formation. We also describe a simulation of the galactic evolution problem in terms of a cellular automaton that provides a representation of the percolation process of interest in an astrophysical environment. Lastly, we provide a number of examples of how the model gives a good account of much of the observed nature of spiral galaxies.",

    "abstract": "Since 1986, most of the interest in superconductivity became focused on high-T c cuprates. The discovery of the superconducting quaternary borocarbide system Y–Ni–B–C with T c as high as ∼12 K inspired research into intermetallic superconductors (IMS) once again. Several reasons can be attributed to this revival of interest in IMS: (i) In the tetragonal quaternary magnetic superconductors RNi2B2C, superconductivity and magnetism occur with T c and T N ∼ 10 K, thereby allowing studies of exotic phenomena associated with, and arising from, the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism. (ii) High T N's and a variety of commensurate and incommensurate magnetic structures in RNi2B2C (Fermi surface nesting playing a central role) strongly suggest that R-spins are coupled via the RKKY-exchange interaction. Hence, unlike in most other magnetic superconductors known so far, conduction electrons take part in superconductivity and magnetism. (iii) Quaternary borocarbides open up new pathways to try and synthesize multicomponent intermetallic superconductors. Their remarkable intrinsic superconducting and magnetic properties and the availability of high quality samples (bulk polycrystalline, large single crystals and thin films) make RNi2B2C particularly special to investigate. Several unusual phenomena have been reported, such as, to name a few, dramatic phonon mode softening at T c, H c2(T) exhibiting a positive curvature near T c and a four-fold anisotropy in the basal plane; a variety of exceptional and fascinating flux line lattice (FLL) related effects — FLL-symmetry transformations and alignments with the underlying crystal lattice as a function of applied field (manifestation of nonlocal electrodynamics despite high κ ∼ 10, and thermal fluctuation effects even though T c, ∼ 16 K, is not too high) and a four-fold symmetric star-shaped (in real space) vortex core. RNi2B2C are strong coupling s-wave BCS superconductors and, remarkably, have a superconducting gap with extreme anisotropy. Strong experimental evidence shows that the four-fold symmetric superconducting gap has point nodes along the 100 Carter, S, Batlogg, B, Cava, R, Krajewski, J, Peck, W Jr and Takagi, H. 1994. Phys. Rev. B, 50: 4216[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]- and 10 Baltensperger, W and Strässler, S. 1963. Phys. Kondens Materie, 1: 20 [Google Scholar]-directions, a feature that has been shown consistent with (s + g)-Cooper pairing. An energy gap with such strong anisotropy is unusual for an s-wave superconductor and, hence, calls for a pairing mechanism different from conventional electron–phonon coupling. Antiferromagnetic fluctuations possibly play an important role in the mechanism. Magnetic superconductors RNi2B2C (R = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm) reveal several phenomena, not observed earlier, associated with the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism. Microscopic evidence (via square FLL interacting with magnetism) of the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity; intrinsic FLL-pinning by magnetic ions; weak ferromagnetism (local moment) coexisting with superconductivity (down to the lowest temperature) and the spontaneous vortex phase (ErNi2B2C); superconductivity setting in an already magnetically ordered lattice (DyNi2B2C) and pair-breaking by nonmagnetic ions in such materials; rich and complex magnetic structures and double (nearly) re-entrant superconductivity (HoNi2B2C) and changes in the FLL-symmetry in the vicinity of magnetic transition (TmNi2B2C) and 4f-quadrupole ordering (TmNi2B2C) are several exciting phenomena that magnetic superconductors RNi2B2C exhibit. At the end of this review are indicated some possible further studies in quaternary borocarbide superconductors. These studies may turn out to be important not only with respect to borocarbides themselves but also from the standpoint of superconductivity in general.",

Moreover, these liquid-crystal phases have offered numerous opportunities to explore and investigate the nature of hexatic order and the related phase transitions. In this paper we present an extensive review of the thermal properties associated with the phase transitions related to these liquid-crystal hexatic phases. Although both electron-beam and X-ray diffraction studies have indicated the importance of hexatic ordering in understanding these phases, the existing experimental data from numerous thermal measurements fail to demonstrate that hexatic order, which can be represented by a complex variable and therefore belongs to the XY universality class, is the only symmetry-breaking field associated with the hexatic-B—smectic-A transition in liquid crystals.",

Macroscopic and thermal phenomena are considered from the unified viewpoint of microscopic quantum field theory. The concepts in quantum field theory such as renormalization and quasi-particles force us to take account of the time-dependence of the trace sum which has been ignored in the usual treatment of thermal situation. It is within this context that we review TFD. The applications of TFD to time-dependent non-equilibrium phenomena (the reservoir model and the self-interacting field model), show that we can obtain the master equation as well as the dissipative coefficient from the self-consistent renormalization condition. At the same time it is also shown that the final Gibbs distribution and the temperature can be derived, which implies that we obtain the equilibrium theory from the non-equilibrium one at the long-time limit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Negative muons may be used as a catalyst to fuse hydrogen nuclei into helium. The necessary confinement of nuclei is obtained on a microscopic scale by chemical bonding within 'exotic' muonic molecules such as dtμ, without the extreme physical conditions required for macroscopic plasma confinement in Tokamaks and laser reactors. Fusion energy released by muon catalysis exceeds the rest-mass energy of participating muons, which triggered questions about suitability of this process for energy production. The present article reviews the theoretical studies of the microscopic events constituting the fusion chain. The aim of these studies is to optimize the fusion yield by understanding its dependence on the macroscopic conditions such as temperature, fuel density and/or composition. Apart from the energy production aspects, the field of muon catalysed fusion (μCF) is also a wonderful example of interdisciplinary basic research combining exotic chemistry with atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. While the μCF reactions occur for all hydrogen isotopes, the present review emphasizes the theoretical and experimental results obtained for the case of dtμ.",

Certain higher-order terms are examined and it is found that it is possible to measure the staggered susceptibility directly in magnetoelectric materials.

A signal estimator, corresponding to the difference in the detector output a.c. power when a given optical field is present or absent, is introduced. The accuracy with which the mean signal intensity can be measured is derived in terms of the inverse root relative variance (IRRV) of this estimator. It is shown that most conventional microwave-based analyses of this problem need revision since they ignore, or treat in an ad hoc manner, both signal fluctuations and photodetection quantum statistics. A rigorous analysis is given including both these effects. The predictions of this analysis compare favourably with existing experimental data. The results are then used to compare signal-intensity measurement by direct or homodyne detection under various operating conditions. Finally, going beyond the measurement of signal-intensity, the probability distributions of the signal estimator are derived and used in an analysis of the performance of optical homodyne systems in threshold signal detection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main part of this paper surveys the mechanisms that can lead to rotation of plasma in an electrodeless discharge (commonly called a theta pinch) and in a mirror machine. Eight proposed mechanisms are examined, of which two are found to be incorrect in some way. Another mechanism, in which the reaction is purely electromagnetic, applies only to the tenuous plasma of a mirror machine. The remaining five theories apply to the highly compressed plasma of a theta pinch. These all rely fundamentally on the large difference in mass between an ion and an electron, i.e. either on Hall currents or the correction for finite ion Larmor radius in the stress tensor. The mechanisms which incorporate the Hall effect cause an equal and opposite mechanical reaction either on the wall (Roberts and Taylor), or on external conductors (Haines), or on the plasma at each end of the discharge axis (Bostick). The mechanisms which use the collisionless stress tensor predict either radial division into oppositely rotating plasma (Velikhov) or a transfer of angular momentum to the walls by collisions during the initial stage of physical contact (Haines). This last theory is new and arose as a result of a critical examination of an earlier theory (Jensen and Voorhies). Experimental evidence for rotation has been confined mainly to high speed photographic techniques, and methods of obtaining a more definite measurement of the rotation and its origin are suggested. The paper distinguishes carefully between the angular motions associated with the centre of mass, the guiding centres and the diamagnetic current, and also considers the stability of a rotating plasma including the Hall effect and the collisionless stress tensor.",

Significant progress in our understanding of real ferromagnets in the vicinity of the critical point has been made in the last decade through improved experimental techniques and theoretical advances in taking into account realistic spin-spin interactions. We start our review with a discussion of the theoretical results for the critical dynamics based on recent renormalization group, mode coupling and spin-wave theories. A detailed comparison is made of the theory with experimental results obtained by different measuring techniques, such as neutron scattering, hyperfine interaction, muon spin resonance, electron spin resonance, and magnetic relaxation, in various materials. Furthermore we discuss the effects of dipolar interaction on the critical dynamics of three-dimensional isotropic antiferromagnets and uniaxial ferromagnets. Special attention is also paid to a discussion of the consequences of dipolar anisotropies on the existence of magnetic order and the spin-wave spectrum in two-dimensional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We close our review with a formulation of critical dynamics in terms of nonlinear Langevin equations.",

Therefore, in the last few years there has been great activity in the area of magnetostriction of antiferromagnets. In contrast to ferromagnets, in antiferromagnets a large variety of magnetic structures can be stabilized at different temperatures and magnetic fields. This fundamental property of antiferromagnets allows one to separate and distinguish the different mechanisms of magnetostriction. New classes of magnetic compounds with antiferromagnetic order, for example the borocarbides and some special manganites, have also focused research efforts on the magnetostrictive behaviour in order to gain a more complex picture of these materials. In particular, changes of symmetry caused by lattice distortions attracted great interest. Moreover, some antiferromagnetic compounds with giant magnetostrictive effects of more than 1% have been found and the number of publications in this area is growing. The aim of the present review is to summarize experimental data as well as theoretical models concerning spontaneous and forced magnetostriction in antiferromagnetic systems, where the magnetic properties are dominated by the rare-earth magnetism. Above this, the available data, which were acquired with different motivations and therefore are of heterogeneous character, are systematized. After a summary of experimental methods the standard model of rare-earth based magnetostriction is reviewed. Then experimentally determined expansion and magnetostriction data of the pure rare-earth metals are discussed followed by selected rare-earth compounds and giant magnetostriction materials. The potential of a theoretical model which takes into account the crystal field effects as well as the (anisotropic) exchange striction is demonstrated in the interpretation of some of the experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Charge fluctuation and charge-ordering phenomena in compounds based on the 3d electrons of transition-metal ions and 4f electrons of rare-earth ions are reviewed with particular emphasis on the mutual coupling of charge and lattice degrees of freedom. For the description of charge ordering in inhomogeneously mixed-valence compounds of localized 3d or 4f-electron systems, we employ Landau's phenomenological theory for second-order phase transitions. By use of the group-theoretical method, the charge fluctuation mode corresponding to the active representation for the second-order transition is determined. The localization of 3d and 4f electrons makes the valence for the specific ions an integer number of charge units e in the ordered phases at low temperatures. The elastic soft mode observed by the ultrasonic method is often a useful indication for the charge fluctuation mode that is frozen below the charge-ordering point T C. The transverse c44 mode exhibiting a considerable softening in the rare-earth compound Yb4As3 couples to the Γ5 triplet of the charge fluctuation mode, giving rise to a linear chain of magnetic Yb3+ ions along [111] below T C = 292 K. Magnetite Fe3O4 and the substitution system Fe3-xZnxO4 exhibit softening of the c44 mode that couples to the charge fluctuation mode, which freezes below the Verwey transition temperature T V = 124 K. The soft c66 mode of the transition-metal compound NaV2O5 gives evidence for a zigzag structure of V4+ ions in the a-b plane below T C = 34 K and is the precursor for the orthorhombic-monoclinic phase transition. The charge glass compounds of Sm3X4 (X = Se or Te) show ultrasonic dispersion due to thermal hopping of 4f electrons between Sm2+ and Sm3+ ions. The ln T decrease in elastic constants of Sm3X4 is described in terms of a two-level system of the 4f-electron tunnelling in the random potential. The characteristic ultrasonic dispersion for the copper oxide compound Sr12Ca2Cu24O41 is also presented. The elastic anomaly associated with the charge ordering in the hole-doped Mn compounds La1-xSrxMnO3 and Pr1-xCaxMnO3 with colossal magnetoresistance is discussed. In short, the temperature dependence of some symmetry elastic constants and the frequency dependence of ultrasonic attenuation coefficients help to characterize the charge-ordering transitions. They can predict the symmetry of charge orderings of the second-order transition, or they describe the thermal hopping processes of charge or they can identify a charge glass.

    "abstract": "Abstract The study of correlated two-dimensional (2D) electron systems in the extreme quantum limit has been advanced by development of a field-theoretic model and associated experimental findings. The fundamental theoretical construction transforms the interacting 2D electrons into quasiparticles referred to as composite fermions. The properties of such an interacting particle system have recently been described, with the principal hypothesis that Fermi surfaces should form from the quasiparticle seas at specific ratios of the electron density to applied magnetic field. This model serves to provide an explanation for an extensive body of experimental data, including a description of the fractional quantum Hall effect as the integer quantum Hall effect for the quasiparticles. This review will present the experimental findings which both motivated and subsequently have verified aspects of this model. Following a brief introduction to 2D systems, early experimental findings pre-dating and influencing the composite fermion theory are examined. The theoretical construction and in particular the hypothesis of Fermi surface formation at high magnetic fields are briefly reviewed with respect to their experimental predictions. Experiments subsequent to the main theoretical developments are then presented. Emphasized are surface acoustic wave experiments which were responsible for measuring the composite fermion Fermi wave-vector and mean free path. Further demonstrations of semiclassical motion of the quasiparticles at the Fermi surface are also reviewed, including antidot experiments, magnetic focusing measurements, and transport studies through nanostructures. Experimental determination of the composite fermion effective mass is examined, considering results from measurements in dc transport, surface acoustic waves and thermopower. Extension of the theory and experi-ments to multiple filling factors in the magnetic field spectrum is also reviewed. Experimental findings are summarized and potential future studies are finally discussed.",

In each case the perturbation may be irrelevant, marginal or relevant. In the marginal case one finds local exponents which depend on a parameter. In the relevant case unusual stretched exponential behaviour and/or local first-order transitions appear.

    "abstract": "Abstract The concept of electron temperature T e is widely used in the description of photoexcited electrons in semiconductors. Nevertheless the photoexcited hot-electron energy distribution appears to be a Maxwell or Fermi distribution only in the case in which the electron density is very high, n ⪆ 1018 cm-3. Usually the energy distribution may only be adequately described by temperature T e below the threshold of the optical-phonon emission ε = ħΩ0 (passive region ε < ħΩ0). Above the threshold (active region ε > ħΩ0) the distribution critically depends on the photon energy and pumping level. In the review we study how the distribution depends on the influence of the lattice and inter-electron scatterings. The electron temperature T e is determined by the balance between the energy imparted to the electron system from the excitation source and the energy lost to the lattice owing to the phonon scattering. As a rule a minority of the electrons are in the active region rather than in the passive one but it is those electrons that are responsible for the energy losses because of the strong lattice scattering in the active region. So the energy-loss rate depends on the shape of the distribution in the active region. In the present review the question of how to calculate this energy-loss rate and to write down the correct balance equation is investigated. Experiments which allow measurement of the temperature T e in the passive region, the shape of the distribution f(ε) in the active region, and the time evolution of these quantities are discussed.",

On the strength of this analysis it is concluded that the perturbing action of the potential of acceptor-type impurities leads to effective overlap of the valence band with the conduction band. As a result, when the impurity concentration is sufficiently high, and exceeds that at which the Mott-Anderson transition occurs, the density of states of a p-type zero-gap semiconductor differs substantially from that of an ideal crystal, and is similar to that of a semimetal.",

The a 1g band consists of orbitals connecting pairs of c-axis neighbouring atoms, while the e π band consists of orbitals in the plane perpendicular to the c-axis. The change in distance between c-axis neighbours changes the nature of the a 1g band from molecular (delocalized) to atomic (localized). The localization of the a 1g electrons causes through the atomic exchange interaction also the localization of the e π electrons, and this localization creates a gap in the e π band which causes the material to become insulating. This model is treated in the Hartree-Fock approximation (the ‘Excitonic’ model) at zero and finite temperatures, and various aspects of the transition, such as changes in the c/a ratio, the creation of magnetic moments, changes in covalency, the effect of pressure and the order of the transition, are investigated.",

These levels give rise to several phenomena whose essence is in the oscillatory dependence of some property of the metal characteristics on the strength of the magnetic field, in the range of strong and medium fields. Of these the most famous are the de Haas-van Alphen effect, and the Shubnikov-de Haas effect. Electronic transitions between the Landau levels give rise to the cyclotron resonance. In a surface layer of a metal placed in a weak magnetic field another system of levels appears for electrons moving along shallow arcs, with their ends resting upon the surface of the metal. These levels originate from the quantized periodic motion of electrons along such 'skipping' trajectories due to a specular reflection at the metal surface. The spectrum of the system of magnetic surface levels manifests itself in an oscillatory dependence of the surface impedance on a weak magnetic field. The oscillations are due to a resonant absorption of microwave radiation in transitions of electrons between the magnetic levels occurring at discrete values of the magnetic field. This new quantum effect discovered in several metals in both the normal and superconducting states should, in principle, be common to all the conductors. Studies of the effect are being extended rapidly, and one foresees a discovery of some new phenomena due to the surface bound states of charged quasiparticles, arising in a conductor when exposed to a weak magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This review is intended to give a broad outline of the many techniques used in the calculation of atomic structure and the methods of using the information gained from this work in molecular calculations. Consequently, no topic is considered in full depth and only selected examples from the literature are used to illustrate the main points. Extensive tabulatios of atomic and molecular properties are already available in the literature, and these serve as additional sources of examples. Only methods within the Hartree-Fock framework, where a single Slater determinant (or in some cases a linear combination of Slater determinants) and the variation principle form the basis of the model, are considered in detail. Extensions of the independent particle model to include correlation have been considered briefly and smaller corrections, such as magnetic and relativistic effects are omitted. We describe, in the first part of the review, the partical requirements of the functional form of the basis set and consider examples of the types of functions available in the literature. These include exponential- and Gaussian type-functions and many others. For' chemical accuracy' the total energy of the electronic system should be estimated to within one kilocalorie or better, requiring at least Hartree-Fock accuracy for the isolated atoms and optimization or augmentation of the bases in the molecule. Smaller, less accurate basis sets for the atoms are still useful, however, in the prediction of certain atomic and molecular properties, and in supplying simple orbital pictures of interest to chemists, although producing poorer representations of the total wave function. In order to produce good wave functions there are certain criteria that they may satisfy. These, when coupled with the independent particle model, produce many methods of obtaining wave functions of varying accuracy depending in the size and type of functions comprising the basis set. Some of the criteria considered include the minimal energy principle, the best approximation to operators other than the Hamiltonian and other less known, and perhaps less practical, methods. The quality of the atomic wave functions, produced from Hartree-Fock equations, using different types of basis functions, may be investigated with the aid of many operators, and in particular the position operators, <rn >, and tested in the prediction of such quantities as the electron-electron interaction operators. The atomic <rn > values are extremely useful in choosing a basis for the calculation of a particular molecular property that depends heavily on the same region of space. In order to allow for the polarization of an atom in a molecular environment, and hence achieve better molecular properties, one may either reoptimize or augment the existing basis. If large basis sets are used initially for the atom, then they may be contracted without appreciable loss of ‘chemical accuracy’ before being used in the molecular calculations. These points are illustrated, using different basis sets produced by several methods, for the molecules HF, H2O, NH3 and HCN. Rules for orbital exponents (non-linear parameters of the basis set) for atoms and molecules are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The distribution of atoms in liquid alloys is obtained by Fourier transform of the measured interference function I(K). The density function ρ(r), thus obtained, is the weighted sum of the atomic densities ρ ij (r) which specify the number of j-type atoms per unit volume at the distance r from the i-type atom. The weighting factors depend not only on the atomic concentration ci but also on the atomic scattering factors fi of the atoms. In binary alloys three radial density functions are needed to determine the atomic distribution. In general, three interference functions I a(K), I b(K) and I ab(K) must be determined to obtain these densities. The electronic transport properties depend on these three interference functions and on the Fourier transform U a(K) and U b(K) of the pseudopotentials of the atoms. The coherently scattered intensity I e.u. coh(K) per atom in electron units can be written as: If f a≃f b, the Laue monotonic scattering c a c b(f a-f b)2 will be small and This relation can be applied to determine ρ(r)≃c aρa(r)+c bρb (r) in Ag-Sn, Hg-Tl and Al-Mg alloys. In these systems the interatomic distances r 1 and the coordination numbers were obtained as a function of concentration from the radial distribution function (RDF) 4πr 2 ρ(r). Negative deviation from a linear law (Vegard's law) was observed in Ag-Sn, and positive deviation in Hg-Tl. In Hg-In, f Hg > f In, and the density function ρ(r) is dominated by the more strongly scattering Hg atoms. The interatomic distances as obtained from the weighted RDF show a slight negative deviation from Vegard's law. The atomic distribution in Au-Sn, Al-Mg and Ag-Mg are also briefly discussed. The predicted electrical resistivity in Hg-Tl and Hg-In follow the decreasing trend at higher Tl or In concentration as observed for the measured resistivities. There is however discrepancy between the observed and calculated values of the resistivity for Hg and the dilute Hg alloys. The calculated resistivities of the Ag-Sn alloys agree with the experimental values. The thermoelectric powers were also calculated for these three alloy systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract X-ray diffraction patterns of liquid tin and liquid mercury are unlike those of simple liquid metals such as Na, K, Cu and Au in that the intensity patterns show considerable asymmetry, or a distinct shoulder, on the high angle side of the main peak. The position of the main peak gives the average interatomic distance in the melt; for Sn and Hg the additional detail of the pattern gives a special close distance of approach. It is shown that this distance is related to that occurring in the low temperature allotropes of the solid metals. In diffraction patterns of liquids of the Au-Sn alloy system the main intensity peak is resolved into two distinct maxima. One component occurs at a position corresponding to a simple random mixture of the component elements, the other to a close interatomic distance. The relative heights of the peaks are composition dependent. The close-packed component persists across the diagram, being strongest at composition Au3Sn and decreasing to a shoulder at pure Sn. As for Sn and Hg the short distance can be correlated with a short distance occurring in the crystalline solids of the system. A similar scheme may be applied to the systems Cu-Sn, Au-Ga and Au-In where double-headed diffraction patterns have been observed in the liquids. It is postulated that the origin of the close distance occurring in the liquid in each system is the same as that of the strong bond existing in the crystalline compounds.",

    "abstract": "We present the theoretical foundations and the implementation details of a density-functional approach for coupled photons, electrons, and effective nuclei in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics. Starting point of the formalism is a generalization of the Pauli-Fierz field theory for which we establish a one-to-one correspondence between external fields and internal variables. Based on this correspondence, we introduce a Kohn-Sham construction which provides a computationally feasible approach for ab-initio light-matter interactions. In the mean-field limit for the effective nuclei the formalism reduces to coupled Ehrenfest-Maxwell-Pauli-Kohn-Sham equations. We present an implementation of the approach in the real-space real-time code Octopus. For the implementation we use the Riemann-Silberstein formulation of classical electrodynamics and rewrite Maxwell's equations in Schr\\\"odinger form. This allows us to use existing time-evolution algorithms developed for quantum-mechanical systems also for Maxwell's equations. Overall, our approach is ideally suited for applications in nano-optics, nano-plasmonics, (photo) electrocatalysis, light-matter coupling in 2D materials, cases where laser pulses carry orbital angular momentum, or light-tailored chemical reactions in optical cavities to name but a few.",

At the level of path integration, and in arbitrary space dimension, we not only report on existing Riemannian geometry-based approaches that render path integrals amenable to the standard rules of calculus, but also bring forth new routes, based on a fully time-discretized approach, that achieve the same goal. We illustrate these various definitions of path integration on simple examples such as the diffusion of a particle on a sphere.",

After reviewing some established theories of SN quantum interference phenomena, we introduce a new approach to the analysis of SN mesoscopic physics. Essentially, our formalism represents a unification of the quasi-classical formalism for describing mean properties of SN systems on the one hand, with more recent field theories of mesoscopic fluctuations on the other hand. Thus, by its very construction, the new approach is capable of exploring both averaged and fluctuation properties of SN systems on the same microscopic footing.

    "abstract": "Abstract We describe an experimental study of the interband optical properties of GaAs quantum wells as a function of their excess electron density and an applied magnetic field. With a negligible density of excess electrons in the well, the spectra show sharp resonances due to neutral Mott-Wannier-type excitons X. Upon increasing the density slightly the excitons capture an excess electron to form negatively charged excitons X-. The transition energy separation of X and X- agrees with the expected binding energy of the second electron. At a density roughly consistent with that determined for a homogeneous well, we observe a sharp transfer of oscillator strength from X to X-. With further density increase, X is completely quenched from the spectra, while X- evolves adiabatically into the Fermi-edge singularity observed for dense electron gases. Application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the well causes a large enhancement of the second electron binding energy of X-, due to the enhanced Coulomb interaction which arises because the outer electron orbital is forced closer to the core of the exciton. Furthermore, excited states of X- for which the spin wavefunction is symmetric upon interchange of the two electrons (spin triplet), rather than antisymmetric (spin singlet) as in the ground state, are observed to bind at finite magnetic fields. Under magnetic field the single X- transition becomes increasingly circularly polarized in excitation spectra, owing to the spin polarization of its electron initial state at low temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Kondo lattice model introduced in 1977 describes a lattice of localized magnetic moments interacting with a sea of conduction electrons. It is one of the most important canonical models in the study of a class of rare earth compounds, called heavy fermion systems, and as such has been studied intensively by a wide variety of techniques for more than a quarter of a century. This review focuses on the one-dimensional case at partial band filling, in which the number of conduction electrons is less than the number of localized moments. The theoretical understanding, based on the bosonized solution, of the conventional Kondo lattice model is presented in great detail. This review divides naturally into two parts, the first relating to the description of the formalism, and the second to its application. After an all-inclusive description of the bosonization technique, the bosonized form of the Kondo lattice Hamiltonian is constructed in detail. Next the double-exchange ordering, Kondo singlet formation, the RKKY interaction and spin polaron formation are described comprehensively. An in-depth analysis of the phase diagram follows, with special emphasis on the destruction of the ferromagnetic phase by spin-flip disorder scattering, and of recent numerical results. The results are shown to hold for both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kondo lattice. The general exposition is pedagogic in tone. Acknowledgements I wish to thank my past and present collaborators, most notably Graeme Honner, Ian McCulloch and Raymond Chan, for the research undertaken to progress this field of study. Notes A brief overview of the strongly correlated electron systems is given in Appendix A. While this notation is fairly standard for the Kondo lattice, note that the localized electrons in the manganese oxides are in the d band, cf. section 1.2.1 below. A summary of the single-impurity Kondo model results can be found in Appendix B. Adding a large antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction between the local moments produces a spin-gapped metal Citation[206] with unconventional pairing fluctuations Citation[42]. The effect of phonons on the 1D Kondo lattice model has been studied by Gulácsi et al. via bosonization Citation[77, Citation78]. Details can be found in section 7.3. More accurately, the single-impurity Kondo model turns out to be a local Fermi liquid. For details, see Andrei et al. Citation[13]. The concept of a local Fermi liquid was introduced by Newns and Hewson Citation[162] who used it to interpret experimental data on rare earth compounds. It corresponds to a non-interacting multilevel resonant model. A similar enhancement is observed for the spin susceptibility. The bands corresponding to the 4f orbitals are energetically narrow, or atomic-like, with a delta-function density of states ρ(ϵ) ≈ δ(ϵ − ϵ f ), where ϵ f is the f level. Note that these are not bands in the usual sense; band theory begins from a basis of non-interacting delocalized Bloch states (cf. Appendix D.1), and provides a poor description of the properties of partially filled 4f shells, in which the f electrons are localized and interact strongly with each other. For comparison with the energies of well-defined conduction bands, it is however convenient and conventional to consider a 4f ‘band’ for a given compound with a 4f n nominal occupation on constituent rare earth atoms. The f level ϵ f is then the energy for the process 4f n → 4f n − 1 of removing an f electron. For example, in SmS ϵ f is the energy for the process 4f 6 → 4f 5 Citation[89, Citation230]. According to standard band theory, Vk would be zero, since the states in different bands are orthogonal (cf. Appendix D.1). However, as noted above, the f orbitals are strongly correlated, and do not constitute a band in the rigorous sense. The same notation is used as in Equationequations (1.4) and Equation(1.5) i.e., S j represent the pseudo-spin operators for the f-electrons. This in spite of the fact that double-exchange ferromagnetic ordering has been observed in rare earth compounds as far back as 1979. See Varma Citation[231] for theory, and Batlogg et al. Citation[19] for experiments on the thulium compound TmSe0.83Te0.17. For a different derivation, see Van Vleck Citation[229]. See also Yafet Citation[252] for 1D. Note that more complicated magnetic structures can arise with the stacking of 2D planes in a crystal Citation[4]. Note, however, that the lattice problem in a certain sense precedes the work on the impurity Kondo Hamiltonian: Fröhlich and Nabarro Citation[62] considered the lattice case in 1940 in their work on the magnetic ordering of nuclear spins. For more details about the Kondo model, see Appendix B. For a review, see Andrei et al. Citation[13]. The exact solution of the single-impurity Anderson model is reviewed by Tsvelick and Wiegmann Citation[227]. Following convention, N here denotes the degeneracy of the localized spin orbitals. Elsewhere N denotes the number of lattice sites. Spin gaps are also observed in bosonization treatments of the 1D half-filled Kondo lattice. See Fujimoto and Kawakami Citation[64] and Le Hur Citation[133] for J>0 and Le Hur Citation[132] for J<0. These treatments are not for the pure Kondo lattice of Equationequation (1.12), but include also a direct interaction between the localized spins. The fact that the hopping amplitude is renormalized by a factor 2 is the reason that the effective mass m* = 2m e as J → ∞ for the spin polaron in the Kondo lattice with one conduction electron. Some of the basic concepts of bosonization can be traced back further; an approximate 3D treatment was given by Bloch in 1934 Citation[212]. The common examples of two-component systems are the two-band models Citation[76], and the two-chain problem Citation[56]. Both of these cases were solved using a field theoretical bosonization. In the literature the Luttinger model is sometimes understood to imply also certain interactions, specifically forward scattering interactions as originally considered by Tomonaga Citation[219] and by Luttinger Citation[142]. This is not implied here; the Luttinger model simply refers to the introduction of the Dirac seas. Following modern convention Citation[235], the Luttinger model with forward scattering interactions is called the Tomonaga–Luttinger model. This is the physical content of Emery's identification Citation[51] of α with the lattice spacing a. Emery's interpretation, which has wide currency, is discussed further in section 4.1.3. An alternative decomposition, designed to investigate short-wavelength fluctuations with wavevectors |k| ≈ 2k F, is used in section 3.2.2, cf. Equationequations (3.13). The standard Hubbard model, as considered here, does not contain impurities or other lattice imperfections that may act to localize the electrons below this scale. A brief overview of the strongly correlated electron systems is given in Appendix A. For more details on the canonical transformations in general, see section 1.2.3, including Appendix C, and section 5.1.2. Within the framework of exact solutions, an extension of the Bethe Ansatz to the quantum inverse scattering method Citation[123] allows correlation functions to be determined. In more complicated cases it is conceivable that double-exchange may be mediated by two or several conduction electrons. Double-exchange is not, however, a collective effect involving a large number of conduction electrons. The similarities between the transition in the Kondo lattice model, and that in the transverse-field Ising chain, have been investigated by Juozapavicius et al. Citation[113] on the basis of this mapping. For the step function cut-off Λα(k) = θ(α−1 − |k|), Equationequation (5.11) gives a ferromagnetic interaction at short-range, similar to the interaction determined by the continuous cut-off functions. However, due to interference set up by the discontinuity, the step-function cut-off determines a weak oscillating interaction at longer range (cf. figure 7). This is not shared by the smoother cut-off functions. As discussed in detail in sections 3.2.2 and 4.1.2, a discontinuously sharp cut-off on bosonic density fluctuations is unlikely in a real system, and the long-range oscillations are artefacts resulting from a singular cut-off function. Because of this, the step-function cut-off is not considered in this section, and attention is restricted to continuous cut-off functions. This property is specific to the Kondo lattice Citation[152]; for the single-impurity Kondo Hamiltonian at zero temperature, the spin coupling renormalizes to infinity for all J > 0, as discussed in section 2.2. There are minor changes in the derivation for ferromagnetic couplings J < 0. For clearness in the exposition, it is however convenient to fix the sign of J as positive for the remainder of this section. It is straightforward to verify that all the results go through for J < 0 with trivial modifications. The phase diagram and ground-state properties for J < 0 are discussed in section 6.3. A failure to realize this point may be the reason for the erroneous evaluation of the canonical transformation by Zachar et al. Citation[262], see section 5.1.2. For certain quasi-commensurate fillings, for example n = 1/2, the spontaneous magnetization still grows continuously, but the critical exponent may be reduced to its value 1/8 as in the constant transverse-field Ising chain, see also Pfeuty Citation[177]. It is interesting to note that some of the features of the transition in the random transverse-field Ising chain are loosely similar to those of first-order transitions in random classical systems. See Fisher Citation[58] for more details. At partial conduction band filling this is assured by bosonization. In section 3.2.2 it was shown that α is limited by the interparticle spacing of the conduction electrons. The interparticle spacing is greater than a lattice spacing for a partially filled conduction band. The spin polaron picture for the ferromagnetic ordering induced on the localized spins was used by Sigrist et al. Citation[203]. It is equivalent to the double-exchange picture, and is perhaps more illustrative at low conduction band filling. For more details see also section 3 and section 4.2.2. A brief overview of the strongly correlated electron systems is given in Appendix A. This limitation is still valid: even recent results Citation[249, Citation250] do not cover the region of doping close to half-filling. As mentioned in section 2.4.2, earlier results based on simple mean-field, slave-boson or Gutzwiller approximations Citation[225] could not predict ferromagnetism close to half filling. This is the reason why the second ferromagnetic region above n = 0.9 is plotted as a striped area in figure 18, where the accuracy was insufficient to determine the phase boundaries. Here a full non-Abelian bosonization approach is used to study the fixed points of the 1D Kondo lattice, and it is shown that the fixed points differ from the ones of the single-impurity Kondo model. Recall from section 2.1 that the RKKY interaction strictly diverges in 1D, and there is no lower bound on the ground-state energy for the RKKY Hamiltonian, even for arbitrarily small J Citation[204]. The divergence is typical of perturbation expansions in 1D, and does not occur in higher dimensions. In Equationequation (7.3) the notation of Novais et al. Citation[165, Citation166] was used, instead of Equationequation (5.2). As in the previous section, the calculated value, see section 5, of the constant A has been used here. α/a measures the effective range of the double-exchange, see figure 13, which was shown to be equivalent to the width of the spin polarons, for details see sections 5.1.3 and 6.1. A brief overview of the strongly correlated electron systems is given in Appendix A. The rule of thumb is that if the Luttinger model representation (cf. Appendix G) involves the normal-ordering convention non-trivially, then the corresponding Bose representation in the condensed matter system is exact. If the Luttinger model representation does not require a non-trivial application of the normal-ordering convention, then the corresponding Bose representation in the condensed matter system is valid only over asymptotically large separations. Bethe's highly detailed original paper is available in a new English translation by Mahan Citation[144]. Only in the so-called Toulouse limit Citation[221], the Anderson and Yuval Citation[6, Citation7, Citation10, Citation11] solution is exact. The Toulouse limit corresponds to a certain value of Jz = J T, where J T ≈ 0.97 Citation[246]. In this limit, however, the Kondo model reduces to a simple quadratic non-interacting model. For simplicity we use a convention, where k B is unity. nth order canonical transformation corresponds to 2nth order perturbation theory in HV Citation[257]. The formalism is thus written for 1D systems. The generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward, and usually involves only a replacement of scalar spatial and momentum variables x and k by vectors r and k respectively Citation[167]. The labels ↑, +1 and ↓, −1 will be used interchangeably for σ; in formulas σ always denotes ± 1 as the spin is , respectively, along the z-axis. The 2D and 3D Fermi momenta take a different form: is the 3D form in a box of volume L 3; k F = (2π N e/L 2)1/2 is the 2D form on a square of area L 2. In all cases the ground-state consists of a Fermi sea with momentum/spin states |kσ⟩ with |k| < k F occupied, and those with |k|>k F empty. Based on analogy with the 3D case, in all dimensions the set of points with |k| = k F is called the Fermi surface. For negative t the roles of electrons and holes are interchanged. Similar considerations apply in calculating the representation for the non-interacting Hamiltonian.",

In this review we discuss the theory of transformations and provide such a rational and systematic method of approach. The purpose of transformation is to map the singularity of interest (usually the critical point) significantly closer to the origin than any other singularity, so that it dominates the later coefficients of the series; extrapolation methods based on Darboux's theorems may then be employed. We show that, for series likely to arise in thermodynamics, it is always possible to find transformations which achieve this purpose. We provide a set of conditions, which should be satisfied by any transformation function, to ensure straightforward and valid analysis, and we discuss the basic types of transformation and their selection in practice. In the final sections, we illustrate the approach with some important examples, and show that it leads to transformed series which are much smoother than those previously obtained.",

In part II we now turn to the description of the Fermi surfaces of the d-block and f-block metals; these include the metals in groups IB, IIB, IIIA, IVA, VA, VIA, VIIA, and VIII of the periodic table. These blocks of the periodic table include the transition metals, the rare-earth metals (or lanthanide metals) and the actinide metals. The Fermi surfaces of many of these metals are quite complicated and there is often no very close resemblance to the predictions of the free-electron model; this is in contrast to most of the Fermi surfaces which were discussed in part I. Another important feature is that many of these metals possess magnetically ordered structures over certain temperature ranges. As a result of the magnetic ordering a large magnetic field arises within the metal and causes an energy separation to appear between the spin-up and spin-down bands so that in the magnetically ordered phase there are quite different Fermi surfaces for the spin-up and spin-down electrons. In part I we saw that for the simple metals there has now been a certain amount of work done on using the known Fermi surfaces in the explanation of many properties of a metal that depend only indirectly on the details of the electronic band structure and the shape of the Fermi surface. For most of the d-block and f-block metals Fermiology is still one stage less advanced than for the simple metals and it is still concerned with trying to determine accurately the shapes of their Fermi surfaces.",

To within the experimental angular resolution (0.5 milliradians) no change in the angular correlation distribution is observed for Li, Se, Na, and Tl upon heating from room temperature to beyond the melting point. The elements Sb, Bi, Ga, Hg, Sn and Te exhibit changes in their angular correlation distributions only upon being melted, whereas for the metals Al, Cd, In, Pb and Zn changes occur when the specimen is heated from room temperature to temperatures below the melting point. Changes in the angular correlation distribution upon heating or melting are generally manifested as (a) a narrowing of the central part of the curve, (b) a rounding-off of the parts of the curve near the Fermi cut-off angle and (c) a change in the area of the broad background curve as compared with the area under the central peak.

We describe the integral projection operator, an expansion in shift operators, the product operator of Löwdin and another product operator (the cosine product). Certain methods which appear in the literature are seen to be equivalent to one or the other of these. We consider factors that influence the choice of an appropriate method.

This equation is then studied, mainly in the vicinity of q=0, in order to show how various limits lead to different types of propagation. The phenomenological equations are then justified from a microscopic point of view. The proof goes in two steps. A linear screened response function of the electrons in a solid is first assumed; one then proves that all the coefficients entering into the phenomenological equations may be obtained from the sole knowledge of this response function and of the charge of the nuclei. The existence of the response function is then justified from a many-body point of view. Finally, the necessary relations between the phenomenological coefficients are proved.

    "abstract": "The discovery of magnetism by the ancient Greeks was enabled by the natural occurrence of lodestone -- a magnetized version of the mineral magnetite. Nowadays, natural minerals continue to inspire the search for novel magnetic materials with quantum-critical behavior or exotic ground states such as spin liquids. The recent surge of interest in magnetic frustration and quantum magnetism was largely encouraged by crystalline structures of natural minerals realizing pyrochlore, kagome, or triangular arrangements of magnetic ions. As a result, names like azurite, jarosite, volborthite, and others, which were barely known beyond the mineralogical community a few decades ago, found their way into cutting-edge research in solid-state physics. In some cases, the structures of natural minerals are too complex to be synthesized artificially in a chemistry lab, especially in single-crystalline form, and there is a growing number of examples demonstrating the potential of natural specimens for experimental investigations in the field of quantum magnetism. On many other occasions, minerals may guide chemists in the synthesis of novel compounds with unusual magnetic properties. The present review attempts to embrace this quickly emerging interdisciplinary field that bridges mineralogy with low-temperature condensed-matter physics and quantum chemistry.",

In 14 cases upper and lower limiting values are known separately, and these agree in each case within the limits of experimental error. Taking the other 126 values as ‘true’ (rather than limiting) values, and using information concerning total energies of β-disintegration, the number of last-nucleon binding energies which are reasonably well determined is increased to more than 600. These values are tabulated, and discussed in relation to the v. Weizsäcker mass formula. Apart from certain anomalies which are treated individually, the discussion brings out the effect of α-unit structure in light nuclei, diminishing in importance to become almost negligible beyond A=40, and yields mean values for nucleon-parity dependent terms in the range A∼215. The recovery of ‘normal’ last-nucleon binding energy after completion of a closed shell is followed in detail over the range 126ˇ-Nˇ-136 (N=neutron number) and somewhat less closely over the range 82ˇ-Zˇ-92 (Z=proton number).",

All experimental evidence points to adiabatic continuability of the strange metal into a conventional one, and thus to one metallic phase rather than two, and all attempts to account theoretically for the existence of a luttinger-liquid at zero temperature in spatial dimension greater than one have failed. I discuss the underlying reasons for this failure and then argue that the true higher-dimensional generalization of the luttinger-liquid behavior is a propensity of the system to order. This implies that the central issue is actually the conflict between different kinds of order, i.e. exactly the idea implicit in Zhang's paper. I then speculate about how the conflict between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity, the two principal kinds of order in this problem, might result in both the observed zero-temperature phase diagram of the cuprates and the luttinger-liquid phenomenology, i.e. the breakup of the electron into spinons and holons in certain regimes of doping and energy. The key idea is a quantum critical point regulating a first-order transition between these phases, and toward which one is first attracted under renormalization before bifurcating between the two phases. I speculate that this critical point lies on the insulating line, and that the difference between the Mott-insulator and fermi-liquid approaches to the high TC problem comes down to whether or not the superconducting states made by nand p-type doping can be continued into each other. A candidate for the second fixed point required for distinct superconducting phases is the P- and T-violating chiral spin liquid state invented by me.",

In recent years, theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed that those electron correlations, which are responsible for the quantum Hall effect, are also the reason for various spin transitions in the system.

At this continuous equi- librium phase transition, the liquid state, in which all macromolecules are delocalised, is transformed into a solid state, in which a nonzero fraction of macromolecules have spontaneously become localised. This solid state is a most unusual one: localisation occurs about mean positions that are distributed homogeneously and randomly, and to an extent that varies randomly from monomer to monomer. Thus, the solid state emerging at the vulcanisation transition is an equilibrium amorphous solid state: it is properly viewed as a solid state that bears the same relationship to the liquid and crystalline states as the spin glass state of certain magnetic systems bears to the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states, in the sense that, like the spin glass state, it is diagnosed by a subtle order parameter. In this review we give a detailed exposition of a theoretical approach to the physical properties of systems of randomly, permanently crosslinked macromolecules.

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract We present a detailed discussion of both theoretical and experimental evidence in favour of the existence of states of ‘confined coherence’ in metals of sufficiently high anisotropy and with sufficiently strong correlations. The defining property of such a state is that single electron coherence is confined to lower dimensional subspaces (planes or chains) so that it is impossible to observe interference effects between histories which involve electrons moving between these subspaces. The most dramatic experimental manifestation of such a state is the coexistence of incoherent non-metallic transport in one or two directions (transverse to the lower dimensional subspaces) with coherent transport in at least one other direction (within the subspaces). The magnitude of the Fermi surface warping due to transverse (intersubspace) momentum plays the role of an order parameter (in a state of confined coherence, this order parameter vanishes) and the effect can occur in a pure system at zero temperature. Our theoretical approach is to treat an anisotropic two (2D)- or three (3D)-dimensional electronic system as a collection of one (1D)- or two-dimensional electron liquids coupled by weak interliquid single-particle hopping. We find that a necessary condition for the destruction of coherent interliquid transport is that the intraliquid state be a non-Fermi liquid. We present a very detailed discussion of coupled 1D Luttinger liquids and the reasons for believing in the existence of a phase of confined coherence in that model. This provides a paradigm for incoherent transport between weakly coupled 2D non-Fermi liquids, the case relevant to the experiments of which we are aware. Specifically, anomalous transport data in the (normal state of the) cuprate superconductors and in the low temperature metallic state of the highly anisotropic organic conductor (TMTSF)2PF6 cannot be understood within a Fermi liquid framework, and, we argue, the only plausible way to understand that transport is in terms of a state of confined coherence.",

The quantum cascade laser which utilizes such transitions in quantum wells is a brilliant outcome of quantum engineering that has already demonstrated its usefulness in various real-world applications. After a brief introduction to the background of this transition process, we discuss the physics behind these transitions in an externally applied magnetic field. This has unravelled many intricate phenomena related to intersubband resonance and electron relaxation modes in these systems. We then discuss QCTs in a situation where the quantum wells in the active regions of a quantum cascade structure are replaced by quantum dots. The physics of quantum dots is a rapidly developing field with its roots in fundamental quantum mechanics, but at the same time, quantum dots have tremendous potential applications. We first present a brief review of those aspects of quantum dots that are likely to be reflected in a quantum-dot cascade structure. We then go on to demonstrate how the calculated emission peaks of a quantum-dot cascade structure with or without an external magnetic field are correlated with the properties of quantum dots, such as the choice of confinement potentials, shape, size and the low-lying energy spectra of the dots.

The subject is approached from a general viewpoint rather than focusing on the specific evolution of certain systems.

Special emphasis is laid on common properties of the different structures, including a critical discussion of the information contained in typically measured quantities. Efficient techniques for the simulation of typical disordered cell structures are summarized, and novel theoretical approaches to the modelling of dynamical cell structures are presented. Here, special attention is paid to the application of the methods of statistical mechanics and the resulting implications. In several systems, a breakdown of order induced by variation of an external control parameter can be observed. Its diagnostics in Voronoi tessellations is presented focusing on the connection with the underlying physics. The discussion of planar cell structures is concluded with a presentation of the peculiar properties of exceptional systems, characterized by the coexistence of two different length scales or by scale invariance.

    "abstract": "Abstract A large number of multifaceted quantum transport processes in molecular systems and physical nanosystems, such as e.g. nonadiabatic electron transfer in proteins, can be treated in terms of quantum relaxation processes which couple to one or several fluctuating environments. A thermal equilibrium environment can conveniently be modelled by a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. An archetype situation provides a two-state dissipative quantum dynamics, commonly known under the label of a spin-boson dynamics. An interesting and nontrivial physical situation emerges, however, when the quantum dynamics evolves far away from thermal equilibrium. This occurs, for example, when a charge transferring medium possesses nonequilibrium degrees of freedom, or when a strong time-dependent control field is applied externally. Accordingly, certain parameters of underlying quantum subsystem acquire stochastic character. This may occur, for example, for the tunnelling coupling between the donor and acceptor states of the transferring electron, or for the corresponding energy difference between electronic states which assume via the coupling to the fluctuating environment an explicit stochastic or deterministic time-dependence. Here, we review the general theoretical framework which is based on the method of projector operators, yielding the quantum master equations for systems that are exposed to strong external fields. This allows one to investigate on a common basis, the influence of nonequilibrium fluctuations and periodic electrical fields on those already mentioned dynamics and related quantum transport processes. Most importantly, such strong fluctuating fields induce a whole variety of nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena. A characteristic feature of such dynamics is the absence of thermal (quantum) detailed balance.

This research has been supported by the DFG through the collaborative research centre, SFB-486, project A10 and the Volkswagen foundation, via project no. I/80424. Notes 1This observation which can be traced back to Citation111 can be rationalised as follows. Let us consider a sojourn in the state j characterised by the survival probability Φ j (τ). The corresponding residence time interval [0,τ] can be arbitrarily divided into two pieces [0,τ 1] and [τ 1,τ]. If no memory effects are present, then . The only nontrivial solution of this latter functional equation which decays in time reads , with γ j > 0. 2Note that the formal solution of another prominent problem of the first-order relaxation kinetics with a fluctuating rate, follows immediately from (Equation25) upon substitution ε j → i Γ j , see in Citation105 for some nontrivial non-Markovian examples and the corresponding discussion. 3Note that throughout this work ν is the inverse of the autocorrelation time. It is equal to the sum of two rates. 4This means that each and every stochastic trajectory runs on the Bloch sphere. The averaged Bloch vector becomes, however, contracted , because . Thus, the averaged density matrix ⟨ρ(t)⟩ is always positive in the considered model, cf. Citation47, independent of the particular model used for the stochastic driving ξ(t). 5This is a standard definition of the temperature of a spin subsystem in NMR and similar areas Citation59. It is used also to introduce the parlance of formally negative temperatures. 6The corresponding dynamics also exhibits a resonance feature versus ν in a certain limit Citation56. 7A remarkable feature is, however, that both corresponding secular cubic equations have the same discriminant, D(Δ,ν,ε0) = 0, separating the domains of complex and real roots. Hence, the transition from a coherent relaxation (complex roots are present) to an incoherent relaxation (real roots only) occurs at the same values of noise parameters, independently of the initial conditions. The corresponding phase diagram separating regimes of coherent and incoherent relaxation (judging from the above criterion) has been found in Citation56. It must be kept in mind, however, that the weights of the corresponding exponentials are also of importance for the character of relaxation process. These weights naturally depend on the initial conditions. 8Within the path-integral approach, the same equation can be derived from a non-interacting blip approximation (NIBA) result of the dissipative spin-boson model Citation132 by putting formally therein the strength of the system-bath coupling to zero. Astonishingly enough, the NIBA turns out to provide the exact result for this singular limit of zero-dissipation. 9This issue deserves to be commented on in further detail: The generalised quantum thermal forces acting on the system from the bath should be on average unbiased. This implies that the thermal average of a properly defined system-bath coupling, , should be zero, i.e., . For this reason, the systematic, mean-field like contribution of the thermal \"force\" should be separated from the very beginning and be included in without change of the Hamiltonian of the total system. Obviously, this can always be achieved. This formal renormalisation is always assumed in the following (with \"tilde\" omitted when applicable). 10For a periodic driving, the field influence on the relaxation kernel can alternatively be taken into account applying the corresponding Floquet basis for periodically driven quantum dynamics. This has been done in Citation84, Citation95. Our approach is valid, however, for arbitrary time-dependence. 11This problem can be resolved by the so-called slippage of the initial conditions, see in Citation137–139. Moreover, within the weak-coupling approximation the effect of dissipation should be consistently taken into account to the second-order of the system-bath coupling only; i.e., in the solutions of Redfield equations (rather than in the relaxation kernels only). The dissipation-induced frequency shifts (i.e. the Lamb shifts at T = 0) should also be very small (compared to the corresponding eigenfrequencies of quantum evolution in the absence of dissipation). Otherwise, the theory needs to be renormalised. Notwithstanding these essential restrictions, the Redfield equations provide one of the most widely used tools to describe open quantum systems in many areas of physics and physical chemistry Citation3, Citation4, Citation9, Citation59, Citation140–143. 12These levels can correspond, e.g., to spatially separated localisation sites of a transferring (excess) electron in a protein Citation11. If such electronic states possess very different dipole moments (the difference can reach 50 D Citation144), an external time-dependent electric field will modulate the energy difference in time due to the Stark effect. Such electric field dependence of the electronic energy levels can be very strong Citation144, Citation145. A large modulation of the local electric field can be induced, e.g., due attachment/detachment of an ATP molecule/products of its hydrolysis. A substantial shift of the electronic energy levels can then be induced Citation146. In a simple setting, the corresponding modulation of an energy level can be modelled by a two-state Markovian process Citation147. The chemical source of driving force can also be substituted by a direct application of a stochastic electric field Citation147, Citation148. This latter possibility has been demonstrated experimentally for some ion pumps Citation148. 13One can immediately see that if K t would be real-valued, then the forward and backward rate kernels were always equal. This would mimic the situation of an infinite temperature as it was elucidated in section 2 for a classical stochastic bath. 14 A fast (on the time-scale τ r of system relaxation) equilibration of this single mode with other vibrational modes is assumed. This imposes an important restriction which can always be justified by a proper tuning of the coupling constant κ 0. Furthermore, the broadening of vibrational spectral lines in molecular systems γ exceeds typically γ > 5 cm−1 (in spectroscopic units) which corresponds γ > 1012 Hz in units of the frequency. The considered relaxation transitions must consequently occur more slowly, e.g., an (ET) can occur on a msec time-scale Citation11. 15This case presents a realistic situation for experimental realisations of molecular systems since a significant stochastic perturbation with an energy exceeding one k BT , (at room temperatures), corresponds in the units of frequency σ∼4 × 1013 1/s. The frequency ν of large amplitude bistable conformational fluctuations of molecular groups is typically much smaller. 16This definition is related to the one given in equation (Equation70) by: with , . 17 An important restriction is: for ω c ≫ ω 0. It stems from the requirement of the smallness of the frequency Lamb shift, ω 0→ ω r , at T = 0. This restriction is most crucial for ε0 = 0, where ω 0 = Δ and (for α ≪ 1, to the linear order in ). Thus, this frequency shift is consistent with the renormalisation in section 6.3. For a large asymmetry ε0 ≫ Δ, the validity range of Bloch-Redfield equations in α becomes broader. 18i.e. the thermally weighted overlap of the wave functions of displaced quantum oscillators. 19Reminder: we consider the case Δ r = 0, or . 20The use of an improved perturbation theory in Δ in the case of fast fluctuating fields does not imply that the Golden Rule rates cannot be enhanced by such nonequilibrium fields. A large enhancement of the forward (backward) rate can occur, e.g., when the absorption of n photons helps to overcome the corresponding forward (backward) activation barrier of the thermally-assisted incoherent tunnelling. For example, for the generalised Marcus rates a condition is , with the field amplitude A chosen such that the probability of the corresponding reaction channel is maximised. 21In the case of periodic driving, this additional averaging is obsolete by defining the current in a self-averaged manner as .",

The ground state properties of the integrable two-leg spin-1/2 and the mixed spin-(1/2,1) ladder models at zero temperature are analyzed by means of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. Solving the TBA equations yields exact results for the critical fields and critical behaviour. The thermal and magnetic properties of the models are investigated in terms of the recently introduced High Temperature Expansion method, which is discussed in detail. It is shown that in the strong coupling limit the integrable spin-1/2 ladder model exhibits three quantum phases: (i) a gapped phase in the regime $H<H_{c1}$, (ii) a fully polarised phase for $H>H_{c2}$, and (iii) a Luttinger liquid magnetic phase in the regime $H_{c1}<H<H_{c2}$. The critical behaviour in the vicinity of the critical points is of the Pokrovsky-Talapov type. The temperature-dependent thermal and magnetic properties are directly evaluated from the exact free energy expression and compared to known experimental results for a range of strong coupling ladder compounds. Similar analysis of the mixed spin-(1/2,1) ladder model reveals a rich phase diagram, with a 1/3 and a full saturation magnetisation plateau within the strong antiferromagnetic rung coupling regime. For weak rung coupling, the fractional magnetisation plateau is diminished and a new quantum phase transition occurs. The phase diagram can be directly deduced from the magnetisation curve obtained from the exact result derived from the HTE. The thermodynamics of the spin-orbital model with different single-ion anisotropies is also investigated.",

It is the generic model for a continuous phase transition and arguably the most studied model in theoretical physics. Since it was solved for a two-dimensional lattice by Onsager in 1944, thereby representing one of the very few exactly solvable models in dimensions higher than one, it has served as a testing ground for new developments in analytic treatment and numerical algorithms. Only series expansions and numerical approaches, such as Monte Carlo simulations, are available in three dimensions. This review focuses on Monte Carlo simulation. We build upon a data set of unprecedented size. A great number of quantities of the model are estimated near the critical coupling. We present both a conventional analysis and an analysis in terms of a Puiseux series for the critical exponents. The former gives distinct values of the high- and low-temperature exponents; by means of the latter we can get these exponents to be equal at the cost of having true asymptotic behaviour being found only extremely close to the critical point. The consequences of this for simulations of lattice systems are discussed at length.",

As a result, the spin susceptibilities are determined in the random phase approximation. The lowlying collective excitations are then obtained by finding the poles of these susceptibilities. We start by giving a brief review of the Hartree-Fock procedure and by indicating how the susceptibilities are obtained. The density matrix approach, where the ground state is interpreted as that minimizing the energy, is used throughout. Using an effective Coulomb interaction of the Hubbard type we consider two distinct systems: a one-band system with an incommensurate spin density wave in its ground state, and a many-band simply commensurate model for f.c.c. manganese. The first of these is such that the band structure and resulting susceptibilities can be obtained explicitly. The spin-wave energies and wave-vectors are found by a careful, small energy and momentum transfer, expansion of these susceptibilities for the case of a parabolic band. The spin-wave damping, which is shown to arise from spin-wave decay into quasiparticle quasihole pairs, is also obtained for this band structure. For the case of f.c.c. manganese the antiferromagnetic bands are obtained from a realistic 9-band paramagnetic model by using a many-band generalization of the Hubbard interaction. The enhanced spin susceptibilities are calculated, using the tetrahedral Brillouin zone integration method, and are presented along with their associated collective excitations. The results obtained are discussed with particular reference to the many-band effects. These effects are shown to be very much dependent on the particular form of interaction used.",

We use this mapping to extract the doping dependence of the strength, f(x) of the spin liquid component and the effective interaction, J eff(x) between the remnant localized spins that compose it; we find that both decrease linearly with x as the doping level increases. We discuss the physical origin of pseudogap behaviour and conclude that it is consistent with scenarios in which the both the large energy gaps found in the normal state and their subsequent superconductivity are brought about by the coupling between the Fermi liquid quasiparticles and the spin liquid excitations, and that differences in this coupling between the 1–2–3 and 2–1–4 materials can explain the measured differences in their superconducting transition temperatures and other properties.

The general principles involved in these applications are discussed. However, no attempt is made to give a comprehensive review of all the work which has been done in these areas; for further details references are given to the existing literature. The main intention of the article is to show that apart from the well-established applications, which are adequately described in the existing literature, there have been many new developments in recent years. Group theory has come to be applied to many other types of problems in solid-state physics and these applications have not been discussed extensively in the existing review and textbook literature on the subject. These applications include: the study of the symmetry, in k space, of constant energy surfaces and in particular the symmetry of the Fermi surface; the labelling and the degeneracies of dispersion relations for phonons, magnons, and other kinds of quasiparticles; selection rules for processes involving various particle or quasiparticle states in crystals; structure determination and phase transitions; the use of two-dimensional space groups for surfaces and thin films; and the problem of the symmetry of a (non-magnetic) crystal situated in a uniform external magnetic field. The treatment given in the article is not restricted to the use of the classical point groups and space groups but, where magnetic ordering is important, the appropriate generalized symmetry groups are considered.",

This anisotropy may be intrinsic to the solid, such as that arising from a non-cubic crystal structure, or it may be induced by the application of the external magnetic field. Such induced anisotropy can itself be divided into two classes : that arising directly from the effect of the Lorentz force upon the itinerant electrons, and that in which the external field is merely an agent which makes evident on a macroscopic scale an anisotropy which exists microscopically, even in the field-free case. The article traces the usual phenomenological formulation of the galvanomagnetic effects, and then particularizes this to the commonly-encountered experimental situations used to study the consequences of both induced and intrinsic anisotropy. The final section consists of a comprehensive compilation of relevant literature, arranged under the headings for the individual elemental metals and semimetals.",

The excited states of negative parity exhibit the characteristic low-lying ‘octupole vibrational state’ and there is a much studied ‘giant dipole region’ which should be amenable to the analysis of the ‘random phase approximation’. The first excited state is the ‘mysterious second zero’ par excellence and a great deal of work on describing it via the method of ‘deformed state admixtures’ has been carried out. The first excited state and a number of other excited states appear to support spectra reminiscent of rotational bands and the collective character of these states has been extensively studied in both the Bloch-Horowitz and α-cluster model schemes.",

The entropy of mixing which was found to be ideal in the sodium-rich liquid alloys provides no support for the earlier speculations about the existence of Na2K molecules therein. The partial molar excess entropy of sodium in dilute solution in potassium was found to be surprisingly large and negative for a system of this type.

    "abstract": "Abstract It was pointed out in 1960 that metals and semiconductors can support low frequency electromagnetic excitations in the presence of a magnetic field. We now feel that it is an appropriate time to discuss some of the progress made, over the last decade, in understanding and using this novel phenomenon. Naturally the field has grown quite rapidly and it would clearly be a Herculean task to review every aspect of it in other than a superficial manner. We have therefore chosen to discuss only semiconductors and semi-metals. This choice is dictated to us partly by the fact that magneto-plasma effects in metals have been reviewed from time to time but mainly by the fact that magneto-plasma effects in semiconductors have never been previously reviewed. Of course the term ‘magneto-plasma’ covers a great deal of activity so we have decided to choose a theme which links the beginnings of the subject to the present day. This theme is that of helicon and Alfvén wave propagation. We have produced a background of theory against which the nature of helicon and Alfvén waves can be readily understood. This background theory can also be used as a starting point for investigations of other plasma effects beyond the scope of this review. Some considerable attention is paid to waves in active systems, i.e. systems possessing a pool of energy arising from the application of an external electric field. Such systems, while of basic physical interest, are also of technical interest from a solid-state device viewpoint. The possibility of transverse wave instabilities occurring in active systems is discussed and a review of the criteria for labelling the types of instability is presented. As an example of the use of these techniques we have attempted to correlate the high electric field microwave emission from indium antimonide with a helicon-based instability. The theoretical work is set in perspective by the inclusion of discussions of the experimental work in the appropriate areas. We have also included a brief review of experimental observations of microwave emission from indium antimonide and the proposed mechanisms, other than helicon instability, which may account for it.",

Our analysis shows that, in the case of Al, differences between various calculations are attributable to a ‘core shift’. The latter can be represented by a single parameter in a pseudo-potential scheme and the best calculations of this shift from ‘first principles’ are in error by about 0.3 Ry. For Si and Ge, it seems that very few first principles band calculations are internally consistent. This may also emphasize the importance of the pseudo-potential scheme in approaching the band structure problem for open (covalently bonded) crystal structures. For these structures also the ‘core shift’ concept proves an aid to understanding not only differences between various calculations for the same element but also chemical shifts in structure, e.g. from Si to Ge to grey Sn.",

The theoretical and experimental values of relative diffusivity and its temperature dependence for various solutes, Ru, Co, Au, In, Sn and Sb, in liquid silver are in good quantitative agreement. Ru and Co in liquid silver appear to diffuse with effective valences of about -2 and zero, respectively. The theoretical evaluation of solute diffusion in liquid tin provides only a qualitative agreement with the experimental data.

    "abstract": "In this article, we review the recent significant progress in the theoretical studies of the electronic states by mainly focusing on Fe-based and cuprate superconductors. These superconductors are \"unconventional\" in that strong electron-electron correlation mediates the pairing; they are different from conventional phonon-mediated BCS superconductors. To seek the high-Tc pairing mechanism, many scientists have focused on the mysterious spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking above Tc, such as nematic order at q=0 and smectic order at q≠0. Such exotic correlation-driven symmetry breaking in metals has become a central issue in condensed matter physics. We demonstrate the emergence of the nematic and smectic orders due to orbital polarization (nxz≠nyz) and the symmetry breaking in the correlated inter-site hopping (= bond order δti,j) in Fe-based and cuprate superconductors. In addition, we discuss exotic spontaneous loop current orders driven by the pure imaginary δti,j. These interesting \"unconventional density-waves\" originate from the quantum interference between different spin fluctuations that is described by the vertex correction (VC) in the field theory. In the next stage, we discuss electron-correlation-driven superconductivity due to the fluctuations of unconventional density-waves. For this purpose, we suggest the beyond-Migdal–Eliashberg gap equation by including the VCs into the equation. In Fe-based superconductors, high-Tc s-wave superconductivity can be mediated by nematic and smectic fluctuations because the pairing interaction is magnified by the VCs. We also discuss the multipolar fluctuation pairing mechanism in heavy fermion systems, owing to the cooperation between the strong spin-orbit interaction and the strong electron correlation. To summarize, we suggest that the quantum interference mechanism described by the VCs plays essential roles in not only various unconventional density-waves but also exotic superconducting states in many strongly correlated metals. We finally discuss some interesting future issues with respect to the quantum interference mechanism.",

Both weak and strong signals are considered; the dominant noise sources being photodetection and intensity-fluctuation noise respectively. Where possible theoretical analysis is compared with computer simulation. Computer simulation also enables the behaviour, under those conditions which are too complex for direct analysis, to be studied. The effects of different normalization methods is considered; existing analysis on the extraction of spectral linewidth is extended; and the accuracy with which frequency shifts can be measured in heterodyne detection is investigated. The findings are summarized in the form of operating guide-lines for obtaining the greatest accuracy in the determination of the spectral parameters.",

The idea is to try to build a consistent picture of the performance of superconductors rather than to present a historical account of the subject. The basic behaviour of fluxons in the bulk of type II superconductors can be explained by the critical state model, but some of the details of flux pinning and the method of flux motion are in doubt. Flux instabilities under d.c. conditions have received a lot of attention and so have the methods of stabilization, but instabilities under a.c. conditions have not been studied in so much detail, and the problem of stabilization is more difficult than for f.c. Generally surface effects are less well understood than bulk effects, partly because there are a number of possible phenomena to contend with. A.C. loss in the Meissner state can be explained by field enhancement and flux penetration at peaks in the surface. For fields between H c3 and H c2 present solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equations for the currents in the surface sheath do not give sufficient agreement with experiment and some alternative explanation, such as flux pinning, may be necessary. There are a number of effects between H c2 and H c1, but the most important are Meissner currents and flux pinning.",

The relaxation rate consists of two significant parts: (1/T 1) K from the nuclear magnetic hyperfine interaction, and (1/T 1) Q from the nuclear quadrupole interaction. We calculate (1/T 1) K from the the modified Korringa relation using a correction factor of order unity for electron-electron interactions. The hyperfine term is linear in T and accounts for the second term in 1/T 1. Within experimental error the remaining rate, (1/T 1) Q , is temperature independent, and theoretically varies as the product of the square of the electric field gradient, q, and τc, a typical time between field gradient fluctuations. Making use of the x-ray RDF, we construct a simple model for liquid indium and calculate the ionic and electronic contributions, q I and q E, to the electric field gradient, to be q I=1.4 × 1024/cm3 and q E=8.5 × 1024/cm3. The calculation of q E assumes covalent bonding between nearest neighbours. Taking q I and q E to be of opposite sign, we find that the correlation time τc is 1.6 × 10-13 sec. When we further identify τ c with the correlation time for diffusion in a three-dimensional random walk, we are able to calculate the r.m.s. jump distance, Δr D, involved in self-diffusion, Δr D=0.38 Å. This value is consistent with the x-ray peak width of 0.38 Å which we used earlier to calculate the electric field gradient.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract The semi-metals and narrow-gap semiconductors are characterized by high values of the electron mobility, and sometimes, of the hole mobility too. When both carriers have a high mobility in intrinsic material the bipolar transport effects become prominent. Properties that are particularly sensitive to bipolar conduction are the electronic thermal conductivity and the Nernst and Ettingshausen coefficients. When there is a very large magnetoresistance effect, as there is in some semi-metals at low temperatures, high electric fields can be applied without excessive power dissipation. This allows the observation of an enhanced phonon interaction with carriers that are drifting with the speed of sound, the effect being manifested as a kink in the current-voltage characteristic. Other non-linear effects have been observed at high current densities due to self-magnetic fields of the charge carriers. These and other effects can be influenced by diffusion phenomena associated with the relatively high carrier lifetimes. The long relaxation times of the carriers in some of the materials at very low temperatures allow one to observe oscillations in the magnetoresistance (and other properties) as well as size-dependent effects. Most of the materials have multi-valley energy bands for at least one type of charge carrier. Although the band parameters are given most directly by cyclotron resonance experiments, they can in general also be determined from galvanomagnetic measurements under less critical experimental conditions. Several of the materials belong to the crystal class R3m and have ellipsoidal (or quasi-ellipsoidal) energy surfaces in the Brillouin zone which are tilted with respect to the crystal axes. These materials provide an interesting example of the determination of band structures from the galvanomagnetic coefficients. Even for a two-band non-parabolic conductor, there are generally sufficient data to allow the band parameters for any specific model to be calculated, provided, of course, that the model is appropriate. Thermoelectric measurements, together with Nernst or magnetothermoelectric observations, can provide the data on the Fermi energy and scattering law that are needed to complete a description of the material. The high carrier concentrations in the semi-metals (and the heavily-doped semiconductors) give rise to the possibility of superconducting behaviour. In this case, however, a low mobility is an advantage, since a high mobility implies a weak interaction between the electrons and the lattice. The recent observations on the variation with voltage of the tunnelling current at a junction between a semi-metal and an insulator indicate a promising technique for band-structure studies. Applications of the semi-metals are somewhat restricted by the parameters of the presently available materials, but the possibility of thermomagnetic energy conversion should encourage comprehensive studies of the transport properties on existing and new semi-metals.",

Here we review the power of symmetry as a resource to manipulate quantum transport, and apply these ideas to engineer novel quantum devices. Using tools from open quantum systems and large deviation theory, we show that symmetry-mediated control of transport is enabled by a pair of twin dynamic phase transitions in current statistics, accompanied by a coexistence of different transport channels. By playing with the symmetry decomposition of the initial state, one can modulate the importance of the different transport channels and hence control the flowing current. Motivated by the problem of energy harvesting we illustrate these ideas in open quantum networks, an analysis which leads to the design of a symmetry-controlled quantum thermal switch. We review an experimental setup recently proposed for symmetry-mediated quantum control in the lab based on a linear array of atom-doped optical cavities, and the possibility of using transport as a probe to uncover hidden symmetries, as recently demonstrated in molecular junctions, is also discussed. Other symmetry-mediated control mechanisms are also described. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of symmetry not only as an organizing principle in physics but also as a tool to control quantum systems.",

A comparison is made with the results of other authors, particularly those of Greytak and his collaborators. Following this presentation of the experimental data, an attempt is made to describe the dynamical behaviour of helium near the superfluid transition in terms of simple physical pictures, and then to use these pictures as the basis of simple calculations. The results often seem to agree surprisingly well with experiment, although the agreement may well be fortuitous; this part of the paper is frankly speculative and ought not to be taken too seriously. Comparison is made with the results of rigorous theoretical work, including recent attempts to apply the techniques of the renormalization group ; although these latter attempts have led to a degree of success, some of the results obtained seem to be in serious disagreement with experiment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The magnetization curves of type 2 superconductors, and type 1 super-conductors, for which H c3>H c, show a hysteretic tail in a range of field below H c3 which corresponds to a persistent current induced in the super-conducting surface layer (the sheath). Existing theories of this magnetization M are based on the hypotheses (a) that departures of the current distribution from uniformity are confined to the ends and may be neglected for long enough cylinders, and (b) that at the persistent (‘critical’) current, the free energy has the same value as it does in the normal state. These are the essential assumptions of what we call the infinite cylinder model. The apparent differences between the results of calculations based on this model made by Fink et al. and those made by Park, are shown to reside in a parameter η which Fink et al. assume to be ∼1. Values of η for a number of values of field and Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ are given. In a certain range, η ∼ 1 but η deviates markedly from 1 when κ is large (η∝ κ1/2 then), and at low fields when κ is small. It is shown that according to the model the tail should be symmetrical about the M=0 axis but that in order to show that it should be so, from free energy arguments, one must take into account the magnetization m of the sheath itself (due to its internal currents) even though m makes a negligible contribution to the total magnetic moment. The theory is compared with experiment, and significant discrepancies are found, particularly in the field dependence of M near H c3, which cannot be explained away as being the result of imperfections in specimen quality. The problem is then reconsidered on the basis of less arbitrary assumptions. First we consider the thermodynamic stability of the sheath. It is necessary to discuss the problem in terms of the current (per unit length, always) rather than magnetization M, so that we may distinguish between current in some particular region of the cylinder from the current averaged over its whole length. The average current J is directly related to the average magnetization M. Adopting the sign convention that a positive current produces a diamagnetic moment, M = −J. The continuous sheath will become unstable when the free energy in the presence of a break in the continuity over a small patch of surface is reduced by an increase in the area of the patch. That is our basic assumption. Unlike the homogeneous systems normally considered in thermodynamics, the sheath becomes unstable at an average current J which depends on the shape and position of the patch. If the patch lies in the central region of the cylinder the associated critical current J 1>>j c, where j c is the critical current calculated according to the infinite cylinder model. If it forms a ring of constant width on one end the sheath becomes unstable at J 2=j c. Thus the free energy criterion used to calculate j c corresponds to the assumption that J 2 is the lowest current at which the sheath becomes unstable. It is shown that the sheath may become unstable to penetration from the end along a large number of narrow slots at a current J 3⩽-j c. Whether or not J 3<j c, however, the sheath would always begin to break up at the end if the current reached a value J u before it became unstable. J u is the average current at which the current on the rim of the continuous sheath would reach j u. j u is the ‘ultimate’ current, the maximum current the sheath can carry under any circumstances. We show that for a high κ superconductor J u<j c, and assume the same inequality to hold for low κ superconductors. Thus at a certain current J p the sheath begins to break up at the end, and at this point, we argue, vortices or ‘flux spots’, of the type whose existence has been proposed by Hart and Swartz, enter the sheath from the ends. J p equals either J u or J 3, whichever is smaller. Only if J p equals J 3 does it correspond to a thermodynamic instability. In any case, since J u<j c, J p<j c, so that j c does not correspond to any observable phenomena, though it is a function with some heuristic value. Unless there is no pinning of the flux spots at all it will not be until a higher (average) current Jk that the spots move continuously through the sheath, entering it at one end and leaving it by annihilation with spots of opposite sign in the middle. It is this current Jk to which the magnetization tail corresponds. Above J p there are observable effects due to the non-uniform distribution of current over a large fraction of the cylinder length, which might serve to determine J p. It is shown, adapting an argument of Hart and Swartz, that Jk should be independent of the size of the cylinder provided the ratio of length to radius is kept constant. Some of the discrepancies between theory and experiment are shown to be resolved. Cylindrical systems such as a toroid, in which the effects of ends have been removed, are briefly considered.",

The macroscopic properties are obtained as a limit in which the momentum transferred by the radiation to the liquid is vanishingly small, while the microscopic structure and dynamical behaviour are obtained from data at higher momenta. An outline of the theory of radiation scattering will be given which emphasizes the relation between neutron and x-ray results. The possibility of studying electron shell movements by measuring the ratio of x-ray to neutron intensities is discussed. In general there are two types of experiment: those in which the intensity is measured as a function of the momentum transfer only (S(Q)), and those in which the intensity is measured as a function of both energy and momentum transfer (S(Q, θ)). The former experiments are used to obtain information on atomic positions while the latter experiments (coupled with the former) are used to derive dynamical information. Both kinds of experiment will be discussed and some methods of interpreting (S(Q)) and S(Q, θ)) will be described. The cooperative modes of motion in the system, particularly for wavelengths of the order of the spacing between atoms, may be observed as peaks in S(Q, θ). Several recent experiments of this kind on liquid lead will be discussed, particularly those in which the temperature variation was studied. In addition, information on the velocity correlation function for the metal atoms may be obtained. The spectral density of the velocity correlation will be considered and compared to predictions based on the cooperative mode picture. It is concluded that while much information has been obtained from these experiments there is a more detailed and extensive work to be done with both neutrons and x-rays.",

L'existence d'un potentiel de paires Δ(r) non nul n'entraˆine pas nécessairement, en effet, l'existence d'une bande interdite dans le spectre des excitations. Une premi`ere situation de SSBI avait été prévue dans le cas d'alliages `a impuretés magnétiques. Ces diverses situations sont caractérisées par l'existence d'une interaction magnétique qui agit avec des forces opposées sur les électrons d'une paire de Cooper. Dans le cas limite o`u Δ est petit, cette supraconductivité prend une forme simple décrite par de Gennes. Nous en donnons une description théorique. Les résultats principaux obtenus pour la densité d'états sont: (1) la forme de la densité d'états N(E)/N 0 ne dépend que d'une énergie h/τ (liée `a l'interaction antisymétrique) fonction universelle de la température (2) la valeur de N(E)/N 0 en un point r est proportionnelle `a Δ(r) qui contrˆole l'amplitude des effets résiduels au voisinage du champ critique supérieur H max (Δ→0 pour H→H max). Nos expériences nous ont permis de vérifier ces divers points: (1) Dans un domaine de champ de l'ordre de 30% inférieur `a H max, on a une SSBI en tr`es bon accord avec la forme théorique: il n'est pas possible de décrire ce comportement en champ `a l'aide d'un mod`ele de bande interdite fonction du champ appliqué. Il est donc nécessaire alors de reconsidérer l'ensemble des propriétés supraconductrices. (2) L'amplitude de la déviation entre la caractéristique tunnel et celle `a l'état normal permet de mesurer la moyenne de Δ(r) sur la jonction dans le cas d'un champ perpendiculaire ou parall`ele `a la surface de la jonction o`u l'on décrit soit des lignes de vortex, soit des effets de supraconductivité de surface. Les résultats obtenus sont en assez bon accord avec d'autres mesures fondées sur l'aimantation macroscopique.",

    "abstract": "In this review, a detailed discussion of the behaviour of a heavy particle interacting with a Fermi sea is given. Particular emphasis is put on the issue of how strong correlations influence coherence and transport of the particle. First, we investigate the question of whether the heavy particle is a well defined quasiparticle at low temperatures. While in one dimension ( D = 1) and at a van Hove singularity in D = 2 the coherence of the particle is destroyed, the quasiparticle weight is finite in higher dimensions. The most important transport quantity is the diffusion constant or mobility of the heavy particle. We are able to describe both the well known high-temperature properties and the cross-over to the lowest temperatures in a unified approximation scheme based on a self-consistent evaluation of an effective action. Two strong-correlation effects of independent origin are discussed. The first arises if the scattering of the fermions from the heavy particle is nearly resonant, that is, if one of the scattering phase shifts δ is close to π/2. In this regime an anomalous exponent is observed in the temperature dependence of the mobility μ(T). In D = 3, for instance, the mobility is proportional to T-3/2 rather than to T-2. The second effect is a giant mass renormalization in the case of a large particle. In this situation, the low-temperature effective mass M* increases up to an exponentially large value, M* exp[c(r/λF)3], where r is the effective radius of the particle, λF the Fermi wavelength and c a non-universal constant of order one.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neutron polarization analysis experiments of the past 25 years are reviewed. In that time the technique has progressed from a curiosity to being a useful tool to be used when needed. In early experiments, the polarization of the scattered beam was analysed in the same direction as the polarization of the incident beam but, in some later experiments, full three-dimensional polarization analysis has been employed. This article starts by writing down the interactions which the neutron has with condensed matter and deriving the cross-sections for scattering and final polarizations of the scattered beam. This is done displaying the spin state functions of the neutron explicitly. A variety of experiments is then reviewed, commencing with the elastic and inelastic scattering experiments performed by Moon, Riste and Koehler in the late 1960s. Elastic scattering experiments where it is important to separate nuclear and magnetic cross-sections such as antiferromagnetic defect scattering are reviewed together with separation out of the nuclear spin scattering for various purposes. Of particular interest are the fully three-dimensional analysis experiments which reveal more about the structure and domain populations of certain antiferromagnets. Inelastic experiments for which polarization analysis is vital are those on paramagnets at high temperatures where it is necessary to discriminate against phonon scattering. Spin glasses are treated as frozen paramagnets. Polarization analysis also has another role to play in the separation of magnetic modes in both paramagnets and ordered magnets, and several of these experiments are reviewed. Finally it is possible to tag the polarization of a neutron beam in time and space and to measure the result at another time and place and this through various techniques yields information about the change in neutron energy on scattering. The techniques of pseudo-random flipping time of flight, neutron spectral modulation and neutron spin-echo spectroscopy are briefly reviewed but the techniques of polarized-neutron-beam management are left to another review.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent progress in the theory of magnetism and electron correlations is reviewed to clarify the theories developed in the last decade and their mutual relations. A historical development of the theory of magnetism is outlined, and the dynamical coherent potential approximation (CPA) which completely takes account of the dynamical spin and charge fluctuations within the single-site approximation is introduced. Both the dynamical effects on various magnetic properties and the many-body band structure are shown to be explained on the same footing. It is shown that the dynamical CPA is equivalent to the other single-site theories of strongly correlated electrons: the many-body CPA, the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), and the projection operator method CPA (PM-CPA). These theories are elucidated with use of a common concept of effective medium or coherent potential. The effects of orbital degeneracy and the realistic calculation scheme are discussed with an emphasis on Hund’s rule coupling. Non-local theories of magnetism and electron correlations which go beyond the single-site approximation are presented. They include the molecular dynamics approach to the magnetic short range order, the dynamical cluster methods as a direct extension of the DMFT, and the self-consistent projection operator approach as an extension of the PM-CPA with use of the incremental cluster expansion. The current problems of their approaches and their future perspective are discussed. Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Professor P.

    "abstract": "Abstract The two-dimensional degenerate Fermi gas of electrons interacting with phonons is considered. The basic mechanisms of momentum relaxation in such a system, associated with electron-phonon, phonon-phonon and electron-electron collisions, are shown to be qualitatively different from similar mechanisms in an ordinary three-dimensional metal. The physical explanation for this is that the two-dimensional system of interacting electrons and phonons breaks down into almost isolated groups, between which momentum transfer occurs through very slow, staged superdiffusion (mixing) processes. With certain structures of the Fermi surface, quasimomentum transfer through electron-electron collisions is insignificant; hence such collisions are not an efficient relaxation mechanism. In this paper an efficient method is suggested for deriving superdiffusion equations, based on the detailed-balance conditions in the electron-phonon system. A theory of low-temperature transport phenomena is developed for pure two-dimensional metals. As has been found, the electrical and thermal conductivity coefficients under certain conditions may be anomalously high, showing a qualitatively different behaviour from that observed in three-dimensional metals. The electrical conductivity is analysed for a metal whose electron spectrum is nearly two-dimensional, as well as for a metal in which the prevailing mechanism of electron scattering is due to impurities. The effect of specifically two-dimensional relaxation mechanisms upon sound absorption is analysed. The possibility of observing such effects experimentally in layered metal compounds of intercalated graphite type is discussed.",

The resonant scattering of conduction electrons is described by a pseudopotential, which is singular in energy, in analogy to the theory of band structures of pure transition elements.

An interpretation of its absolute magnitude in liquid metals cannot be undertaken in terms of a pseudopotential formulation, but relative changes of shift with some parameter such as temperature, volume or alloy composition can be investigated. Knight shift changes with concentration have been measured for a series of binary liquid alloys. Since application of a pseudopotential treatment is simplest when the two constituents have the same valency, the alloys chosen have mostly been of this type, e.g. In-Ga, In-Tl, Sn-Pb, Sb-Bi. Although theory predicts the correct qualitative behaviour of the shift changes, the precise theoretical predictions are very sensitive to details of both the pseudopotentials and the liquid structure factor. In the case of In-Sn and In-Pb, where the shifts of both constituents decrease with increasing indium content for In-Sn, but increase for In-Pb, the difference between the pseudopotentials of tin and lead does not appear to be sufficient to explain the observed differences in changes of shift.",

    "abstract": "The heavy fermion systems present a unique platform in which strong electronic correlations give rise to a host of novel, and often competing, electronic and magnetic ground states. Amongst a number of potential experimental tools at our disposal, measurements of the Hall effect have emerged as a particularly important one in discerning the nature and evolution of the Fermi surfaces of these enigmatic metals. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of Hall effect measurements in the heavy fermion materials, and examine the success it has had in contributing to our current understanding of strongly correlated matter. Particular emphasis is placed on its utility in the investigation of quantum critical phenomena which are thought to drive many of the exotic electronic ground states in these systems. This is achieved by the description of measurements of the Hall effect across the putative zero-temperature instability in the archetypal heavy fermion metal YbRh2Si2. Using the CeMIn5 (with M=Co, Ir) family of systems as a paradigm, the influence of (antiferro-)magnetic fluctuations on the Hall effect is also illustrated. This is compared to prior Hall effect measurements in the cuprates and other strongly correlated systems to emphasize on the generality of the unusual magnetotransport in materials with non-Fermi liquid behavior.",

    "abstract": "The most recent light sources, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray free electron lasers (FELs), have extended tabletop laser experiments to shorter wavelengths, adding element and chemical state specificity by exciting and probing electronic transitions from core levels. Through their unique properties, combining femtosecond X-ray pulses with coherence and enormous peak brightness, the FELs have enabled studies of a broad class of dynamic phenomena in matter that crosses many scientific disciplines and have led to major breakthroughs in the last few years. In this article, we review how the advances in the performance of the FELs, with respect to coherence, polarization and multi-color pulse production, have pushed the development of original experimental strategies to study non-equilibrium behavior of matter at the femtosecond–nanometer time–length scales. In this review, the emphasis is placed on the contribution of the EUV and soft X-ray FELs on three important subjects: (i) the new regime of X-ray matter interactions with ultrashort very intense X-ray pulses, (ii) the new potential of coherent imaging and scattering for answering questions about nano dynamics in complex materials and (iii) the unique possibility to stimulate and probe nonlinear phenomena that are at the heart of conversion of light into other forms of energy, relevant to photovoltaics, femtosecond magnetism and phase transitions in correlated materials.",

After a brief introduction to low-dimensional organic solids and their crystallographic structures, we focus on the dimensionality and interactions and emergent quantum phenomena. Important topics of current research in organic matter with sizeable electronic correlations are Mott metal-insulator phase transitions, charge order and ferroelectricity. Highly frustrated two-dimensional systems are established model compounds for studying the quantum spin liquid state and the competition with magnetic long-range order.

    "abstract": "Thin films based on silicon and transition-metal elements dominate the semi-conducting industry and are ubiquitous in all modern devices. Films have also been produced in the rare-earth series of elements for both research and specialised applications. Thin films of uranium and uranium dioxide were fabricated in the 1960s and 1970s, but there was little sustained effort until the early 2000s. Significant programmes started at Oxford University (transferring to Bristol University in 2011), and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico, USA. In this review we cover the work that has been published over the last ∼20 years with these materials. Important breakthroughs occurred with the fabrication of epitaxial thin films of initially uranium metal and UO2, but more recently of many other uranium compounds and alloys. These have led to a number of different experiments that are reviewed, as well as some important trends. The interaction with the substrate leads to differing strain and hence changes in properties. An important advantage is that epitaxial films can often be made of materials that are impossible to produce as bulk single crystals. Examples are U3O8, U2N3 and alloys of U-Mo, which form in a modified bcc structure. Epitaxial films may also be used in applied research. They represent excellent surfaces, and it is at the surfaces that most of the important reactions occur in the nuclear fuel cycle. For example, the fuel-cladding interactions, and the dissolution of fuel by water in the long-term storage of spent fuel. To conclude, we discuss possible future prospects, examples include bilayers containing uranium for spintronics, and superlattices that could be used in heterostructures. Such applications will require a more detailed knowledge of the interface interactions in these systems, and this is an important direction for future research.",

In turn, plasmons, phonons plus electron-phonon collective effects, phase changes especially in relation to metal-non-metal transitions, and Luttinger liquids are considered. For plasmons and phonons, quite a wealth of experimental data on both metals and semiconductors now exist and, in selected areas, are brought into contact both with ab initio calculations and with theoretical models. For the latter, in addition to studies by many-body techniques, ‘experiment’ is invoked, but now in the form of computer simulation. This has played an especially important role in understanding Wigner electron solid formation quantitatively. Some attention is given also to metal-non-metal transitions in organic conductors, and the influence of directional chemical bonding in quite a number of the areas reviewed is stressed.",

Some progress in these fields of research, has been achieved at the present time. We believe that today the study of quasiperiodic structures and, in particular, pinning in these structures, is also a topical problem. This is because these structures are an intermediate case between fully ordered superconducting lattices and the chaotic system of pinning centres which exists in ordinary superconductors. One of the basic objectives of this review was to demonstrate the existence of interesting problems from the viewpoints of both fundamental and applied physics in this area. It should also be stated that because of the rapid development of technology it is hoped that soon it will be possible to create both more complex and more advanced microstructures, specifically for improving the critical parameters of superconducting materials. This also shows the importance of this field of research.",

An activation energy for the dissociation of InBi groupings of 2 kcal mole−1 is deduced from the temperature dependence of an excess line width observed at 50% Bi. The lifetime of this species is found to be 4×10−7 sec at 580°k from the magnitude of a field dependent broadening observed at concentrations between 50 and 100% Bi. Qualitative evidence for the existence of In2Bi groupings is obtained from the Knight shift data. It is suggested that this type of measurement may be applicable to other liquid alloys and should provide a method at least as sensitive as resistivity and viscosity measurements for the detection of preferred atomic groupings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We emphasize the importance of considering the relationship between the structure of a liquid and the interatomic potential directly from the point of view of wave vector space (k space). Although the Ornstein-Zernike equation was not originally derived from this point of view, this equation when transformed into the k-space representation has direct physical content, when coupled with a normal mode representation according to the approaches of Pines and Bohm (1952), and Percus and Yevick (1958). These normal modes are defined isothermally, and the relation to the dynamical modes of the liquid is discussed. The use of a simple k-space relationship between the transform of the Ornstein-Zernike direct correlation function and the transform, Vk , of the interatomic potential is explored. This leads to a correspondingly simple relationship between the structure factor and the interatomic potential. It is equivalent to a generalized Debye-Hückel equation and is expected to be valid only under special circumstances; namely, where the potential is long range in a particular sense and the small k behaviour of Vk is dependent mainly upon this long-range behaviour and relatively insensitive to details of the potential at short distances. It is noted that these conditions appear to be met reasonably well for the liquid alkali metals. The comparison of theory and experiment is somewhat uncertain because of incomplete experimental data on the structure factor as well as unresolved theoretical issues.",

The analytic character of model Hamiltonians for s–p bands (pseudopotential case) or for d bands interacting with s–p bands (resonance case) is summarized. The compatibility of the results of several workers with these analyticity requirements is considered.

    "abstract": "Abstract It is shown that the pairwise interactions between ions employed in the recent analysis of the radial distribution functions for liquid metals may result from perturbations due to local deviations from a uniform positively charged background of an electron gas in the Hartree description. Such a potential reveals the long-range oscillatory behaviour, as in the current established theories for the shielding of impurities in the electron gas, and it is closely related to the correlation of the ionic positions. The dielectric constant may, as a first approximation, be independent of the relative configuration of ions. It is to be noted that the total potential energy of the liquid metals cannot be expressed as a sum of these potentials in contrast to that of the non-metallic liquids. That is to say, the total potential energy contains the contribution which depends on the average density of ions. Therefore, the equation of the macroscopic quantities of liquid metals represented in terms of the radial distribution functions give reasonable values only when the pair potentials are differentiated with respect to the relative coordinates of ions. If the concept of the pair potentials is valid in such a meaning, the theories due to the radial distribution function of liquids can in principle be applied to liquid alloys as well as pure metals. Simplified procedures are proposed to interpret (i) the interaction of solute atoms in dilute alloys and (ii) the anomalous behaviour of some concentrated alloys, often corresponding to the composition of intermetallic compounds. The treatments based upon the pair potentials are also useful in the non-equilibrium properties of liquid metals such as viscosity.",

One of the goals of the review is to provide a deeper insight into the nature of this instability of the electron gas in normal metals and improve the understanding of this type of non-spin magnetism. We discuss theoretical aspects of the physics underlying magnetic ordering of conduction electrons in bulk metals and in thin films, and describe the behaviour of the susceptibility, thermal expansion, specific heat, compressibility, sound velocity, magnetic induction bifurcation, the order parameter, domain formation, wetting of domain walls, nucleation and kinetics of diamagnetic phase transitions. In the vicinity of diamagnetic phase transitions the results obtained coincide with those following from the Landau theory of phase transitions. The existence of the critical sample size for the diamagnetic phase transition in thin films is considered. We place special emphasis on the problem of the order of diamagnetic phase transitions. The survey is partly motivated as complementary to the recent review by G. Solt and V. Egorov describing the experimental situation in the field. Contents PAGE 1. Introduction 386 2.

    "abstract": "Quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors are highly unconventional materials, which exhibit a wide variety of phenomena, including spin density waves, quantum Hall effect, and superconductivity. In this paper, we review some experimental and theoretical developments concerning the superconducting state of these systems, where a particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of triplet superconductivity. This possibility is supported by various experiments including upper critical field, Knight shift and NMR relaxation time measurements on the Bechgaard salt bistetramethyltetraselenafulvalene hexafluorophosphate [(TMTSF)2PF6]. However, similar NMR results are still lacking for another compound (TMTSF)2ClO4 and other members of the Bechgaard salts family. Furthermore, the pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry are not yet fully known. Therefore, we include a discussion of both triplet and singlet pairing states, and analyse briefly the possibility that the symmetries of the superconducting order parameters are different for various compounds. Finally, we also discuss some open questions regarding the superconducting state of these systems.",

This result is established for many-time propagators in a straightforward way by iterating in the diagrammatic form of the equations of motion. The iteration method does not work for two-time propagators, but we are able to present an alternative argument which makes it plausible that the result holds true in this case as well. The decouplings leading to the Hartree-Fock, ladder, and ring diagram (RPA) partial sums are discussed in detail. It is conjectured that the reverse correspondence is not true, i.e. to any given partial sum there does not necessarily correspond a decoupling.",

By using the nearly-free electron approximation based on the pseudopotential calculated by Animalu and Heine, and the recent theoretical interference function, a(q) of Ashcroft and Lekner, our quantitative results indicate that the resistivity of liquid Hg calculated according to Ziman's theory (g = 1) is at least a factor 2 less than the experimental value (suggesting g 2<0.5) and that it increases rather than decreases with pressure, whence we deduce ∂ ln g 2/∂ ln a ~ -30, where a is proportional to the cube root of the atomic volume, in order to restore agreement with experiment.",

These have clearly glass-like properties. In other systems, results are limited to one or two methods hinting at glass formation; some of those are also reported. Clustering phenomena and the slowdown of reorientations at the freezing temperature are observed in susceptibility measurements and by local probing on nuclear spins. The modulation of the structure by cluster formation is revealed by diffraction experiments. These phenomena are confronted with model predictions and numerical simulations.",

The results in the metallic range are in qualitative agreement with the simple Drude theory but show wavelength dependent relaxation times presumably because of the relatively high photon energies. An absorption in the near IR distorts the results for the solutions near the Mott transition (e.g., ε1 shows a minimum and remains >0). A peak in Im (1/ε), as calculated from ε1 and ε2, occurs at energies within 20% of those predicted from the relaxation time and carrier density. The peak is sharp for the most concentrated solutions but broadens as the Mott transition is approached. These results support the view that these solutions are simple metals though the electron density is low relative to common metals.",

No assumptions regarding ideal entropy were made to obtain these free energy values although a statistically random mixture of ions is presumed in the scattering model.

Conventional descriptions in terms of liquid state theory should then be applicable. (2)Electron theory gives us an indication of the general shape of the pair force law. Analysis of structure data using conventional liquid theories confirms the gross features. (3)Use of dielectric screening theory, in conjunction with liquid state theories relating the Ornstein-Zernike correlation function with the long-range part of the force leads to theoretical predictions different from the old Ornstein-Zernike theory. (4)Ion-ion interactions via the conduction electrons are long range according to theory. The method of Percus and Yevick, known to be rather good for short-range forces, does not seem appropriate to liquid metals. Both theoretical reasons and pragmatic justification can be given to support the Born-Green theory as a useful starting point for long-range forces. (5)There is found to be a correlation between melting points, valence and Fermi energy. Some basis for this is afforded by dielectric screening theory.",

This double structure is also found in the monoatomic metal melts.

In the melts of Au, Ag, Pb and T1 as of Na and Cs, however, the spherical close packing shows up as a zig-zag chain. The straight atomic chain and the zig-zag chain are in fact imaginary, being parts of layer lattices with limited order. In conclusion the real zig-zag chain of solid amorphous Se is considered.

Such technical developments allow the study and tuning of (quantum) phase transitions, unusual magnetic structures and (high-temperature) superconductors in a variety of quantum materials. An especially important class of strongly correlated electron materials is the heavy Fermi liquids (HFLs) displaying numerous reduced-moment antiferromagnets, quantum critical points, unconventional superconductivity, hidden order (HO) and other mysterious ground states. Among the ‘heavy fermions’, the duality of 5f electrons in uranium-based compounds introduces interesting behavior that can be affected by large magnetic fields. I list a few such heavy fermion materials to be considered: URu2Si2 and its tunable hidden state, UBe13 and UPt3 as very HFL paramagnets that become superconducting, the magnetic superconductors UPd2Al3 and UNi2Al3, and the ferromagnetic s UGe2, URhGe and UCoGe. There are also the suggested metamagnetic Fermi-surface reconstructed intermetallic compounds such as UPt2Si2 and UCo2Si2. Present research attention focuses on the high-field behavior (30–40 T) of URu2Si2 and its destruction of HO. These and other U-based systems, e.g. UAu2Si2, UIrGe, etc., expand the opportunities of high magnetic field studies far into the future.",

For example, they govern nuclear reactions, formation of stars, nuclear synthesis and stability of biologically vital elements. These are high-energy processes discussed in particle physics, astronomy and cosmology. More recently, it was realised that fundamental physical constants extend their governing reach to low-energy processes and properties operating in condensed matter systems, often in an unexpected way. These properties are those we experience daily and can routinely measure, including viscosity, thermal conductivity, elasticity and sound. Here, we review this work. We start with the lower bound on liquid viscosity, its origin and show how to relate the bound to fundamental physical constants. The lower bound of kinematic viscosity represents the global minimum on the phase diagram. We show how this result answers the long-standing question considered by Purcell and Weisskopf, namely why viscosity never falls below a certain value. An accompanying insight is that water viscosity and water-based life are well attuned to fundamental constants including the Planck constant. We then discuss viscosity minima in liquid He above and below the λ-point. We subsequently consider a very different property, thermal diffusivity, and show that it has the same minimum fixed by fundamental physical constants as viscosity. We also discuss bounds related to elastic properties, elastic moduli and their analogues in low-dimensional systems, and show how these bounds are related to the upper bound for the speed of sound. We conclude with listing ways in which the discussion of fundamental constants and bounds advance physical theories.",

The goal is to explain in a language that can be understood by non-specialists' very recent advances in quantum information and especially string theory suggesting the existence of entirely new forms of matter. These are metallic states characterized by an extremely dense many-body entanglement, requiring the supremacy of the quantum computer to be completely enumerated. The holographic duality discovered in string theory appears to be a mathematical machinery capable of computing observable properties of such matter, suggesting the presence of universal general principles governing its phenomenology. The case is developing that these principles may well apply to the highly mysterious physical properties observed in the high-temperature superconductors and other strongly interacting electron systems of condensed matter physics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Electromagnetic waves in the submillimetre spectrum (10–200 cm−1, 300–6000 GHz) have many current and potential applications of importance but the sources at present in use leave much to be desired. Optically-pumped gas lasers now give useful CW power levels at numerous submillimetre frequencies but they are not tunable. Electron-beam backward-wave oscillators designed for submillimetre frequencies demand extremely high precision of machining and alignment; such sources are available for the long-wave end of the submillimetre spectrum but they are currently too large and elaborate in operation for many of the important potential applications. Several methods of exploiting the phenomena of non-linear optics to down-convert the frequency of the signal generated by a tunable, optical or infra-red source have recently been demonstrated and several types of non-linear diode are known to be fast enough to give some output power at submillimetre harmonic frequencies when driven by a microwave oscillator; each of these methods finds enthusiasts to argue its potential but none yet provides a tunable CW submillimetre-wave output at a power level that would be widely useful (say, 0.1 mW or more). In this article an attempt is made to identify the basic considerations that limit the submillimetre-wave performances of the methods of generation referred to above and that restrict the adoption for the submillimetre spectrum of other methods of tunable generation in use at other frequencies, such as dye lasers, recombination diode-lasers and IMPATT oscillators. In the final section of the article, the analyses of the preceding sections are summarized by indicating which methods appear to offer some prospect, and which very little, of eventually providing for the submillimetre spectrum a tunable coherent source as effective as those now available for other spectral ranges.",

The mobilities of Cd, In and Sn in liquid bismuth are very similar to their respective mobilities in mercury at room temperature. The mobilities do not appear to be a function of valence, which makes questionable the existence of a strong field-ion interaction.

The reference atom may be one of many equivalent near-surface atoms from which a core-level photoelectron is excited or, in the case of diffuse low-energy electron diffraction, one of many equivalent adsorbate atoms (lacking in long-range order) on the surface of a crystalline substrate. Other variants apply to low-energy electron diffraction, Kikuchi electron diffraction and time-reversed versions in which the wavenumber (energy) and direction of the incident beam are varied. I show that, for such low-energy electron diffraction spectra, the relative phases between the reference wave and scattered waves have a known geometric form if the spectra are taken from within a small angular cone in the near-back-scattering directions. By using the back-scattering small cone at each direction of interest, a simple algorithm is developed to invert the spectra and extract object atomic positions with no input of calculated dynamical factors. The article also reviews key ideas and works which led to the current understanding of this field.",

    "abstract": "A great variety of experiments, like heat release measurements, acoustic measurements, and transport measurements on mesoscopic samples, have proved that two-level systems (TLSs) play a crucial role in the low-temperature thermal and electric properties of disordered systems. This paper is aimed at reviewing the role of slow TLSs in point contacts. First the theory of point contacts is summarized, concentrating on the discussion of different point-contact models, and on the different regimes of electron flow in the contact, mainly focusing on the ballistic and diffusive limit. The Boltzmann equation is solved in both regimes, and the position dependence of the electrical potential is determined. Then the scattering processes in point contacts are investigated, particularly concentrating on the scattering on slow TLSs. If the electron-assisted transitions between the two states are negligible the electron–two-level system interaction can be treated with a simplified Hamiltonian. The scattering on such slow TLSs causes non-linearity in the current–voltage characteristics of the point contact, which can be determined using Fermi's Golden Rule. These calculations are presented showing both the contribution of elastic and inelastic scattering, and including the dependence on the position of the TLS, and on the effect of high-frequency irradiation. These results are used to discuss the differences between these slow TLSs and the fast centres which may be described by the two-channel Kondo model. The available experimental results are analysed, distinguishing between the effects due to the different types of TLSs.",

Two principal energy loss peaks, identified as being due to surface plasmon and to volume plasmon excitation, were found to vary as a function of alloy composition in each system. Deviations from the variation expected from a simple free-electron model could be interpreted in some cases in terms of an interband electronic transition occurring near the measured volume and surface energy-loss peaks. For bismuth-rich In-Bi alloys and for indiumrich In-Al alloys the transmission energy and oscillator strength could be estimated and shown as a function of composition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We consider the electronic structure of liquid metals as a problem of multiple scattering. The total scattering operator is developed in terms of the reaction operators of a single scattering event, having a ‘standing wave’ boundary condition. This method has several advantages with respect to the approach where the total scattering operator is developed in terms of the scattering operators of a single scattering. Since the reaction operators are hermitian, the occurring perturbation expansions have a real perturbation parameter, which is more easily handled. Furthermore, if in the expansion of the total scattering operator, only terms up to the second order are maintained, this approximate expression satisfies already the ‘optical theorem’, just as the exact total scattering operator. Finally, spurious damping terms are eliminated at the outset. For very dense systems we obtain practically non-attenuated waves and this can be understood as if the damping due to a single scattering event is compensated by the reaction of the surrounding scatterers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A more exact definition of the lower ionosphere is given. By the lower ionosphere we mean that part of the upper atmosphere between 50–60 km and 150 km where the phenomenon of ionic diffusion is small, and which influences the propagation of radio waves and atmospheric noises, and which is the seat of the system of currents that produce the variations of the geomagnetic field. The plasma exhibits a particular non-linear behaviour and has a layer (Bailey's layer) where considerable effects of electromagnetic resonance occur. After describing briefly the most recent work on the chemical, ionic and electric structure of the D region, the reason for the non-linear behaviour of the plasma in this region is explained. Using V. A. Bailey's theory of interaction and the Ginzburg-Gurevich kinetic theory the concept of the ‘plasma field’ is given and it is shown how the latter theory allows greater precision in calculating G eff and v eff and that among other things G eff depends on the temperature. To have a more complete idea of the non-linearity of a plasma, the theories of D. Graffi and M. Marziani are given in which the expression for a general non-linear equation of an electromagnetic field. Among the non-linear effects known up to date those studied in Italy, that is gyro-interaction, self-modulation, self-demodulation, detection effect, are considered. After defining the effect of the gyro-interaction (Luxemburg effect with resonance) the essential features of the Bailey theory are given. A brief description is given of the experiments carried out in Italy which showed the existence of resonance in the Luxemburg effect during both day and night, both with pulses and C.W., and the possibility of having a dromedary curve and a bactrian curve; also how in function of the penetration of the wanted wave in Bailey's layer we can pass from one resonance curve to another. From a discussion of the phenomenon of self-modulation one can deduce that there are two different phenomena, that is, a self-demodulation that obviously is not dependent on the power of the wave and must be a linear phenomenon, and a self-modulation that clearly depends on the power and is a non-linear effect which can be explained by the theory of interaction. Since it is not yet clear if the self-demodulation around the gyro-frequency depends on the power or not, the essential lines of the linear theory of Bailey, developed by Sodha and Kaw, and the non-linear theory of Sant Ram and Kaw are given. Finally the concept of ‘ionospheric detection effect’ is given and we also give, with some explanations, the theories proposed by G. Lanza in 1966 and whose conclusions seem to agree with experiments and by A. Gurevich in 1969. In the second part of the present work the methods of measurement and the technique used to demonstrate the above phenomena are given. The new technique of ‘modulated pulses’ that consists in the emission of pulses at MF and VHF modulated with low frequencies or with the gyro-frequency is of particular importance. In fact, if the VHF pulses are modulated at the gyro-frequency it is possible to generate ‘the detection effect’. If, instead, the HF pulses are modulated at audio-frequencies it is possible to show how the self-demodulation and the self-modulation do not depend at all on selective fading. There follows a description of the essential equipment built by the electronics laboratory of the Astronomical Observatory of Rome and located near Rome and at Camerino. The last section of the present work describes briefly the experiments made to date with the above-mentioned equipment and the principal results obtained.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We give a Hamiltonian-based interpretation of microscopic Fermi liquid theory within a renormalization group framework. The Fermi liquid fixed-point Hamiltonian with its leading-order corrections is identified and we show that the mean field calculations for this model correspond to the Landau phenomenological approach. This is illustrated first of all for the Kondo and Anderson models of magnetic impurities which display Fermi liquid behaviour at low temperatures. We then show how these results can be deduced by a reorganization of perturbation theory, in close parallel to that for the renormalized φ4 field theory. The Fermi liquid results follow from the two lowest order diagrams of the renormalized perturbation expansion. The calculations for the impurity models are simpler than for the general case because the self-energy depends on frequency only. We show, however, that a similar renormalized expansion can be derived also for the case of a translationally invariant system. The parameters specifying the Fermi liquid fixed-point Hamiltonian are related to the renormalized vertices appearing in the perturbation theory. The collective zero sound modes appear in the quasiparticle-quasihole ladder sum of the renormalized perturbation expansion. The renormalized perturbation expansion can in principle be used beyond the Fermi liquid regime to higher temperatures. This approach should be particularly useful for heavy fermions and other strongly correlated electron systems, where the renormalization of the single-particle excitations are particularly large. We briefly look at the breakdown of Fermi liquid theory from a renormalized perturbation theory point of view. We show how a modified version of the approach can be used in some situations, such as the spinless Luttinger model, where Fermi liquid theory is not applicable. Other examples of systems where the Fermi liquid theory breaks down are also briefly discussed.",

The non-monotonic behaviour of the acoustic flux observed experimentally, as a function of the magnetic field can be explained within the framework of the free-electron model assuming that the electrons are scattered diffusely from the metal surface. The reason for this behaviour is traced to the variation of the relative phases of the collision drag force on the bulk ions and that on the surface with increasing magnetic field. The relations between existing theories of direct generation of ultrasound have been investigated within both the free-electron approximation and the effective-mass theory. We conclude that, besides the collision drag force, the Lorentz force and the Bragg reaction force, an additional ‘deformation’ force acts upon the positive ions. We find that the assumption of electron diffuse surface scattering is the only mechanism that can account for the observations on the variety of materials investigated. We also analyse, within a simple effective-mass approximation, possible band structure effects on acoustic wave propagation in metals and on the helicon-phonon interaction.",

Luminescence spectra, excitation spectra, temperature dependences and lifetimes are described. The radiative transition in chalcogenides is the recombination of an electron in the conduction band tail and a trapped hole. A strong electron-phonon coupling distorts the lattice near the trapped hole, lowering its energy. This interaction is responsible for the broadness of the luminescence band and its position at about half the band gap energy. The recombination centre is thought to be a charged dangling bond with density 1017 cm-3 in arsenic chalcogenides and 1016 cm-3 in selenium. The same centre is observed in the hole drift mobility, and thermally stimulated conductivity. Luminescence in amorphous silicon also originates from recombination between the band tails and deep centres, with three separate transitions identified. In contrast to chalcogenides the electron-phonon coupling is not strong. The shape and intensity of the spectra are very sensitive to sample preparation and treatment, and correlate with other electrical and optical properties of Si.",

The explicit structure in a binary could in principle be determined from three independent diffraction patterns. It is relatively much simpler to measure and analyse the x-ray and neutron intensity patterns and with these alone obtain considerable correlation information, even if more than two atom types are present, by calculating the ratio of the two experimental radial distributions. For the binary the relevance of the ratio derives from the fact that each distribution is a sum of the radial distributions of the three types of atom-pairs, each term being weighted by the appropriate product of scattering amplitudes. The structure of the sample can be analysed by comparing the ratio for any interatomic distance to the values it would have for pure A-A, pure B-B, pure A-B, and random pairing. In a true liquid the results are semiquantitative. In an alloy with well-defined short-range order, the correlation of these close pairings can be clearly determined. Results are shown for liquid NaK and vitreous silica. For any alloy the experimental results would serve to test structural models.",

These large planets are huge, rapidly rotating bodies and seem to form two separate families. Jupiter and Saturn appear to have an apparently permanently banded appearance of alternating light and dark clouds of rapidly changing colours. The composition of their atmospheres seems to be similar to that of the Sun. Present theories are unable to account for the banded structure, the origin of the colours and the Great Red Spot situated in the southern Jovian hemisphere. These planets are surrounded by an extensive system of 23 satellites. Two of them, Io of the Galilean satellites, and Titan of the Saturnian system, have atmospheres. The Titan atmosphere is thought to be considerably larger than the present Martian atmosphere. Uranus and Neptune are thought to form a separate family of planets, with less than solar proportions of the light elements, and larger portions of methane than found on Jupiter and Saturn. In this article, which was completed in March 1976, we review our current understanding of the atmospheres of the major planets.",

The l=1 nature of Cooper pairing in superfluid 3He leads to a complex collective mode spectrum. A number of the collective modes couple to sound. The expressions for the collective mode frequencies are derived using a phenomenological theory. Cryogenic and ultrasonic measurement techniques are briefly discussed, followed by a review of the results of sound propagation experiments, in particular those that show coupling to the collective modes. The effects of fields, textures and dispersion are also reviewed.",

The difficulty of orthogonality of the conduction-electron states is circumvented by constructing a many-electron state. The calculation is in close analogy to that of the superconducting ground state. It yields a one-electron energy spectrum and the plane-wave decomposition of the states. Calculations are carried out for a model simple metal and the generalization to transition metals is outlined. Though the perturbation-theoretic irregularities are eliminated and the results appear to be qualitatively correct, the computed corrections to the free-electron curves are smaller than those from the Green's function treatment. It is not clear which is nearer the truth.",

The recent discovery of what is interpreted as a non-classical moment of inertia at low temperature in solid 4He [E. Kim and M.H.W. Chan, Nature 427 225 (2004a); E. Kim and M.H.W. Chan, Science 305 1941 (2004b); E. Kim and M.H.W. Chan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 115302 (2006); A.C. Clark and M.H.W. Chan, J. Low Temp. Phys. 138 853 (2005)] has elicited much excitement as a possible first observation of a supersolid phase. In the two years following the discovery, however, more puzzles than answers have been provided to the fundamental issue of whether the supersolid phase exists, in helium or any other naturally occurring condensed matter system. Presently, there is no established theoretical framework to understand the body of experimental data on 4He. Different microscopic mechanisms that have been suggested to underlie supe...",
